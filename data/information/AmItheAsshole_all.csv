15frpwi,AITA telling my brother to pay me back everything he stole from me if he needs an uncle for his kids.,"My brother was an addict when we were growing up. 

My parents did everything to try and save him from himself including ignoring me and my sister to dedicate themselves to him. 

I guess it worked. They got him into rehab and he is clean and sober now. 

That is great for him. I, however, have a shattered relationship with my parents. 

He stole them from me. 

He also stole thousands of dollars worth of my belongings. 

His wife recently passed away and he isn't doing well. 

Our parents passed away during the pandemic. 

He reached out to me and asked if I would take his son if he died. 

I said no. 

Our sister refuses to speak with him so I am his only choice really. 

He is begging me so that his son won't end up in foster care. 

I said I would take his son if he paid me back for everything he ever stole from me. 

I told him only the monetary stuff would count. 

So my 1999 Jeep that I paid for myself and he stole and crashed. And that my parents begged me not to report stolen so he wouldn't go to jail. 

My entire Uncanny X-Men comic collection. 

That sort of thing. 

I said he could never pay me back our parents missing my wedding because they were dealing with his bullshit. 

My wife says that I'm being too harsh and that an innocent child is involved. 

I can't look at that kid without thinking of everything his father did to me. 

I don't think I would provide a good home for him. 

He is probably better off in foster care.",Tiny-Entertainer-434,2687,0.959999978542328,384,1690930888,2023-08-01 18:01:28,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15frpwi/aita_telling_my_brother_to_pay_me_back_everything/,8,2023
15go2jh,AITA for rude and dismissive about all of my wife’s baby name ideas?,"My wife and I are expecting our first child in the coming months and we have chosen not to find out the sex until the baby is born. Things are starting to feel very real now so we’ve started to properly discuss names, but we’ve realised we both have vastly different tastes in name style and we are having a hard time finding the right one. 

My wife likes names that are out there and unique but I find these names tacky and silly and would prefer a better known, more traditional name. 

Last night she showed me a short list she had put together and thought I might like. The names on the list were:

Girl:
Fern, Fennix, Rhodes, Faun, Brixtyn, and Kinley

Boy:
Spark, Diesel, Quincy, Phoenix, Buck, and Fox

These names are tamer than what she’s suggested before, but I told her they didn’t feel right. I suggested ideas like Rose instead of Rhodes, Felix instead of Phoenix, and Buchanan instead of Buck.  

I finally snapped when she suggested Zoomer. I asked if she was serious and said it was a stupid name. She asked what my problem was and why I was so dismissive of all her ideas and shooting down all the names she likes. I told her we were naming a child and not a dog, and that names can have a huge impact on the child. I said I don’t want my child to be bullied or taken less seriously because they have a ridiculous name. She told my I was rude and that I was the bully for making her feel unsupported. She started crying and went to bed. I decided to give her some time and space so waited till she was sleeping to go to bed.

I feel bad about coming at her the way I did, but I also feel it needed to be said.

EDIT:
When she got back I explained my concerns and apologised for how I reacted previously. She explained that she has a very common name and there were always multiples in school, and she doesn’t want that for our child. I very rarely experienced this so can’t really comment on how it feels. 

We’ve decided to look into the app everyone is talking about, and to explore our family tree to see if there are any names we both like. Thank you all for your suggestions! 

Many people have asked to see some of the names that I like, so here goes

Boy:
Oscar, Garrett, William, Benjamin, and Edward

Girl: 
Matilda, Elizabeth, Katherine, Eloise, and Harriet",Aaronsaway,4710,0.959999978542328,3722,1691020231,2023-08-02 18:50:31,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15go2jh/aita_for_rude_and_dismissive_about_all_of_my/,8,2023
15if7rm,AITA for upgrading my seat so I didn't have to sit next to my stepfather's family?,I M14 am on vacation with my mom and stepfather and a bunch of his family. This is the second summer we have done this. Last year I enjoyed the vacation but the flights sucked. I have a switch with lots of games on it. My mom made me share with my stepfather's brother's kids because they didn't bring anything for entertainment. They could have watched a movie or something on the screen on the seat. I got to be bored because they didn't plan ahead. So this year I planned ahead. My dad gives me money so I can buy souvenirs and do my own thing. I asked him if he could upgrade my seat for me. He looked it up and saw that it was on sort of an auction system. If there better seats to be had then if you win your bid you get the seat. He checked with my mom and asked her if she was okay with it. She said she was. We put in of $55 for an upgrade to coach+ or something. More legroom and closer to the front of the plane. I got it. It was great. I sat by the window up front instead of in a middle row in the back. And I had my own plug in for charging my switch. When we landed my stepfather said I was rude to not want to sit with the family. I said that I had permission from my mom and dad to sit there. Now he is arguing with my mom because he said that it should have been discussed with him since he paid for the original ticket. I think I made things worse when I said that no one discussed it with me when I was told to share my switch even though I bought it with my own money. He is saying that I'm not allowed to upgrade my seat on the way home.

15j9hlu,AITA for telling my mom she's not financially gaining from my dad's death?,"My (41F) parents divorced in 1991 when I was 10. My father remarried in the midst '90's, as did my mother. The 2 rarely spoke when I was growing up & most communication was relayed thru me (lovely parentin, huh?).

In April 2021, my dad contracted Covid & passed away a month later, essentially destroying my whole life...that's a story for another time though. My step mother receives his survivors benefits. 

In February of 2023, my step dad passed away from various health issues. Since they were married over 10 years, my mother would receive his survivors benefits. Makes sense, right?

Cue to 2 months after he has passed, my mother asks me to borrow my dad's death certificate. When I ask why, she states she could get more from my dad's survivors benefits than from my step dad's. She also claims to need it for a passport in the future (absolute horseshit). 

I told her no, she's not getting my dad's death certificate. The woman hated my father, to the point that she didn't even recognize him when she saw him when I was grown. I really don't want her benefiting from my dad's death at all. They've been divorced over 30 years & she has never been anything more than an asshole to me & my kids. 

She hasn't hardly spoken to me since. So....am I the asshole???",CPrauser,1813,0.959999978542328,238,1691276372,2023-08-05 17:59:32,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15j9hlu/aita_for_telling_my_mom_shes_not_financially/,8,2023
15j9pw2,AITA for not paying for my siblings college after my college was paid for,"
My parents wanted to save for college however they had 4 kids  and didn’t make enough to be able to save enough money for each kids. 

By the time I was leaving for college they had 100k saved up for us,  25k each however that wouldn’t be enough for me and they wanted me to not have to take out loans so we had an agreement that they would use all the money had to help pay for my college

By the time my younger siblings started college, I would have a job and since I used their money, I would be expected to pay what ever my parents couldn’t afford  of their tuition up to 6k a school year, which would equal 25k per kid

I didn’t want to go into debt and so I agreed,  
My parents continued to save,  and for the next kid they were able to save enough each year that I didn’t need to contribute 

This year I now have 2 siblings in college, and my parents are missing 5k this year to cover my siblings schooling 

They came to me asking for the 5k,  while i have a job and earn enough, I’m now married and my partner and I both have plans for our future and kids, and since our finances are shared we both couldn’t come to an agreement therefore we’re choosing not to give my siblings the 5k

When I told my family this, they were mad, saying that it’s what I agreed to and they are now calling me selfish and entitled as well as other things, I told them that I didn’t make them give me the money and that the siblings could easily work or take out a loan. 

My parents are still mad but my siblings took it to an extreme. They are refusing to talk to me. They blocked me and my partners number and social media and want nothing to do with us,  they’ve even managed to turn my youngest sibling against

15japbc,AITA for telling my girlfriend a wedding was child free even tho it wasn’t ?,"My (25M) girlfriend (25F) and I went to my sister’s wedding last week and I told her it was child free even though it wasn’t

Context: my girlfriend has a kid, a little girl who’s 3yo and she takes her EVERYWHERE. We rarely have private moment as a couple 

Now, don’t get me wrong, I love my girlfriend’s daughter, but it gets exhausting to never have moments between just me and my girlfriend 

So, when I told my girlfriend about my sister’s wedding, I told her that it was child free and I asked if she could have someone babysit her daughter. She asked her mom, who agreed.

At the wedding, there was obviously children, a detail I’d forgotten, and when my girlfriend confusingly asked me why were there kids if it was a child free wedding, I simply told her I had no idea

She went to the bathroom during the dinner but i noticed she wasn’t coming back so I went to look for her and I encountered my sister who looked very angry 

My sister called me an asshole and a coward. Apparently, she ran into my girlfriend who was upset with her because my gf thought my sister had only applied the child free rule to her. She told my girlfriend that her wedding was never child free, which made my girlfriend even madder, but at me, and she left

I called my girlfriend but she didn’t answered and when I came home her things and her daughter’s weren’t there anymore 

My sister is also not talking to me anymore because she thinks I ""threw her under the bus"" even though I never told my girlfriend it was my sister’s idea to only apply the child free rule to her 

I think I had a good reason to tell my girlfriend it was child free but having both my sister and girlfriend mad at me is making me think otherwise",liedchildfreewedding,2448,0.8399999737739563,1595,1691279612,2023-08-05 18:53:32,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15japbc/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_a_wedding_was/,8,2023
15k3geq,"AITA for not waiting to redecorate, even if it upsets my trans cousin?","I (f 20) currently live in the house left to me by my paternal grandmother. Since moving in at 18, I have wanted to change the decor pretty dramatically. My grandmother was a very “coastal grandmother” and the entire house reflects that. The main color palette is white, navy and some hints of other dark colors. I want to change it into bright pinks, oranges, and yellows.  
  
For my birthday in May, my dad surprised me by hiring an interior decorator and gave me a pretty large budget, so it basically became a renovation too. We have slowly been working together to create ideas for the whole house and on friday, she finally came with paint, wallpaper, and fabric swatches. She pinned all the fabric swatches to the correct pieces (the living room has a conversion pit that we are upholstering), plus painted the wall to pick the right color for the wallpaper.   
  
My (maternal) cousin (ftm 23) and boyfriend (m 19) are both currently living with me. My boyfriend knows of my renovations and told me that I own the house so he just wants me to do what I like. My cousin lives on the opposite side of the house and uses a bar as their kitchen, so I rarely see him. Well, yesterday he came into the kitchen and asked about the redecorating, as he can see stuff in the bar and bathroom. I explained what I was doing.  
  
He FREAKED out on me, saying that i'm trying to force him back into being a girl by painting everything so feminine. We went back and forth for over an hour, with the conversation ending with me telling him that he can either suck it up or move out and pay rent somewhere. My dad also made him sign a renter’s contract, even though he wasn't paying rent. I made sure to bring this up, saying that if he wanted to fight about it then I can give him his 30 day notice.   
  
FYI- his areas are not being turned pink, except the bar he uses as a kitchen. The bar and kitchen will look the same, with the same cabinets and countertop. His bathroom is staying white, but we are replacing the toilet and shower.   
  
He still is currently in my house, but I have gotten multiple calls about the situation. My mom’s side believes that I am being transphobic for not waiting to decorate until he leaves (he said before that it's not for at least 2 years). My dad’s side believes that my grandma left me the house because I always loved it and she knew my pink dream for it, so I shouldn't have to wait because someone doesn't even pay rent on it. 

The house is in my name, was left to me, and I just really really want to decorate it. I love how every room comes together and it's exactly how I wanted it. I’m going to be disappointed if I don’t go through with it. And my dad has spent so much on it already. I feel bad to make him uncomfortable though. So AITA for going through with redecorating?

15l08qx,"AITA for posting ""receipts"" of my psychologically abusive bf on my social media?","My (38f) bf (39M) of almost 4 years is constantly psychologically/mentally/emotionally abusive to me and has become even more so after I was diagnosed with cancer in 2021. Since then he has mocked my illness (yeah, CANCER), gaslit me, manipulated me, called me every name in the book, called me drug abuser-related slurs because I am on pain medication, etc. I reached out to family and friends, and they all dismissed me, citing what a charming, charismatic person he is. So, after dealing with it for 2 years while going through and recovering from DA-REPOCH inpatient chemo, not being able to leave due to my illness and lack of funding or support, I finally broke and started posting his abusive texts and audio recordings from our security cameras on my social media stories. Since then, I've received a number of messages that are basically like, ""How dare you embarrass him like that?"", and ""You're acting so childish."" So, AITA? Or is he TAH that got what he deserved?

  
Now we're both about to be evicted and I have nowhere to go (still), I'm still unable to work, and I have no idea what to do. I already filed for Social Security Disability as Unemployment and State Disability have both been exhausted, but that could take months, if not years. The reason we're being evicted in the first place is that instead of paying the rent, he decided to pour money into his project car for the past 3 months because he ""deserved it"". Then when I was sick and asked him to reply to the eviction summons within 5 days, he didn't so the court entered an automatic ruling in favor of the landlord. Now I'm just waiting for that 5-day notice from the sheriff. Ugh god please help me.

15l0uuu,AITA for Not Inviting My Sister to My Wedding After She Insulted My Fiancé?,"Hey Reddit, I (28F) recently found myself in a tough situation regarding my upcoming wedding and my sister (25F). To give you some context, my sister and I have always had a complicated relationship. We used to be close growing up, but as we got older, we started to drift apart due to our differing personalities and lifestyles.

My fiancé (30M) and I have been together for seven years, and he's honestly the love of my life. We got engaged six months ago, and the wedding planning has been in full swing. Now, the issue arose during a family dinner a few weeks ago. My fiancé was there, and he was telling a story about a recent hiking trip he took. He's really into outdoor activities, and he was excitedly talking about climbing a challenging trail.

Out of nowhere, my sister made a snide comment, saying, ""It's surprising you actually did something that requires physical effort."" She said that and looked directly into my eyes. Ever since, I started dating him, she made fun of me, for being with a more chubby man. Everyone at the table went silent, and I could see the hurt on my fiancé's face. He brushed it off, but I could tell he was hurt by her comment.

After the dinner, I confronted my sister privately about her hurtful remark. She dismissed it, saying it was just a joke and that my fiancé shouldn't be so sensitive. This really upset me, as her comment felt like a direct attack on the person I love. I explained to her how important my fiancé is to me and how her words were hurtful.

Fast forward to a few days ago, I sent out wedding invitations to all our close family and friends. When my sister received her invitation, she texted me, asking if she could bring her new boyfriend of two months as her plus-one. I thought about it and decided that, given the strained relationship between us, I would prefer to keep the wedding a more intimate affair with people who genuinely support our relationship.

I told my sister that we were having a small wedding and couldn't accommodate plus-ones for people we didn't know well. She didn't take it well. She accused me of bad things, like not being happy for her, not wanting her to enjoy the day as much as I will. After a while, I was full of her and told her she’s not invited anymore. I brought up the hurtful comment she made about my fiancé and how that played a role in my decision and that she doesn’t respect my boundaries. She got defensive and said I was overreacting.

Now she's been telling other family members that I'm being unreasonable and that I'm using her comment as an excuse to keep her out of the wedding. Some family members have reached out to me, saying I should be the bigger person and invite her, regardless of the past drama.

So Reddit, AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding after she insulted my fiancé, or should I put the past aside and include her for the sake of family harmony?",Miiyaka,1619,0.959999978542328,445,1691451062,2023-08-07 18:31:02,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l0uuu/aita_for_not_inviting_my_sister_to_my_wedding/,8,2023
15l0ydg,AITA for wanting to move out over lemonade?,"I (22F) moved back home to live with my parents two years ago. My family has always been very close, and my parents actually initiated my moving in so I could focus on building my savings. 

Everything’s been great: the house is huge, so no one’s living on top of each other, and my mom has been ecstatic over all her kids being home. I take care of my space as well as shared spaces, doing chores, etc. They’ve refused any rent or grocery money I’ve ever offered, insisting I save most of the money I make. My mom grocery shops for the house, and always asks each family member what they need from the store for the week. I always ask for a 12 pack of canned lemonade. They’re my weak spot, I have one or two a day. My mom has never had a problem getting it for me before.

Recently though, she’s been resistant. Thinking it was about the money, I offered to give her the $5, and when that didn’t help I just started getting it myself, but she still glares at me when I drink it. I’ve kept asking what the issue is, but she just walks away and the next time I see her she’s changed the subject entirely. Things came to a head yesterday when I came home from work with some of my personal groceries, including lemonade. My mom lost it, crying and carrying on about how I don’t care about how anyone else feels. I’m at a COMPLETE loss, trying to calm her down, when she tells me if I’m going to continue with these habits I won’t do it under her roof. 

Hearing that, I admit I did snap a bit. I was hurt that she would threaten to kick me out for any reason, considering how close we’ve always been, but especially since I don’t think I’ve done anything even remotely wrong. We got in a huge back n forth, mainly with me demanding she tell me what’s so wrong with me drinking some damn lemonade and her sneering at me saying “you know!”. I eventually stormed off to my room, feeling torn. My brother came in shortly after to talk. He says he understands completely where I’m coming from, but is suggesting I do what she’s asking and just stop drinking the lemonade. 

I absolutely could, but at this point it’s sort of the principle. I know I’m living with my parents, but I’m an adult and feel I should be allowed to drink my preferred beverage whenever I please, especially if I’m now paying for it and going out to purchase it myself. It is just lemonade, but it goes both ways; my mom shouldn’t care about it either, because it’s JUST LEMONADE. If she’s insisting I stop drinking it or else I’m getting kicked out, I kinda want to take the initiative and just leave. I have plenty saved at this point. I feel bad because she’s my mom, she’s been so good to me and has given me the chance to gather the savings I now want to use to get away from her. I also feel bad for yelling at her; me getting worked up didn’t help the situation.

15ly0u9,AITA for not inviting my aunt to my wedding?,"


I'm (31F)  getting married in the fall. I had stated from the start that I would strongly prefer if my aunt didn't attend. She has severe developmental delays (she's about the age of a 5 year old inside), gets overwhelmed easily and generally doesn't enjoy crowds. She didn't attend my parents wedding either.. I feel strongly that my wedding will not be a fun time for her, as there will be a lot going on and there won't be any food She enjoys (she likes hot dogs and pepperoni pizza- the food at the wedding is all going to be vegetarian).

I offered to do our own party with her and get all the food she likes, I said she could come to bridal shower if she wanted, the rehearsal dinner, brunch after etc. I feel like those events would still be a lot for her but they're much shorter events. All of these options were rejected. Instead they want her to attend the wedding- with two people they're going to hire to watch her. I said if she needs two people to watch her is this something she's even going to have fun with? They also did not offer to cover the extra people I didn't budget for (my partner and I are paying 100 percent of wedding costs).

When I entertained the idea, I asked what the plan would be because my grandmother(86) and my mother (57) both felt she was incapable of staying the entire event. I got multiple responses to the same question ""she will come for the ceremony and leave"" ""she will come for just dinner"" ""she will come for the ceremony and dinner"" ""she will get her hair done with you (??)"". I tried explaining that coming in the middle of the event (likely during speeches or the first dance) was not okay and I expressed concern that there wouldn't be almost any food She would enjoy (food is a huge factor for keeping her chill)  and she would have to sit around for 2 hours before anything was served that she would enjoy. Knowing her that would make her anxious and uncomfortable. My grandmother yelled at me that she could have cheese and crackers. I tried telling them there's no cheese and crackers on the menu.

With all of the above I made the hard decision to just say ""no"".  Since then my mother has called my partner and his mother to try and convince them that we needed to let her come. When this didn't work, they started saying that my partner had told my aunt she could come and how dare he lie to her (this didn't happen). My grandmother then also proceeded to tell my future MIL that my partner was a huge jerk for lying. My mother has also accused me of making my grandmother ill over this. Now I'm being told my mother too is sick over this too.

Well tldr my family minus my sister and another aunt think I'm a huge asshole. My grandmother declined my wedding invitation after attending my bridal shower and not acknowledging me.

She says her job wanted her to fly out of state this weekend for an opportunity but it is in possible with her son and asked us if we would be willing to take him in so short notice. Usually my husband gets a hotel and stays with his son when she flies out, but she said this time would be a longer term stay. I told my husband absolutely not, that wasn’t happening. He said I was being unfair, and that he cares for my daughter (who’s from my late partner) like his own, and I should do the same. I screamed at him and said “my daughter isn’t the product of my affair, absolutely no way is he staying here.” He got angry and said that I was being ridiculous and a b*tch, because the child is innocent. In my eyes it hurts me too much to look at that boy.

15mv2dm,"AITA (25f) for telling my sister (29f) that if she wants to come visit me, her children need to follow my rules?","So this is an ongoing problem for the last couple years. My sister has two kids, and she likes to come visit and basically use my house as a hotel so she can take her kids to various theme parks in San Diego. I'm fine with that for the most part.

My problem is that my sister has very different parenting ideas than I would like in my home. She isn't big on discipline, and has gotten upset with me when I tell her kids to stop doing things. For example, I have glass doors in my house going into the laundry room, and on one visit, my nephew (then 6m, now 7m) was slamming the glass doors as hard as he could, and I was worried they would break. I admittedly freaked out a little and snapped at him not to play with the doors, and my sister got upset and told me he was fine. 

Her kids were better behaved when they came to visit last week, but her son has one habit that annoys me. Her son (who btw is not neurodivergent, they've taken him to multiple doctors and been told he is neurotypical) refuses to eat multiple things on the same plate. For example, say we made spaghetti, and had a side salad and bread, he would demand a plate for each thing, so three plates. He'd also demand two different forks for the spaghetti and salad, as well as a seperate plate and fork for dessert. I always buy paper and plastic dishes when they visit, and after four days they'd used up all the paper plates because of his little quirk, and so when we were having cheesecake amd he demanded another plate especially for the cake, there wasn't another paper plate for him. Personally I'm uncomfortable with the kids using real dishes, and so I said he'd just have to use one of his other plates, or not have dessert, which made my sister shoot me a dirty look, say it's fine, and go get him a real plate. She said I was the same way when I was his age (I really don't think that is true, at least to this extent).

I do not feel like my sister should be the one making these rules in my home. Yes it's her kid, but I'm the one paying for the food, the dishes, and to live here. 

Aita if I tell my sister I don't want them visiting anymore unless her children follow the rules I set for my home?

Editing to add that the kids use kidware at home as well (everything plastic or paper), so this isn't just a me thing, it's very common in my family. Even my 9yo nephew still uses plastic from my understanding. 

There are other problems I had while they stayed here, but I listed these two because they were the ones that had the most contention between my sister and I. There are other issues involving wasting food, and not helping to clean up their messes before they left.",garlicknots12,1038,0.9399999976158142,513,1691623199,2023-08-09 18:19:59,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mv2dm/aita_25f_for_telling_my_sister_29f_that_if_she/,8,2023

I was talking with my mom (71) a day or two ago and Anna came up so I mentioned that Anna got her period. My mom ended up telling a bunch of other family members including my sister (32F) and aunt (68F).

My sister sent my daughter a text about it being good timing or something because my daughter doesn't go back to school until next week so she'll be able to ""get the hang of it"" by then. My daughter showed it to me and started screaming saying that her period was private and I shouldn't have told anyone. She is mortified and upset. 

I talked to my wife (36F) about it because I don't see the big deal -- we don't keep secrets in this family and I don't think periods are anything to be embarrassed about but my wife took my daughter's side and said that in the future I should ask Anna before I share any details of her life with anyone, especially my mom who likes to share family information.

I told him to move out. He’s going to but Katie said I over stepped and I told her she’s not to let anybody kick her out of her own place again and she’s not to move anyone else in without my permission because I would sell the house and put it in my retainment.

15onm0m,AITA for not going to a friend's wedding after getting kicked out of the bridal party?,"This happened a couple months ago. I miss my friend and wonder if I could have done something different.  

Sarah (31F) and I (26F) met when we were in undergrad. She was funny and we had a lot in common. Even after school ended, we stayed friends. We'd share memes, vent after bad days, stay at each other's houses. I'd say we were best friends. 

She met a guy, fell in love and got engaged. I was ecstatic for her, and happy when she asked me to be in her bridal party. I'm kind of a dork and had never been to a wedding, let alone played an important part in one. 

Ultimately the bulk of the planning and the wedding itself was to happen during my last year of law school. 

The final year of law school sucks. I had to do my highest level classes while preparing for the bar the toughest-to-pass state. I let it consume my life and was working on bar prep from 6am to 10pm at least six days a week. I wasn't the best friend during that time. I didn't respond to messages as fast as I should have, and I'd turn down some, not all, bridal hangouts because I had to study. 

Towards the summer, things fell apart. She was supposed to get married in September and her venue cancelled in June. She started calling late at night and saying really worrying stuff about her mental health. The first few times this happened I freaked out and talked her down the best I could. I suggested postponing the wedding if it was hurting her this much, or at the very least talking to a professional about all the stress. By the end of the call, we'd both be laughing and everything would be ""fine."" 

However these calls kept happening more frequently and I started to dread seeing her name on the phone. Spending a couple hours a night playing therapist then getting up early and studying the minutiae of state vs. federal class action certification was miserable and I got tired of it. She wasn't looking for any solution, just to use me as a therapist. I told her I can't keep taking these calls where she threatens herself, and if she made specific, credible threats to her well-being again, I'd just call 911 since I'm genuinely worried and live 100+ miles away. 

She got incredibly upset, started crying and hung up. A week later, Sarah asked if I could come over to talk. I understood that she was hurt, and really wanted to make things better between us. When I got there, all the bridesmaids were there like it was an intervention. Sarah told me that she had rethought me being in her wedding. She said it felt ""disingenuous"" to have someone there that doesn't really care about her enough to support her, plus I was ""soooo busy.""  She also told me that I was still welcome to attend the wedding as a guest with no plus 1. I told her I appreciated her telling me in person, but I wouldn't want anything ""disingenuous"" on her big day even as a guest, and she can invite someone else. 


That was the last time we spoke. I can't help but wonder if I was the AH for refusing to take any more calls, and refusing to attend as a guest.",i4gor,1299,0.959999978542328,167,1691794718,2023-08-11 17:58:38,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15onm0m/aita_for_not_going_to_a_friends_wedding_after/,8,2023
15onuwl,AITA For giving my mom the silent treatment after I found out she was pregnant?,"I will try to be as direct as possible.   
I (20F) always had a complicated relationship with my mother. Throughout my childhood, she always had problems with addiction. Basically, what I remember from my childhood with her is living with her until things got so bad that our family had to step in, moving in with them, my mom getting better, then moving back in with her only for her to get worse and the cycle to start all over again.   
However, since I was 13 I live with my uncles, they are incredible and they have always been the parents I needed, but since then my mother has not asked me to stay with her again. My uncles always explained that she had a disease and her leaving me with them was proof of her love for me.  
You can imagine that my relationship with her has always been complicated, but I've always tried to understand that this is something that is out of her control. In the last months, she's been on a good streak again, stopping all that shit, she's moved in with a new boyfriend and he seems to be someone that wants to help her out. We don't see each other much but I try to call her at least every 15 days, and my parents always try to report to me about her improvements.  
However, last week, after a long time, she was the one that called me and asked me to go out. I tried not to get too excited because I already know what she's like, but at the same time, I was happy. When we met, she explained how her boyfriend has helped her to cut 100% contact with anyone who influences her to go back to addiction, and how she wants to be a better person. She even started therapy and went to rehab for a while. I said I was very happy and asked what finally motivated her to make that decision.  
And then she told me that he helped her but that the big motivator that gave her strength is that they decided to start a family and that she wanted to meet me in person to let me know that she is pregnant. She said she needed to be better, to be present, and that is what is helping her focus on recovery.  
It hurt me, you know? That they were worth it, but I wasn't. I decided to leave before our lunch was even over and ignored all forms of contact from her thereafter. As people say, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.  
However, yesterday her boyfriend called me (I answered because I didn't have his number saved) and he started yelling at me, he said I was an asshole, that for him I would never have contact with his family, because apparently no one knows where my mom is and what hindered her improvement was my attitude. My grandparents are also angry with me and said that I am very irresponsible and that I didn't have emotional responsibility with someone very vulnerable. My parents said I didn't do anything wrong but I have my doubts.

15pjld3,AITA for asking my girlfriend to use different body wash,"The main thrust of this post is, I am allergic to nuts and my girlfriends bodywash contains almond oil. It isn't life threatening for me to come in contact with it but it does cause hives. I asked my girlfriend (Jess) to change the body wash she uses as I am getting hives from residue of her body wash in the shower. 

Jess was initially fine with it after a small back and forth but has since spoken to friends and believes that I am being too controlling, as do her friends. My friends are mostly neutral with a couple saying that I need to ""nut up"" and let her use whatever she wants. 

A little bit of added context is that we recently decided we wanted to move in together and decided to do a ""trial run"" as Jess still lives with her parents and I rent my own place. So it's easy enough for her to move in with me for a few months to see if living together full time works for us. 

It's never been a problem before now as I've never had a reaction from touching Jess after she uses it, but I am having a reaction from the residue that is left in the shower, usually on the removable shower head which I need to use to get clean because I'm a big dude and just leaving it up there doesn't reach everywhere.

Jess has always been aware of my allergies, she doesn't eat nuts if she knows we're going to do anything together and the few times when she has, she thoroughly brushes her teeth before seeing me.

15qcye1,AITA for not warning my mom that I put cheese in the food that I made?,"I (24F) made shepherd's pie recently from a recipe online, which said to mix about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese in the mashed potato topping that goes on top of the meat. My mom (63F) has rarely put cheese in her mouth and claims she despises cheese and that it disgusts her, and that she can't stand the sight, smell, taste, etc., of it. She does love other forms of dairy like yogurt, butter, etc. On occasion, she has accidentally ingested some in some of her favorite foods, including garlic bread which she did not know could possibly include cheese.

She had some of the shepherd's pie I made because she loves anything with beef and potatoes, and she ended up absolutely loving it and went for seconds. She wanted to make some herself and I told her the recipe but I omitted the 1/4 cup parmesan because it looked like she was really excited to make it so I felt bad and didn't want to crush her spirit by telling her there's cheese in the original recipe.

She ended up making it without the parmesan, she said it was really good, but she did tell me that the potato topping tasted a bit ""off"" or ""different"" and I told her the original one I made, the one she ate, had parmesan in it. She immediately tilted over, losing balance and grabbed the kitchen counter and put her hand on her forehead as if about to lose consciousness and she got extremely disgusted.

Edit: someone suggested i post an edit. Someone asked if I served it to her, I didn't, I walking in on her already having some with my dad who most likely offered her some. He probably saw the dish on the counter cooling down and served himself some if he thought it looked good, he doesnt care too much about the ingredients and probably couldnt figure right away that there was any obvious cheese in there, as she couldnt seem to tell either.

15qdiw2,AITA for telling my boyfriend he couldn’t beat a professional athlete in a cage fight?,"I think this is so beyond ridiculous, but my boyfriend is pissed off and I need some neutral opinions.  
My boyfriend of almost a year (24m) was staying at my (22f) house last night after going out with his friends, and was a bit tipsy. We were having a conversation about a tennis tournament (I’m a huge tennis fan), and he randomly asked me if I thought he could beat Rafael Nadal in a cage fight.   
I honestly thought he was joking, laughed, and said no. I thought he was messing around, like those surveys that say 20% of Americans think they can fight a bear or something. My boyfriend’s a strong guy and goes to the gym regularly, but Nadal’s one of the greatest athletes of all time and is obviously going to be ridiculously fit, even if he’s a bit older now.  
My boyfriend took HUGE offence to this. He said I was undermining him as a man by saying a 30-something year old could beat him in a fight, and it’s like if he told me another girl was prettier than me. I clarified that I think my boyfriend is a strong, handsome, guy and is very very fit, but I don’t think he could beat a professional tennis player in a cage fight, just like I don’t think I look like a professional model. This discussion went on for 5 minutes until I realised he wasn’t joking, and I just told him that I thought he would win the fight to put an end to it.  
We watched a movie and I thought he had forgotten about, it , but then he went to sleep in the living room, refused to speak to me, and was still pissed in the morning after he sobered up. He told me I was an asshole, rude, and he needed time to himself, then just left after eating breakfast. He hasn’t responded to my texts since other than yes or no answers, and to tell me that I need to ""seriously reconsider how I spoke to him.""  
This just seems blown well out of proportion and we’ve never had an argument like this before. Is there some dating rule about this that I’ve never heard of??

15qe79r,AITA for telling my daughter that she is smart and hardworking but not gifted.,"My wife and I both have electrical engineering degrees but I no longer work in the field and am a manager.

We have a daughter (15F) and a son (17M) and both will be headed to university next month. My son is doing a BA and has not yet picked his major and my daughter will be studying physics and computer science. My son is also very smart and is a history and language nerd.

My daughter is smart and hardworking and is attending at an earlier age than usual. She was in a school program for gifted kids. We were having a conversation at dinner the other day and my wife mentioned how proud she was of our daughter and how lucky we were to have gifted children going to good university programs and how not many people can do what our daughter did.

I was also very happy but I said that while (daughter) is really hardworking and smart, I would not say that she is actually gifted and others can't do it if they put in the same amount of work. 

Her school does a lot to try to admit girls into her program, and my wife helped teach her advanced college level math and physics from an earlier age, she didn't naturally pick it up on her own. If anything being a younger applicant with the same credentials probably helped her stand out more for the admissions committee.

I have seen how people can ruin their lives over thinking they are 'gifted' and it going to their head so I just wanted to caution her about that. 

Both my wife and daughter are upset at me now, my wife thinks I was trying to put her down which is not true and says she is gifted, while my daughter actually agrees with me but says I should not have said it as she already knows.

15rbgge,AITA for criticizing my boyfriend for staging a fake deportation scenario to test if I’d marry him?,"The other day, I (26M) was out of town attending a wedding with friends from college when I got a call from my boyfriend (29M). He told me he received a letter in the mail and that he was going to be deported. I’ve been with him for 5 months, but until now, his immigration status wasn’t something we had discussed, so this was one million percent out of the blue. He told me that he was basically hoping I could come back to town and marry him ASAP. 

I was freaking out. We’ve told each other we looked forward to getting married and having kids in the future, but I indicated on several occasions that I did not want to get married for at least a few years until I was finished with grad school. Furthermore, I’m 2 weeks away from moving overseas (without my bf) to begin a 10-month program, so I’m already in an emotionally fragile state. So I didn’t give him a hard no, but I told him I just wanted to discuss it later when I could process what was happening and be in a better frame of mind.

So basically, now I’m at this wedding shitting myself. For the next hour, he’s texting me saying that it’s fine and that maybe we should just part ways since he didn’t want to put me in that situation. Once I found a spot outside to hide, I called my boyfriend back and immediately breaking into hysterics. I didn’t know what to do as I wanted to support him, but this was a huge shock to me as I wasn’t even aware his immigration status was a thing at risk. 

That’s when he told me he made the whole thing up. While he did immigrate several years back, his citizenship status was already finalized, and there was no real risk of deportation. It was all basically a test of my loyalty and commitment to see if I would drop anything in an emergency to support him. He also criticized me for expecting him to let me know if his immigration status was in danger in the first place. 

So I was in a state of shock. Apart from the fact that I was meant to be off on a relaxing weekend seeing my friends for one last time before moving halfway across the world for the next year, I also had literally just come out to my mom and my sister the day before and told her about me and my boyfriend’s relationship, so as far as “loyalty” goes, I really felt I had just made a huge step in legitimizing our relationship. I continued to be hysterical and miserable, feeling like I got played but also that I was simultaneously a garbage boyfriend for “failing the test,” and so I basically had a miserable time the rest of the wedding with my friends.

But now, I’m wondering, AITA for criticizing my boyfriend on the scenario here? I do feel shitty for hesitating when he asked me to marry him. I really do feel I love him a lot, but I was not ready to jump in and save the day in such a scenario without question, and I’m now questioning whether I’m a bad boyfriend.",jdawg077,1490,0.9399999976158142,1018,1692057068,2023-08-14 18:51:08,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rbgge/aita_for_criticizing_my_boyfriend_for_staging_a/,8,2023

15t5wzf,AITA for telling my parents I'll no longer keep my brother on track in school?,"I (17F) am a twin with my brother, C (17M). Starting in middle school and throughout high school, it was left to me to keep him on track. C struggles with academic environments, stress, deadlines, etc, and this results in him becoming apathetic throughout the school year. Every end of the quarter it's a cycle. His grades range from Fs to Ds, and I'm left to pick up the pieces and get his average high enough to passing. And I do, each time. Even if he barely passes, he's never missed a credit, been held back, or delayed in any way when he would have otherwise.

This would be me pulling him into the dining room to sit and work on assignments while I was there as an accountability partner. He would complain, yell, and just be rude the entire time. Other times, it would be me having to log into his school computer and do them for him. When he knows I did them, it was seldom acknowledged, and sometimes even complained about how I went about doing them when they'd lose points. My parents, especially mom, always told me this was just what my job was since I'm his sister. That I have to keep him on track and make sure he passes every time, even barely. It's been expected of me for years. 

It's our senior year now. After high school, he plans on attending a police academy to become an officer, and I want to major in education. I'm struggling with balancing work, my extra-curriculars, and an eating disorder. We're in the process of trying to pursue treatment for anorexia. With this, I decided to tell my parents that while I want to help him be on track, I'm not going to go out of my way nearly as much. In my mind, he needs to be able to hold himself accountable, especially in the real world, and he can gradually learn that over the course of this year. My mom was absolutely furious, telling me that I can't abandon my job to keep him on track, and that he'll come around when he's older.

I do want to preface I'm not completely giving up. I'll still happily tutor him and study buddy when needed. But I don't want to drag him to the dining room anymore, or do his assignments on my own time. But I do see how this can look selfish, especially during the last year. AITA?

15u37kh,AITA for maybe being insensitive to my friend’s miscarriage?,"To preface, I am almost 27 weeks pregnant with my first and have suffered 2 miscarriages in the last 2 years. I totally understand the emotional pain and all the other feelings that come with a miscarriage.

There is a women, Anna, at our “sister office” (think same company, different buildings doing different things) who had the same due date as me. We really bonded over that, but sadly she miscarried at 12 weeks. It was her first pregnancy, first miscarriage.

When I discovered she miscarried from a social media post, I sent her a simple message telling her my heart is with her and she’s in my prayers. She responded with “Thank you ♥️” and we haven’t talked since. I also hid my Instagram posts and stories from her just so she wouldn’t be triggered by anything baby related that I would post (not blocked, she could still see them if she manually visited my profile, but they won’t pop up while she’s casually scrolling). It’s been about 3 1/2 months since then.

Well, another friend at this same office, Sarah, had a miscarriage 2 weeks ago. She sent me a message a week ago asking for my advice knowing I’ve had two. She wanted to know the details and my experience with them. In this conversation, she mentioned how her office, the office Anna is a part of, is throwing her a bridal shower soon and that she would love for me to come.

The bridal shower was today, and I went. As a buffet lunch was served, Anna and I walked past each other and made eye contact. I smiled and said hi and that her new haircut was super cute. She said thank you, put her food down on the table and went to the bathroom. She was in there for 20 minutes and came out crying with other women (and mutual friends) surrounding her and consoling her. 

One person who happens to be Anna’s sister came up to me and told me it wasn’t very “girl-code” of me to show up with my “belly” and that I don’t understand how she feels and how hurtful I’m being. All I could say was “I’m so sorry.” 

Sarah didn’t let any of this bother her or interrupt the party which I am very glad for her sake, since it was her bridal shower.

I stayed for the rest of the party and had a few people come up to me and tell me not to feel bad. Someone asked me if I knew about Anna’s miscarriage, I said yes and they responded with “Interesting.” I stayed after it was over talking with Sarah about our miscarriage experiences.

But I feel awful and so guilty. I regret going, and i hate how i made Anna uncomfortable and cry. I don’t know if Anna knows I’ve had two miscarriages, not that that would help.

I’m in such a funk now and don’t know what to do or how to feel. AITA?",blacktwosugarsplease,1129,0.959999978542328,366,1692314345,2023-08-17 18:19:05,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15u37kh/aita_for_maybe_being_insensitive_to_my_friends/,8,2023
15uziv4,AITA for wanting my mom to stop touching me?,"So I (19M) am very much the type of person who isn't a fan of physical contact, and basically everyone in my family knows this. However, once I started growing out my hair when I turned 17 my mom started touching it out of nowhere with no permission or warning, and I've told her on countless occasions to stop, and admittedly after awhile I stopped being nice about it. I asked her if she'd do this to a stranger at the store and She says it's fine because ""we're family""

And it doesn't stop at my hair, if it's super hot out and I don't wear a shirt she'll without warning look for stuff on my back such as blackheads or zits to pick at. I told her she has a problem and she said ""No I don't, lots of people do this"" to which I just got fed up and replied ""you're literally touching me without consent, and I think you know what other types of people do that"" she went silent for a second then just said ""that's different""

It's at the point I can't take my pills in the morning (I have Epilepsy) without either waking up before her super early, or physically pushing her away and telling her to stop so I can take my damn medicine, which my older brother gets upset at me for doing whenever he witnesses it.

She always hated me, the shit went so bad she had to go to therapy from 9 until she was 15. After that she started to ignore me, honestly it was a good outcome. She went to college and we started having a more polite relationship.

My father had an affair during the time she was in college and me and my mom found them in the house. She was a neighbor so I knew her name. My parents went to therapy and my mom forgave my father, but still hated the neighbor.

I discovered from my cousins that my sister was planning to steal my baby name because I was pregnant at the same time as her. She was acting like my pregnancy was some sort of evil plan against her. She spent around one month in my ass trying to convince me to give her the name. In an angry moment after receiving 12 calls from her the same day I told her the name of my dad's ex mistress as if it was the name we planned.

Her baby was born 2 weeks ago, she only let the family visit today. When she told our parents the name my mom got choleric with her choice. That's when it came out I was the one who told her. My parents are a little mad at me but much more with her. My sister is pissed, they already have her birth certificate and will have to spend around a thousand dollars to change the name.

I worked very hard to graduate early and get into college. I'm trying to get out of my house as fast as I possibly can. 

We live in a multigenerational house. My paternal grandparents own the house and my dad and his brother both live there with their families as well. My mom divorced my dad and he remarried a few years later. I was living with her until her new husband transferred overseas for work last year. 

I am the oldest kid in the house and all the adults work. So I got stuck babysitting my nephews, niece, and half brother and sister. I don't mind, they are well behaved and I get paid. Not a lot but I do. 

For college I had a plan. I have my laptop at home but I don't want to lug it around. So I got myself a handheld gaming computer. It runs windows and I have a small folding Bluetooth keyboard. 

My half brother saw it when I brought it home and he wanted to play games on it because it looks sort of like a switch. 

I said he couldn't because it was my computer for school. He is ten and on the spectrum so he loses his temper very easily. He had a tantrum and his mother insisted I let him play with it.  I said no and took it and went to see my grandmother. I was showing her all the stuff I could do on it when my dad came home. 

His wife convinced him that I was taunting my had brother by not letting him play with my ""toy computer"". 

My dad said to let him play and that he will be careful. I said it wasn't a toy and that I got it for school. He insisted that I needed to share when I was in his house. My grandmother gave him side eye but didn't say anything. 

Surprise surprise, the little asshole couldn't play Diablo on it so he got upset and smashed it. 

I said I told you so and gave the ultimatum from my title. 

It was Monday today and I took my uncle's kids with me to the zoo. I left my father's children at home. His wife had to take the day off. They tried texting and calling me for an hour until they figured out I wasn't going to back down. 

He tried to ground me when I got home but my grandmother told him I was right. So now I am in my room setting up my second brand new computer in a week.

there’s stains in the carpet all over the house from times he hasn’t made it. it’s disgusting and i can’t afford new carpet and neither can he. i just ran the carpet cleaner over it after getting up all the big stuff and that’s the best i can do for now. 

today i was in the kitchen cooking dinner and he was sitting at the table. he stood up and said “i have to go shit. actually, i’m shitting right now”. i thought he was joking at first until i started hearing it hit the floor. he stripped down, dripped it all over the floor, and smeared it around with paper towels in an attempt to clean it up. i was pissed at this point because he knows he has this problem and refuses to wear diapers and now i’m playing hop scotch trying not to burn anything. 

i ended up having to shut the stove off and clean it up myself and at this point i had no appetite left so i just made a plate for him and my brother and started getting ready to put it away. whenever he got down from the shower, i told him he needs to work with me on this to get it figured out because i’m not going to keep dealing with this and i’ll pay someone else to if i have to. i told him he needs to at least wear diapers or he’s ending up in the nursing home. 

i know this was harsh, but i have just been so fed up with it. he tried to blame me by saying i made him come in the kitchen for dinner and it took him farther away from the bathroom. i never made him sit there, and he didn’t even make it out of the kitchen so i know he wouldn’t have made it from anywhere else in the house either. he was really embarrassed and started crying though and said he’s not happy about it either and when i came to apologize later for making him so upset, he just kept saying “whatever” and saying he didn’t want to hear it.

15zjgi2,"AITA for convincing my husband not to go to his ""best friends"" wedding?","For a little bit of background; my husband's best friend never liked me since I had a ""tiff"" with his ex girlfriend. I had made a post on Facebook that I was looking for donations to help a friend get on her feet after escaping from a very abusive relationship. She felt the need to comment something negative about me ""asking for handouts"". 

Fast forward to when he had a new girlfriend. After I helped that friend through her hardship and breakup... I decided every Christmas season I was going to pick a friend and do a ""cheer"" hamper for them. So I would post online again. I did this for like three years in a row before my hubby's friend got the new girlfriend. We got acquainted.

She saw my Facebook post and did the SAME THING his ex did! But she got worse. She went to every possible Facebook group she could...just to blast me. Where she got completely roasted because people thought I was doing a beautiful thing. My husband's friend completely blew up at him and told him that he and his girlfriend refused to come to our wedding because he could not support such a person like me. ( of course he called me every name in the book) 
He then tells my husband "" her or me, because I'm not going to be your friend anymore.""

Fast forward a year later. We are happily married, etc. His friend literally didn't talk to him for that entire year, ghosted him even. He then messages him late November and invites him to his wedding. My hubby and I assumed it was both of us as an invite. so i got him to ask about plus ones. He said we are doing plus ones but your wife cannot come! 
I said.."".if you go to that wedding you are disrespecting me, our entire marriage and even yourself for how he treated you. He refused to come to our wedding and completely dissed our marriage and was vocal about the refusal of support if it were me you were marrying. It would be like a slap to the face if you go. I dont think you should. "" 

The dude also invited him unofficially on facebook like two weeks before the wedding. My husband took a little bit to decide. But went with what I told him. And didn't go. 
For the record; i wouldnt have wanted him to go/ us to go even if i was allowed. To go...and feel hated by the bride and groom. Weird. Awkward.

I feel guilty because even my hubby's mom and brother went to the wedding, and didn't understand why he didn't go, and of course i got blamed and told i was controlling when all i feel i did was give my husband insight to feelings that were already there...AITA?",x-Sevenie-x,736,0.8700000047683716,186,1692830729,2023-08-23 17:45:29,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zjgi2/aita_for_convincing_my_husband_not_to_go_to_his/,8,2023

My girlfriend and I love together. She wakes up at 6am to get to work at 7am.

I work from home and don't need to wake up until about 8:30am. I enjoy sleeping in until then. 

It fucking maddens me that her alarm goes off constantly from 5am-6am and destroys my sleep and my morning. I've brought this up with her and she's defended the habit and refused to quit because (1) she says it's the only way she can get up in the morning, and (2)  she has to drive to work for a job that starts much earlier than mine, and I work from home, so I should be accommodating to her and empathetic that she has to wake up so early and drive. After months of this I told her that the next time her snooze went off, I'd turn off her alarm on her phone. 

This morning, I did that at 5am and reached over and just turned off the alarm on her phone after she hit snooze the first time. She slept through to about 6:40am, woke up, freaked out, and ended up about 10 minutes late to work. She is furious at me. But I insist I am right and I will do the same thing tomorrow.

1629d74,AITA for ordering salmon at a vegan friend's birthday dinner when she asked everyone to eat vegetarian?," I (21F) was diagnosed with autism in April last year. Everyone in my friend group is aware of this. One characteristic linked to my autism is my strong aversion to many foods. I'm an extremely picky eater, and the only vegetable I actually like is potatos and I can stand carrot, though I'm okay with most fruits. Whenever I'm going to a new restaurant, I always research the menu beforehand to mentally prepare myself for what I'll eat. Unexpected changes can be really hard for me.

My friend ""Lily"" is vegan and celebrated her birthday yesterday. She decided to invite our friend group dine at a health-focused restaurant that, while offering many vegetarian/vegan options, also serves chicken and fish dishes. Before going, I checked the menu and decided on grilled salmon with mashed potatoes (planning to ignore the side salad).

When we arrived, Lily requested that we all choose to eat vegetarian for the night for her birthday. I apologized and explained that there wasn’t a vegetarian option I liked in the menu. Everyone else agreed to her request, and she persisted with me. I expressed that had I known this beforehand, I would've eaten at home and just ordered a vegetarian appetizer. I was genuinely hungry by that point. After some back and forth, I asked if I should leave and she allowed me to stay, but the atmosphere was tense.

The rest of the evening was awkward, with Lily avoiding conversation with me. Today I texted her and asked if everything was ok between us, but she responded by saying I'm too spoiled, and an asshole for not even doing the one thing she asked for her birthday I'm not confrontational by nature, so I apologized again and responded by asking her to inform me in advance next time.

I was confused, and she said a man shouldn't bathe his daughter as it is inappropriate and could result in ""temptation.""  

Now, I know she's religious, so maybe that's where this comes from, but I was disgusted. What she was implying was horrible. I told Lucy, and she got very upset with her mother. They argued and now her mother is staying in a hotel (we are paying). Sarah has now been texting me and blaming me for all of this. I am about to block her.

1635gwu,AITA for not tipping well because my hairdresser brought her baby to the appointment?,"I (30f) been going to Lindsey for years now, and she always does a really good job. She's a very kind girl and I had not had a bad experience with her until yesterday. I hadn't had my hair done in about 6 months so I was quite overdue for cut/color. Keep in mind that Lindsey does specialty haircuts and her rates are not cheap.

So, I walk in for my appointment yesterday and I noticed that Lindsey had her 3 month old with her. She apologized and explained that her babysitter canceled last minute and she was in a bind. She gave me the option of rescheduling but to be honest I didn't think much at the time as the baby was sleeping, plus I really needed my hair done. So I went ahead with the appointment as planned.

The problem started once her baby woke up and was fussy and cried throughout the session, making it hard for me to relax. Furthermore, she had to step out a few times, once to calm the baby down and another to change a diaper, she even left me sitting alone in the chair for about 20 minutes so that she could go feed her daughter. She wasn't nearly as focused as she usually is.

By the end of the appointment I was feeling irritated by all of the disruptions and extra noises that happened that even though I was happy with how my hair turned out I left a small tip. Mind you, the tip is on top of her usual (expensive) rate. When I gave her the tip, she asked if something was wrong and I explained that I felt like the baby was a distraction and that even though I didn't have to pay for the extra time (roughly an hour) I was unhappy with how long it took. She said that she was disappointed because she gave me the option to reschedule. I apologized and left.

Not being a parent myself, I don't want to be dismissive or unsympathetic to Lindsey's situation, however, I really felt like I didn't get the experience with her that I usually pay for. It felt chaotic and unorganized not to mention that I am not the biggest fan of children.

Am I the asshole for not tipping well?",LargeSquash2912,1963,0.8899999856948853,868,1693178338,2023-08-27 18:18:58,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1635gwu/aita_for_not_tipping_well_because_my_hairdresser/,8,2023
1635kea,AITA for not letting my brother blow out my candles on my birthday,"All throughout my childhood my little brother has always got all of the attention. My mom always called him “her little angel” since he was always her favorite. To get straight to the story, I (15f) haven’t had a birthday party in about 5 years, while my little brother (who’s now 10) has always had one each year. My uncle (we’ll call him bob for privacy reasons) started questioning why my little brother has always had a birthday party and I didn’t, well she wasn’t planning on celebrating my 15th birthday anyway. But when my uncle (bob) started telling the rest of my family rumors started going around and since she didn’t want to sound like a “bad mom” she decided to let me have a birthday party. We were hosting it at a local playground near where I live. 3 of my friends and some of my family was invited and came. All day my brother has made up lies to get attention from people, and when me and my 3 friends were on the swings my mom made me get off so my brother could swing. (There was another set of swings right next to the one I was on) while most my birthday my brother got all the attention, it was finally time to sing and have cake. While everyone was gathering around my brother started crying and screaming because he wasn’t going to be able to blow the candles out, so my mom told me to let him blow the candles out and then she’ll relight them for me to blow out after. I was getting fed up with all this so when everyone was getting to the end of my birthday song I kind of moved my brother away and blew my own candles out. My brother was not happy about that. He started screaming and crying. My mom got really mad at me and she scolded me for not letting my brother blow the candles out. The rest of the family agreed on my part. My aunt and uncle started yelling at my mom for treating my brother way better than me. The rest of the family just started leaving in shame of my mom.

1635lnj,WIBTA if I exposed a local church?,"My buddy donated an extremely nice living room set to a local church, for a very specific purpose according to him: because parents didn't have anywhere nice to sit and wait for their kids while they were waiting for them to get out of classes, sports, events, etc. He told them this when he donated it. That is not what the church ended up using the furniture for. In fact, they didn't use it for anything; they didn't even donate it to a family in need, as you may expect. Instead, it went to one of the church official's daughter's house. She is very much not a family in need, as she just installed an entire new addition to her house, as well as a swimming pool. My buddy was just as surprised (and angry) as I was when I told him where his furniture ended up. He is trying to be passive, but I know this family (the church family) very personally, and I'm certain it is not the first or last time it has happened; it's just the first time somebody noticed.

16362zh,AITA for peeing in my friend's shower?,"I (22FtM) was staying at a friend's place a few months ago over my spring break. Let's call her Natalie (23F). Natalie and I have been friends for a while, but we haven't been able to hang out as much since she graduated last year and has been working. This was my first time seeing her new place, and our first time spending the night together (before anyone gets the wrong idea, there are absolutely no romantic or sexual feelings between us). 

Now, as a guy without a penis I am unable to enjoy the wonders of pissing standing up most of the time. STPs scare me and so I simply sit. However, when I shower I can pee however I'd like and it just goes down the drain and washes off my leg if I aim badly! I shower every night before bed and I basically always pee, it's just really satisfying for me. I don't really talk to my friends about my peeing habits, but my whole family pees in the shower as well and I just assumed it was normal.

Last week, me and Natalie were hanging out with some of our friends. Somehow, we started talking about peeing, and so of course peeing in the shower came up. Many of my penisless friends agreed with me that it's so nice to be able to stand for once, and many of my penis-having friends even agreed as well. However, not everyone felt that way, and there was a bit of an awkward silence afterwards.

Natalie approached me later and nervously asked me if I had peed in her shower, and I said yes. She got really quiet and the whole thing got really awkward. She kinda shuffled away and we sort of avoided each other the rest of the evening. Later, one of our mutual friends texted me to tell me Natalie was really uncomfortable to learn that I peed in her shower, and she was reconsidering whether she would ever let me stay with her again. I texted her about it directly and apologized, but she hasn't replied yet.

She shaves everything else, although she’ll happily go kinda long between shaves, but her armpits she probably shaved once every 2 or 3 months (longer in winter) for a special occasion if she really feels like it. She says she loves have armpit hair and it makes her feel more womanly and sexy and herself. I don’t have an issue with this most of the time (although I’m not really used to this and would probably prefer she shaves). And she’s really clean and never smells bad or anything. 

But recently I invited her to a family function where she’ll meet a lot of my family and some family friends for the first time. She said she’s going to wear a strappy summer dress. I asked her if she’ll shave her armpits and she said she wasn’t planning to. I asked her if she could do it for me as I don’t want my family or family friends to judge her or think she’s weird. She got really offended and said that was really harsh of me and that now she doesn’t even want to come. I don’t think I’m being unreasonable asking her to shave.

166po8j,AITA for calling the hotel,"I had to create an anonymous username because people know my regular username. 

I will try to keep this short and sweet.

I have a MIL that has been a thorn in my side for over 20 years. From the second I started dating her son, she was an actual pain and boundary stomped nonstop. An example- my first child was an emergency csection and I was released a day earlier than normal and she thought it was acceptable to call my ob/gyn to have him make me stay at the hospital longer. She also made sure to tell me on multiple occasions that I will never have a strong bond because I couldn’t breastfeed. When my husband and I confronted her, she lied and played the victim. 

I recently started going to therapy and have really begun to understand that she is absolutely insane. I always knew, but I never wanted to put my husband in a weird position. He is, by all means, a great husband. Very supportive and caring.

Heres the issue- we have a family wedding this weekend out of town for my husband’s side. My children are in the wedding and we are very excited. My husband informed me that his mother called the hotel to request that we have an adjoining room with his parents. She did not discuss it with us, she just made the call to the hotel. To say that I am feeling violated is a gross understatement. I told him that I am NOT ok with this. He said he didn’t want to create any problems or drama and didnt want anyone to be upset. He also said it’s probably because she wants to spend time with our children, but I feel as if this type of thing should be discussed first. We did say we are fine with being on the same floor for this reason, but she took it upon herself to call and request that our rooms be adjoining. 

I took matters into my own hands and called the hotel myself to request that we do not have adjoining rooms. My husband is worried this will create a bigger issue, but I am really upset that his mom thinks this is acceptable. We are near 40 and I don’t want to be treated like a child.

166pxro,AITA for saying my son in law needs medication?,"My daughters husband has ADHD. I am aware of ADHD and the nuances and symptoms since my daughter has it as well. But, at least from my point of view, he does nothing to cope or combat it in any way. As a result, I have witnessed him acting extremely negligent to his duties as an adult partner. I don’t mean emotionally or anything, because they can be very sweet together, I mean he’s 100% the type of guy who has to be asked 5x to take the trash out and still doesn’t do it. Every house chore falls onto my daughter, even right after she gave birth, he didn’t do a single load of laundry, a single dish, walk the dog or change a diaper. He works full time to support them while my daughter takes care of the baby,  which is nice, but outside of that, he does nothing to contribute to their life from what I’ve seen. He is oblivious to the fact that she’s speaking to him half of the time and she ends up just sitting there talking to herself while he stares at his phone or spaces out.  All of which, he attributes to his ADHD claiming he has “executive dysfunction”, or that he gets sidetracked, overwhelmed by multiple chores and starts to get frustrated. She has to call his name over and over again, repeatedly say “hello? I’m speaking to you?” For him to even glance up from his phone when she’s sitting 2 feet away from him. He’s so not in tune with his surroundings that if the baby cries and she asks him to pitch in and help, he expects to be told what’s wrong with the baby, how to help, where to find everything, because he wasn’t paying any attention. So if she needs him to help with the baby, she’s still not getting whatever else she needs to get done finished, because she’s standing there and walking him through step by step, repeating herself, and still doing 100% of the mental load. 

I watched this happen on countless visits and I just had enough of it this time. I watched for a week while my daughter did everything, cooked every meal, cleaned everything, did every feeding, changed every diaper. She did it or I did it, and not once, did her husband even offer to help or notice. When we did things all together he was constantly talking over my daughter, zoning out, or completely not even paying attention, and she has to repeat herself over and over again. Finally I snapped, cleared my throat and asked “why are you ignoring your wife when she’s talking to you?”. He started scrambling and trying to explain that it’s just that he has ADHD and can’t help it, and I told him that having ADHD doesn’t give him an excuse to treat my daughter like she’s invisible, and if that’s the extent to which it affects him he needs to see a doctor and get medication. His face got really red and he looked like he was about to cry, and I have to admit that I do feel bad for that, but at the same time, I think he needed to know. My daughter is saying she agrees but says that I owe him an apology for my tone or I won’t be invited back to visit.

Both my MIL and husband were then like ""Please, no"" in a ""oh he’s gonna fuck up"" way. 

My FIL said ""Well you weren’t exactly his type in high school, you know?"". My husband tried to make him stop after that but my FIL added ""Not saying you weren’t pretty enough or anything like that, you just wouldn’t have caught his eyes"" 

I got up the table and went to the bathroom. I was not even in there for 5 minutes that my husband knocked and told me we were leaving.

166rclm,WIBTA for not attending dinners at my inlaws house while pregnant?,"I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes.  Pre-preganancy, we would go to my inlaws house every month or so. Just the 4 of us, so not large family gatherings.

When I was diagnosed my hubby told tell his mom so that she was aware and to ask if we should bring something for me to eat and to let her know that we were doing our best to not have sweets around to reduce temptation. She insisted that she would provide all the food and that there would be lots of options for me.

Problem was my MIL served food that i couldn't eat. I had a small tossed salad and a side of veggies. She also served a dessert of fresh strawberries which she macerated with sugar covered with whip cream and an apple pie with ice cream.

After the visit I cried during the whole drive home. I was hungry, upset and hormonal.  My hubby spoke with his mom, but she thought it was reasonable for me to eat what i could from what was served. She didn't seem to understand why everyone else needed to refrain just because of me. 

I skipped the next dinner saying I wasn't feeling well, but I've decided that I won't attend any more dinners until I give birth.  My inlaws can come to our house so that I can control the food served.  My hubby knows how important this is for the health of our baby, but he's concerned about my MIL making things very difficult.  He's asking me to consider letting my MIL host us but we just bring some food.  Eliminating sugar is very difficult for me, so I prefer to not be around such temptation.  I wouldn't take such a hard stance, but she doesn't seem to think gestational diabetes is something serious and has even said I need to think moderation.  The complications for baby can be very severe and I want to be careful.

167n3n4,AITA for telling my wife that I didn't care about her feelings?,"sockpuppet account for obvious reasons.

my wife and I are in our mid-30s. We've been together since 2014, married since 2019. No kids. 

about ~4 times per year, my wife has what I can only describe as a rage attack. She has an (untreated) disorder that causes her emotional regulation issues, and she sees a therapist (though not a psychiatrist). They are very frustrating to me. She is functionally ""unreachable"" as she goes through them, and she just... gets mad. At me, obviously, but just everything in her life, no matter if it makes sense or not. It's like her amygdala just freaks the fuck out at a tiny thing (mild conflicting opinion from me, or not being able to find her phone, etc) and pumps out anger hormones. 

she returns to a baseline afterwards, apologizes earnestly and honestly, and returns to her normal self. Her normal self has big emotions too, but I almost enjoy them - I don't feel emotions as deeply as her, so it's nice to feel along with her, if that makes sense. 

three nights ago, she had one. We had a little disagreement, so I went into the kitchen, and she threw something at the wall and started just *yelling*. She wouldn't let me leave the kitchen. Again there is no reasoning with her when this happens, words mean nothing. 

I escaped, told her to go to bed, cleaned up the mess she made, and that was ""that"".

The next day, she came home from work and started apologizing, and I told her that I wasn't really willing for this to happen again, and she has to take action to prevent this from happening. We kept talking and a couple minutes later she said, ""I feel really bad, you know"" and my response was **""right now, I don't care how you feel. I'm telling you this can't keep going on.""**
we dropped it and moved on.

a couple hours ago, she brought up that it was hurtful that I told her I didn't care about her feelings, but I think that's a pretty reasonable way to respond when I was on the floor of our condo cleaning up her rage choices the night before.

168g7uk,AITA(23F) for telling my siblings that we have to practice saving food for everyone else.,"My mom passed away 2 months ago, and my fiancé and I quickly became the sole guardian of my 3 youngest siblings(16, 14, and 11). As much as I loved my mom, I know how hard it was growing up under her and how we didn’t have a lot, so when I left for college I did feel guilty leaving my siblings there knowing they wouldn’t have much, but I did so for this very reason, so that I could make enough money to get house that allowed me to house all of them if needed. They understood why I had chosen to go away to college and didn’t resent me for leaving them there, which I’m so grateful for. 

Although i am in the position where my siblings can stay with me for however long they need to, I won’t lie and say things haven’t been hard. Especially financially wise, I mean I went from just caring for myself, my fiancé, and our 2 dogs to caring, clothing, housing, and feeding 3 children who need stability. It was such a shocking flip to my world and I’m just trying my best to do what’s best for my siblings. However one thing 3 teenagers can do is eat. And I fully understand that we grew up in a household where we would have food one week and then be home dry the next two weeks, so we truly never knew when we’d eat a full meal again outside of school. Yet that is not a worry my siblings have had to face here, it takes some saving and budgeting but my fiancé and I have come up with a way where we can spend $1,400 a month to fully stock up the house. I have had small conversations about my siblings needing to be considerate of everyone in the house when it’s regarding food and telling them to just take what makes them full and leave enough for others to be full as well. I understand the resources guarding mindset is very hard to get out of, I really do, but what else can I do? Things got bad when my fiancé and I went grocery shopping at Costco on Thursday, and we usually buy a few snacks for the kids to snack on or take to school. We woke up Friday morning and within less than 24 hours all of the chocolate chip cookies were gone and it came in a pack of like 50. 

I called everyone down and explained to them that I will never restrict access to ANY food from them, however they needed to be 100 percent considerate of everyone else in the house who also needed to have access to the same food and snacks as them. I told them that we were going to start learning about portion control and saving food for others and they all said that they understood and that was sort of the gist of it all. 

The reason I’m asking if I’m TA because I went to my group for other people who have the same situation as me and talked about it, and another group member told me that I was being a terrible person by controlling what they ate, and that I was going to give them an ED. Im absolutely not trying to control their eating habits, I’m  just trying to make sure everyone eats.

Instead of using her own money to do that, she wants to buy a McMansion to get out of their smaller cramped house. Basically implying that her and her family need the money more than I do since they’re married with kids and I’m not. She thinks my parents were unfair when they created the will and that I should “do the right thing” to make up for their mistake. Our entire family is split on the issue.

Our aunts and uncles and cousins all have differing opinions, with the more homophobic side of the family saying I’m being a greedy asshole.

Obviously, the vet did the heavy lifting and I was just there to assist. I don’t know for sure why I was required to wear scrubs when the most medical thing I did was give the dogs their medicine, and I’m pretty sure it was just so the kennel techs looked professional (the owner was a bit pretentious and was always concerned with appearing professional). 

Three years ago when I started college, I had to quit my job at the pet store. I was determined to pay my way through college and not take out any student loans, and as much as I loved that job, it did not pay very well. When I quit, I got rid of all of the shirt scrubs, but I kept the pants because as it turns out, nurses have been holding out on us, and scrubs are really comfortable. I treat them like sweatpants. They are comfortable and just something for me to wear around the house on my day off, but I would never go out in public wearing them.

Fast forward to two days ago, when I went out to go check the mail while wearing some of my old scrubs without thinking about it. Our neighbor who lives in front of the mailboxes was out watering her garden and she perked up when she saw me. She she got all excited and told me about how her daughter was a nurse, and how she knew I was in college but she didn’t know I was going to college to be a nurse. So I of course cut her off and said oh I’m actually in college getting a degree in history and I go on to explain why I had the scrubs and all that. To say she was mad about me wearing scrubs would be an understatement. She compared it to stolen valor, when people dress up like veterans and first responders when they aren’t. She went on and on about how hard her daughter worked to become a nurse, and that nurses “have earned the right to wear scrubs.” I was honestly a little baffled, because I wasn’t trying to pretend to be a nurse, and now, one of my neighbors who I barely know is lecturing me in the middle of our neighborhood. 

She posted on Facebook that afternoon that she saw someone out in public wearing scrubs, and that when she talked to them it turned out they weren’t even a nurse. It was very clear that she was talking about me, but I do appreciate that she said it was a stranger at a grocery store since she is friends with a lot of the people in our neighborhood. I didn’t even consider that I could be in the wrong until I saw how everyone who was commenting on her post was agreeing with her. So am I the asshole?",Capn_Frogger,10027,0.9700000286102296,490,1693782475,2023-09-03 18:07:55,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169bc2f/aita_for_wearing_scrubs_even_though_im_not_a_nurse/,9,2023
169bfmj,AITA for having my nephew move in with me after he was disowned? My kids are angry with me,"I (M50's) have two kids, Jamie (M24) and Mia (F22), their mother being my ex wife, Sarah, (F50's).

Our marriage fell apart when Mia was still in diapers. Sarah was having an affair with my younger brother and she became pregnant with my nephew, Caleb (M20).

Sarah and my brother ended up getting together, although eventually my brother abandoned them and packed his bags and moved to another state when  Caleb was around 2 and to this day never sees his son.

We had shared custody of Jamie and Mia but they gradually chose to spend more and more time at my home when they became teenagers, as they felt that their mom liked Caleb better than them.

Since lockdown, Sarah has changed a lot as a person. She ""rededicated her life to Christ"" and joined a very cult-like online church.

Recently, someone from his college outed Caleb as gay and Sarah has disowned him as her son, and ever so graciously gave him a week to get out of her house (sarcasm of course).

I reached out to Caleb and told him that he is welcome to stay with me for free so that he can finish college, there's no way I could watch a family member become homeless without trying to help them. After some talking things out he moved in, and I had him take Jamie's old bedroom. My kids haven't lived at home in a while now so I have the space, and it's actually quite nice to have Caleb's company.

The problem is that Jamie and Mia are both extremely upset with me for letting Caleb move in, considering their history with him and Sarah showing him favoritism. They say that there are other family members who could've taken him in (my parents offered but they do live in another country) and that I should've asked them beforehand to consider their feelings.

Jamie now even refuses to let me see my infant granddaughter until I get Caleb to leave. If I am an asshole, how can I make this right?",Impressive-Wing-8298,6420,0.9399999976158142,1043,1693782724,2023-09-03 18:12:04,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169bfmj/aita_for_having_my_nephew_move_in_with_me_after/,9,2023

16a6jls,AITA for telling my wife she can do all the old people stuff but I'm not interested yet.,"My wife is six years older than me. I'm 54. I still enjoy skiing, scuba diving, hiking, etc. My wife used to be my partner in all that stuff. Now she is happy reading, gardening, watching TV, and being a grandma. 

I love being a grandpa. But I like taking my grandchildren out to the pool, or the park. I do play games at home with them as well. 

My wife says that she doesn't want to do the things we used to do any more.  She says she doesn't have the energy any more. I don't mind doing them on my own. For example this last winter she got to stay at the hotel, the chalet, and town while I went skiing. This summer she didn't want to come down to the Carribean to go scuba diving. I would have loved her company but she said she wanted to help with the grandkids more. I said I understood but I still wanted my vacation. So I went. 

When I got back she was upset with me. She said I was an asshole for taking a vacation without her. She could have come. I just wasn't interested in hanging around the city for an extra two weeks. She said that she felt like I abandoned her. I said I worked hard my life so I could enjoy it not to lay like a potato. She said her new hobbies might be sedentary but she enjoyed them. I said that was fine but I didn't want to do old people shit until I absolutely had to.

16b318x,AITA for not looking after my infant niece while my sister had to run errands?,"I feel really bad and need an unbiased opinion.

I (28f) am currently living with my sister (32f) and my niece who is 5 months old. My sister asked me to move in with her as she was separating from her partner and needed someone to help with the bills. I cover the majority of rent payments for the house and bills since my sister is not fully back to work yet. On the days she is working it is usually our mother who looks after my niece.

Now I mainly work from home and due to how loud both my niece and my sister are and the job specifics I wear good noise cancelling headphones (I also have a room with my own bathroom). I have told my sister multiple times if she needs anything and I haven't responded to a knock she needs to come into my room and tap me to get my attention otherwise I would simply won't hear her and wouldn't know if she needs anything. However my sister keeps forgetting it.

Last Friday was very hectic at my work so I ended up working 12 hours and had some snacks to get me going. I had no knowledge of my sister asking anything of me since I sit opposite the door I also haven't seen her coming into my room since she didn't tap me on my shoulder as we agreed. Apparently she had to run a few errands at work and had noone to leave my niece with and decided to leave her with me since she would be a few hours. Because I had no idea of her plans and she hasn't followed what I have asked her to do, my niece was left unattended for over 3 hours and was crying her eyes out for god knows how long. I only found out about it when my sister returned home (I was still working and had my headphones on) as she ripped the headphones off my head and started shouting at me and calling me an asshole for not attending to my niece, even I have explained to her I had no idea she was gone or my niece was crying (to add, I don't look at my phone during work hours and after I have checked there was no messages or missed calls from my sister)

16byu49,AITA for taking money out of my son’s allowance?,"
I(41F) have 3 sons(twins who are 12, and a 10 year old). All of my sons started doing chores around 8 and started getting allowances for their chores at 10 years old. Chores are only mandatory 5 days out of the week, I don’t care what time a day they choose to get them done. As long as they are done by the end of the day. I made it clear to my boys once they started earning money that they would be getting 10 dollars a day for everyday they complete their chore. If they fail to do so, then 10 dollars would be deducted. It has been that way for 2 years for my eldest boys and a couple of months for youngest. Allowance is always paid out every Wednesday, and I encourage them to save enough to take with them on the weekend to their dads in case they go somewhere fun or see something cool that they might want but dad might not be okay with spending money on. This system has worked swimmingly for us since it started, the boys have always complied with completing their chores.

However, one of my 12 year olds refused to do his chore of the week (sweeping down stairs and wiping down surfaces) for 3 days. The first 2 days he did so without problem, but when his friend asked him to play on Fortnite with him, my son asked for 15 minutes to complete his chore before he got onto the PlayStation. His friend asked what chore he had to do, so my son told him. In response, my son’s friend said “it’s a good thing my parents don’t make me do girl chores.” I spoke with my son and explained to him that knowing how to clean was not specific to any gender, that it was a life skill everyone needed to know. I also told him that I understood that other family’s functioned differently; however, in our family, everyone did an equal share. Even after speaking with him the first day he decided to not do his chore, he still chose not to do his chores, so like agreed I took 10 dollars out of his allowance for each day he didn’t do, which allotted to him only having 20 dollars in his allowance; whereas his brothers had 50. 

The problem comes where my son was so upset about the lack of money in his allowance that he called his dad about it very upset. My ex husband then proceeded to call me and tell me that I’m in the wrong for only giving him $20 and to imagine how it makes him feel that his brothers got more than he did. I explained to him that our other sons actually did their chores for all 5 days, so they were rewarded accordingly. And assured him that if he had decided to start giving the boys an allowance then he can run allowance however he wanted, but this was ultimately the system I had come up with. My ex husband told me that I am being insensitive and humiliating our son.

16bzzj6,"AITA for refusing to change the color of my sister's bridesmaid dress, even though she hates it?","I can't believe I'm posting about this but I really need some insight.

I (23f) am getting married to my fiancé (25m) in November. We're really excited and the day is fast approaching.

I have 5 women being my bridesmaids, one of them is my sister, Millie (21f). Millie has always been more of a tomboy growing up but doesn't have an issue with wearing dresses for formal events.

I want my bridesmaids to wear matching dresses, which everyone knew when they accepted. I bought and paid for the dresses. They're a relatively simple style and in a pastel pink color.

Millie is now angry and saying she won't wear the dress because it's pink and ""too girly"". She's even threatening to not attend the wedding anymore unless I return her dress and pick out another color.

I'm distraut that she'd make such a problem out of a dress color when she knew I wanted the bridesmaids to match. I think Millie is being dramatic and could deal with wearing the dress for one day but tbh my feelings are really hurt that she'd threaten to drop out of the wedding over this.

My fiancé thinks I should kick her out of the wedding party before she causes bigger problems closer to or on the day. My parents got themselves involved in this and told me to just exchange the dress for the same one in a different color and that we're both acting like children.

16csnas,AITA for yelling at my husband for asking the temperature of the soup,"My husband and I just got back from a trip where I contracted a nasty bacterial infection in my chest and my sinuses. I don’t think I’ve ever felt that sick before, I’m still sick but no longer feel like I’m dying. Yesterday in the morning I made my famous Get Better Soon Soup that I only make when someone in the family or friends circle is sick. Chopping and slicing and general cooking stuff wiped me the F out, but it was so worth it. Husband was at work and I wanted soup, no big deal. We often bring his mom food since she lives nearby and we like to help/spend time with her. When my husband came home to me laying on the couch much like a dead fish lays on the beach, he declared the soup smelled amazing and then asked me to put some in to go containers for him and his mom to eat. I just looked at him and very slowly and very quietly said, “I’m still really sick, and I’m the one who had to make the soup, it really took a lot out of me, can you Please do it yourself.” I did not succeed in keeping the annoyance out of my voice. He said yes, also a little annoyed. And as he approached the stove he asked “do you think it’s hot enough for us to eat right away, or will I have to heat it up when I get there?”. And then I lost it. I yelled, I couldn’t help myself, I was so annoyed and shocked at his first question, I really couldn’t handle how incredibly incompetent this new question was. I said “Give me a break, please lord you have to be kidding me. You are a grown man, with hands, and a brain. You cannot be asking me about the temperature of something you’re standing over. Tell me you’re fucking with me.” He was standing there shocked and a little hurt, I felt bad, but not that bad! All he had to do was ladle the soup into the to go containers, he’d be able to feel the heat through the container. Or he could have tried it. Or he could have done literally anything other than ask me that question. Stick your wingwang in there for all I care! He really didn’t say much, just packed up the soups, and left. Everything is fine, he seems to have chalked it up to ‘she’s sick and in a bad mood’ and has forgotten about it. I did not apologize, nor has he asked nor seemed like he needed one.

16cuja0,AITA for not wanting to take my sister home after my mother's funeral?,"We are three siblings, me (26M), my sister (24F) and my younger sister (21F). My 24 year old sister left home four years ago to travel the world. At first she travelled to Europe with a small savings. In time, she became a minor influencer. She travelled many countries using both her money from influencer work and rich bfs.  
  
My mum (she was 53 years old) was diagnosed with colon cancer 2 years ago. Unfortunately, we were late in the diagnosis and my mum's immune system was not very strong. These two years were very difficult and the biggest thing my mother wanted most during this period was for her daughter to visit her.  
  
My mother was very fond of my sister all her life and at first she did not want her to travel the world. My sister left the country against my mother's wishes and only came to visit us twice during this period and one of them was before cancer. For 2 years after my mother was diagnosed, she always wanted her daughter to visit her and cried every time she spoke to her on the phone.  
  
Me and my family repeatedly spoke to my sister and told her that she needed to visit my mum, but each time she made up some other fucking excuse, always promising to come ""next month"", never keeping any of them. Meanwhile, she was posting fucking stories on Instagram. When she came to visit 1.5 years after the diagnosis, she only stayed for a week. My mum was crying when she left the house.  
  
We lost my mum three days ago. The funeral was the next day and she couldn't even make it to the funeral because she was in Indonesia. She could only come home in the evening. When she came home, I asked her, ""Why the fuck are you here?"" She told me that this was her house. I said, ""You couldn't even make it to the funeral. The woman cried for you the whole time, if you're coming after she's dead, don't come at all, get the fuck out.""  
  
As a result, the fight grew, our relatives at home let her in and my father agreed to let her stay. My father and my cousins say that we are going through a difficult time and that we should be united now, even if she made a mistake. I don't want to be united with that fucker. Everyone says that no matter what, I should forgive her because she is my sister, that I am wrong. I think she should leave the house.

I (23F) have a sister ""Janine"" (26F). Janine is married to her husband (41M) and they have an 18-month-old son together

Since I was a teenager I've always been a private person. I don't do social media, at work I don't talk about my personal life and I only talk about work-related stuff. When I'm with family I don't discuss my work life. 

Because I'm a private person my family has no idea what I do for work, what my salary is and they also have no idea what university I went to or what degree I picked. 

I'm just going to give a tiny bit of context of my family life. When I was 15/16 my mother, a single parent, started getting sick and I became her carer. By the time I was 17, she couldn't do anything other than stay in bed. By the time I was 18, my mother had passed away. I'm not going to lie it was a struggle because I was doing my GCSEs and A-levels and managed to just pass them. I explained my extenuating circumstances to my five choices of universities and all five accepted me. 

Since my nephew was born my sister has become obsessed with taking pictures of her son every single day and is constantly sending them to me. I don't have any insecurities about my body but I just like leading a private life and I haven't taken a picture in five years. 

Every time I come around to see my sister, BIL and nephew, my sister is constantly trying to take pictures of us together and has only managed to successfully take two. Whenever my sister has her phone in her hand or is near her phone I will step away from my nephew as I know she wants to take a picture. 

My sister recently worked out why I do this and she thinks I'm being an asshole because she wants pictures of my nephew and me together so that when he's older he can look back.

She’s gotten cheated on many times, and her previous relationship were unhealthy. I also believe shes in a toxic relationship with her current boyfriend.

My nieces and nephews, along with my other kids are all happily married, some starting their own families. 
 
It was my sisters birthday recently, and she and her husband had planned the trip for the family. She helped with expenses if needed but for the most part everyone payed for themselves.

My daughter was the only one going by herself.

We did things as family, but there were times when we split up to do something with just our partners. So sometimes my daughter was by herself or basically being a third wheel.

At the end of the trip my daughter complained to me how she hated going on the trip. That she felt like it was a cruel joke that she was there by herself, and that the others should not have show affection to their partners when she was around. This is not the first time she complained about something like this, she’s done it after holidays and birthdays as well. 

I’ll admit i’m tired of my daughter complaining about this. So I told her that just because her life isn’t going well doesn’t mean others will stop living theirs.

16eks1y,AITA My husband treats my kids horribly compared to his own.,"Some context here, We’re both 44. When we met he was a single father who had sole custody of two kids. The mother hadn’t been in the picture in years, big time drug user and lost all her kids. I was a single mother with three kids. One of the things (There were many things but this really got me as my kids are the most import thing in my life) that I found appealing was that he was legally raising and loving another man’s child as his own! The first few years together were great, some minor disagreements with parenting, like him calling my 3 and 4yr olds sissies because they needed a night light to sleep. 

Blending families always has learning curves I thought, best to discuss with him and we can iron out a mutual parenting plan. It seemed to work for a few years.

We had all been living as one family for about five years. He proposed, 3 months after our wedding things started to change. Little things at first, comments that weren’t mean just mostly sarcastic Then it turned into yelling if a chore wasn’t done to his exact standards.

Each kid had 1 chore a day. I was not okay with this yelling and bickering that occurred daily, once again we talked but he wasn’t receptive and got very defensive  “You let the kids get away with everything and they have no consequences.” I’m a firm believer in not double punishing kids. So if a chore wasn’t done correctly I would tell to remember next time that this is also part of your chore. For example if one was taking the trash out but didn’t put a new trash bag in the trash can, it’s not defiance it’s a typical kid’s forgetfulness. To clarify all five of the kids had this issue. 

He started harping on the kids more and his kids point blank refused to do their chore. This went on for 2weeks, he didn’t say anything. So I brought it up and his response blew me away. He said “Your kids can do my kid’s chores for awhile seeing as how yours don’t know how to do chores correctly and mykids need a break”  

After that, It was he was yelling at my three for everything and it said it my kid’s fault that his didn’t do their chores. We both worked 40 hours a week, I handled the bulk of the household chores with the kids having small tasks like trash, putting the dishes away, folding clothes, sweeping, feeding the dogs and I rotated the chores every week so each kid didn’t get stuck with the same chore. 

Tired of only me and my kids cleaning up the house we all lived in, I decided to give those that did their chores a reward of extra screen time.

16fevsr,AITA for leaving curtly after my sister got home two hours later than the time she said she would be home and i would be done babysitting,"Me and my fiancé babysat my sister and her friends two kids last night originally they told us they would be home at 10 and around 9 o’clock to turn on a movie and turn off the lights to get the kids ready for bed. around 930 the moms started texting my fiancé’s phone asking if the kids had gone to sleep yet we said no thinking they would be home soon. The mom said turn the lights off and tell them to go nighty night. my fiancé responded to the message saying we thought you would be back at 10. What’s the ETA? My sister responded asking if I was irate to which my fiancé said we both have an early morning in the morning. When the two moms got home They were very not remorseful for being two hours late and then not apologize or say anything about the fact there are two hours late. i went to the kitchen to grab my keys, one Mom asked if the kids went down all right I replied Yep and walked outside. my sister texted me apologizing, and I said we both  (me and my fiancé ) felt very disappointed and taken advantage of. I then said you can Venmo us. My sister, said wow, really.
I tried calling my sister to talk about it and explain how upset I felt and hear her out as to why she was upset. My sister has ignored my calls since yesterday and has gotten my mom in the middle of it telling my mom I stormed off and was rude to her friend.

16gboda,AITA for telling my sister gender reveal parties are tacky and attention seeking,"My sister (25f) has always been a bit of an attention seeker. She would always announce her grades, new jobs, raises, etc. whenever the family was together. It killed me when she used to tell the entire family she got a 100 on her test in a class that we were taking together even though she knew I only got a C- or D+ and they would ask me how I did after her announcement. She was always the golden child and I (26f) was the screwup.

We're both pregnant right now, both of our first kids. She's married with a great job and a house and I'm on my own in a studio right now. A couple weeks ago I got an invitation to her gender reveal barbecue/pool party. I didn't want to deal with her showing off to the entire family in front of me so I told her I won't be coming. She asked why so I told her that I didn't want to deal with her friends and our family. She insisted it would be fun so I told her that gender reveal parties are tacky and I don't want to deal with it. 

She, again, insisted that it would be fun and just to think of it as a barbecue with colored cookies. I snapped at her that I didn't want to go to a stupid party to watch her show off to our family just like she did when we were younger. She hung up on me and now our parents are upset at me for being rude to her.

16h5u91,AITA for using a fake test to expose my “colorblind” brother in front of friends and family?,"So, I (F17) have a brother (M15) who claims he’s colorblind. When he was younger, all his paintings and drawings seemed normal. The whole colorblind claim started after he turned 10, all because of a light pink t-shirt he perceived as white. My parents joked about him being colorblind since my uncle (my dad’s brother) is. He continued this claim, constantly mentioning it to others, which has always annoyed me because I’m sure he’s lying. I’ve told my parents, but they brush me off, saying I’m just jealous of the attention he gets.

Last week was my birthday. I had a gathering at home with about 25-30 people on the weekend. The topic of his supposed colorblindness came up again, with everyone asking him to identify colors. I, feeling frustrated, asked him to take an Ishihara test on the TV. He agreed after some hesitation. I went up to my room to grab my computer to plug to the TV. But instead of a genuine test, I used a fake Ishihara test, one that anyone could pass. He pretended not to see some numbers, and once the test concluded, I revealed to everyone that it was a fake test, aiming to show he was lying.

The mood turned sour. My brother and parents were furious. My family tried to brush it off, making jokes, and my friends found it amusing. Post-party, my parents were livid, they labeled me as an “attention seeker” and a jealous asshole and grounded me for embarrassing my brother.

16h5wz8,UPDATE: AITA for refusing to let my parents put a tracker on my (28F) phone?,"Hi everyone! Quick update for anyone who is interested.

Recap: 
My parents wanted to put a tracker on my (28F) phone ""for my safety"". I said no and was called a stupid bitch. Drama ensued. Original post [here](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/GiPGFE6Yfh).

Update: 
Things were very frosty the next couple of days. My Mum eventually came to me and said that she was going to address the ""elephant in the room"". She said that she was very disappointed in me but, as I didn't care about her, she will just have to live without it (the tracker on my phone). I think she expected me to cave at that point but I didn't. I said ""thank you for understanding"" and that was it. The car keys were returned to the drawer and nothing more was said about it from anyone (including my Dad). To this day, I have no idea why the 180 degree flip happened. 

Although you all helped me realise that I have an unhealthy codependant relationship with my parents, I think it will just take time to set boundaries and learn how to be my own person. I still love them a lot and I know they love me too (even though we aren't the type of family that says so).

Which leads me to my other news...I got the job in London! I have officially moved out and am living there now. It still feels surreal. I know it is going to take some time to get used to living independently but I am ready to be my own person and learn how to do things on my own. Honestly, I had given up hope that this day would ever come. I feel so much happier and can genuinely say I am proud of myself. If anyone has any tips for living away from home for the first time, please let me know! 

Finally, thank you for all your support and giving me the push I needed. I was in a very dark place and now feel like I can start living my life. Thank you.

Small Edit: People are asking about the car / asking me to check it for trackers. To clarify, I didn't bring the car with me so can't check it.

16h6lbq,AITA for telling my sister it's her own fault our family doesn't help her with her kids?,"I (f21) have a sister Chloe (f32). Chloe has three kids, f8, f6 and m1. She and her husband both work and the youngest goes to daycare. Ever since the youngest has been born, my sister has had a bit of a personality shift. Getting more into organic food and ""holistic living"" as she calls it.

Chloe and her husband started leaving the kids with our parents for the whole weekend, every weekend, so that they can get a break. My parents are doting grandparents and seemed to enjoy it but around a month ago they refused to do it anymore, their reason being that they are too tired to keep up with the kids.

They then started leaving the kids with my other sister Avery (f27) every weekend. This had a similar ending.

After Avery started refusing, Chloe asked me if I could babysit the kids on the weekends. I stupidly told her yes. I only babysat for 3 Saturdays and had to call it quits because Chloe was driving me nuts.

First of all, she has a very very long list of rules for the kids while they're babysat. Some aren't so difficult to follow, like organic foods only (which is only what Chloe has in her house anyway), but others just feel silly, like no holding the baby for 'too long' and no shows or movies from Disney. There are more but this sub has a character limit.

When I was babysitting, Chloe would be calling me every 30 minutes, and she gets angry if I don't answer straight away. Every time Chloe came home, she would berate me over something, anything. Not answering the phone quick enough, letting the baby nap too long, etc.

When I told Chloe I'd no longer babysit, she got upset and said no one ever wants to help her anymore and her village is disappearing. I couldn't really pretend and I told Chloe it's her own fault, and people would be more willing to help her if she wasn't a helicopter parent. She blew up at me and said she's demanding basic respect.",Flaky-East-7161,5747,0.9700000286102296,431,1694560871,2023-09-12 18:21:11,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16h6lbq/aita_for_telling_my_sister_its_her_own_fault_our/,9,2023
16i10qu,AITA for turning around and going back to my parents with my baby when I got home because my husband let his homeless brother move in and everyone had lice.,"I recently went to see my parents with my newborn. It was just for the long weekend so my husband stayed home with our three older children. 7/5/3. 

My husband called me when I was out of town to let me know his brother needed a place to crash. I said that he should give him a ride to a shelter or something because it was a bad idea to let his brother in our home. He has stolen from us before. 

When I got home there were five very itchy people in the house. I immediately got back in my car and went to my parents house. My husband was calling me the whole time because he needed help dealing with the lice. I didn't call him back until the baby was settled back in at my folk's place. 

I told him the pharmacy had the shampoo and comb for lice. He said he needed me to come home and take care of it.  I noped. I said that he let his brother in our home against my wishes. His brother gave them all lice. I also reminded him that when our oldest got lice from kindergarten he didn't help me at all. 

I hate lice. They freak me out. I dealt with it because I had to.  This time it's on him. He said that he would have to use up his sick days to take care of this. I said tough shit. 

He did it. He took his brother to a shelter, he deloused himself and the kids, and then he spent three days cleaning all the bedding and the furniture. He called me every day begging for help. I did not come home until his mothe confirmed that everything was done. 

He is pissed that I stuck him with all that by himself. I know I should have helped but it was too much.  I'm still not 100% from the baby.

16i1t09,AITA for defending my parents choice to take money for my sisters surgery out of her college fund?,"
I(17f) am a freshman in college, as is my sister Leah(18f). 

Our parents weren’t the best off growing up, but they always set aside money for us to go to college. 

Leah played soccer, and before her freshman year of high school our parents sat her down and told her that if she played, she needed to be careful because if she got hurt all the money to pay for it would come out of her college fund. Several schools in the league our high school is in are pretty good with a reputation for playing rough, and she isn’t the biggest person, so she knew there were risks involved. 

In our sophomore year she had a pretty bad non contact injury that ended up needing surgery and several months of physical therapy. All this money came out of what would be contributed to her fund, and I don’t know an exact number but all the appointments and stuff were at least several thousand. 

Now we’re both going to similarly priced schools, and she will need more loans than I do. In a group chat we’re both in I made a joke about how expensive college is and she responded “now imagine paying thousands more because your parents don’t want to pay for your medical bills”. 

I privately messaged her and told her I didn’t think she should be sharing personal stuff like that and that she knew the risks of soccer and chose to play anyway. She said that she was free to share something that really upset her and that I needed to stick up for her against our parents(she’s argued about this many times). She said that they paid for my medical bills so they should for hers and that I was a “shitty sister” and is asking for me to tell our parents they should’ve paid. I don’t think I should have to, they clearly outlined what they would and wouldn’t pay for and the risks she chose to take aren’t my problem.

We have invited his dad to visit us in Washington, and while during the week that he stayed with us he managed to throw a huge temper tantrum because he demanded that we apply for a Greencard for him right away. We agreed, but told him we needed to find out more about the process and how he will support his family of 5. He has 3 young kids 17, 13, 11.  He was not satisfied with that and yelled at us about how we are betraying the family and not moving him to the US.

He is a wealthy business owner in Belarus and Russia, and when we asked for him to bring the family for a vacation to the states, he refused. My only condition was to meet the family and talk about moving to the US and all the financial decision involved. He has refused to come and visit us. 

He is now living part time in Italy and part time in Russia and constantly berates my husband and I about how we are betraying him. This is causing me so much stress and anger that I can't sleep for nights at a time.

16ixm2q,AITA for not making an effort to increase my child support payments after coming into some money.,"I got divorced five years ago and I lost a lot. My ex got the apartment and out car. I was okay with it because she had our children and I wanted everything to be as stable as possible for them. I ended up moving in with my grandmother to make ends meet. 

My ex and I were doing a decent job of being co-parents I think. I spent a lot of time with my kids and I have never missed a child support payment. 

My grandmother became I'll during COVID and I was basically her caregiver. She made it through but it knocked her on her ass. She passed away about two months ago. 

I am an only child but my parents are both irresponsible which is why they couldn't help me out when I needed somewhere to live. 

My grandmother made me her main beneficiary when she passed away. All that she said was to take care of my kids. 

I sold her house after I gave everyone their bequests. I took the money and the rest of the estate and I bought myself a house and a car. Her house was old and not in a great neighborhood for kids. I also put money into my children's education fund. 

When my ex found out what I did she got upset. She said that I owed her more child support now. I checked with my lawyer before I did anything. Money from an inheritance, the sale a house, or a lottery win does not count as income. If I had invested the money instead then the interest would count as income. 

She thinks I intentionally screwed her over. I think I now have a good reliable car for work and a nice, small house in a good neighborhood for when I have the kids with me.

Now I’m too old to be on my parents insurance and while my company’s insurance is considered very good, getting a new leg or getting adjustments for body weight changes are still expensive. I expect to be paying a fortune if I get pregnant. So I try my best to stay the same weight and if I gain some weight I can immediately feel it becoming less comfortable to walk in.


Anyway a friend’s gf and I were talking and she began remarking on how I’m not eating much. We were out to dinner and I just was having a soup and salad and everyone else was having baby back ribs. I’d stolen a few of my bf’s plate but generally I was trying to eat light.

I was pissed and she sounded super condescending and blurted out she had no business talking down to me about my weight even if it was to tell me not to change it. The other people overheard and the gf got really embarrassed and left with my friend soon after.

16jskv9,AITA For Kicking A Girl Out My Wedding For Wearing Purple?,"(English is not my first language so sorry for any grammatical/spelling errors)

I(48F) and my husband(50M) got married 2 moths ago. We both have been married before, me widowed and him him divorced, so we wanted out wedding to be fun and relaxed with all out friends and family there to celebrate the start to a new chapter of our lives. We both had decided to wear purple at our wedding so when we sent out our invitations we asked that all guest attending not wear purple. This color has significant meaning to the both of us as it was the favorite color of my husband's daughter who unfortunately died of cancer a year ago. She was able to be there when we got engaged but couldn't here who to see us get married. My husband and her were very close as her mother (husbands ex wife) was barely in her life. In the 3 years I knew her, we had become close and I truly felt like she was my own daughter (I don't have any children). When she died, my husband and I were devastated. To honor her we chose to wear purple so we could feel like she was there with us.

Now on to when it started. We asked all guests who wanted to be in early pictures to show up an hour before the ceremony, so you can imagine my surprise while in the middle of taking pictures I see a woman get out a car wearing a floor length, solid purple dress. My husband and I noticed at the same time and we were both horrified. Shortly other caught wind of what was happening so my mom, my sisters, and my MIL when over and told her she had to leave. I didn't hear exactly what was said but there was lots of yelling before she got back into her car and drove off. at that time others were starting to show up for the ceremony and caught the end of the encounter and were all asking questions of what happened. We later found out that she the plus one of my husband's cousin but he ended up getting sick and just told her she could go by herself so since no one really knew her we all thought the issue was dropped. The rest of the night was beautiful and everything I could have ever imagined and naturally I forgot about what happened.

About a week ago, one of my friends who was at the wedding and saw the encounter, sent a Facebook post made by her the day after my wedding. She basically talked about how we were disrespectful and rude for kicking her out the way we did. Saying we had completely embarrassed her and made a fool out of her. She called us all sorts of names saying that I was just jealous and insecure because she was prettier than me and how it's ""just a color and we can't own it"". I was horrified. I started crying out of frustration reading it then started to feel guilty, thinking that maybe she was right. I told my husband and he was furious and immediately called his cousin to tell her to take down the post but to no avail.

16jsx4z,AITA for telling my sister her daughter's eating habits are out of control and need addressing?,"I am 30F. I'm raising my two kids, 7F and 4M. I have a younger sister, Megan, 28F. Megan has a daughter, Ava, 5F.

My daughter Ruby turned 7 last week and she wanted a laser tag party. I planned her a birthday party at our nearest laser tag centre, and I allowed Ruby to invite two friends from school. It includes a few games of laser tag and a pizza dinner afterwards for the kids.

Both of Ruby's friends are vegetarians but luckily the laser tag place has plain cheese pizza that they can have.

I invited a few family members as well, including Megan and her daughter. Megan declined, her reasoning being that Ava will not eat pizza and she'll feel left out.

For context

Ava has been a picky eater for a while. Whether this is due to neurodivergence or not, my guess is as good as anyone's because my sister has never taken her to a pediatrician about this (we live in a country with free healthcare, cost is not the issue). Megan just caves and plays restaurant with her all the time and never has her try anything new.

According to Megan, the only things Ava will eat are chicken nuggets, plain cheese sandwiches, mashed potatoes and waffles. Megan just acts like this is not unusual or a problem at all, and says Ava will grow out of it eventually.

The problem started because Megan suggested that we change plans and after the laser tag games, we take all the kids to McDonald's. I told Megan about two of the kids at the party being vegetarians and that she's more than welcome to bring her own food to the party for Ava.

Megan kept trying to persuade me and said Ruby's friends can bring their own food instead. I told her to stop because I'm not changing the plans, she can either come or not, at this point I was getting annoyed. Megan snapped at me and said the girls are choosing to be vegetarians, her daughter isn't choosing to be a picky eater, and I should prioritise my niece. I said it's not about priorities, I'm just not changing plans that are already made and booked. I told Megan she needs to address her daughter's eating habits because they are blatantly out of control.

My sister said there was no need for me to be rude and that I have no right to comment on her parenting, Ava isn't my child and I have no say. She said if I have a problem with that, I can go screw myself.

Megan ended up not going to the party and my parents are intervening and saying that they understand why I said what I said, but it's still not my business and I should've just left it at ""I'm not changing the plans"" and I should apologize to Megan for the comment.

I go on vacation multiple times a year and unfortunately, my husband and the kids could never travel with me outside the US. The kids need a letter of permission to travel abroad, which was hard for us to get since his ex never answered his emails.  


  
My family and I have been planning a trip to Paris and Kyoto to visit my maternal grandmother and paternal grandparents for Christmas and New Year. My entire family is going on this trip, my parents, in-laws, siblings, cousins, nieces, and nephews. We’ve been planning this trip for over 2 years and we finally bought our plane tickets after my son was born eight weeks ago. My husband’s ex has also signed the letter of permission, so everything is already in order for the trip.   


  
Last weekend my husband’s ex sent him an email regarding our trip. She basically asked if we could cancel our trip, so the kids could spend Christmas with their great-grandmother. Their great-grandmother is supposedly ill and they’re not sure if she’s going to be here next year.  
My husband immediately wanted to reject that idea, but I asked him to think about it.  


  
I think it might be good for the kids to stay behind with their grandma. They’ll get to see their great-grandma for maybe for the last and they’ll also see their mom. I know the kids are very excited to travel abroad, but do think this is more important than Paris or Kyoto. Both are just cities they won’t go anywhere and we can visit in summer. I told my husband all of this and he argued that we’d probably not get the money back we already spend. I told him that we bought business-class plane tickets and I know we’ll get that back.   


  
My husband just got angry and told me that we’re not going to discuss it anymore. My parents and siblings are on his side, but I feel like they’re only looking at the money. When I was a kid my parents also left my siblings and me in Kyoto with my grandparents to go on a trip. At the time I was also angry about it, but as an adult am very happy that I got to spend that time with my grandparents.   


  
I think this is also the case for the kids. They probably won’t be happy about it now, but will really appreciate it when they’re older. My husband disagreed with this and told me I was not looking at the kids’ situation and was angry when I again suggested canceling their trip.

16lem3c,AITA for making my daughter share a room with her son?,"I am father of 5 biological children and 1 adopted nephew. My 3 oldest children are adults in their 20's and have previously moved out. My youngest 2 are teenagers aged 16 and 14, and my nephew is 8. My in-laws also live with us. We have a 6-bedroom house so each of the kids have a bedroom, my wife and I have a bedroom, my in-laws have a bedroom, and we previously had a spare bedroom for my older children to stay in when they visit.

My oldest daughter moved to my home country at 18 to attend university there. She met and later married her husband, and they have an almost 4-year-old son together. Things went south in their relationship a few months ago. My daughter moved out with their son, and she was able to stay with my brother for the last few months. 

A couple weeks ago she was able to leave the country to move back home with us. My 16-year-old daughter moved into the spare bedroom so we could turn her bedroom (that is bigger and has its own bathroom) into a room for my daughter and grandson to share. 

The whole family pitched in to decorate to my daughter's taste and to create a nice area for her son with a small loft bed. 

When she came, she was initially grateful, but she did express not being too fond of sharing a room with her son. 

Last week she suggested that my nephew and grandson could share a room instead. I told her if she was staying in my home it would have to be in a shared room with her son. She mentioned it a few more times so I asked my nephew if he would like to share his room. His answer was that he didn't really want to, but said some nights grandson could have a sleepover in his room.

Last time my daughter brought up the boys sharing a room I was a little harsh with my tone and my wife thinks I was being an ass. My wife isn't completely on my side. She thinks I'm not being nice to our daughter who is going through a tough time right now and might need some space/privacy to adjust to her whole life/future changing. She doesn't see why the boys can't share as there's only a small age gap and our nephew would probably get used to sharing with his little cousin.

16lfqhr,AITA for refusing to let my step-sister come to a father-daughter trip I'm having with my dad? (and some other family members),"My(15F) parents divorced when I was 3, my dad quickly remarried after that to my now step-mother, no kids between them, tho my Step-mom (whom I'll call ''Dora'') has a 16 y/o daughter (Sam) who quickly bonded with my dad because her bio dad has never been in the picture, he loves her and treats her as his own, but we're not close and we don't really like each other so anyway. She also lives primarily with my dad while I spend friday night to monday morning at his house and around 3-5 weeks during school break.

Now my paternal family is really outdoorsie, we like to do a bunch of things around that Sam is included and we just ignore each other during them while enjoying our time with others, however, my dad, grandad, aunt and I have a special treasure hunt we do around Christmas that it's really special to me. It's like the only real time I have with my dad because, while Sam is not as bitchy as some I've read here, she really likes to demand both my grandad and dad's attention and since they consider me ''tomboy-ish'' they kinda ignore me to coddle her which sucks.

My dad asked me around my 10th  birthday if he could invite Sam and I said no. I've been saying no ever since and while he doesn't like it, he respects it, he does other stuff with her without me and I don't complain. This year, however, Sam is very adamant on going and I just don't want to, my dad is pressuring me to let her come as well as Dora,  while my aunt and grandma are insisting he just leaves this thing untouched between us but my dad doesn't want to hurt ''his little girl's feelings''. 

NGL, that stung o I said that if he really wants her there, then he doesn't have to pick me up for Christmas this year and to just leave me be. I called my mom to pick me up and my dad tried to console me and apologize because I was crying but I just asked him to leave me alone and got to the porch to wait. Sam and Dora insist that I'm and AH and I'm acting selfish but the way I see it it's not like that, this is the only real thing I have with my dad, I have to do everything else with him and Sam or else I get a nasty look. I get that dad loves her, I don't care, but why do I have to share the only thing I have?

So this whole saga has been resolved. I hadn't been to the volunteer session since the whole incident happened and I was mostly over it. I contacted a few other classmates and they basically told me that the guy I had the issue with did the same thing to all of them, the only difference was that I actually ran into the guy in person so that's what made it super awkward.

I emailed the event coordinator earlier today because I was interested in volunteering this weekend and next weekend and I wanted to make sure that guy wasn't already on the schedule.

Turns out he was there last weekend and he had an absolute meltdown against one of the other volunteers. I don't have any specifics but apparently it was bad. They told him to leave the premises and he isn't allowed back. One of my new friends from the bar incident saw it happen and the guy just lost his mind without any provocation. I'll get more details this weekend.

So I guess the issue is resolved. I am still extremely confused, but I am just going to move on.

Edit: So I called the organizer this morning to see if I could find out what happened. I was afraid they weren't going to tell me because of confidentiality or something but they told me I would find out no matter what so they may as well just tell me.

Apparently last weekend one of the other volunteers was talking to him and he told them he wasn't interested in talking and the volunteer called him rude. So that didn't sit well with him and a few minutes after he just starting screaming at them. He started yelling ""am I being fucking rude!"" over and over until he was told to leave and not come back.

I'm leaning on him having some sort of mental issues but I'm not an expert so who knows. He probably needs help from someone qualified.

16qh017,AITA for 'belittling' my sister and saying she shouldn't demand her husband help with their baby at night?,"My husband and I (29M, 27M) went through the surrogacy process and had our son 4 months ago. We were thrilled when my sister (31F)  announced her pregnancy and we found out we would be having children very near the same time. Our niece was born a little over two months after our son.  
  
My situation and my sister's closely mirror each other. Our husbands both work typical 9 to 5s with 30 - 45 minute commutes. My sister is a SAHM and I do freelance work from home.   
  
For the first two weeks after our son was born (the first of which my husband took off of work), we would both take partial night shifts. Once I felt like I had at least some of my bearings on parenthood, I offered to take over completely on week nights, while he does mornings before work + weekends. It's a collaborative process and that breakdown of parenting just made sense to me. My husband was the one leaving our home to work every day, he was the one who had to be up by a specific time and make a drive.  
  
At 4 months, we no longer have this obstacle anymore (and to be honest, I kind of miss the sweet, quiet bonding time those extra night feeds provided now that he's settled onto a nice sleep schedule and usually only wakes up once.) Still, I think we got it down to almost the perfect science before we exited the newborn stage. My sister, on the other hand, is very much still in that phase and struggling.  
  
This has been a recurring problem for her from the beginning. She has been coming to me saying she's scared she's going to fall asleep holding the baby, that her husband won't help her with the night feeds, etc. I tried to give her tips since I've been through it. I suggested she let her partner take over in the evenings (\~6 to 9pm) so she can go to bed early and catch a few more hours, nap when baby naps, etc.. She shot down everything saying ' that wouldn't work for them' and that she just needed her partner to do some of the night feedings.   
  
I reminded her that her husband is the one commuting in the mornings and falling asleep while driving was a very real possibility, and that I had lived through it and so could she. I then offered to watch her daughter for a few days so she could catch up on sleep. She took major offense to both of these things. She said I was belittling her experience and acting like I was a better parent. She said I couldn't truly empathize with her or give her valuable tips since she had been pregnant and I hadn't, and that me offering to watch my niece just felt like me saying she needed help raising her own daughter.  
  
My intentions were definitely not malicious and I'd like some outside perspective here. AITA?

16qj1fi,AITA for saying that my cats health is more important to me than my 4 year old nephew?,"I promised my sister to look after my 4 year old nephew Alex while she goes out for a dinner. Anyway, I woke up that morning and noticed that my cat cheese wasn’t feeling well. He was refusing to eat or drink and being overall very lethargic, after a few hours of him not getting better, I decided to take him to the emergency vet so I immediately called my sister and told her that cheese isn’t doing well and I was gonna be taking him to the vet and that I’m very sorry but I won’t be able to look after Alex. 

She lost her marbles. She didn’t even ask what’s wrong with cheese, she instantly started blaming me for ruining her night and claiming that it’s prob nothing serious and saying that it ridiculous that I care more about a cat than my nephew… I told her that that wasn’t true but I wasn’t gonna leave cheese to suffer all day till the next morning, after going back and forth I told her that yes I do care about my cats health more than my nephew. My cat was a life of death situation, my sister could’ve called a baby sister or asked someone else to take over but my cat could’ve potentially died. 

I love cheese, it’s just me and him at my apartment so he’s a huge part of my life and not just a pet that can be replaced so I truly don’t think I did anything wrong.

My mum called a few days later and told me that I should apologize for saying I care more about cheese than my nephew but I refuse to do so unless I get an apology about how she talked about my cat.

16rb5mt,AITA for insinuating a woman was fat?,"I (35F) am currently 8 months pregnant. Something I've learned (fun news for anyone aspiring to follow down that same path) is that a LOT of people, mostly older women, feel that if you get pregnant they suddenly have the right to both comment and touch your body without permission. Sometimes/often without warning- even total strangers. I'm an intrinsically private person and while I don't take offense, it does encourage the inner snark to come out. 

I started showing around 5/6 months. I have two fibroids that are each quite large, think softball size. This causes me to look bigger and further along than I am. I've also not really gained elsewise (yes I'm aware it's a good problem to have, but I do look disproportionate) so it's REALLY apparent even under hoodies. Fast forward to last weekend.

I was in our local grocery store and an older, larger woman walks up to me and says something akin to ""aw hunny, congrats! How far along are you?"". Kindly, sure, so I smile, step out of touching distance (this is usually when they go for a belly feel) and say ""8 months"". She looked at me with a shocked expression and exclaims ""Oh hun NO I would have guessed any day now! YOU'RE HUGE!!""

So... I smiled sweetly back at her and said ""aw thanks, you too"". 

You can imagine it didn't go over well. At one point she said something about it being medical, and so my one interjection was ""hey me too""- but it didn't do much to diffuse the situation. Eventually she huffed away and I carried on my business.

I don't really feel bad, but I am trying to gauge the assholiness of my response. I strongly feel that there shouldn't be a stigma that pregnant women suddenly become public property, but acknowledge I could have once again been the 'bigger person'. Or responded with ""yeah I have two tumors in there with her"" which has historically gotten a sputtering apology from people too. (Fibroids are benign tumors so this is technically true, just aimed at making people uncomfortable).",Silver-Butterfly-767,9799,0.8999999761581421,2289,1695595268,2023-09-24 17:41:08,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rb5mt/aita_for_insinuating_a_woman_was_fat/,9,2023
16rcome,AITA for not wanting a memorial for my half sister and wanting my sisters boyfriend at a different table for my wedding?,"Throwaway. 26 F am getting married in December. Some of you may read the title and think I’m horrible so I need to give a lot of backstory. 

My parents are divorced. My dad (who is putting about 15,000 toward the wedding) has a second wife and lives in a different state. He has 2 kids with her. His daughter (7) was born sick and I wanna make this as anonymous as possible so that’s all I’ll say about the illness. My dad told us she was probably not going to live very long. She died last November (2022). My dad and his wife want a special memorial table dedicated only to her next to where we planned to set up other pictures. I politely said no and my bf agrees with me. Maybe I’d feel different if I was closer to her but I really only met her maybe a dozen times. I haven’t seen her since Christmas of 2021 which was the last time I visited my dads state. I feel like it will bum people out, and my bfs family doesn’t know she is and neither do alot of friends. I don’t have anything against her I just never really knew her. They’re pushing this because the wedding is near the one year anniversary of her death. 

Second issue. My sister (24) has a long dating history and always insists on bringing the guy to every family thing almost immediately. There’s probably a run of 6 Christmas photos in a row where there’s a different guy there with her. She has been with this guy now since July. We had the seating set before she started dating him. I don’t even want to invite him but caved on that for my sister. She is at the head table and I don’t want to try to squeeze someone else in, or kick someone out so he is sitting at a table with a few of her friends. Sister is very upset because she wants him sitting next to her. But I barely know the guy I don’t want to change seating so he could be at the table. I also told her I would be offended if she wanted to sit with him over me. Also it’s not like people are going to be sitting besides dinner so she will have plenty of time with him.

16s5q4a,AITA for lying to my son about the reason our cat wasn't there anymore?,"I (52F) have a son who I will call Asher (18M), and a couple years ago we had a cat named Luna who was our family's pet for 19 years. Around 2 years ago, my husband passed away in his sleep from a heart attack related to complications from his Diabetes.  
  
After my husband's death, Asher went off the rails. Accused me of trying to get rid of my husband. Accused me of cheating. Accusing me of wanting to get rid of our cat. Even threatened to get rid of my late mother's ashes. He ended up having to get hospitalized where the doctors told me he had schizophrenia, and I was advised to rehome our cat by several family members. So I contacted a close family friend and asked her if she was willing to take in the cat, which she took in the cat while my son was in the hospital.  
  
When my son got home, I told him that Luna had gotten very sick and stopped eating while he was gone, and the vet decided she had to be put down. It took him a while, but eventually he accepted it as the truth and mourned the loss of his cat. I felt so bad lying to him like that, but I was worried if he knew the cat was still around, he would have a worse outcome.  
  
Recently, while at a family dinner, one of my nieces told him that Luna was still alive and told him where she was at. Asher ended up confirming that what happened was the truth, and went off on me. Yelled at me for lying to me, for daring to get rid of Luna. I told him I didn't feel like she was safe here and that multiple family members advised me to rehome her. He wasn't having it, and has since stayed shut in his room for a week. He only begrudgingly comes out for dinner, where he yells at me and calls me a terrible mother, and drags his food back to his room.

She decided she wanted one anyways and that she would just keep this a secret for him. A week after her bachelorette party one of the bridesmaids ex boyfriend logged into her messenger and took one of the videos we had sent of that night and sent it to the brides fiance.

16t3981,AITA for asking my MIL to stop telling people I’m English?,"I (29f) recently moved to the US with my girlfriend Emma (27f). We met 3 years ago when she moved to the UK to get a professional qualification that took 2 years, then she worked in the UK for a year before we both moved to the US together. I had never met her parents in person before moving here, but I had met her older sister Jane (29f) and I know that they both had spoken to their parents about me. 

I’m Scottish, have lived there for my whole life, as have my parents, grandparents, great grandparents etc. what I’m saying is my family are on record here since the Scottish census began in 1801, and know my family line goes back several hundred years before that. It doesn’t really come up other than when Americans tell me they’re Scottish, which doesn’t normally bother me. Yet when we were at Emma’s parents’ last weekend for a family gathering members of the extended family kept coming up to me and telling me how happy they were that Emma is back from England and how they thought it was interesting I’m English which was confusing because Emma studied not far from my village in Scotland, and I’m not English. I politely corrected them and they all looked confused but changed the subject. After the 10th person — that’s not an exaggeration— I talked to Emma about it and she was just as confused as I was.

About an hour later and after several more instances I was in the kitchen with Emma when her mum (54f) came storming in and asked what I’d been telling people, I was confused bc I had talked to lots of people about lots of things. Then when she clarified I told her that I’ve been telling them I’m not English bc I’m not, and that Emma studied in Scotland bc she did. She went off saying how England is just what they call the UK and it’s the same. I told her that it’s not the same. She said I was letting politics get in the way. I told her that regardless of politics it’s still not the same bc England and Scotland are 2 separate countries and I want her to stop telling people I’m English, and to say Scottish or British instead. Emma agreed with me and we told her that we know she didn’t mean offence, but it is confusing and a tiny bit offensive. Bizarrely, she then said that she was referring to the continent and accused me of trying to make her seem stupid when I pointed out that would make me European. She talked to neither of us the rest of the night, neither Jane when she agreed with us.

Somehow since then it’s ended up being Emma, Jane and I vs their parents and everyone else since then and I kind of regret saying anything.

16uvx4g,AITA for not wanting to sleep in the same bed as my girlfriend's body pillow?,"I (25m) have a girlfriend (26f) who's autistic. Normally I wouldn't bring this up, but it is relevant to this story. She's pretty high functioning, but the main way her autism effects her is a really strong special interest in one specific fictional character. I've never had an issue with this, and I try to keep up with whatever's going on in the fandom for her and listen to her infodumping about her favorite character on a regular basis. 

About a year ago, my girlfriend got a body pillow of her favorite character. I didn't really have an issue with it, as we have a very large bed with more than enough room for something like a body pillow. The body pillow wasn't even that weird as far as body pillows go, it's just her favorite character wearing her normal outfit on one side and a simple dress on the other. Definitely not weird compared to other kinds of body pillows out there. 

Recently, my girlfriend told me she's getting more covers and another pillow inner so she can have two body pillows to sleep with at once. I was more apprehensive about this, as our bed is big, but two five feet long pillows plus two people feels like it would be pushing it. She assured me that if it was really an issue, she could go back to only sleeping with one, or alternatively lay one of them Lincoln style and use it as a regular pillow, so I agreed to it once again. 

The real issue arouse when the pillow covers actually arrived yesterday. She did get another cover of her favorite character, as I'd expected, but what I hadn't was that she'd also gotten a cover featuring her favorite character's DAD. I'd always known she had a little crush on him but I never thought it would go THAT far. Worse, this pillow isn't just him in a normal outfit like her original one. One of the sides full on has his dick and balls out for the world to see. 

I told my girlfriend that I'm putting my foot down, and I refuse to sleep in a bed with another man, even if that man is a pillow. She said that that's ridiculous, it's not like he's real, and one of the sides is SFW so if I'm really uncomfortable she can just keep it flipped to that side. 

I said that I still don't feel comfortable with that. I know I wouldn't be able to forget the uncomfortably detailed dick lying in wait on the other side of the pillow, especially if I have to sleep right next to it. She said she can put the pillow with her favorite character (who's female) between us, and keep the dad pillow firmly on her side of the bed, but I said I just don't want him in my bed at all. 

She's pretty pissed about it. Her body pillows are pretty expensive, since she has to get the art custom drawn and then custom printed, and it's not something you can return. The dad character really doesn't have any superfans other than her, so it's not like there's some other girl she can possibly try to sell him to either. I know she's been saving for this pillow a long time, so I do feel guilty saying she can't cuddle with it. AITA?

16vq3ap,AITA for telling my wife I don't care if she likes beards?,My wife and I have been married for going on 10 years. We met in our mid-20s and are now in our mid 30s. When my wife and I met my facial hair admittedly was patchy. But as the years have passed and I have aged my facial hair is now full and supple. I have always wanted to grow a nice long beard like the masculine men I saw growing up. I always admired it. Throughout my relationship with my wife I have normally kept just scruff on my face. But I have also told my wife about my desire to grow out my beard. Her reaction is always to tell me who that's gross or you need to shave you look disgusting. This is now happened enough times that I finally blew up and said babe I I don't give a f*** if you like beards or not!

16vqlbg,AITA for taking my teen daughter side over my girlfriend,"I'm a 48-year-old man, separated from my 40-year-old wife for the past eight months. We were together for 18 years and have four daughters aged 17, 14, 5, and 4. Despite our separation, my wife and I remain on amicable terms. She resides in our marital home, while I'm currently living in our rental property.  
  
Approximately four months ago, I rekindled a relationship with a former college girlfriend who's 47. We were together for five years back in the day, but parted ways because she wasn’t ready to settle and have kids. She now has a 13-year-old daughter.  
  
A notable issue has arisen between my eldest daughter, who's turning 18 soon, and my girlfriend. My daughter is assertive, outspoken, and holds strong to her principles. She's very bonded with her mother. On the other hand, my girlfriend is quite strict with her own child. She sets clear boundaries, including computer usage limits, basic phones, no TV during school days, and has various disciplinary measures. In contrast, my wife and I have been much more relaxed parents. Our kids have more freedom with their devices, social activities, and we're more lenient when it comes to discipline.  
  
Last night, a situation escalated. My daughters, girlfriend, and her child gathered at my place after school. The plan was for the kids to finish homework, have dinner, and then for us to have a family game night. However, my oldest was engrossed in Instagram and YouTube, which led my girlfriend’s daughter to request similar screen time.   
  
When my girlfriend suggested my eldest put away her laptop to join the game, my daughter declined. My girlfriend insisted, emphasizing the importance of family time. My daughter firmly reiterated her decision to abstain. As I entered the scene, my girlfriend, in front of everyone, said I should intervene. My daughter, clearly frustrated, asserted that my girlfriend isn't her mother and left the room.  
  
I communicated to my girlfriend that while my daughter’s tone could've been better, I’ve never imposed strict family time, and she was preoccupied. Upset, my girlfriend promptly left with her daughter. She later texted me, expressing her belief that I'm permitting my daughter's purported disrespect and criticized our parenting approach.

16vqp7v,AITA for making a Tiktok that somewhat exposed my influencer parents?,"I'm (16m) banished to my aunt's house right now and while she agrees with me that I'm not an asshole for having these feelings, she says she agrees with my parents that i was an asshole for the TikTok that I made about our real lives. Without saying too much, my parents had me while they were in college and i lived with my grandparents until they graduated and got married. I have three younger siblings and we all live in a large city together. My dad has a real job and my mom basically just writes a blog and has social media accounts. She NEVER mentions me. I'm never in pictures. My siblings are because they were written about from the time my mom was pregnant with them, after they got married. She writes a lot about our ""lifestyle"" and brags about how thrifty she is and simple but she doesn't tell people that my grandparents give us money and that she blows it on really expensive things like buckets and sweaters. Trust me when I say that NONE of what you see online about my family is true except for where we live and our names. Anyway, I vented a little bit to my friend about how my parents go back and forth on pretending to be poor but then not and then back again, depending on who they talk to. And i said that sometimes that meant that my mom buys something expensive and stupid to brag about but then I have to hear about eating less or being ""more simple"" about birthday wishlists because life is too expensive. So we made a Tiktok at my house. I pointed out stuff like ""here's my mom's ONE sweater that cost $400 and that's why i got this for Christmas"" and pointed to a kid's art set. I pointed out some stuff that she told her readers she was gifted that she actually bought, too. My Tiktok doesn't get much attention at all but one of my friend's showed it to her mom and her mom showed my mom. My parents are mad and say that doing stuff like this hurts the whole family because it could affect sponsorships and maybe book deals and Dad said i was an asshole for doing the video. So, am I?

16wk6vv,AITA for refusing to give up my airplane seat to a tall person?,"Hey everyone! Bit of a weird situation and I’m not sure if I am TA or not. Happy to have my perspective challenged.

Last week I was taking a 12 hour flight that I had booked months in advance. At the time of booking I paid extra to choose my seats. The seat I chose was $55 extra and right at the front of the plane (trying to arrive somewhere on time upon landing). The seat also happened to be an extra legroom seat and I am a 4’11 female.

I check in, board, sit in my seat as usual, but as soon as the seatbelt sign was switched off I had a man come over and ask to change seats. The first time he asked politely saying that he is 6’4 and flying is painful for him can we please change seats. I was open to it until I saw that his seat was way in the back of the plane and so I told him no sorry I paid extra to sit up front. He kind of got increasingly mad and wouldn’t leave saying that there’s no reason someone of my height needs extra legroom (I told him I paid to be upfront). I suggested that he ask the other people in those seats if they could swap but he refused saying that he wouldn’t want to bother other men or split up couples. He kept getting rude and angry so I just called over a flight attendant who told him to go sit down. For the rest of the flight he would walk past for no reason slamming into me (I was sitting aisle).

Was I in the wrong? Should I have swapped with him? TIA",Such-Error-34,5916,0.949999988079071,1857,1696113531,2023-09-30 17:38:51,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wk6vv/aita_for_refusing_to_give_up_my_airplane_seat_to/,9,2023

16xgjla,AITA for getting upset about my husband's sexist joke and telling his sister the truth?,"I am a married woman with a husband who sometimes makes jokes that bother me. He says it's just a joke and that I shouldn't take it seriously, but I think he's being disrespectful.

Last weekend, we went to a family gathering at his parents' house. During a private conversation, he made a joke that really upset me. He said I should stay in the kitchen with the other women and make lunch for him and the men in the family because that was my role. He laughed at his own joke and expected me to laugh too, but I didn't find it funny at all.

I got angry and told him he was being sexist and that I wasn't his maid. He said I was overreacting and that it was just an innocent joke. He said I had no sense of humor and that I should relax.

I walked away from him and went to the living room. His sister (my sister-in-law) noticed that I was upset and asked me what had happened. I told her the truth, and she was furious. She said her brother was an idiot and that she was going to talk to him. She told the other women in the family what he had said, and they were all outraged. They all went to talk to him and criticized him for the sexist joke. He felt embarrassed and tried to justify himself, but no one accepted it.

When we got back home, he sulked and said that I and the women in the family took his joke too seriously. He said it was just a joke, and I shouldn't have said anything.

16xgnuw,AITA for blowing up on boyfriend about him not doing shared housework and that his ADHD isn’t an excuse? I called it a misogynistic dynamic.,"My boyfriend (m35) and I (f33) have been together for a bit over year and living together for 5 months. Overall, we’ve both shared that we enjoy living together. When it comes to daily housework, we do a good job of sharing tasks like washing the dishes, making the bed, laundry, etc. 
There are certain tasks I find myself doing more, like cleaning kitchen surfaces and sweeping, and tasks he does more like mowing and grocery shopping. 

My issue lies with the less frequent, but equally important tasks. Things like changing the bed sheets, mopping, scrubbing the toilet, wiping down windows and mirrors, wiping off furniture surfaces, cleaning the shower, dusting baseboards, etc. He has done them just a handful of times since we’ve moved in. He sees me doing them, so he knows they are things that need to be done, and theyre overwhelming completed by me. I’ve brought up to him multiple tjmes that id like him to contribute more. He usually became defensive or gave excuses. He says because of his ADHD he doesnt notice when it gets dirty or forgets. In the end, he says he will do better and then takes up some of those tasks for the day, but theres no long term improvement. 

Today i found myself again working my ass off on these chores. i approached him again about my frustration and he got very defensive and downright angry. we both escalated quickly and it turned into mutual yelling. He again cited his ADHD as the cause. i said he does amazing at managing his adhd in his career and in other tasks by using strategies like setting reminders, alarms, putting things into a calendar, etc. He should implement them for housework too if he cant remember. he told me to write him a list of what needs to be done and when. i said no because im not taking on the mental load of being the household manager and sent him a video about how it is unfair when women have to manage and delegate tasks and schedules for their spouse to do their share of the work. Eventually i just sent him a chore list and schedule i found online because im not sitting down for an hour to make one. 

the fight dragged on and at one point he brought up that i do things that annoy him too.. like when i left a candle burning and a throw pillow got a burn mark (we were both in the room when this happened and the pillow was accidentally nudged from the bed to the nightstand). i thought that comment was unrelated to the real issue. it ended in me saying i wasnt going to end up in a misogynistic household where the woman is expected to do most of the cleaning and manage when others clean. 

am i being unreasonable? AITA?",beigewoodtable,3119,0.8600000143051147,2398,1696203068,2023-10-01 18:31:08,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xgnuw/aita_for_blowing_up_on_boyfriend_about_him_not/,10,2023
16z704f,AITA for telling my aunt I will ban her from seeing my parent in skilled nursing if she doesn’t stop being so judgmental?,"I (45f) am the daughter of a wonderful parent, who, unfortunately, is facing the final chapter. My parent needs full time care, as they suffer from Alzheimer’s.  My aunt recently came to visit her sibling, and had an attitude the entire time she was here. When I finally pressed for an answer to “what’s wrong are you okay?” She went off on me about how my parent shouldn’t have to live in this place. She told me I am selfish for not having my parent at home with me, and was very critical of the care my parent is getting.

The facility is very highly rated.  I vetted several recommended through a social worker before I chose this one. Is it perfect? No.  Nothing is. But they are safe, which is the main worry with an Alzheimer’s patient. 

Also, my parent is combative. My aunt doesn’t see it, but it is true. My aunt lives across the country and only makes it out here a few times a year. 

I have a full time job and two teenagers at home. I cannot care for my parent full time. I just can’t.  I feel bad enough about this without her piling on the guilt trip. 

I am the sole power of attorney.  I told my aunt I can have her banned if she doesn’t keep her opinions to herself, and of course that only made her even madder. She does not get how hard this is.

Anne is my only sibling and this is her first baby. My dad pass away 4 year ago and it  only been mom, Anne and me for a long time. Mom and I have been really excited to welcome a new member of the family. Since Anne is my only sibling, I thought (assumed) I would be the baby's godmother. My sister made it seem I would until her husband told her I would need to be married in order to be the godmother. I'm very much single and have no plans to marry. I  don't think it in the cards for me. I was sad to hear this  and kept how upset I was to my self. If the catholic church says I can't be a godmother then who am I to argue. I took Anne to the Prego Expo, along with our mom. We started talking about the baby shower and doing a little planning during and following the expo. Today I go a text message from Anne, telling me the date and location of the baby shower. I asked her why she was doing it in that location since we talked about another location. She said her husband's brother and his wife liked that place and they wanted a DJ at the baby shower and for it to be a party. I was taken a bit back since I thought mom and I would be doing the planning. Especially since mom will be paying for the location and she has a limited income.   Anne then proceeded to send me screen shots of table center pieces and shower decorations that she wanted me to make for the shower. I was upset and it took me a minute to understand why I was crying. My plan was to ignore her for a few hours while I settled my feels. But she kept messaging, demanding a response and I finally texted her back. I told her I was upset about not being a godmother and that I felt her husband's family was taking over the planning and how my feelings where hurt. Anne texted back that its her husband, that she never confirmed the location and that I'm making no sense. I texted Anne back, telling her that  helping plan means involvement, and that I felt like I was not involved instead I was being told when things are happening and rudely being told I needed to do the decorations.  I also texted Anne that I clearly misunderstood my level of involvement and that I felt I was justify upset but that I will get over it. She has not responded.  My mom is now mad at me for upsetting Anne and she worried it will affect the baby. So now I feel like crap. I know it's Anne's decision on how much I am or am not involved in. My feeling where hurt and I should have kept them to myself since Anne is pregnant and it can affect her baby... Am I the asshole...

1700z9v,AITA for telling my SIL I paid for her honeymoon?,"Throw away account because family drama.

Before we were married my (34F) and husband (42M) were in a horrific car accident, both almost killed. Since we were unmarried we each received separate 8 figure settlements. Literal fuck you money as we were hit by a major carrier 18 wheeler in 2016. We both still work full time, I have a 6 figure salary my husband 7 figure salary. Sounds braggy, sorry, but it’s important. Now to the point.

My brother, Mike (38M), proposed to my now SIL, Alice (32F) in 2017 and married in 2018. I love them both and would burn the world down for them no questions asked BUT I think they see my husband and I as an ATM. Post settlements, husband and I paid off all our student loans. I have a master’s he a Ph.D. so not cheap. I also, without his knowledge as a surprise, paid Mike’s student loans with the help of SIL. Would have paid SILs too but she had a full scholarship so no loans.

Mike and Alice paid for their own wedding as Alice’s family couldn’t afford it but chipped in where they could. It was a beautiful wedding. They stayed within budget but Mike realized he wouldn’t be able to take their dream honeymoon and asked if my husband and I could loan him some money for the cruise he wanted to take her on. We agreed and asked him to pay us back within a year of the trip. He agreed. To this day we haven’t seen a dime but aren’t mad over it. Alice and Mike hit a rough patch with some health issues, then covid and now here we are.

My SIL can be a lot. She also likes to tell me how to parent my kids (5M, 3M, and 1M). She and Mike don’t have any and don’t plan to. Fine their choice. My oldest had his birthday party over the weekend and in true 5 year old fashion asked for a trucks theme. We decked the house out. Day was going well until Alice made a comment about my 3YO having a meltdown over not getting any presents. I told her he’s little and expressing emotions how he knows. Not a super big deal for me as he’s pretty easily redirected. 

She commented how I’m enabling him to become a “Karen” later in life and how she wouldn’t tolerate it if she had kids. I quipped it was a good thing they weren’t planning on having any and went back to my little guy. She said something to the effect of “poor parenting” and in a snap judgement I told her I paid for her honeymoon and she and Mike owed me $7k and once I got that money back I would take her input into consideration. She grabbed Mike and stormed out of the party. That night my brother, SIL and her sister blew up my phone calling me an AH for telling her. My brother is pissed because it was “supposed to be between us.” Something I don’t recall us talking about. I thought she knew the whole time.

Our only child is 2.5 years old and the last two years have been a struggle. This past weekend my husband admitted that he thought we had decided that I would make the child-rearing decisions and that he would ""help"" when I needed it. I was livid. I told him he had just defined ""default parent."" He did not think it was a bad thing that I make all the decisions for our child and he ""helps"" when I struggle. Cut to last night - I took two hours after work to get a run in with friends. This had been planned for a week and husband said he was cool with it. I came home to a house in disarray, table had not been cleaned from dinner, daughter had not had her bath, and other than ordering pizza for dinner, no other forward motion had been made to get our child into any sort of nighttime routine.

170w5oo,AITA for telling a bridesmaid she can't bring her dog to the bachelorette party?,"I (30F) am the maid of honor for my sister (32F)'s wedding. We're planning a bachelorette weekend in Vegas since my sister has never been before and has always wanted to go. We plan to be out of the hotel as much as possible, making the most of our trip. 

One of the bridesmaids (28F) recently asked in the groupchat about accommodations for her dog, a fifty-pound Australian shepherd. 

I was confused...she wanted to bring her *dog?* 

The bridesmaid said the dog was an ESA (emotional support animal) and that she likes to have her dog there on planes (we live on the east coast and will be flying to Vegas). 

We literally flew to Istanbul together not six months ago without this dog and there was no issue whatsoever. And when we get to Vegas, does she plan on just...keeping her dog all cooped up in her crate the entire time?! The hotel we're booking does have dog-friendly rooms, but doesn't allow pets to roam freely around the hotel room unsupervised - the dog would have to stay in that crate for god-knows-how-long each day. That can't be great for the dog. On top of that, our other younger sister coming on the trip is very allergic to dogs. We don't have the money to just let this one bridesmaid book her own room for just herself and the dog to prevent my younger sister having an allergic reaction. Unless this bridesmaid was willing to pay for a room herself, I told her she couldn't bring her dog on this trip.

I thought that was going to be the end of it, since this was definitely reasonable on my part (in my opinion), but this bridesmaid is now being super pissy with me and saying how it's sooo wrong and horrible of me not to let her bring her ESA. Bearing in mind she's been absolutely fine without the dog in the past on much longer flights. Bearing in mind I even told her she could bring the dog IF she was able to pay for a room of her own so that my sister doesn't have a reaction.

Instead she told them I couldn't make it because of wheelchair problems so people we pretty surprised when I finally found someone to push the door open for me.   
Later on my co-presenter admitted to doing this purposefully, she said ""why would I tell them, you already made us late I wasn't going to allow you to disrupt the meeting any more."" (We weren’t late, just not early, and once able to enter, it took all of 45 secs to join the group.) She also admitted to wanting to replace me with someone else because my wheelchair problem had frustrated and annoyed her. Note: this project is titled Advancing Accessibility and Good Neighbourliness, and the ideas all mine. I asked her not to use the language & materials I'd produced and she said ""I'll use whatever language I please"" and said I was ""deluded"" for thinking people wouldn't understand why she couldn't ""let"" me attend that meeting. (Anyone not using a wheelchair could just stroll in, I was the only she could've one kept out like that.)  
It feels so unfair and underhanded, so I really want to inform the rest of our neighbours who went to the meeting about what she did. Part of me thinks that's petty because it happened months ago (she only just admitted what had happened) and I still did get to attend the majority of the meeting.   
Am I the asshole for wanting to exposing her bad behaviour, thus potentially torpedoing a project that could help other people with disabilities? Should I swallow my pride and try to work things out with her to try to salvage some hope of progressing a cause I believe in?",fabvanfan,4361,0.9700000286102296,292,1696548361,2023-10-05 18:26:01,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170wv5z/wibta_for_telling_on_my_neighbour_for_locking_me/,10,2023
171q8sd,AITA for telling my wife nobody cares about her small business?,"My wife (27F) owns an Etsy shop where she sells handmade jewelry. She has some real talent and the jewelry she sells is genuinely very nice and high quality. She gets a surprising amount of sales on there too, and has great reviews.

The issue is that EVERYWHERE we go, EVERY conversation she has, she slips in something about her shop and tries to promote it. Talking to a friend? She'll casually mention a big sale she made or a custom order she got and not-very-subtly mention that she'd give her friend a coupon or something similar. Talking to our waiter? She'll mention that she has a pair of earrings on her shop that would compliment their eyes. Talking to someone online? She'll somehow manage to say ""as the owner of a small business.."" She literally cannot have a conversation anywhere with anyone without trying to sell them her jewelry.

The other day was a family member's birthday, and they were having a decently-sized get-together with just other family members and a few close friends. I went with my wife, and she's a pretty social person even outside of promoting her shop so she was quickly making conversation with my family. Of course not 5 minutes later she was showing someone the bracelet she had on that she made and mentioning that she sells them and talking about how since they were family she would happily give them a 25% discount. She probably had that exact same conversation with at least 5 people during the 2 hours we were there.

As soon as we left I spoke to her and said she needs to quit doing that. I told her if people were actually interested, they would ask her about her store, but not every single person she talks to wants or needs to hear about her art. She got upset and said that she just wants to spread her product and doesn't see what she's doing wrong and hasn't spoken to me much since. I feel like I'm the asshole since I will admit I had a pretty harsh tone and could've been a lot nicer during that conversation, plus I get she's just trying to sell her products, even if it gets obnoxious. AITA?

174589z,AITA for telling my MIL she can no longer have contact with my son?,"I’m a single mom (F42) of four- Arden (F13), Briony (F11), Robin (M10), and Kaya (F7). All of us, except Robin, are Deaf, with ASL as our first language. Arden and Briony’s dad (M46) left when the girls were 4 and 2, and I met Kaya’s dad, Alex (M43) shortly after. He had just come into custody of his nephew, Robin.   
Robin’s bio mom (Layla, F47) gave Robin up to focus on recovering from her long-term drug addiction. Robin is fully aware of who his bio mom is, but considers Alex to be his dad, and has called me his mom since the age of 2/3ish. Layla has told me in the past how grateful she is for me filling that role, and that she feels more like Robin’s aunt than his mom. All this to say, when Alex was diagnosed with cancer two years ago, it was pretty clear to all of us that I would continue to raise Robin as my son after Alex’s death.  
Alex passed away in June, and ever since, his mom has been causing problems. While she’s never been outwardly hostile towards me/my children, she often complains about our use of ASL (Most of the family learnt at least some basics to support communication, but MIL insisted she was too old and couldn’t do it) and has made comments in the past about my inability as a mother due to my deafness. My older girls are practically non-existent to her, and she often ‘forgets’ that Kaya is her grandchild too and focus solely on Robin.  
MIL spent most of the funeral telling people that I was ‘unfit’ and trying to ‘steal Robin away from his real family’. It was hurtful, to say the least, and made me uncomfortable welcoming MIL into my home after that, but I convinced myself that it was for the benefit of the kids- they’ve just lost their dad. I didn’t want to take away a grandparent too.   
Last Saturday, Robin came back from an outing with MIL looking miserable. He wouldn’t talk to anyone about what had happened and spent the rest of the weekend shut away in his room. I tried to ask MIL what was going on, but she didn’t answer any of my messages. Finally, Robin broke down in tears, asking me if ‘Grandma was really going to take him away’. It turns out that MIL has been repeatedly telling Robin that she’s going to take him away from us, even telling him she’ll call CPS on me to have the kids removed. On Saturday, MIL had gone even further, saying she could just drive away with him, and he’d ‘never have to see us again’.   
I immediately sent MIL a message informing her that she was no longer welcome in my home or near any of the kids, and let Layla know what was going on and that she was still welcome to visit/have Robin to stay, if MIL was nowhere nearby. My phone has been blowing up ever since, with people asking me to reconsider. I haven’t said anything about what happened, so can only assume MIL is spreading false information, but all the negative responses are making me doubt if I’m actually in the right here.

174yb8g,AITA for not defending FIL in a feud on my pregnancy announcement post?,"When I announced my pregnancy on social media 3 weeks ago, FIL was upset that baby would be taking my last name. He commented that his last name sounded “much better.” My brother and a couple friends responded to him. They told him he was being weird and he insisted it wasn’t weird to expect his grandchild to have HIS last name. My brother called him stupid (not saying I agree with this but it happened) and it snowballed from there. 

I never once intervened but my MIL called my bf to complain about me. She said they’re tired of dealing with me, they refuse to keep eating my “shit sandwich” and they will not walk on eggshells. She was upset her husband got attacked in my comments. I ended up taking the phone and told her it was not my responsibility to moderate a feud that he initiated and publicized on MY announcement post. Basically we argued for an hour. She insisted I was in the wrong, I should’ve stuck up for him and I had no reason to be so upset and I am too sensitive (no one ever even told her I was upset?). 

I called FIL after because MIL told me that’s what I should do. He told me he doesn’t give a fuck about me or the baby anymore as it won’t have his last name. 

I really don’t see the issue in me not defending him. I think he has been a bully his whole life and wants to whine now that someone stuck up to him (I don’t necessarily agree with my brother insulting him but I also don’t see how it’s my fault that he did). I refuse to apologize for not intervening and they have cut contact completely until I do.

175qy8m,UPDATE: AITA for “ruining” my daughters graduation?,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bpmf2e/aita_for_ruining_my_daughters_graduation/)

Hi. It's been a while and I'm not sure if anyone would even care at this point but I accidentally logged into my throwaway on an old laptop and remembered this.

Quite frankly, I'm really embarasssed and ashamed to reread my original post. My attitude was terrible and it's one of those moments I wish I could go back in time and shake some sense into my past self. As many people in the comments predicted, I know longer have a relationship of any kind with my daughter, or two of my other kids. COVID and lockdowns did a number on our family, I'll just say that.

I've been doing a LOT of reflecting and therapy over the last year and I realise I've not been the kind of mother my children have needed in their lives. I have no contact with my daughter now - who has married and moved abroad now - and, from her wishes, this will not be changing anytime soon. I also have very little contact with two of my other children. My relationship with my final child is strained and I am doing everything I can not to break it.

After having logged into this account again and seeing that post, I find myself desperately wishing to go back in time and maybe I could've stopped the breaking of my family if I'd behaved differently here.

I don't really know what I want to say here. Maybe just hopefully encourage one person who has been deemed 'the asshole' to reflect sooner rather than later and maybe their lives won't go the same way as mine.

ETA: I'm going to log out of this account again now. Maybe I'll pop in again in another four years with better news. Thank you for the comments and advice I've received. And to those who think I'm beyond redemption, I truly hope you're wrong.

175rrgb,AITA for telling my friend’s GF to stop this shit when she pulled out tarot cards?,"I put a TLDR right at the bottom

My (24m) best friend Lewis (24m) has a girlfriend who is super weird, not just in the way she acts but her whole personality too. She believes in tarot cards, palmistry, crystal energy and all that sort of crazy stuff.

He started to bring her to group meetups & she seemed like a relatively chill person, she was just chatting and smoking some pot and stuff. One time when I was at Lewis’ house though she started to ask me what my zodiac sign is & telling me what crystals “match my energy”. There was another time when one of our other friends was going through a breakup, and she just straight up said to him “i guess that’s what happens when a Virgo dates a Aries”.

It’s just my personal opinion that anyone who believes in this stuff probably has a screw loose up there. But I didn’t say anything cause that’s his girlfriend. She started to talk about this shit more and more. 

I invited Lewis round to my house one day and when he arrived his GF was there too. I wasn’t rude or anything, but also wasn’t super friendly to her because I didn’t even invite her. For a while we were watching a movie, until she pulled out a pack of those tarot cards.

She started telling me that she wanted to give me a reading, I said no thanks. But she started pushing saying that she just wants to see what my reading comes out as. I think the fact that this was in MY house and that I hadn’t even invited her made me fly off the handle, and I ended up saying loud, but not shouting at all, “I have a reading for you : stop with this shit and get real”.

She asked if I was being serious and Lewis thought I was joking. I kept a straight face and said I wasn’t, and that I was fed up with all this psycho shit. His gf started crying & calling me names and Lewis said “why are you being such a dick” before leaving.

A few other friends that know us all have literally agreed with me, saying that she tries to push that shit on anyone and they’re fed up too. But some others say that I should have just let her do it to get it over and done with. AITA?

TL;DR - My best friend’s GF believes in crazy spirituality shit. When she tried to give me a tarot card reading, i said no but she kept pushing. i finally told her “I have a reading for you : stop this shit and get real”. They got upset, but some of my friends don’t blame me. AITA?

Edit because I forgot to mention and someone’s comment made me remember : I don’t know if this is true or not but Lewis has said to us once that his GF has some kind of personality disorder but wouldn’t specify what. Idk if that’s part of the reason for her behaviour (I see some people saying that I’m assuming she has a personality disorder because she likes tarot, PLEASE READ PROPERLY. I said that Lewis has literally said to us that she has one, not that I think she does).

Last edit : wow I went to sleep, woke up and checked my post not too long ago and I’m very very surprised at how much attention it got. It seems to be mostly ESH but because there’s LOADS of responses I can’t really tell. I understand now I went too aggressive and should have just said no again. I guess that the fact it was in my house and she wasn’t invited along with the things she’s said to me & my friends in the past (e.g the example i gave at the start when my friend broke up) was what made me get angry a lot faster. I’m gonna apologise to Lewis (idk about her though) and then see where our friendship goes from there.

176jndn,WIBTA If I didn't pay for my stepkids private schooling?,"I (36f) have one (13F) child. My husband (46) has 4 kids (13F,11M,8F,6F) with his ex wife. Their divorce was very amicable and he gladly pays for his ex’s home and cash support as she was a SAHM. This amounts to close to 8k a month. He makes 250k (15k month net) while I make 400k (around 23k a month, varies). I would guess his ex makes 60k a year now.

We live in a high cost of living city so Ex's house is only 3 beds and ours is 4 beds (almost 10k a month). Before marrying me he lived in a studio down the street and he would take the kids during his days but put them to bed at her house. I lived in a two bedroom paying 4k, so my daughter had her own room. Now, his kids share a room at our house when they are here 30% of the time. We have an uneven amount of kids and can’t afford a 6 bedroom. I have put my daughter in her own bedroom. She’s only 2 months younger than my oldest stepdaughter and is with us almost all the time. Her father is out of state and I receive meager child support.

Between that and my daughter attending private school (started 2 years ago before we married), I pay a little less than half my salary every month to tuition and mortgage payments.

Ex wife is now asking my husband to either allow my oldest stepdaughter or stepson to have their own bedroom, and to send all the kids to private school. Quite frankly, we can’t afford it. I am making great money now but was basically paycheck to paycheck most of my daughter’s life. I pretty much decimated my retirement and got into big debt (100k) to start my business that just started thriving last year.

She is claiming I am treating my child like the favorite. I have always instilled academic values in my child- she has never received anything less than an A and has a lot of dreams. The other kids are great kids but they do not value education as much. I’m not judging, just evaluating, but the kids are different. They have been raised differently, and that's fine.

I told my husband we can consider private school for each kid individually as they get older and  they possibly get more academic rigor but sending 5 kids to private school is just out of the question. I feel like I am being expected to foot this bill because I am successful but I also have my long term financial security to work out. He has a healthy retirement (to which ex is entitled to half) and I have nothing to fall back on if my industry gets a downturn. My career is half his career’s age, I do not have wealth like he has.

I asked my daughter if she was ok sharing a room with her stepsister, and she said she would prefer not to since the kids are messy.

AITA for not wanting to pay for all my stepkids private schooling and changing up rooms?

Edit: My four stepkids share two rooms at my house which mirrors their living situation at their moms (13F & 11M) and (8F & 6F). This weekend we are going to figure out a room divider.

176kogp,AITAH for feud w/ deceased husband's ex??,"My husband and I were married for 12 years before he passed away. We have 2kids together. He also has 2 kids from a previous relationship. When he passed away his ex expressed wanting to keep things the same and have the kids spending time together. However she meant the custody schedule meaning I still have her kids 50% of the time. I missed my husband and was always close with my step kids so I agreed. 3 years have passed and his kids are 15&16 and I still want them in my life however I want to start forming my own habits, traditions and vacations without her imput such as vacations on ""her off time"" and not taking them, me not spending enough on birthdays, her asking me for money for their sports and interests. 

When I brought this up she threw a fit, literally said I was abandoning them ""just like their dad"" and I'm showing my true colours and clearly I never loved them like I said I did. I explained they can still come over and will still have their own rooms but if I want to up and go to my parents that live hours away I don't want to have to clear it with her anymore because I also don't want them at my house unsupervised (not because I don't trust them but because they're still young). 

She has literally hired a lawyer and is trying to establish that I agreed to a custody arrangement and she wants child support since we always had more money. My husband had money set aside for his kids when we met and when he died I sold assets that were his and split the $ between all 4kids. His life insurance was also split in 5 for all of us. The house was mine so it was never written to be left to his kids. 

The estate lawyer set it up where they get money at a certain age and she got monthly amount to help raise them. I dont believe I owe her more. Some people in our life are split since it seems like I did agreed to custody but I was just trying to be a stable figure for them still. 

Am I wrong for wanting her to screw off and not wanting to give her anything?? This whole thing seems ridiculous but her lawyer is attacking me???

177c2tj,AITA for refusing to let my wife name our kid something stupid?,"Me (25m) and my wife (23f) are having our first child together. She is currently 9 months pregnant and could give birth anytime in the next couple of weeks. The only major fight we have had throughout her pregnancy happened a couple days ago, and it was about what we were going to name our kid.  
  
 It all started when we found out the gender of the baby. We didn’t do a gender reveal and decided to find out the gender at one of her checkups because we didn’t want to spend time making two lists of names then have to get rid of one after. So after we found out we were having a boy we sat down together and made a list. Almost all of the names she suggested were normal, until the one that caused me to write this post. She suggested we name our son Mune. She told me the name was from this movie she watched when she was younger and that it always stuck with her. I told her the name was a little out there and he would get made fun of for it. She claimed he wouldn’t and we started going back and forth trying to decide whether to add the name to the list or not. Eventually she agreed to keep the name off the list, we picked some that we liked, and I thought that was that.  
  
 Later on in her pregnancy her mom decided to throw a baby shower as it was her first grandchild, and my wifes pregnancy was almost over and we hadnt celebrated once. It was fine for the most part until we started to open the gifts. Most of them were normal baby things like diapers and bottles, until we got to her moms gift. My wife opened the gift bag and pulled out a blue handmade blanket. It seemed normal enough at first until my wife unfolded it and low and behold there was the name Mune written on the blanket. When I saw it i was pissed but didn’t want to cause a scene so i stayed quiet. After that reveal I had family members come up to me and ask me about the name and why i hadnt told them. I didnt know what to tell them as i didnt have a clue about this either and just had to embarrassingly tell my family that, which pissed me off even more.  
  
 Once the event ended and me and my wife went home I started to question her about the name. She got defensive and told me that it was a good name and that i was overreacting about it. I brought up the earlier points and told her it was a stupid name for a kid and if she wanted to name something Mune so bad she could use the name for a dog. She got upset and called her mom to come get her. After she left she called me and told me she wouldn’t be coming back for awhile. Everyone ive talked to about this has said im not the asshole, but now that my wife has been gone and ive been thinking about it I feel like I could have handled the situation better. Aita?

I chose not to abort, but soon after she was born, I realized that I could not handle having a baby while being a freshman in high school. My older sister (26 at the time, now 42) and her husband can not have biological children. They adopted my baby when she was three months old and I gave up all my rights to her. It was a difficult decision but it was right for me and her. I no longer see her as my daughter, but as my niece. She does not know that I gave birth to her.

A few days ago, I was having dinner with my mother and she suggested that I tell my niece that I’m her biological mother because she’s sixteen now and old enough to understand. I refused. I have a good relationship with my niece and I’m afraid that revealing the truth will ruin our relationship because she might think I abandoned her. I love her as my niece but do not have any maternal feelings for her anymore. She is my sister’s daughter and I don’t want to ruin their family either.

My mother has continued to insist that I tell her because she has a right to know. She’s older than I was when she was born and my mom thinks she’ll understand. I disagree.

In her book, she used a quote that has been widely circulated for years. I googled it and couldn't find the original author, but people have been quoting it on Twitter, blogs, forums, and YouTube since at least 2012.  
My sister made a post on IG and FB, shaming another account for sharing this quote without crediting her as the author. She also included a portion of her book that contained the quote. In the FB comments, I sent her links to several places where this quote had been used over the years and pointed out that it's a popular saying, so she shouldn't take it personally. For content published in 2022, she said it was after her book's release date; for 2021, it was after the date she submitted the manuscript; and when I showed her posts from 2018, she asked what my problem was.  
I then messaged her privately, explaining that I didn't have an issue with anything. It's just a well-known quote, and many people often come up with the same ideas simultaneously. However, I mentioned that it's bad PR for her to claim rights to a quote that, on the first page of Google, doesn't link back to her book al all but to various other people and their content from years before her book's publication.  
She responded, saying I was insulting her intelligence. She said I'm entitled to my opinion, as is she, but accused me of publicly dragging and harassing her. She ended the conversation, then deleted and reposted her original post, removing my comments.

178red6,AITA for telling my sister her jealousy over something that happened at my wedding is stupid and pointless and that it’s really not my problem causing her to cry?,"Sorry for the long title. This whole situation is unbelievably stupid.

I (40M) recently got married to my girlfriend of 3 years Lexi (36F) but I’ve known her for 12 years and this is a second marriage for both of us. We met through work but were both very good friends for many years before we got together. So I knew her when she was married to her ex-husband and she knew me when I was with my ex-wife. She came into the relationship with 2 daughters, Hannah who is now 14 and Daisy who is now 6 and I’ve had the joy of knowing them as the kids of one of my best friends and as my own stepkids. Their father left when Lexi was pregnant with Daisy and nobody has seen or heard from him in 7 years, so he completely abandoned Lexi and the girls. My own marriage broke down a year later in 2017 due to my wife cheating. It was a shitty time all round and Lexi and I relied on each other a lot but our friendship didn’t progress romantically until 2020.

I love both Lexi and the girls very much but I have never tried to force myself as a father to them, since I knew Hannah remembered her bio dad real well and has struggled immensely with his abandonment. It happened naturally when Daisy called me Dad one day and hasn’t called me anything else since. Hannah has also  started referring to me as her dad but still calls me by my first name. 

Anyway, at the wedding reception once all the speeches and stuff were out of the way, my mom grabbed me and told me that Lexi and the girls had a surprise for me. Basically, I was pulled away and Hannah and Daisy asked me to officially adopt them. I never expected this and was so over the moon I cried tears of joy so of course I said yes. 

Word quickly got out and ever since my sister  Claire has been insanely jealous. She has stepkids of her own and they have a mom very involved in their lives snd they do not view Claire as a mom at all. She has tried to push it and it’s caused bitterness between them. My sister has made some incredibly bitchy comments saying it’s not fair that she’s been involved with her stepkids a lot longer and she is only viewed as their dad’s wife whereas after just ‘3 short years’ I’m already a dad.

I’m honestly sick of her trying to ruin my happiness so I told her her jealousy was both pointless and pathetic and it’s really not my problem at all that her relationship with her stepkids is different than mine and I made her cry.

She is now saying I’m an insensitive AH as she doesn’t have bio kids and it’s the closest she’ll get even though I don’t have bio kids myself.
My mom says she is being childish but some others think I need to show compassion.",regulardadsunite,3703,0.9700000286102296,168,1697410283,2023-10-15 17:51:23,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178red6/aita_for_telling_my_sister_her_jealousy_over/,10,2023
178rrnv,WIBTA if I said I had a problem with my fiancée adding a ring enhancer to the engagement ring I just gave her?,"I’m not sure how I should feel here.

Last week I celebrated my 2 year anniversary with my then gf, & really went all out to make it an amazing weekend getaway, finishing it all off with a surprise proposal at the very end.

I got her a beautiful ring, simple classic style with smaller diamonds running down on the face of the band with a 1ct diamond sitting on top, it also came as a set with a matching wedding band that really makes the whole thing look amazing. I basically worked 2 jobs for months to be able to save up and buy this for her along with the rest of the weekend plans. The proposal went great, she was completely surprised & I even had a photographer lined up to be there inconspicuously to capture the moment without her noticing.

All week long after, she’s said how much everyone is telling her they love the ring & giving me kudos on the selection, etc. I didn’t have much to go off for figuring her style out because she’s not huge on wearing jewelry, which game me some anxiety regarding that so hearing that made me feel a lot better.

The ring size was a tad bit big so we had planned for her to get it resized sometime this next coming up week. Fast forward to today, she goes to church with her mom and is taking her & her daughter to a museum while I’m at work. While at her mom’s house, suddenly she texts me saying she might not need to have her ring resized after all now because her mom just gave her a nice ring holder to keep it in place, & sends me a picture of this ring guard/enhancer that, admittedly is very nice, but it almost swallows up her whole ring finger and completely changes the entire appearance of the ring I just gave her.

I told her I don’t think that is going to work after we add the wedding band to the ring, to which she replied she thinks can be split further apart to make that space. She then tells me I didn’t like it she didn’t have to wear it, but in the same text says she really loves it  and mentions this ring holder her mom is giving her is $3,000 so it was a very nice gift. 

Well, not that the monetary value is what matters here, but I spent just shy of 10 grand on her engagement ring/wedding band and diamond set. So I’m a little offended that she even feels the need to add the enhancer to it, which I’m still not positive will accommodate the wedding band after that is added after the wedding. & I just don’t like the fact that a wedding/engagement ring is meant to be from me and she wants to add more to it from someone else, even it it is her mom. To me, the enhancer is so big completely swallows & hides the ring itself.

AITA for feeling like this? Should I pretend it doesn’t bother me & hope I’ll get used to it, or that she’ll decide on her own to stop wearing it?  I’m worried she will take it this the wrong way if I try object to it, so hoping for some guidance on how to best approach it if my feelings are valid.",JackkHammerr,2262,0.9300000071525574,2066,1697411348,2023-10-15 18:09:08,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178rrnv/wibta_if_i_said_i_had_a_problem_with_my_fiancée/,10,2023
178s9hl,AITA for not wanting my autistic sister to come to my birthday party?,"I (15F) am turning sixteen soon and I’m having a pretty big party to celebrate. I have a stepsister (16F) who is autistic. She is fairly high functioning but very spoiled and throws tantrums whenever she doesn’t get what she wants. When I was little, she would always ruin my birthday parties so I stopped having parties with my mom’s family. I usually have parties with just my dads family and my friends. This year, I’m turning 16 so I’m having a bigger party which my dad is mostly paying for but I’m inviting my mom, stepdad, stepbrother and half siblings (13M and 11F). I’m having a party with about 90 people and over the weekend my grandma is gonna take me and some of my friends and cousins to their cabin in the mountains.

I do not want my stepsister to come to the party or to the cabin. I know she’s going to ruin it. She gets jealous whenever I get anything and my dad is planning to gift me my dream car at the party so I know she’s gonna throw a tantrum. She always steals the attention from me and I just don’t want her there. I’m not inviting her to the cabin either because it’s just for my cousins on my dad’s side and my friends. I’m not that close to my stepsister. Besides, we’re going to hike, boat, ride horses, and do other outdoor events that I know my sister can’t handle. She’s gonna start crying if we try to go on the water and she can’t walk further than half a mile without getting tired.

Yesterday my stepsister told me that she’s really excited for my party because it’s at the zoo and she loves it there and she has never stayed in a cabin before. I told her that she’s not invited and she started crying and ran to her room. My mom called me an uncaring brat for not inviting her and telling her so bluntly. She said that her and my stepdad aren’t coming either if she’s not invited. I don’t think I’m the asshole because it’s my party and I don’t want her to ruin it.


UPDATE: I don’t think my moms family is coming. My stepbrother is coming because he’s 18 and doesn’t care if my stepsis is invited and I wish my little siblings could’ve come, but I’m not inviting her. I might do a smaller celebration with just them, but I don’t have the money to pay for that myself so I can only do that if my mom pays for it (which she probably won’t).",Due-Sale4970,5123,0.9200000166893004,1170,1697412822,2023-10-15 18:33:42,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178s9hl/aita_for_not_wanting_my_autistic_sister_to_come/,10,2023
179jpz6,AITA for “disinheriting” my daughter?,"I didn’t actually disinherit my daughter it’s just what my wife claims. 

My first wife had drug problems and still got primary custody of our son. I was young and didn’t fight her on custody and when he got older we weren’t close so I felt awkward asking him to live with us. She tried to prevent us from communicated and moved around a lot so it was always hard to spend any time with him until he got his own phone. But now I have spent more time with him and now we are close. 

My second wife is hard working and very financially successful as an engineer. In fact she makes more than me. Our daughter takes after her, she is a straight A student and is going to be back in school to be a nursing practitioner soon. 

My wife is angry with me because my daughter and I aren’t close. She goes to her mom for everything and doesn’t speak to me much. We were close when she was young but since high school it’s like she pretends I don’t exist. I try to reach out but it’s met with silence. I think my wife poisoned her against me because I have spent most of my money on my son. My wife told my daughter I didn’t pay for an cent of college for her and my wife did all the saving for her college fund. 

I didn’t really contribute to my daughter’s college fund.I didn’t pay for any piano lessons etc. I did pay for half of the family expenses with my wife like the mortgage but my extra money has been going to my son. Partly child support but I’ve also been contributing outside of that. He didn’t finish school with good enough grades for college. I gave him money to upgrade his grades and helped him get a place to start college. He got 2 semesters in and then left because he was depressed. He has a lot of issues from growing up with his mother and I feel partly responsible because I didn’t try to fight for custody. I give him money for rent and he has issues holding down a job so he needs support. 

My daughter recently reached out with an schedule for her and her fiancé’s wedding. It had his and mom’s dance but not the father daughter one. I was confused and asked my daughter about that and she replied “we aren’t close enough for that”. I was shocked and asked her why she would consider us not close and she said “well you basically disinherited me”. I called her and asked her to explain and she said because her mom paid for college and will be helping her with her NP degree and I didn’t give a crap about her after middle school because of my son. I explained everything I said above to her and she said I should have split my funds and time between them. I told her I felt like I did and she got angry and said I didn’t and it’s like she was raised by a single mom and that’s why she is uncomfortable with having a wedding dance with me because it would be a lie.",Vegetable_Bet404,3562,0.8799999952316284,1036,1697497934,2023-10-16 18:12:14,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179jpz6/aita_for_disinheriting_my_daughter/,10,2023
17bx0zh,AITA for telling my wife that she's not welcome at my parents' house anymore because she's too loud?,"My wife, Karen, and I have been married for 5 years. She's a great person, but she can be really loud. She laughs loudly, talks loudly, and even snores loudly. It's not a major problem at home, but it can be really embarrassing when we're in public or at social events.  
Recently, my parents had a big party for their 50th wedding anniversary. Karen and I were both invited, but I was really worried about how she would behave. I told her beforehand to please try to be quiet, but she didn't seem to listen.  
As soon as we arrived at the party, Karen started laughing and talking loudly. She was also making a lot of noise with her jewelry and bracelets. I tried to subtly hint to her that she needed to quiet down, but she just ignored me.  
At one point, Karen was talking so loudly that she interrupted my mother during a toast. My mother was really upset, and she later told me that she felt embarrassed.  
After the party, I had a serious talk with Karen. I told her that her behavior was unacceptable, and that she's not welcome at my parents' house anymore until she learns to be more quiet.  
Karen is really upset with me. She says that I'm being oversensitive, and that she's not going to change her personality just to please me.

17bx2pa,"AITA? My wife says I'm asking her to ""mask"".","Hi reddit. Sorry for this sockpuppet account. I am 34m and my wife ""Polly"" is 32f.

Like a lot of couples, we debrief after our workdays. Polly works in a high-touch, high-interaction job, so we usually say our hellos, make dinner, and then eat separately so she can wind down a bit. Then, afterwards, we sit in the living room and shoot the shit.

Polly has a mild neurodivergence that means she tells... let's call it ""branching"" stories. She will get bogged down in sidestories and background stories and details that, frankly, add nothing to the core story about her workday. That's usually fine, but I've noticed it getting a bit worse, to the point that, by the time she's done, it's basically time to watch a show and go to bed. I mean, I'm spending upwards of an hour just listening and adding ""mmhmm"" and ""oh wow"", because she says she gets even MORE distracted when I ask questions.

I brought this up with Polly, and she said that I am asking her to mask her disorder, and that's just how her brain works. I get that feeling, I really do, but I am starting to feel like I'm a side character here, because she takes up all the airtime that we set aside to debrief.

Here's why I might be an AH: I said ""well, we all change our communication styles based on context, right?"" And she said that's different, and that masking is not code switching. 

I just want some time to talk about my day, too, but I don't want her to feel bad. AITA? ",aita-mask,4681,0.9399999976158142,1190,1697758599,2023-10-19 18:36:39,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bx2pa/aita_my_wife_says_im_asking_her_to_mask/,10,2023
17cp1kz,AITA for throwing my friend’s girlfriend out of my house?,"I (35F) have been friends with Alex and Adam (twins 35M) since our mom’s were pregnant with us. Literally grew up together including them being only 3 days older than I am. Alex got engaged several months ago and the wedding is the weekend before Halloween. I love his fiance, Kelly (30F) she’s a beautiful human. Adam started dating a girl a few weeks ago, Jordan (28F). Jordan is the definition of spoiled brat. Only child who has never been told no and quite obnoxious about daddy’s money.

Alex and Kelly have their wedding planned already and are just waiting for the day to arrive. Ever since Jordan came into the picture she’s been trying to insert herself into the wedding. I’m currently 6 months pregnant with my third and final kid. My other two littles will be ring bearers and my husband and I are both in the wedding party. Jordan has apparently pulled Kelly aside more than a few times asking to replace me as a bridesmaid so I don’t “ruin the aesthetic” of the wedding. Kelly declines every time because we’re basically family at this point.

Kelly has told me each time she’s done this and spoken to both Alex and Adam. Alex as her fiance has taken her side, but Adam is staying neutral at best, avoidant at worst. My husband and I had both couples over last night for a chill dinner. Jordan immediately upon seeing said I look like a beached whale. So 6 months pregnant, not exactly small but I’m size 6 when not pregnant. I was livid. I told her at some point my belly would go away but she was stuck with her ugly personality and kicked her out of my house.

Kelly, Alex and my husband all think I was within my right to throw her out, even if what I said wasn’t exactly nice. Jordan did some more name calling and yelling before dragging Adam by the arm out of the house. I told him he could stay if he wanted and she called me a “boyfriend stealing bitch.” Doesn’t make sense but ok. Today Adam texted me saying I took a low blow and needed to apologize for being as asshole to Jordan. I don’t feel like apologizing, but am curious, was I out of line.

Update: (thanks mods) Adam came over earlier today and we spoke at length about Jordan’s behavior. I told him I hated the way she made me feel in my own home, and worse that she did it in front of my kids. I told him I can’t control who he dates, but if he wants to keep seeing her I would not be attending hangs when she is present. Adam said he and Jordan argued from the time they left my house and most of the day yesterday. He broke up with her and threw her out! He hasn’t responded to any of her messages. He showed me some of them and they are FOUL. He apologized to me for his role in all of this and not sticking up for me in the moment. Alex also apparently ripped Adam a new asshole yesterday and told him Jordan wasn’t allowed at the wedding. Adam told Alex about the break up and let Alex know if she shows up Adam will direct security to escort her out. Adam also apologized to Alex and Kelly. Adam told me he is embarrassed on behalf of Jordan and her behavior and told me hopes this doesn’t change anything between us. I told him we are family and that doesn’t change.

17de736,AITA for refusing to sleep on the couch?,"I (32M) and my wife (31F) got into a heated argument after her friend accused me of hitting on her. The other day, on my way from work to home, I came across a friend of my wife and she looked like she was carrying heavy stuff so I asked if she wanted a ride home. At first she declined but as I was leaving, she changed her mind and got into the car. We had a nice chat whilst driving and all was well. I even told my wife about it when I got home.

Yesterday, I was confronted by my wife because I allegedly ""hit"" on her friend. I obviously denied it and told her the version of events but apparently I was persistent with said friend when offering her the ride. I only asked twice, and the second time was asking if she was sure. My wife insisted that her friend isn't the type to just lie about something like this. Naturally, I asked why she trusted her friend more than me and then she told me about how her sister's husband cheated with a friend. I was angry at how I was being compared to someone else based on a mere accusation and we ended up arguing. Then we were just about to sleep and she told to sleep on the couch because she didn't feel comfortable with me. I argued that I wasn't going to be punished for something I didn't do and after quite a back and forth, I eventually let her have the room and slept in the other one instead.

I woke up in the morning to yet another confrontation about why I didn't sleep on the couch. I was obviously baffled and asked why I would sleep on the couch when there's an entire other room. According to her, if one spouse tells the other that they should sleep on the couch, then they should do as asked to show that they're sorry.

17eyun2,AITA for laughing at how my friend used her inheritance?,"I decided to post this with the help of my husband (who is unsure if my behavior was over the line). Here's what he thought was important for the sake of the story:

\- My friend of about 17 years (Delilah, 37f) had a very problematic childhood. She barely went to school because her only parent was addicted to substances among many other problems. I don't know how she slipped through the system for so long but she was pretty much a lost cause by high school because of how little discipline she had. 

\- At 23 her dad died and due to the matter of death, Delilah won a somewhat large sum of money.

\- Once she got that money, Delilah chose to go to a community college. I guess she learned to love learning and had so many interest she never knew about that she went to several schools in most of her 20s and came out with several degrees.

So my view: I've held my tongue on her wasting so much money on school. I guess if it was my money I'd want to save it or explore then get a degree, not go head first. She has 6 degrees and to me it's just silly. The real kicker is my husband is an engineer and makes more than she does, despite all her side jobs and projects. 

Well we were visiting her and she mentioned how she wanted to study history and maybe take a class or two online for the fun of it. I laughed and asked if any of her inheritance was still even left. She said that shouldn't be my concern. I admitted it was ridiculous, she could have just bought a nice house with that money, instead of blowing it on degrees that she doesn't even use.

She told me all her degrees served a purpose, she loves what she does now and loves learning because she was deprived of it as a child. She told me she wasn't going to defend herself to someone who did not grow in a similar situation.

My husband told her to calm down. After is now awkward and I'm not sure if I need to apology or not.

17fq8zg,AITA for wanting my fiancé’s step dad walk me down the aisle?,"My fiancé and I have been together for 6 years and we are getting married in May. My fiancé’s step father married his mom when he was 3 and raised him like his own.

I have a lot of respect for his stepdad raising a child that’s not his own and helping us both when we needed it. He co-signed for our first place because neither of us had regular jobs and income and when we bought a place he and my fiancé did all the renos. 

My own father is a deadbeat to me. He dated my mom when they were both young and then left when I was born. He didn’t give us money and my mom never asked which is crazy if you ask me.

He just prefers fries. (Same, kid).

Anyway, I took my daughter to my parents house about a week ago. My mom is also vegan so we were eating our tofu and rice. My daughter has just started solids so she was also going ham on my plate. My parents dog ate more than I did.

My younger sister (15) had her friends over. They were having burgers or something and watching me with my daughter. After I ate I nursed her and one asked if I was vegan. I said yes, she got this weird kinda look, and asked if my baby was going to be vegan.

I just kinda shrugged because, you know, she could be a dairy hating fry fiend like her brother or a cheese-aholic like her daddy. Maybe, maybe not. My sisters friend nodded and spoke to me a little more before leaving. 

I thought it was a little odd but shrugged it off. Teens are weird creatures sometimes.

Anyway, unbeknownst to me, this teen had decided I was a crazy vegan ""crunchy"" mom. Theres a few tiktokers who are apparently stupid about their kids safety and happen to be breastfeeding vegans. Like yours truly.

I thought all was well - my sister sent me a link on the importance of a balanced diet for kids among a few other bits and eventually I called her. I was like, what the hell? And she started going on about how I was a bad mom.

I told her to watch her mouth and she blew up and said I was the one with a ""crunchy vegan baby"". 

So, turns out, her friends are all convinced my children are terribly abused by my veganism, and because she'd never seen my toddler eat meat it was clearly true. 

I told her to calm the fuck down, explained my parenting, yada yada.

She them got mad because all her friends think I'm a terrible mom and I should have been clearer and not just shrugged her friends question off because I should have known what they would have assumed I meant.

I think she's being dramatic. They were worried, wires got crossed, all is well. She's still acting like its the worst thing in the world.

So, basically, aita for making a mistake and having my sisters friends think I've got a crunchy vegan baby?

As a side note, my husband was feeling petty so he went and got ribs for lunch. Filmed little lady eating her first rib. I can now firmly say she will not be a vegan, vegetarian or anything of the sort.

17h8g6q,AITA for leaving sexually-explicit messages where my colleague could see them?,"I (35f) am a teacher at a alternative school where each class has two teachers. My coteacher (34f) is very in-your-face, in-your-business and doesn't understand boundaries very well. She is always looking over my shoulder, she will straight up yank my laptop away from me and look at what I'm typing, if my phone goes off she goes ""oooh who is that?!"" and things of that nature. I've gently tried to explain to her that I don't want her touching my stuff like that, she'll say stuff like ""oh, well I'm an open book, it's no big deal!"" When I've explained less gently to her, she borderline cries and gets into an anxiety loop where she accuses me of being mean and/or mad at her.

I'm currently in a long-distance relationship and my boyfriend and I rely a lot on sexting to keep our relationship fun. He's in a different time zone, so the things I send him at night won't get responses until the next morning some times. Today I noticed he was sending me (text) responses to photos I had taken last night about what they made him want to do with me. I want to point out quickly that there were no kids in the room at this time, and even if one had wandered in, they're too short to get my phone and too young to read. I decided to leave my phone on a tall standing desk by my own laptop while going to get a cup of coffee, knowing my coteacher would probably look at it.

When I got back, my coteacher told me in a very serious voice that I need to be careful about what I am doing at work because she saw my disgusting and inappropriate texts. I told her she wouldn't have seen them if she hadn't been looking for them, and she said that wasn't the point, that she felt sexually harassed but wouldn't go to HR about it ""because the children wouldn't be able to handle a change in teachers.""

17h8pmw,AITA for telling my husband he doesn't deserve to be a father because he wasn't excited to be in the delivery room with me?,"My (26f) husband (29m) have been together for 4 years and I am currently pregnant with our first child due in the next couple of weeks.

When I got pregnant, I told my husband I wanted my sister (29f) to be in the delivery room with me. My sister is my best friend and I wanted to share this moment with her. Because the hospital we're going to has pretty small delivery rooms, mothers are allowed only 1 birthing partner. My husband was upset and kept asking me to reconsider because he wanted us to meet our child together. I understood where he was coming from but I was firm that I wanted my sister there and her support. He eventually got over it and I thought it was a thing of the past.

A few days ago however, my BIL's father passed away in his native country so both he and my sister travelled there for the funeral. Since this happened all of a sudden, my sister told me she is not sure she can make it back for the birth and needs to help her husband and his family sort through the estate. I was disappointed of course. I told my husband he could in the room with me. He just replied 'ok'.

That caught me off guard because he really wanted to be in the room when we talked about it a few months ago. I told him I thought he would be more excited. He said he's just my ""sloppy seconds"". I asked him what's that supposed to mean. He said I value my sister more than him and only see him as a backup because my sister can't help me out. I told him that's not true but then he brought up how my sister values her husband more than me and I should learn how to treat him from her. This started an argument and since then he's been a bit cold towards me. I talked to my best friend and she said I was wrong to ask my sister to be in the room before my husband.

17hywgh,WIBTA for yelling at my spouse for leaving me alone in the car to hike?,"I got a minor medical procedure last week following a medical treatment involving lots of meds with hefty side effects. The side effects and healing process from the procedure are at their worst yesterday and today. I'm not supposed to do anything strenuous including hiking, kicking, jumping, or running for two weeks. 

My in-laws came into town for a week and we haven't seen them in 9 months. My spouse booked a reservation for a tour at a national park a few months ago, not knowing I would be undergoing this medical treatment.

On the 3 hour car ride to the town with the national park, my spouse decided he wanted to stop by an additional national park to hike. This is a national park we hiked at previously last year. I was not feeling well. They went to hike while I waited in the car. I was annoyed but it wasn't a big deal.

Today, after a hotel stay, we went on the tour. It involved hiking 3 miles downhill mostly. I was mostly fine but in pain towards the end. To my surprise, my spouse decides to go on another hike at the national park from yesterday. It's a 4 mile hike. I'm in too much pain from the 3 mile hike I wasn't supposed to do in the first place today. I say I don't think it's fair to ditch me in the car alone like this. They all leave anyway.

I'm currently alone in the car by myself and shocked I have signal. I'm pissed and I don't think I plan on talking to them the rest of the day. I'm tempted to just take the car and drive off.. I feel like it's extremely selfish to ditch me here at a park only a couple hours away from home which we've all been to before, not just yesterday, but previously when I was able to hike.

17ioa5q,AITA For Not Giving Stuff To People Having a Second Kid?,"I got SO MUCH of the same stuff that are extras and I'm trying to sell them on Marketplace for some extra cash because we are struggling a bit right now, as bfs hours may change.

My MIL informed me of someone in the family who is expecting a baby any day now *this was a few weeks ago, she's now had the baby, which is apparently their second or third kid, according to my Bf* 

My daughter is now in size 4 diapers and we had a package of 3s left, I have no problem with her bringing that to the family member, I've given away free diapers before just because our baby shower had an amazing turnout and we didn't need to buy diapers until the 5month mark. 

Anyway, my MIL sees me listing this bundle, it includes 3 teethers, a toy I have THREE of, and do not need another of, and a 3 month clothing item. I'm selling it for $15, which is cheap considering the entire bundle is $30-$40. I also said I'm giving away more 0-3 or 3-6 freebies if they buy the bundle. Kids are expensive, kids!! 

She calls me, furious that I didn't think to give the bundle to the family considering they have a girl. I asked my boyfriend beforehand if it's their first kid, or second? I feel that that matters mostly because it shows they either do, or don't need it. My MIL is PISSED saying ""How dare you assume they can't afford this child! How stupid do you think they are!?"" I tell her, I'm sorry, but when people plan to have a second (third???) Child together, typically they make sure they can afford it. I also have over 11 listings to try and bring in around $70, I want to give my daughter a fantastic birthday/Christmas.

She's not happy I'm not giving away the bundle. So, AITA?

Edit; OK, I'm getting mixed responses here saying I'm TA about my attitude towards having second children. In my opinion, if you can't afford kids, you should not have them. So many women/families can/are living off of welfare with 6+ kids being neglected. Also *huge disclaimer* I'm not just giving away gifts from the baby shower. I'm giving away all the extras or things that simply do not and will not fit. She has at least 100 outfits, many of which are duplicates! 

Edit #2, I guess since people don't understand what i am saying; 
I am solely referring to people who legitimately take advantage of the system, people who are drug addicts with no business having children (hiya, that's me, I was born to a drug addict and adopted!) People who FAKE disabilities, people who sell their food stamps, I could keep going on. Because it's very true people take advantage of the system. I am not one of those people. I am trying to get on disability and also still work part time to provide, due to a chronic illness that popped up immediately after pregnancy and hasn't ceased since. I understand why people would find me to be a hypocrite, but when I say we have so and so to our name, this is genuinely the first time it has ever happened, as my free phone STB and I need a phone plan; it's not like I'm a lot of people, who DONT use protection then are shocked Pikachu face that they're not invincible to getting pregnant, and, again, up until this point we've had assistance such as snap, wic, medicaid, and hopefully soon SSDI. 

Edit #3; I see what many of you are saying and why my attitude about eugenics is wrong. One person even said I as being racist (????????) It's definitely hypocrisy, but at the end of the day, the entire reason I'm not giving these people the things I'm selling is because #1, ive never met them, #2, bf has never met them, #3, I already gave them a package of diapers, and #4 I automatically assume if this IS their second or third kid... well, then, you would hope that they would still have some things leftover from the first, money saved up, (ik, ik, hypocrisy because for the first time ever we are struggling.

17jee5t,AITA for expecting a full refund for my daughter’s birthday cake.,"Today was my daughters 2nd birthday party, I went with a new girl that was recommended to be for the dessert. When I spoke to her over a month ago I sent her two different examples of what I wanted both decently easy. Price was not an issue, we would have paid whatever was quoted. 

We settled on an option for a 35 person 1 tier cake (marble cake with pink and white frosting with some glitter and white chocolate ghosts on it) and 40 ghost cake pops wrapped for part of the party favors. The quote including deliver was $180. We have been in contact almost every day this week confirming all the details. 

She was supposed to deliver it today at 9:30am to the party venue. Delivery cost was included. I paid in full in advance, and added a tip. $200 total. At about 9:45am she texted me that she was running about 40mins to an hour late, and would not be bringing the cake pops at all due to “an issue” and would refund us for them. At this post we are already at the party and guests are walking in, my husband ran to giant next door and grabbed plain cupcakes as a last minute resort. 

She finally arrived at almost 11am with a cake that looked nothing like discussed and was not even decorated as it should have been. She put the cake down and ran out of the venue. I texted her multiple times for a refund with no answer, she has since blocked me on all social media, and sent me $100 refund (half the total amount) the cake was awful and after cutting into it and trying it we ended up telling the venue to just trash it and went with the cupcakes instead.

17jfokn,AITA for signing away a house to my baby mama even after finding out she put me on child support?,"The mortgage is in her name but she put my name on the deed when our son was born. We were pretty much in agreement that it was her house. 4 years later, I keep our son on the weekends.

3 months ago, BM lost her job. She had me sign a piece of paper that said, handwritten, “I no long live at this address” because she can’t get public assistance unless she has proof we don’t live together.

My gf, who works in child support, says that she’s trying to put me in child support. BM had always said she’d never do that, but then my gf showed me the statues and. I ran this by BM and she said she withdrew the application when she found out.

Weeks later, BM says she can’t get mortgage assistance unless my name is off the deed. My gf says that something seems off. I signed the docs anyway, but BM told me the sig wasn’t valid so we agree to meet again to re-sign.

The morning of, my gf says “i just got an email that a letter addressed to you from DSS is on its way”. I text BM. She says she got a call about it and was gonna tell you about it this evening and says it’s probably just a notice, and that if she wanted me on it, she wouldve done it by now. My gf says she’s BSing and explicitly tells me NOT to sign the deed over. Says that I need to file for 50/50 custody. Gf tells me to call DSS asap.

Gf texts me an hour later with a voice memo with a rep from public housing assistance saying I do NOT have to be off the deed for BM to get mortgage assistance. I call DSS back and find that BM deliberately went and submitted the child support application. Gf tells me to stop all contact with BM and that this is now a legal issue.

But none of this was consistent with what I knew about BM. I called BM and she admitted to everything, but said she didn’t know about not having to have me off the deed. She said she is only using public assistance until next week, and then she is revoking the child support case. None of that explained why she had to have me off the deed nor why she deliberately put in a child support application. I stated that because i don’t NEED to be off the deed, I will wait to sign it over. She hit me with “so now you’re trying to withhold my own house from me?” And knowing her, if I pissed her off by not signing it, she would keep me on child support permanently.

My gf argued that I shouldn’t give up the only asset that may help pay off the child support one day. I asked my family and coworkers and they disagreed. Saying trusting her is my best option and that it’d be best to sign over the deed to keep the peace.

My gf said my BM controls me and that I am spineless and that I had no reason to give away the only asset I had. She even went all the way to say that she felt betrayed and that I chose to appease my BM over protecting our household finances. We have been fighting all weekend, but I genuinely felt like I did the morally right thing, as well as the only thing that’ll make BM drop the child support case.",throwRAbowlofchow,3231,0.8500000238418579,2264,1698622012,2023-10-29 18:26:52,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jfokn/aita_for_signing_away_a_house_to_my_baby_mama/,10,2023
17k5zqa,WIBTA if I get married in my friend’s wedding dress?,"I (29F) am getting married next May to my boyfriend of 11 years (29M). We have been engaged since the birth of our kid 5 years ago. Due to a number of circumstances, chiefly finances, we have had a long engagement.

I have been friends with Caitlyn (31F) since grade school, and although we are not “best friends” we have had a long and joyful friendship that means a lot to me. I went to Caitlyn’s wedding to her college sweetheart, which happened when she was freshly graduated at 23.

Unfortunately, her husband was found in a bathroom stall with his coworker at the reception. My heart broke for her, and I was part of her support system in the aftermath. She is now happily remarried with two kids of her own.

In planning my wedding, the one thing I’ve been struggling with for years is the dress. My body image is poor, and I have an unusually large chest that makes all clothes shopping awful. But I went thrift shopping last week, and found THE DRESS. It was everything I could have dreamed of, and it FITS ME! I literally fell to my knees crying in the dressing room. Right away, I sent a photo to everyone I could think of, including Caitlyn. She called me immediately. I didn’t see it then, but when I got home, I saw that I had multiple missed calls and texts from Caitlyn.

So, it’s her wedding dress from her marriage to her ex. Apparently, she finally decided to let go of it. Since it was so long ago, I genuinely didn’t recognize it. It’s also not as if she goes around parading her wedding photos. Once she said it, I remembered right away. It also made sense, as one of the things she and I bond over is boob size. I tried to laugh it off, but she said, “I’m sure they’ll let you return it, under the circumstances.” I felt sick to my stomach because it was obvious she didn’t want me to wear the dress, and I was already super attached to it.

I stopped engaging for the rest of the night and talked it over with my fiancé and some other friends. Opinions are split. Some know how hard this process has been for me, and think Caitlyn is being petty. Honestly, I don’t. I get where she’s coming from. But I literally cannot keep looking. And it was $30. I have a 5 year old. I would love to spend wedding dress money on her instead.

Some say that it’s not only a bad omen, but disrespectful to ask Caitlyn to look at me in her dress. Imo, Caitlyn has moved on and has a family. If the roles were reversed, I would be thrilled for her. That said, I do understand that I could be the AH by reminding a friend I do love of one of the worst day of her life.

I tried talking to her about it the next day, but she has been firm on not attending my wedding if I wear the dress. She actually said she is rethinking the friendship in general. I am gutted, and don’t really think that’s fair. I would love to find a solution that allows me to keep the dress and my friend, which is why I am posting here. AITA?

17k7mvl,AITA for telling my husband to talk to his mother re: our newborn,"My husband and I just had our first child together after a couple years of trying and dealing with infertility. Our son came early, a month and a half - we spent three weeks in the NICU and it was a very emotional time for me/us.

Fast forward and we are now home and getting used to everyday life with a baby. We have been getting visitors pretty often compared to what we’re used to, and his parents come every couple of days. 

Lately, I have had extreme anxiety when they come over because his mother has been incredibly overbearing to a point where I feel insulted. Each time they visit, she is constantly staring and analyzing how I am taking care of my child and making comments on what I “should” be doing or what she would do. Mind you, my husband was born in the 80s and she has not taken care of a baby since. This came to a head the other night when she flipped out on me for sitting my child up to burp him. She for some reason believes you can’t do that to a newborn, even though it’s exactly how they showed us on the NICU. It would have been one thing if she actually had advice, but what she was saying made no sense and how she said it to me was incredibly rude and condescending. She also went on to comment on how he was dressed (not enough layers), how he was being fed (because he was drooling), and kept calling him by his middle name (see below).

I’m not a confrontational person, so when they left I asked my husband to talk to her re: her behavior. My husband also did not stick up for me as any of this was happening. This quickly spiraled into an argument, which yes is partly my fault because I was so heated about my MIL, and he told me that I’m overreacting, constantly miserable around them and I should “get over it”. Now he is saying that he wants to move out and raise our child separately.

I do want to add my husband and his parents are from a different country. They have lived in the US most of his life, but there are barriers at time culturally. Regardless, I’d like to know if I’m TA and overreacting - is this “just how I’m laws are”?

Last add: while my husbands reaction is extreme, other things I “complained” to him about my in laws leading up to this: his mother telling me I gave birth “the easy way” (emergency c-section), his father for some reason feeling comfortable grilling me about breastfeeding (I’m not for multiple reasons), his mother texting me two days after giving birth asking me not to name our child the name we DID end up choosing bc she does not like it (now she refuses to call him by anything but his middle name), his parents questioning what I was doing that caused our son to come early..",DreamerInTheThreads,3639,0.959999978542328,368,1698710363,2023-10-30 18:59:23,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17k7mvl/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_talk_to_his_mother/,10,2023
17kwlaj,AITA for not letting my husband shower when he wants?,"Mostly SAHM of two kids here, ages one and three. I work two days a week at most, usually only one. Most of the time I'm home with them.

My husband is a blue collar worker in construction. He works long days, his job is pretty physical, and he works really hard. He gets up at 5am and gets home by 630. My days are usually around the same, give or take an extra hour in the morning.

Every single day my husband gets home, he wants to go to the bathroom and take a shower the second he gets in the driveway. This would be one thing if he was quick--but he takes at least 25 minutes on the toilet and 25 minute showers, and I cannot start dinner with the kids hanging off my legs. They just scream and cry every single time. I've started to ask him to wait until they go to bed, given I really only have a 2 hour window to get dinner ready, eat, clean up the dishes, clean up their chairs, get them ready for bed, get them baths etc.

He complied at first, but he's now telling me it's very unfair to ask him to sit in dirty clothes and be a sweaty mess for two hours until they get to bed. Which I understand it's uncomfortable, but you know...I've just been alone with the kids for 13 hours straight. Every day. I have stuff I still need to get done, too. My kids are in their tantrum phase as well, which has been really hard. 

He got really snippy with me today and said I was being incredibly selfish when I asked him to wait. I said I felt he was being selfish by running to the bathroom for almost an hour every time he gets home when he *knows* I have stuff to get done, too.

17ky8my,AITA for telling my daughter she needs to get over me grounding her as a teenager?,"When my daughter (now 26F) was 17, I left her home alone for a week while I was on a business trip; while I was away, she threw a party behind my back which ended with her and her drunk, underage friends trashing a significant part of the house inside and out. All told, they did a few thousand dollars in damage (including two broken TVs and damage to the car); the place looked like a warzone, or the aftermath of a bad teen movie. So, I told her she would have to pay me back, and that she was grounded until she did; no electronics outside of schoolwork, strict curfew, no friends over and absolutely no more parties, and she had to get a part-time job to start paying off her mistake.    
    
I wanted to teach her to take responsibility for what she'd done, and that meant no exceptions to the rule. It isolated her from her friends, I admit, but that was the consequence. She hadn't paid me back by the time prom came around; she tried to persuade me to let her go, but I was firm. She was basically grounded right up until she moved out.    
    
The thing is, she's basically resented me ever since. It feels like we haven't had a single pleasant conversation in nine damn years; she refused her college fund because she didn't want anything from me (she chose not to go to college at all - she went full-time at her job after HS); and even now it feels like every other conversation we have is her complaining about her senior year and how unfair I was. I've tried getting her to understand it was her own consequence, that I did it because I love her, the works, but she's still convinced it was all just me being awful.    
    
What's really brought things to a head is that recently her and her boyfriend had their first child. I've offered to help with anything they need, but I've been rebuffed at every turn, and when I asked if they were sure my daugher blew up on me. Apparently I'm not allowed to see my own granddaughter until I ""accept that how I treated my daugher is wrong"" and apologise for grounding her and forcing her to miss prom; my own kid told me that until I did that, she didn't trust me to look after or even be around her child in case I treat them ""the same way"".    
    
I told her that was enough; that of course I'd never be cruel to a baby or young child, that the punishment she earned was appropriate, and that she needed to accept she ruined her own damn senior year by being immature and doing things behind my back. In response, I got a long text from her and another from her boyfriend about how I'm an asshole and apparently I ""haven't changed"", and how I'll never be in their kid's life now. I've been talking about it with some close friends since, and while some of them are on my side, others have said I was too harsh on my kid at the time and that she's allowed to be upset. I've also had angry messages from some other family members about it, as well as some of support; it seems everyone's picking sides now.

First we thought about what they needed so we gave them that. Study table for her sister, washing machine for her mom, an AC for my mom, fridge for my parents house, etc. Then I invited my parents and hers on separate days to ask what they’d like to have and make a list for us. The lists came out that everybody wanted everything. 

Then we made our decision together and told them who gets what which of course isn’t ideal for either party. 

Now both my parents and hers are appealing to emotional side of us, telling each of us how the other one is facilitating their family more. They also claim they are not materialistic but the other family is. At the end of it, both sides are unhappy and both sides are blaming me for inequitable division. Her family thinks I took advantage of her and didn’t value her efforts. My family thinks my in-laws are materialistic and taking my hard earned money and things for granted. Today it got to a point that her mom is telling her how unfair and unfaithful I’m to her and she’s better off without me and my family is actively hostile to my wife and my dad told me to divorce her today.

17n6ozb,AITA for ruining my wife’s friendship?,"My wife(34F) and her friend have been friends since high school. They are pretty close and she was a bridesmaid for our wedding. Recently another friend invited them to go to Italy to their family’s vineyard as their family was going to Spain for the month. So accommodations are free but the flight, food etc were extra. They left for 2 weeks. 

I was not aware of this trip until a month before it was suppose to happen(they booked it 2 months out). Recently I lost my job and had to get another one. It pays around half what my job originally did (120k>66k). My wife only has cashier experience and barely makes more money than it would be worth it for her to work as we have 2 kids (4 and 1). My wife isn’t the best with money, she does spend without thinking and she agreed to this trip without telling me. She had to beg her mom to look after the kids after she said yes to the trip and her friends booked the tickets. Her mom is from another city and came to live with me for 2 weeks as I had to work and couldn’t take care of them when I’m working.

I was extremely mad at her but allowed her to go as I know she’s been depressed since the baby and it was too late anyway. She asked her friend to cover her for the flight and she would pay her back. I knew it was hard for us to pay her friend back but it was a non refundable anyway.

She came back from the trip very happy until her friend asked for the flights. She had spent $1400 on the trip not including the flight and her friend wanted the $1200 that was the cost of the flight that she had put onto her credit card. We had $300 left in our account and already have credit card debt. We are thinking of downsizing our house to an apartment but it’s hard because as soon as landlords hear that we have kids they don’t want to talk anymore. It really sucks but I told her we can’t pay her friend back until I get a better job.

It’s been 3 months since the trip and her friend is getting angry because she promised to pay it back and we no longer have money. It’s not like her friend needs the money back, she makes six figures and has a house already, she’s not struggling. I told my wife we don’t have enough to pay her back and she will have to explain to her friend. They clearly did not have a good conversation as her friend blocked her and told their other friends about her refusing to pay her back. She cried and is mad at me for losing my job (I was laid off I had no choice) and I got mad at her and told her to get a job then because I’m trying my best.",Working_Ad639,2947,0.9300000071525574,962,1699049920,2023-11-03 17:18:40,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17n6ozb/aita_for_ruining_my_wifes_friendship/,11,2023

17n7q7t,AITA for telling my BIL to leave my children alone?,"My wife and I have 3 children and this situation involves our 2 oldest. Back when they were young, we had crazy work schedules. On the other hand, her brother has a job and position where he can come and go as he please so he helped with our children. The three of us took turns taking the kids to school and picking them up. The kids sometimes stayed with him for a day or two. When they grew older, our work schedules stabilized so we didn’t rely on him as much. However, the kids are incredibly attached to their uncle to the point it seems like I’m being replaced.

Once when our daughter ran out of panty liners, she called her uncle to ask him to pick her up some. My wife was at work but I was working in the yard and she didn’t think to ask me. A year ago our son was questioning his sexual identity and instead of coming to me or his mother, he went to talk to his uncle and then my BIL told my wife about their conversation. I was the last to know about it. On our daughter’s last birthday, she was most excited about his gift because he got her the exact model and color tennis racket she wanted. She didn’t take a second look at my present. The last straw happened earlier today when our son was sick at school.

Instead of calling me or his mother, he called his uncle. BIL texted us about the situation and asked my wife to call the school so that he could pick up our son. I was home and no one asked me to do it. I was very angry when BIL dropped our son off. I confronted him about over stepping our family boundaries and we got into an argument. I told him to leave our house and leave our children alone. My wife just got home from work and we got into an argument. She doesn’t like the way I talked to her brother but I don’t like the way I’m being left out of my children’s life. She said we’re lucky to have him help us out but I don’t want his help anymore.

When I asked her where he really was she gave me a confused look. When I realized she was serious I told her to give him his phone back. I told her she was not to punish him for any reason even if it was justified. She told me that was stupid and she should have equal say. This might make me an asshole but I laughed at her response and told her that was the dumbest thing I heard. I told her just because she’s his new stepmother doesn’t mean she gets equal say in punishment, especially if she’s going to wrongfully punish him. She told me a b is nothing to be proud of. I told her that’s subjective and I doubt he is proud of it. She called me an asshole for not letting her be a mom.

17nyame,AITA for saying what I said to my sister because her and my wife are leaving me out of their trip and expecting me to pay the bills when they are gone,"
I (29m) and my wife (27f) moved into my sister's (31f) house about 8 months ago when I lost my job, against my will. My wife decided that we couldn't afford our life anymore despite her making a sizeable income and accepted my sister's invitation to move in, and has been spilting the bills with my sister since. Even though we are only two people and she has her children (3m and 6f) in the house as well so should be paying for 3 peoples portions, which I've mentioned several times.

  Yesterday they told me that in December they are going on vacation for two weeks. My wife, my sister, my sister's kids, and my sister's boyfriend.  When I questioned why I wasn't invited my sister rolled her eyes (passive aggressive as always) and my wife said that since I didn't have a form of income that I wouldn't be able to afford it, but they know that if I had enough time in advance I could've lent money from my mother, which is why I suspect they hadn't told me sooner but they say they just decided.

   I told them that it was completely unfair to go on a trip now that I have no money and never before when I could've come too. My sister loudly, i assume to embarrass me (this was in the front yard), implied I wasnt trying hard enough to get a job even though I have been trying and even louder told me not to go begging to mom. My mother doesn't mind lending me money she usually says don't even worry about it,  and I think they left it to now because she doesn't make a lot so if I need to borrow that much i need to let her now a couple months in advance.
  
  I asked my wife if I could get some help from her if I could get the plane ticket covered by my mother, and she insisted she couldn't despite her large savings account (it was over 10k last year) so now I'm thinking they just don't want me there and I got upset and here's where I may be the asshole I said maybe if she wasn't covering half the bills while my sister is not paying appropriately for her children's power and water usage she'd have the extra.

  My sister blew up and screamed at me for what was probably minutes, calling me a loser and a bum and many other hurtful things and said that if angry about whos using what i can pay the bills for the 2 weeks they are gone, despite me obviously not having the income to.

I didn't see a problem however whenever I left a woman (about 30 or so) started telling me off, saying that I was ""a disgusting ableist for using the disabled bathroom without a disability"" I tried to explain that tourettes was a disability but she wasn't hearing it, I told her if she needed to use the bathroom she could and I was sorry if I inconvinenced her, but she told me that she didn't need the disabled bathroom because she ""wasn't disabled and didn't want to take those resources like I did""

I ended up walking away but she got a member of staff and the staff member asked for my proof of diagnosis, I didn't carry it with me and I explained that, the member of staff ended up telling me off and not to use the bathroom, and any time I ticked throughout this, she'd point at me and go ""she's doing it again!!"" 

But now I'm not sure whether I made the right choice in using the disabled bathroom for my own comfort without a physical disability

17q6i3h,AITA for not wanting my MIL to fly over to visit when my baby is born?,"My MIL has no job, no savings, no husband, and lives in a different country. She divorced my FIL when my husband was a kid and have only remained in touch via Facebook. When she heard my husband and I were getting married she started messaging my husband more and more often and was telling him everyday how he is her favorite son (my husband has several half siblings -same mother different fathers). My husband paid for her trip to our wedding because she allegedly told him that her money was “tied up” at the time. 

Fast forward to now, we are expecting a baby in the new year. When she heard the news she immediately told my husband that she’s going to visit us to take care of the baby. When I heard my anxiety just went through the roof. 

1. I don’t want “help” from her. If anything I would rather have my mom here - I have no plans on entertaining this woman while I am recovering from child birth and learning to be a first time mom, especially when my husband has decided not to take any paternity leave 
2. She will somehow need us to pay for her trip here AND the food while she’s here - my husband and I are already worried about living on a single income while I am on leave 
3. I have a gut feeling that once she is here, she will never leave and we will be stuck

17q8foj,AITA for reporting my kid's teacher for being stupid?,"I got a call from my son's school on Thursday that he was being taken to the ER. His PE class was playing baseball and he got hit in the face with a ball and got knocked out. 

Fortunately the ball was a soft foamy texture. He had CT, MRI, and a host of other exams. They diagnosed him with a slight concussion and had a gnarly black eye and abrasions on his cheek. 

He was cleared to go back to school and looked a little fucked up. Everyone knew what happened and some of his teachers emailed us to see how he was doing. We emailed them to keep an eye on him.

Today my son came home and said his teacher asked what happened to his face. He was confused. Like everyone knew. He's a 6th grader and even the 7th and 8th graders and their teachers knew. The fucking ambulance came to the school.

His teacher held him at lunch  today. Ms. D said he could tell her the truth because his face didn't look like a baseball hit it but ""someone"" did. He said no, it was a baseball. She asked how he was being treated at home. He said fine. She said she didn't believe his story and would have to tell the principal. My son said okay.

When my son told me this, I started to laugh. No way is his teacher this fucking dumb. Well, sure enough I get an email a couple of hours later from the VP saying a staff member submitted a report that they were suspicious of my son's face. The VP assured the staff that it was from an injury at school. Like everyone knew.

I was so mad that I emailed Ms. D and told her I knew she submitted this report trying to start shit. How could she be that fucking stupid? She knew about the accident but she didn't think a baseball to the face would leave a blackeye. This caused all of us so much needless stress. I think she was trying to get brownie points and look busy. 

I also replied to the VP that my son now has extreme anxiety going back to her class and we're worried that he'll start experiencing headaches from being stressed out over his dumbass teacher. This could had gone real bad. He replied that he was taking this seriously and she won't be in my son's 3rd period class tomorrow.

He is constantly complaining about my two kids and how they always do the bear minimum when it comes to chores. But never says anything to his son about his chore being done minimal. For example he was complaining to me about my daughter's (F13) clothes still being in a basket in her room but has said nothing to his son (M14) about the clothes that are all over his room and not even in a basket. He also complains my daughter is on her phone to much mean while his son is on the Xbox from the time he gets off school (he is in a video game club at school and stays after twice a week to play games but even on the days he don't stay he comes home and jumps on) until it is tome to shower which he has to be told to do. Mean while I work a full time job and deal with all the finances and he is a stay at home dad. I then come home and have to finish the dishes that are not done and sort through the laundry that he has washed that day and give the kids theirs then fold the towels and my own clothes.

17qxw6f,AITA for giving my adult daughter money to make up for missing out on her senior trip?,"I have three kids we'll call Brock (24M), Misty (21F), and Ash (19F).

Misty graduated from high school in 2020.  Due to world events, her senior year was spent at home.  Things like her senior trip, spring break, and prom got cancelled.  Her school never planned a ""make up"" trip or prom for her year and instead went back to business for the class of 2021. 

Misty, props to her, never complained about it.  She accepted things with a sense of resignation, if that makes sense.  Regardless, I can see that it hurt her to see her brother and sister get to do the things she couldn't do.

A few weeks ago, Misty reached out and asked if I can help her out with something.  Her favorite actor is going to be performing on Broadway next spring and she desperately wants to see that show.  She's in college and has a job, but needs help paying for a ticket.    

She made it clear that I didn't have to pay her if I didn't want to.  But given what happened three years ago and how she took it, I felt bad for her.  What she went through wasn't fair.

So I bought Misty a ticket for opening night.  It was expensive, yes, but frankly it was about the same amount that was spent for Ash's prom or Brock's letterman jacket and banquet.  

My husband doesn't agree.  He thinks that I'm spoiling Misty.  He doesn't see how it's fair to give our adult daughter money for a trip but not do the same for the other kids.  To him, what happened in 2020 happened in 2020 and you can't do anything to fix it.  

I disagree.  Brock and Ash got to go on trips, banquets, and prom for their senior year and Misty spent hers under lockdown.  She really had nothing to commemorate senior year.  And if anything, the money I spent on her ticket came out to less than all of the senior year expenses for either of our other children.  

I need an outside perspective.  AITA?  Or is my husband in the wrong?

One of the moms that works full-time mentioned about how they had started to pay for a cleaner to come in every other week. They both work full-time and have two kids and were finding they couldn't keep up with all the chores. 

The other SAHM was agreeing with her about finding it difficult to keep the house clean when her husband does only a few chores inside the house. She told us her husband's main jobs are cooking dinner, cleaning the bathrooms, and looking after the yard. 

In my opinion that's a more than fair distribution of chores considering her husband works full-time. They have one child (10F) and no pets. I mentioned to her that it actually sounded pretty fair and that my husband has zero cleaning chores and mostly only cooks on the weekends if he wants. 

I told her as he works full-time to provide for our family, I consider it my job to do the majority of the household chores. This isn't gender related in my opinion, if we both worked I would agree about splitting chores equally or if I worked and he didn't I would be expecting him to do the majority of the housework. I have five children, the youngest two aren't in school and I'm a carer for my husband's grandmother yet still it's easy to set aside a couple hours a day for household chores. 

She strongly disagreed with me and she thinks her husband should be doing more and told me couples should split housework equally. I told her that I think she's being ungrateful to her husband who allows her to be a SAHM even now their child is older. 

In the end lunch was ruined, she called me anti-feminist and an asshole. Two of our friends took her side telling me off for judging her(?). Was I the asshole here? I feel like I was pointing out the obvious.",Responsible-Crazy465,4791,0.8399999737739563,3342,1699486501,2023-11-08 17:35:01,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qz4iv/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_is_ungrateful/,11,2023
17qzhj8,AITA for raising my voice and saying my husband's nephew was being unthinking and selfish?,"My husband (26M) and I watch his nephew Seth (10) one weekend a month while my husband's sister Anna (30F) works extra or takes a weekend to herself. She's a single mom, so the family tries to help her when possible. My husband and I agree that both Seth and Anna are very self-centered. When we can, we try to help Seth learn to see other's perspectives and break out of his self-centered-ness, while acknowledging that he is 10 and this can be a challenge for a child. We had him an extra day yesterday because we were both off work and he was out of school.

We limit the beverages Seth has at our apartment. If he wants something to drink that's not a cup of water, one of us has to get it for him. This is because we've caught him guzzling multiple sodas in a matter of minutes after telling him he can have *one*, or he'll drink our chocolate milk from the carton, etc. He can't control himself with sugary beverages.

We had just finished eating lunch and Seth asked if he could have a cup of milk. My husband said he would get him one in a few minutes. Unfortunately, my husband ended up blacking out and had a short convulsive episode This happens occasionally, so I tried to keep myself together to get him on his side, time it, etc. I was also trying to tell Seth to leave the room until it was over because it's distressing to see, but Seth stayed in the room. Thankfully, my husband woke up right after the episode subsided. He was alert but said he wanted to lie on the floor for a while. As I was getting him a pillow, Seth asked my husband, ""Well, can you get my milk first?""

My husband didn't respond to him, but I did. I pulled him into the kitchen (where I could still keep an eye on hubby) and told him he was being ""unthinking and selfish."" I will admit my voice was raised, in part due to the stress of the moment leaving my body but also, admittedly, out of anger at Seth. I permitted him to get his own milk for the moment because I thought I would lose my cool if he asked again.

Anna apparently heard of this after Seth went back home. She has been going back and forth with me and my husband through text (and one very angry voicemail) saying how dare I scream at her son (which I did not do) and how it was our fault for having ""stupid rules"" for him. My in-laws are trying to play referee but they want me to apologize to Anna because ""it would make things easier for everyone if she wasn't angry."" I said it would be easier for everyone if Seth (and Anna) were taught to be a little less selfish. She hasn't shown any interest in how her brother is doing.

17rpk5j,AITA for telling my friend we don’t care about pics of her cats right now?,"I (29m) am going on an early group “Friendsgiving” trip to Colorado in five days. All together there are five of us going but the one person I may have been an AH to is Sarah (28f). We have a group chat where we discuss planning for the trip and we all agreed to keep this chat exclusive to trip info so we don’t have important info being buried by random conversations. Two days ago we found out our Air BNB was canceled due to snow damage breaking a hole in the ceiling and we’d been scrambling to find a new place to stay. We couldn’t find another Air BNB so we settled for two, joining, rooms at a hotel that Sarah managed to find a deal for. We asked Sarah to text us the info for the hotel and she said she would, five minutes go by and instead of the hotel info we get a bunch of pictures of her two cats as well as a video with the caption “My two widdle fur babies are so precious, I’m gonna miss them so much.” Another friend reminded her to keep the chat relevant to trip info and asked again for the hotel information. Sarah replied with “Well screw me for missing my cats.”

Here’s where I may be the AH; I replied with “Sarah I’m sorry but we don’t care about your cats right now, when we’re trying to put our trip back together, can you please send the hotel info?” She sent the info and tagged it with a “F*ck you” to which she’s received heat from everyone who will be attending the trip. She has since apologized but I feel like my comment has put a damper on the vacation before it’s even started, AITAH for saying what I did?

Edit to add: All five of us were looking in to new hotels or Air BNBs, Sarah just happened to be the first one to find a good deal on something that we all agreed on, she wasn’t the only one looking.

Edit 2: To answer the question I’ve been seeing asked; why was it so urgent we get the information if we had five days. I apologize but I misspoke in the post. Sarah hadn’t actually booked it, she found a deal for it on one of those booking sites and we needed her to send it so the guy handling finances could pay for it.",AITAH_Viewer,2444,0.9200000166893004,251,1699570644,2023-11-09 16:57:24,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rpk5j/aita_for_telling_my_friend_we_dont_care_about/,11,2023
17rpoot,AITA for showing up to the wedding even after bride said she didn't want me there?,"This involves me, JJ (Bride) and Calvin (groom). 

Calvin and I grew up together as sandbox kids/neighbors. Took baths together, spent every waking moment of the first 14 years of our life together from preschool to trips our parents would take us on. Our parents always said we were destined to get married and even as kids, Calvin would always say I'd be the one he'd get married to. High school, we grew apart. There was no bad blood, we just had different interests and I was an unattractive nerd while he was star of the football team as cliché as it sounds. We'd still see each other on occasion through holiday parties and neighborhood dinners. 

Now we're 30. I feel much better about myself and have found success in my single life. Calvin then announced he was engaged a year ago to JJ. There was a holiday party with our families again and my parents went (I was out of town). Apparently both families and Calvin mentioned me when sharing his baby photos and that they always thought it would be us engaged. It didn't seem to be in a bad way, just kind of a joke. According to my mom, afterwards, JJ seemed to be really intimidated by me and the past. 

Apparently the families are still hanging onto the idea that I still wanted to marry Calvin. Sure, I was a tiny bit disappointed but it was like letting go of a childhood crush on Peter Pan, I'm not heartbroken about it and don't feel like anything was taken from me. 

Move on to JJ. She found me on facebook and contacted me saying that she would appreciate if I didn't go to the wedding because she saw me as an 'ex' despite us never having a relationship. I left it on read and went anyway to support my friend and he was thankful I was there. Wished them well at the dinner table and went back to minding my own business and chatting with the other neighbors, Calvin's family, etc. 

JJ reached out to me again and told me she was really disappointed in me and that me being there ruined her image of having a perfect wedding. I haven't shared this with anyone and don't think I will. I don't feel close enough to Calvin anymore to put a damper on his relationship. She seemed nice enough from what everyone's said, so that had me thinking if I really did ruin her wedding by being an AH and showing up anyway.

17rqn50,AITA for asking Future MIL not to tell my toddler they make her sad?,"My (28F) oldest son is 3yo My fiancé’s (32M) Mom came over few weeks ago & when leaving, asked my 3yo for a hug. He initially said “no” & walked away. Came back unprompted & hugged her. She said “oh good bc I was going to be sad”. W my fiancé’s, aunt’s &bestfriend’s edits, I sent her this:

(Summed up):
“We’re teaching 3yo that he’s in control of his own body & self-defined boundaries regardless of how it makes someone feel. If he’s trying to make someone upset on purpose, that’s a different story. We don’t want him to go against his boundaries to make someone feel better. I’m sure you just want to show he’s important to you but we’d appreciate it if you could show it in a different way.”

FMIL: “OP, I’d appreciate you not sending me these kinds of messages and we have these conversations in person. Thank you”

OP: “I don’t really see a difference to be honest. I would’ve said the same things in person. I didn’t see this topic as one that needs to be discussed too much. If you have a response I’m obviously open to hearing it, but it won’t change the fact that saying things that could make my kids feel guilty & responsible for other’s feelings will be accepted. Again, you can show that you care for the boys but not in ways that make them feel bad.”

FMIL: “Bc having adult conversation via text I believe are pretty cowardess. When you address me or any other adult, via text, it’s not really appropriate, so I will end this conversation with if you can't talk things over with me instead of telling me what ""not"" to do then that in itself is a problem. So I'm done.”

OP: “Again, I would say the same words to you in person, nothing cowardess about the method I choose to say these words. The reason I didn’t see it made sense to do it in person is bc I’m essentially asking you a favor & it’s your choice to acknowledge it or not. I wasn’t looking for a debate about it, just asking that you please not make certain comments to my babies.”

I’m alright if she’d prefer me to discuss something like this in person, but why ignore my initial message? Seems like blameshifting/diverting to me.

She then went to my fiancé & txted him “so by now I’m sure “OP” told you she was messaging me, if you guys have something you need to say to me just say it”. They had a 30min phone call & my fiancé told me she said:

- she’s already distanced herself from coming over & she’ll distance herself more if she has to
- it’s not something she was doing intentionally (I never said it was intentional, just bringing her attention to this and potential repercussions)

Chose to message her bc I’m HORRIBLE at having deep/stressful convos in person (I have ADHD so can’t process what I want to say & what other person is said & formulate responses,etc) also this is a boundary so not rly up for discussion or debate. Either she chooses to stop or doesn’t.

17sguih,AITA for deliberately ruining my housemate’s romantic date night with his boyfriend because they planned to use my bathroom?,"I (21f) live with my best friend (John-21m) in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom flat. I have the main bathroom and John has the en suite bathroom. My bathroom has a shower/tub combo, sink and toilet and John’s bathroom has a shower, sink and toilet. When we first moved in, I didn’t have a preference about which room so John took the bedroom with the en suite. 

The issue is that recently, John has been using my bath without permission. Normally I’m not super territorial about my space, but here’s my issues:  
1-	John is having baths that last 2+ hours  
2-	He moves my stuff around (shoves them into draws) and puts my loofas and flannels on the floor which is just unhygienic  
3-	He doesn’t clean up after himself  
4-	I’m not allowed to use his bathroom when he’s occupying mine because he doesn’t want me to go into his bedroom

I’ve brought these up to him and he always says he won’t use to bath anymore but he always goes back to it. He claims his knees are acting up (he’s being testing for arthritis in a couple of weeks) and that the commute to and from work kills his joints. It's been like this for 2 months. Every time I get home from work, John is soaking in my tub so I can't shower, pee, etc. It might seem like a small thing but it's incredibly annoying.   
  
Fast forward to a couple of days ago and his boyfriend (Sam-19m) is visiting. He’s seemed pretty sound and has always been nice to me. I go from the kitchen to my bathroom and see the bath has been turned on so I turn it off. I go into my bedroom to grab my towels and clothes and when I get back, Sam is in my bathroom, sitting on the toilet seat watching the bath fill up. I ask him what he’s doing and he tells me him and John are planning on having a ‘romantic bath together’. I turn the bath off again and say ‘well this is my bathroom and I need a shower so get out.’   
He stands in the doorway for a few minutes texting John. I managed to push him out and I had a nice, long 'everything' shower. The entire time, John is texting me asking me to 'hurry up' because him and Sam had plans and I was ruining them. I responded and said 'I'm in my bathroom. I've told you not to use my bathroom because you leave it in a state and you spend hours in there.'   
When I get out the bathroom, John and Sam are sitting on the sofa watching a movie. As I walk past them, John says 'are you happy? You ruined our date night.' I just shrugged and got food.   
  
However I guess John went and vented to our mutual friends who are split on who is right in the situation. But the general consensus is that I should have just sucked it up and let them use my bathroom for their date night.

At a small cafe/restaurant while spouse and I ordered things at different counters for a quick dine-in bite, someone else placed a bag on the last open table, “claimed” the table as his and went somewhere else. 
When I was done with placing my order, I came and sat myself on the “claimed” seats since no one was physically sitting there except a lonely shopping bag on top of the table. 
Then my spouse came, sat himself and we started chatting while waiting for our food to be served.

This guy who had “claimed” the table earlier, came and angrily told me that he was sitting there, even though no one was sitting there except the shopping bag. I told him off by saying, “I didn’t see anyone sitting here. Besides, this is an open cafe not a DTDC bus where you get to claim a table by placing your belongings on it.”

17t71hr,AITA for refusing to host an all-vegan Hanukkah?,"My partner David and I are in an interfaith relationship and host both Hanukkah and Christmas every year. We enjoy hosting and especially cooking, and have zero problem catering to people's dietary needs. A few members of my family keep kosher and my cousin Ruth is vegan – all of them get a full meal (main, three sides, dessert) and drinks just like those without dietary restrictions at all of our holiday celebrations.  

My cousin offered to host Hanukkah at her house this year, which of course meant an all-vegan menu. The vast majority of the family said that they would prefer to have our normal arrangement at our house, as they were not interested in celebrating a holiday with a vegan menu, as they'd be missing out on many traditional family foods and recipes – many of which have been in our family before the Shoah. 

Ruth then came to us and asked if we'd be willing to cook an all-vegan Hanukkah, especially as we're both good cooks and she was sure that people would come round to the vegan dishes we made if they gave them a try. My partner and I politely declined, but asked her if there was anything we could do, prepare, or cook to make her feel more welcome. She said a lot of very hurtful things in response and has not spoken to us since.

Everyone seemed really friendly, and we were just doing introductions when this one guy, ""Dee,"" introduced himself and volunteered that he was Haitian.

17t7jpd,AITA for refusing to thank my MIL for a gift card she sent my husband and I for Christmas?,"My(41F) husband's(43M) parents live a few states away from us and we only see them maybe once a year. They are extremely well-off ... not that that matters,  but I figured I'd mention it. We both work full-time jobs, but there have been times when we have struggled financially. A time or two my husband has asked his mom for help paying a bill,  and she has reluctantly helped us. While I am extremely grateful  for her help, and have expressed my gratitude wholeheartedly..she's the type of person who will never ever let you forget about every cent she's ever helped out with.  She would constantly bring it up, and  it just kind of felt demeaning in a way. Especially because I  HATE asking anyone for help, but these were times when it was a last resort.

Fast forward to a couple Christmases ago, she mailed us a $200 gift card for Christmas. I work retail and Christmas is kind of a crazy time of year for me. I work late nights and long hours. When the card arrived I was at work, and my husband FaceTimed his mom with our kids to thank her for the gift. I intended on personally thanking her, but I just got busy and forgot.

A couple weeks of my life consisting of  basically just working and sleeping go by, and my husband mentioned that his mother hadn't called him in a while. He ended up calling her to make sure everything was okay and she WENT OFF.

She asked my husband why I hadn't thanked her for the gift card. He told her that when he thanked her, he was thanking her on my behalf as well, and that I've been working a lot.

She said it was unacceptable, and that I needed to thank her, because, to her I looked ungrateful.

When he told me that his mom was angry and that I should just thank her I flat out refused. Not because I wasn't grateful, but because she made such a huge deal about   it. She obviously only sent it as another thing to throw in our faces, and not out of the kindness of her heart. 

Since my husband defended me, and I never thanked her, she blocked both of us on social media and hasn't attempted to contact us or her grandchildren in years.

I asked my parents to get me a specific set of pens for my birthday, I've wanted them for ages.

17vf9b2,AITA for “dressing up” too much at my kids school.,"I F42 was told by my husband M51 that I shouldn’t dress up to go to our child’s elementary school. 

I love fashion and do tend to dress up. I don’t like wearing jeans ( I don’t like the feel and it’s hot we’re I live). So I wear a lot of skirts(usually tea length or to the knee and trouser type pants. I love finding interesting prints and cuts. I usually wear heels and only wear active wear to the gym.  I’ve spent a lot of hours cultivating my wardrobe.  I volunteer at my daughters school often, am on the PTO board,and do pick up and drop off so I’m there a lot and the teachers know me pretty well.  I’m also one of the older moms in elementary and my husband is the oldest dad. 

We were at an awards ceremony. I was wearing a printed jumpsuit with an asymmetrical neckline. One of the teachers told me I always look like I just walked of the set of Sex and the City.  I took it as a compliment, since it’s an iconic show. My husband said it wasn’t and she is saying I’m always over dressed.  He also said the other parents don’t appreciate me trying to show off since they mostly wear jeans or active wear. 

My husband is retired and rarely dressed up. Which is fine with me, especially since he had to wear a suit everyday for 30 years. It’s all personal preference I think.  I just prefer different.  He use to love my style, but seems over it since he retired.

My brother Chris (37M) and sister in law Rachel (33F) have two kids 4F and 2M. I’ve taken an extended maternity after my most recent delivery due to some complications and won’t be back at work until after the new year. My husband went back when our little one was 4 months. 

Chris and Rachel came to my husband and I about 2 months ago saying their daycare could no longer keep them as the center was closing unexpectedly and they were in a bind and asked if I could watch the kids while they worked. I told them I would be willing to so long as it was temporary and not long term. Both assured me they were seeking out a new center that could take them both. Both were appreciative of our help as they were told on a Wednesday the center’s last day of operation would be that same Friday.

The first few weeks were fine but as it’s been longer and longer, my husband and I are staring to doubt they are actually looking for a new center. They’ve never offered to pay me for watching the kids, but I’ve never asked either. Until this past weekend. We took all the kids to a park on Saturday and I spoke with my brother about whether or jot they had found a mew daycare. He said they had done some tours but were told there weren’t spaces for the kids yet and had been wait listed. I told him I completely understood and reminded him me keeping the kids was supposed to be temporary. I asked him if he and Rachel could start paying me $100/week for both kids. He called me outrageous for even asking citing “we’re family.” 

I tried explaining how much more money my husband and I were spending having them in the house 5 days a week and he called me lazy for still being on leave when my baby is 8 months old. At this point, I told him I would no longer be watching the kids and not to bring them Monday (yesterday) morning. Since Saturday, Chris and Rachel have blasted Dustin and I on social media which has caused all kinds of friends and extended family to reach out, many calling us assholes amongst other things.

17vg85i,AITA for saying to my wife that I’m the one who gets to make decisions about my niece?,"My (43M) niece (14F) is being raised by my wife (40F) and I - it’s a long story, having to do with my sister getting herself pregnant from a deadbeat and proving overall unfit to be a mother. Bottom line is, I see my niece as my daughter and love her just as much as my own biological children (11M/8M). I know my wife also loves her the same way, however I’m legally my niece's sole legal guardian.  
  
My niece has practiced gymnastics for the past 10 years, and when she was about 7 or 8 one of the coaches at her gym took notice of her potential and suggested she could really make it as a professional athlete. I personally believe my wife and my niece/daughter were taken by this promise of future glory (“can you imagine if she competes in the Olympics one day?”, my wife said). I was always VERY cautious because I do realize the shots are slim; I also knew that could cost us a lot of money going forward, but the coach believed so much in her that they managed to cover some of the costs of her training on the gym’s dime.  
  
And when I say training, I mean TRAINING – some serious hard work. I told them I was fine with the idea as long my niece was happy doing gymnastics and it didn’t majorly impact her life. And then, last month, she tore her ACL during practice. We do have insurance, so the medical costs were covered. However, she’s going through a painful recovery, all the while wondering when she’ll be healthy enough to get back to the gym. But I told my wife I don’t want her to do this anymore. Seeing her get hurt and in pain made me realize this is a dangerous sport, and the toll it's taking on her body is simply not worth it.  
  
My wife said I couldn’t make this decision without considering what my niece wants; I said I can because I’m the adult here and she’s still a child. So my wife said there was still the matter of her disagreeing with my view, and that we were supposed to make this parenting decisions together. I then said that's true regarding our boys, but not when it comes to my niece. All I meant is that I'm the sole guardian in the sense of being responsible for her; what my wife got is that I was undermining her as a surrogate mother. AITA here?

17xqlvd,AITA for asking my daughter to take in her grandmother for a few days?,"I (55M) live with my MIL (82F,) wife, and two sons in the suburbs. Recently, my MIL has had trouble meeting her friends in the city, and her whole day has been disruptive. She spends most of the day at home either getting in the way of chores or watching TV. It's not healthy for her, since she doesn't really talk much to anyone or go out. 

I remembered that my youngest (30F) lives alone in the core of our city in an apartment, so I asked  MIL if she'd want to move in with my daughter so she can see her friends more often. MIL liked the idea and even seems excited.

Next time I spoke to my daughter, I asked her if she could take MIL in for a few days just to try it out. My daughter kept saying no, that she has no room and she can't move anyone in, but I said that she could just put out a mattress and let MIL try living there for a while since she likes the idea. She asked me if I told MIL about the idea. When I said yes, she just hung up on me and she hasn't picked up any of my calls since.

17yhsua,"AITA for reminding my brother (42m) how old our mom was when she died, after he mentioned trying for a child?","My mother and father had my brother at 20 but waited on me until they were 40.

My dad died a few years after that because of health problems. My mom also had a long line of issues between and her family that resulted in immobility and lack of capacity. I was never really a kid because she needed someone to care for her and we didn't have the money for outside resources. She died when I was 19. Because I want fair judgment, I'll admit I'm resentful of my parents for having me when they did health-wise (not age wise - if they did not have so many health issues and had me at 40 I would feel differently). The roles just felt reversed. Maybe that's clouding my judgment. 

Many of their issues were genetic or a combination of genes with also negative health choices. My brother is now 42, in similar health as they were, and has expressed no desire to change or take steps towards reducing his risks of certain diseases. 

Him and I do not talk much and when we do it's very quick. He told me recently his wife and him were trying for a child. I didn't say anything because I didn't know how to reply. He later text me what was wrong? He said to be honest because it was clear I didn't like what he admitted and I told him both our parents died very young because of health reasons. I don't say that to scare him, but I was barely adult when mom died of things we are susceptible to. It's not up to me and he can do what he wants, yet consider how tough it can be to lose parents at such young ages and the impact it can have. 

There was no reply, but both his MIL and wife text me to say my mom was a brave woman and I need to get over what happened because she loved me, just like my brother will love his potential child. 

My brother wasn't around when our parents became very sick so I don't think it had a similar impact on him.

17yin8d,AITA for not telling my brother I got engaged over a year ago?,"So, this is obviously a thorwaway, also I am dyslexic, so tell me if I need to fix anything please.

I(29F) have an older brother (32M), we were raised by a single mother, and don't have any extended family, so we grew up pretty close.

I moved across the country 11 years ago to attend college, then stayed in the new state because it has better job opportunities for my field. My brother, on the other hand, remained close to my mother.

8 years ago he introduced his girlfriend to us over Christmas, and also told us that he got engaged. She asked me to be a bridesmaid and I accepted, but when she told me that their wedding date will be close to my finals, I warned her that I might not be able to do everything she needs me to do. She was very sweet, and said that that's ok, she just wanted me to be involved.

3 months before the wedding, my brother called me, he said that my ""lack of involvement and enthusiasm for being a bridesmaid"" was stressing his fiancée, and that they decided that I should just be a normal guest. I said that that was fine, apologized to him, then called her to apologize too.

Fast foreward to when they finalized the seating chart, and apparently I was seated in a back table, with some of my brother's coworkers, not even close to the family table. I was upset when mom told me, but didn't want to make a scene. My mom on the other hand demamnded they change my seat, which resulted in me being uninvited. I renember my brother telling me that his wife deserved the wedding of her dream, and that I was ""stressing her"". I asked my mom to back off, didn't go, but still sent a congratulations text and a gift. 

But I also stopped reaching out to my brother, and it became obvious that I was the only one keeping us in contact. We rarely met after that, mainly because they spend holidays with his in-laws, and then COVID hit.

I met a man during COVID, we hit it off, it became serious, and he proposed last year. I asked my mom to only tell my brother if he asked about me, and she respected my wishes. Also I don't have social media at all, so there was no announcement or anything like that.

We just sent out invites, and my brother got his, and for the first time in years, he called me upset, because I didn't tell him that I had a serious partner, let alone a fiancé.

I let him rant and rave, then just told him that it was not a secret, and if he bothered to ask me or my mom about my life, we would have told him. He said that I should have reached out to tell him, but I said that I did not want to stress him or his wife with my presence.

He called me an AH, and said they would not attend, to which I said ""it's your choice"", which made him even angrier, so AITA?",Charming-Corner-6235,3281,0.9700000286102296,311,1700348605,2023-11-18 17:03:25,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yin8d/aita_for_not_telling_my_brother_i_got_engaged/,11,2023
17z9yjw,AITA for telling a coworker she isn't Native American?,"I was speaking with coworkers and the topic of a nearby town came up. The town has a difficult to pronounce name and my coworker made a comment about what kind of idiot came up with the name. I pointed out that it was a word is from a Native American language. My coworker replied with ""well, I'm allowed to make fun of it then. I'm part Indian, Native American.""

My coworker appears very white. From what she has told me, her family has lived in the same rural area for years and this is the first time she has mentioned anything about this. Curious, I asked her what nation she was from and she said she had a Cherokee ancestor. I ask if she is registered with a Cherokee tribe and she says no. I ask who the ancestor was and she said her great great grandmother was a Cherokee princess.

Here's where I might be the asshole. I am white and know very little about Native Americans but I DO know that white people love to claim to be Cherokee without any evidence to back it up. And that the Cherokee nation doesn't have princesses. I know this because my estranged aunt used to say the same thing while everyone else in my family said they had literally NEVER been told about Indigenous ancestry. A DNA test of another aunt proved this later on. We're just white. 

So (and this is where I might have been rude) I tell her that the Cherokee don't have princesses and she's probably wrong. She got really defensive and insisted it was true. I told her that lots of white people claim to be Native and aren't, and that with DNA tests there isn't really an excuse not to look into it. Needless to say the vibe became awkward quickly and this coworker has been ignoring me since and seemed pissed at me.

Another coworker said I should have just let it go and not said anything. My reasoning is if she's going to say ""I'm Native American so I can make fun of them"" she better be damn sure she's ACTUALLY Native American. And if she is Cherokee, I feel like she still can't make fun of a DIFFERENT tribe's language anyway! So AITA?

1802hkh,AITA for telling my dad’s wife that she’s getting her karma and to leave me out of it?,"I (15f) am my dad’s affair baby. My mom didn’t know he was married and broke it off when she found out but she was already pregnant. She decided to have me and has always been a great mom to me. A lot of my friends don’t get along with their moms but mine is really cool and I wouldn’t trade her for anyone. My dad takes me out on the weekends to do things and visits on holidays, but I’ve never lived with him or anything. When I was younger he had to take me to his house for a few hours one time when my mom was really sick and his wife yelled at him and I had to stay in a bedroom away from her because she was so mad. My mom explained the cheating when I was older and realized how weird the situation was compared to friends with divorced parents. I have feels about it, but he’s my dad so I try to not think about it a lot. I know my dad’s wife hates me and is the reason I can’t see him more, so yeah, she has a reason to be mad at him, but also screw her.

So a couple of months ago, my dad started asking if I would like to spend whole weekends with him. I said I would be ok with it if it wasn’t at his house. He said his wife wants me to come and she’s had a change of heart. Sounded really sus so I said no. Then this weekend she wanted to come have lunch with my dad and me. She said that she realized how important I am to my dad since they can’t have kids now and that she would like to make up for it all and be my step-mom if I would let her.

It really made me mad because my whole life she’s made it really hard to see my dad and now she wants to be nice? I might be TA because I told her that if she can’t have kids that’s karma for how she treated me and she’s never going to be anything but my dad’s wife. She started crying and my dad told me later that was a terrible thing and I need to apologize. My mom said that she put me in an unfair situation and I should probably avoid talking to her right now because she’s having to deal with infertility and hasn’t really gotten over things.

181ltdb,AITA for doing what my wife told me to yet she claims I threw her under the bus?,"Simple story - happened yesterday.

We have a 7 month old baby that is watched by a nanny most days but on some days, my parent's come over during the day to help out. Yesterday was a busy work morning as I essentially had to run out for a few meetings just as they arrived so I handed off the baby and gave them a quick status update. Wife is upstairs at home sitting on Zoom meetings.

I get a text mid-morning from my wife saying that she's hearing the baby fuss excessively for over 20 mins and for me to call my parents to suggest that the baby may just need a bit more food. I do just that - I call mom and say that my wife hears the baby fussing and that he's probably hungry. Mom says that dad was already prepping a bottle and that the baby was fussing just for a few minutes since they came back inside. Mom asks why my wife didn't come downstairs to say anything or check up if she was concerned and I just tell her that she's in a work meeting. I carry on with my meetings and carry on with my day. Nanny switched parent's off later on that day per schedule.

In the evening, wife asks me what I told my parents - I told her that I conveyed what she told me. ""Wife says baby is fussing, he's probably hungry, probably a good time to make a bottle, she's in a meeting and can't come down to check up."" That made wife very upset, says I threw her under the bus and made her seem insensitive and inattentive. My response was simply - ""But I did what you told me to...""

181mnhy,AITA for bringing up my aunt's ex-husband after she kept pushing me to get married?,"My (32F) aunt (55F) is one of those nosy ladies you'd think only exists in romcoms. When I was a teen she asked me when I’d get a boyfriend, when I was in a steady relationship she asked me when I was getting married, and the marriage inquisition became even more invasive after my younger sister (28F) got married this month – which probably gave my aunt probable cause to label me as the family's “spinster”. 

In the wedding party, she kept asking me why I had broken up with my ex-boyfriend, she said how she always thought we’d ended up married soon, and she advised me to get serious about this if I ever plan to have kids, because I’m not getting any younger. It came to a point where I couldn’t keep my mouth shut anymore. Granted, I could have just asked her to stay out of my business, but since she was bringing up things about my personal life, I assumed it was fair to do the same. 

So I said something like: “even getting married is not a guarantee you’d be with someone forever, look at you and Uncle X, I’m sure you thought it would be eternal love yet now he’s with someone else”. It was the same as slapping her in the face; she accused me of being disrespectful and left the table on the verge of tears.

182c7m2,AITA for braiding one of my students hair without her mother consent?,"I am an art teacher for 14 to 15 years old students and recently I noticed that one of my students had really messy hair. I didn't say anything but the time passed by and it just seemed to get worse and worse. One day I saw her mother at the end of the class. For the record my students is black girl. She was adopted and her parents are both white. When I asked her about her daughter hair she just responded that she wasn't going to try to learn how to style them cause there is no point.

1834tvx,AITA for not changing my dog's name when my new neighbor's child had the same name?,"I (36M) am the owner of a Great Pyr/Australian Cattle Dog mix named Charlotte (6F). I live in a lower-middle class suburb in an unspecified United State. I have lived here for about a year now, and I let Charlotte out to go potty roughly six or so times a day. It's always the same routine: I open the back door, Charlotte runs outside to pee and ""patrol"" the yard (apparently it's a Pyr thing), and doesn't typically come bounding back to the door until I poke my head out and call her name.

About a week or two ago (maybe longer if I didn't notice) new neighbors moved in across my back alley. I had no intentions of interacting with them whatsoever, like ever, except today when I was executing the last step of Charlotte's aforementioned potty protocol.

I stuck my head out and called her name, but this time, alongside the familiar sounds of my dog galloping up the porch steps, was an adult human voice shouting something along the lines of ""WHY ARE YOU CALLING MY DAUGHTER??"" At first I thought it might just be my new neighbors getting into a spat, until a couple minutes later I heard pounding on my front door.

I opened the door to an angry man about twice my size glaring me down. He said something like ""Why the eff are you calling my daughter into your house"" and I responded ""Your daughter's name is Charlotte?"" and he just kind of kept glaring at me?? In absence of a response I followed up with ""Charlotte is my dog's name, dude"" and he rolled his eyes at me and said I ""better"" change my dog's name because he doesn't want his daughter (2F) getting confused and running into my house.

I told him that's not going to happen because not only did my dog have the name first, we also lived here first, plus I don't like strangers making demands of me before even attempting to be polite. What I DIDN'T say but really wanted to say is that teaching his child stranger danger is his responsibility, not mine.

He called me stupid and said that a human child obviously has priority over a dog for a name. I shut the door in his face and stared at him through the peephole for a moment before he eventually walked back to his house.

This last potty break, I went out with Charlotte and stayed in the yard with her until she finished her business, but this guy just kind of stood in his yard with his arms crossed and glared at me the entire time.

TLDR: I think it's unfair that this father demands I change my dog's name just because he chose the same name for his kid \[RUDE AND UNNECESSARY COMMENT REDACTED\]. But on the other hand, most humans think humans have priority over dogs for just about everything. AITA?

183waoi,AITA for refusing to go the fanily dinner?,"Me (30f) and my twin brother live in different cities. Before last Christmas, I was speaking about gifts woth my brother and he was unsure what gift to get his wife (30f). During this conversation, I mentioned that I got her a book she really liked in a library when they came over on a previous visit. He asked if I he could pay me to have the gift for her, and I would get her something else. I agreed. But since the next day I was travelling to their house for the Christmas dinner, I got her a last minute bath set.

During the gift exchange, she absolutely loved the book from my brother, and was polite about my gift. However, later during the evening she mentioned how she ""understands when money is tight"" and that I ""could get more thoughtful gifts next time"". It did not feel good. Then we travelled back home and never spoke about this again.

Today, I am speaking to my brother on the phone and discuss about Christmas gifts. I tell him that for my sister in law, my gift is a wool sweater that she specifically mentioned she liked a while ago. My brother asks again that I let him give this gift to her and that I get her something else.

I said no, especially after last year. He had no idea that my sister in law made any comments and said that maybe I interpreted wrongly. The he said he actually remembers my sister in law speaking privately with him afterwards and saying that gifts are a reflection of love and that I clearly don't put much thought in her gifts. I asked him to just get her something else because I put thought in my gift, and have no idea what to get her otherwise. After some back and forth I agreed to let him have the gift, but I told him I am not coming for dinner this year as I don't want to hear any more comments. He said that I am a baby, and to think about it.

I am quite upset that he does this thing of asking for my gift. I also don't put that much pressure on myself when it comes to gifts, but I make an exception with my sister in law as she often discusses the gifts she normally gets.

184n60w,AITA for telling my BM that I’ll die before our kid graduates high school?,"Alright it’s probably a weird story but I really need the second opinion.

Me (23M) and Kate (22F) are parents of Mark (4M). We split up before he was born, and to be honest I’m not very involved with the parenting besides being generous with child support and occasionally having Mark over.

I have a chronic and terminal condition that recently landed me in hospital. I had a really horrible flair up and had to be admitted to ICU. To make it worse, it happened during the time I was supposed to have Mark over. I was unconscious and on life support and so I couldn’t answer Kate’s calls.

When I woke up, I checked my phone and saw all the missed calls and messages. Kate was very upset as I basically ghosted her, and she sent a lot of rude and judgemental messages. So I snapped a pic of me in the hospital bed with all the tubes attached and sent it to her with the caption “sorry was busy trying not to die”.

Kate obviously freaked out and apologised, and I, being high on meds, told her that “it’s okay just a normal day having X”.

Turns out Kate didn’t know about my condition. We didn’t really have a relationship, she was just a girl from my school whom I hooked up with and it didn’t end very well. And we don’t have much contact aside from Mark-related stuff. I don’t know why I didn’t tell her, probably forgot or something.

Obviously it made her freak out even more. Kate called me and started crying and yelling at the same time, basically having a breakdown over the phone. She said I should’ve been upfront with her about it back then, that it’s my fault if Mark ever gets sick (it’s not a genetic neither a transmittable condition so he’s okay btw). She also said it’s unfair that we made a baby who will lose his dad at a young age, and this is where I might have been TA. I said “you know what would be more unfair? Fucking dying before my only son graduates high school.”

It upset her even more and she said that I’m the asshole for making her and Mark go through this. I said it’s not my fault, she said it is because if I was upfront with her, she wouldn’t have hooked up with me. I told her it’s too late and she called me an ah, hung up and told everyone I was an AH to her.",No-Marketing4660,5438,0.9300000071525574,617,1701038434,2023-11-26 16:40:34,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184n60w/aita_for_telling_my_bm_that_ill_die_before_our/,11,2023
184nwuy,AITA for having our neighbor move their fence off our property,"Throwaway. My son helped me create an account to post this AITA.

A neighbor hired a contractor to build a wood privacy fence.  I came home after the posts were set and immediately suspected the fence posts were on my property.  We live in brand new homes and so I asked her to meet me outside with her survey.  I had already staked out the property line, and it was clear to see the posts were on my property.

 Before I could say a word, she said ‘you can’t tell where to put a fence with a survey’ which astounded me and left me shaking my head.  After a few minutes of trying to explain that a survey is absolutely the way to determine where your fence should be, she threw her hands up and said ‘my contractor has my survey’ and walked back in the house.  

The next week, the contractor continued to finish the fence without moving anything.  We emailed her and called her and she ghosted us.  I paid $900 to have a surveyor do a site visit and write a report that clearly showed the fence was on our property.  We sent that to her from our lawyer and she finally responded ‘there must be some mistake’.  Only after more legal threats did she get her contractor back to move it off our property.  

Meanwhile she trash talked us to everyone she could and labeled us bullies etc and has half our new neighborhood believing her.  She won’t talk to us, which is actually fine by us, but it really pisses us off knowing she has created this negative impression about us. 

 I should mention that our lots are pretty small and we had a very large backyard project done this summer and the fence was taking up valuable real estate that we needed to fit our plunge pool in.  We tried to deal with this in a polite neighborly way and she forced us to bring in our lawyer. So, AITA?

**edited to add relevant information: in the survey I paid for, the fence was measured at 12 inches into my property line. Not an insignificant amount if you ask me!** ",AITAthrowawayFence,2662,0.9700000286102296,324,1701040264,2023-11-26 17:11:04,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184nwuy/aita_for_having_our_neighbor_move_their_fence_off/,11,2023
184oall,"AITA for going against my boyfriend's ""family rules""?","I've been dating Marc for the past six months and he's been a nice guy so far. Has all the qualities I would want in a partner. He's nice, kind, an amazing cook. We do everything together and have never had problems in our relationship thus far. 

Marc took me to meet his family for the first time ever two days ago. My period was a day or two late this month so I wasn't surprised when I started menstruating in the middle of playing with Marc's neices. I didn't think much of it and told Marc's mom (who was playing with the neices alongside me) that I needed to use the bathroom since I've gotten my period. I was not expecting to see disgust on her face. 

She looked really panicked and disgusted when she stood up to lead me to the bathroom. The whole time, she kept telling me not to touch anything or anyone, and to maintain a safe distance from the food on the dinner table. It was bizzare to me but I kept my mouth shut until I could get a tampon inside me. 

When I came out, I noticed that Marc's mom seemed wary of me. I asked her if everything was okay and she said that everything was fine but that I couldn't touch certain things in the house, especially the items made out of cloth. This included the couch. I had to sit on a random wooden chair. I would not have minded if not for the context. 

This whole situation made me extremely mad as she was treating me like I was impure and untouchable. The other women in the house did not say anything and the men pretended to not hear the commotion. I told Marc's mom clearly that I was not going to be following these rules and would much rather prefer to be out of the house. 

Marc had gone out to get ice creams for everyone so I did not get the chance to tell him before I stormed out and went back home by cab. He wasn't upset with me but he did say that I could've waited for him to come back even though it wasn't completely necessary. 

My sister in law says it was kind of an asshole move to just up and leave. I could've dealt with it for one, for Marc's sake. But I'm torn.

184okt4,"AITA for ""ruining a child's Xmas"" cuz I refused to sell my doll?","I(36f) love thrifting. I'm also I kid at heart so this summer when I found several bags of American Girl doll clothes- I bought them. I collect old dolls that sometimes need clothes but was really hoping an AG doll would show up. Against all odds, one did show up on the shelf a few weeks later. As a kid I wanted an AG doll so badly but they have always been pretty expensive so I never got one. I paid $35 for her took her home and enjoyed dressing her up. My son joined in, dressing up his stuffies. It was so cute that I took a pick and put it on FB. Also, while researching her I found out my doll is a Just Like You #11 which are a bit rare & go for $100+-$300+ online. always fun to find valuable things at the thrift store for cheap!

Fast forward- today, a few days after Black Friday I got tagged in a friend of a friend's post. ""Kay"" is asking if anyone has an AG doll to sell. She had tried to buy one online for Black Friday but couldn't find anything within her price range. I instantly had Kay in my DMs offering me $50 for my doll. I declined.  telling her that I don't know why my friend tagged me cuz my doll isn't for sale. 

She replied about how she had promised her 6yr old granddaughter ""Mia"" a doll for Xmas. She was now worried if she ordered a more expensive doll online it wouldn't get to her in time & offered me $70. I again declined & said my doll was something I had wanted at Xmas as a kid & waited a long time for.

Kay immediately countered. ""See you know what it's like not getting the AG you wanted so badly. Please! You could make this Xmas so special for Mia! You can use the money to get a brand new one!""

I thought about it. I really did but I told her no thanks. Finding mine at the thrift shop felt special- like it was meant to be. I suggested if she was worried about the doll not getting to her in time she could get one of the much cheaper AG knockoff Walmart dolls & have it ready just in case & return it if the AG doll makes it in time.

Kay didn't want to get a cheap doll. She then switched tactics. Asking me if I would even be able to look at my doll again knowing that not selling her meant I ruined Xmas for a little 6yr old girl?

Yes I can Kay because when you decide to be manipulative is where I draw the line. I immediately blocked her. maybe this makes me the a-hole but I don't really care. I'm sorry little Mia. I hope you get the doll of your dreams someday.",Tootl3,2129,0.9700000286102296,318,1701042012,2023-11-26 17:40:12,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184okt4/aita_for_ruining_a_childs_xmas_cuz_i_refused_to/,11,2023
185gfj7,AITA for not letting my autistic BIL hold my newborn?,"My fiance (24M) and I (19F) had our first baby last week. He was born healthy but giving birth was very traumatic and hard on me mentally/physically. I had an emergency c-section after being in labor for three days. I still feel extremely foggy and out of touch with reality.

I only wanted my fiance's parents present to meet the baby in the hospital. The rest were welcome to Facetime us, but they would have to wait to see our son after we'd gone home and had time to adjust to having a newborn. 

I'm not close with my family because I left home at 18 to escape their abuse. Almost none of them are allowed contact with my child because of the way they treated me and my siblings. 

My fiance's family are a very close-knit group, and all of them have been very kind and welcoming to me up until this point. I wouldn't be marrying in if they weren't. The only one I've had issues with is my fiance's brother (30M) who has autism. He makes a lot of offhand comments and jabs that get passed off as 'dark humor'. 

When my in-laws got there, they brought my fiance's older brother who they care for and let live with them. He's diagnosed with autism but does not have any severe disabilities. I wasn't happy that they'd brought him against my wishes, but I didn't say anything after everything I'd gone through. 

My fiance's brother was adamant about holding our son. He was loud, had an attitude, and smelled terrible. His clothes were dirty and his hair was covered in grease. It was like he hadn't showered in weeks. Again, I didn't comment on his hygiene, but I tried to preface that I didn't want anyone holding the baby right now except my in-laws. I was as kind as possible. 

My in-laws told me that he didn't mean any harm and that he could wash his hands. I told them no again, and my fiance backed me up when they didn't calm down. My FIL law took his son home and my MIL stayed and apologized, but my fiance's brother is apparently 'deeply hurt' and texted my fiance to tell him not to marry me because I'm ""driving them apart"" and ""a bitch who wants to keep him from his nephew"".

I'd like to preface that my fiance himself has confirmed that his brother was not always this limited, and was fairly normal until high school when he seemed to start to play up his diagnosis for sympathy.  He hasn't worked a day in his life and lives off of his parents. He does not shower or even bother to apply deodorant before leaving the house. He would literally live in the same clothes for months if not for his mom doing his laundry. I have no ill-will for people with autism or disabilities (my youngest brother had down syndrome and cared for him as a identified child.) My issue is solely with my brother in law.",Ok_Substance_3119,4433,0.9399999976158142,568,1701125683,2023-11-27 16:54:43,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185gfj7/aita_for_not_letting_my_autistic_bil_hold_my/,11,2023
185hwxa,AITA after my daughter wet herself in the car?,"I’ll try to keep this as straight to the point as possible. My family and I (39M) traveled to visit my wife’s parents for Thanksgiving which involved a 5ish hour drive one way. My daughter (13F) had gotten the new Zelda game for her birthday a couple weeks ago and spent the drive playing basically nonstop. On the drive back home, we stopped about 2 hours in for gas and a bathroom break. My wife and daughter went inside while I gassed up before going with my son to the men’s room. When we got out, my wife and daughter were already in the car, so we got back on the road.

Not even half an hour later, my daughter announced that she had to go to the bathroom and asked if we were stopping soon. I’m not a dickhead (maybe an asshole?) so I wasnt *mad* but I was confused. I asked her if her stomach was okay, and she said that yes, she felt fine, and that she didn’t have to pee when we stopped but had to pee now. I gave my wife a look, and she stammered that she (daughter) said she didn’t have to go. Fine. Whatever. Dumb, but whatever.

I asked my daughter if she needed us to stop right this second, or if she could hold it for a bit. She said that she had to go, but could wait.

Another 10 or so minutes passed before she frantically asked if we could stop because she really couldn’t wait. I told her I would get off at the exit with a bathroom.

Needless to say, she didn’t make it. My wife is annoyed with me for not stopping immediately, I’m annoyed with her for letting her say she didn’t have to go when I suspect she just wanted to get back to her game, and we’re both annoyed with my daughter for wetting herself when it was easily, *easily* avoidable.

1871n7d,AITA for not taking the baby as soon as I was asked?,"Our daughter is 7 weeks old. My wife is a full time SAHM (both of us want this until our daughter is at least 5, starts school and can openly communicate with us). I work full time making $25 an hour and while the pay is good, I've been looking for something a bit better just so we have more fun money, basically. I get home from work today at 3pm and she asks me to take the baby. As soon as she asked though, I got a phone call that I suspected was from an interview so I said ""hold on a second"" and took the call. It was an interviewer and he wanted to do an over the phone interview and asked if it was a good time. I said yes.

About 40 minutes later I go back in and my wife is cooking dinner with the baby strapped to her chest. I said I could take the baby now and she said ""looks like I've got it"" and dismisses me completely. She then turns off the stove (dinner was done) and goes in to the bathroom with the baby and takes a shower, with the baby. I go in and say she's being ridiculous and that I had to take a phone call and she snapped. She said ""I take phone calls while holding the baby all the fucking time. I cook, clean, shower, shit and shave while holding the baby. Your excuse is pathetic."" AITA for not taking the baby immediately?

18729yz,AITA for brushing my daughter’s friend’s extremely matted hair out so she avoid a drastic cut?,"My daughter has a friend, A (13F), who has been going through some health issues that I don’t want to put here. A’s mum passed away when she was little so it’s just her and her dad. Since he has started dating his girlfriend (we’ll call her C) A’s needs have been pushed to the side a little and he’s just not noticed that A has been struggling. She’s doing better now after getting the help she needed.

However, A’s hair has been extremely matted as it had not been brushed for months. A had been hiding her hair under hats and hoods at home and trying to disguise it at school in buns. She stayed over at the weekend and I only found out about her hair when they came downstairs after getting a comb stuck in A’s hair trying to fix it. I comforted A as she was ashamed about her hair but had hoped that she and my daughter could fix it. My daughter convinced her to tell me about it as she had been scared to say anything to anyone as she thought she would be judged as her dad’s girlfriend has made comments about her appearance when she was going through her health issues. When A was going through her issues, I made it clear to her and my daughter that our home is a judgement free zone and if she ever wanted to come to me or my husband for help then she would get it. A then asked for help detangling her hair. So that’s what I did. We put on some films and worked on detangling A’s hair. It took hours, but it was doable.

When A went home on Sunday, her hair was completely detangled and neatly braided into two dutch braids. She was happy and thanked me for helping with her hair. Then Monday I got an angry phone call from C because she was meant to be taking A to get her hair cut due to how matted her hair was. Apparently C and A’s dad had noticed how bad it was and C had told me that she would get it sorted. C is mad because the salon they were going to had charged her a cancellation fee for cancelling the day of the appointment. C wants me to pay her back for the cancellation fee as it’s my fault for fixing A’s hair when they were going to get it cut out. I told her that I wouldn’t be paying it, I just did the right thing by A instead of going to the extreme option straight away. C then said that A was no longer allowed to be friends with my daughter and they would sue me for the cancellation fee. It was £60 (half the cost of the cut).

My daughter told me that A knew about C wanting to cut her hair and A didn’t want the hair cut which is why she went to my daughter for help. A like my own daughters has long hair, so cutting the matted hair out would have meant her losing well over half of the length of her hair.

AITA for brushing out A’s hair so she avoided getting a drastic cut.

Update: This got more attention than I thought it would. I would just like to clarify a couple things. 1. While I am not going to go fully into A's health issues, the matted hair is the result of a depressive episode. Once things got better, she was just very embarrassed by the state her hair was in but didn't know how to fix it. So she hid it and it got worse. She is able to brush and wash her hair when she's ok. 2. A isn't being neglected by her dad. He knows he hasn't been the best dad to A and is trying to be better when it comes to her. Since A's health issues, he has been seeking help. I'm not going to report a man who I can see is trying to get better as a parent.

A's dad (I'll call him J) came round earlier as he wanted to talk to me. A and C had gotten into a shouting match yesterday because of the cancelled appointment. C had told A that she wasn't allowed to see my daughter anymore until I paid the money I owed - this was news to J - and A told C that she was going to continue seeing her friend. A also told C that she hated her and that if anyone was going to take the place of her mum it would be me because I care about A as a person not just her appearance. J wanted to know what had happened with A and why I owed C money. I explained it all to J and he was horrified to learn that C was going to cut A's hair short instead of helping her. He had been under the impression that the appointment had been to get her hair detangled and wouldn't have consented to A getting a big chop. He hadn't realised how focused C had become on A's appearance with her hair. He told me that he wasn't going to stop A coming around as he knows how important my family is to her. When her mum died and he fell apart, we provided the stability they both needed. I told J that A is always welcomed here and she knows it, but it's her dad that she needs. She needs him to be there for her and to support her through whatever she is going through, having her dad will mean more to her than having me there. J agreed with this, and that he knows he's not been the dad that she needs and is going to try and be better for her. He's asked if I could recommend a family therapist who could help them, and I gave him a few names. Since A started going through her issues, J has stepped up. He's not the same dad that he was when they started but he does still have a way to go to be dad of the year. 

Since speaking with J I've had angry texts from C, furious that I 'went behind her back' and spoke with J when she was dealing with the issue. In the string of angry texts she sent me, she said horrible things about myself, A and my daughter. I'm not engaging with her anymore, she's a walking red flag. I screenshotted them before blocking C and sent them to J's work phone (J gave me his work number when he started dating C because she had been screening and deleting messages before he saw them. She doesn't have access to his work phone.)  My daughter has been messaging A making sure she is ok, and she will be coming to stay at the weekend as she doesn't want to be at home when C collects her stuff. I'm not sure what is going on with that relationship, nor do I want to know but it does sound like J is finally putting A first.",NiorNightingale,7449,0.9700000286102296,806,1701297605,2023-11-29 16:40:05,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18729yz/aita_for_brushing_my_daughters_friends_extremely/,11,2023
187vzpq,"AITA for not being happy that my parents invited my son to my ""welcome party""?","I'll try to make everything as easy to understand as possible, but of course I can answer questions if I have to. 

So, when I (m29) was 21 I got a scholarship to study in Japan (I was a college student in the US). I was very excited to go, however a girl I was seeing ended up pregnant (we were not together, but were exclusive). Of course I didn't want a baby with my fwb, and also it would ruin my opportunity to go to Japan. 

I begged her to have an abortion, since why would any of us want that baby? We were definitely not committed to each other. We had discussed abortions before (as many other subjects), so I knew that she didn't have a problem with abortions. However, she decided that she was going to keep the baby. I told her that honestly I didn't want to be a father, but that I'll wait until the baby's birth because maybe I'll feel different then. I didn't change my mind when the baby was born. So we agreed that I wouldn't be an active father, but I'll fullfil all of my responsibilities. 

I had to cancel my trip to Japan to get a better job so I could pay child support. Thankfully my parents also helped me so I moved in with them, I almost had to drop out of college but thankfully I was able to graduate. I still wanted to go to Japan, so when one of my ex classmates moved in there to work I asked him to let me know if there was any vacancy at his company. I got a job there and moved in October 2019. 

Ever since, I couldn't come back to America, because of COVID and also because the rhythm of work there is harder, so I was always working and trying to advance in my career. Of course I continued sending the money for my son. 

Well, the thing is that I have vacation now and I travelled for Thanksgiving. I got here the week prior to thanksgiving and my parents prepared a ""welcome party"" with our family and friends. They apparently got very close to my son when I was not here and they invited him and his mother. To be honest I don't have any problems with them, but we don't have a close relationship either. 

When I went to the backyard (where the guest were) I greeted them both, but I was feeling awkward and we didn't talk much. When everyone left my parents told me off because they expected me to be way happier about seeing my son. We got into a bit of an argument and now my mother and father are upset at me for being so cold? I don't understand why they expected me to be happier, I don't know my son too much, he wasn't very excited to see me either. But it's been far too long and they're still upset, si I need some outsider pov since my friends are agreeing with me, but they might be doing it just to not argue with me.


Edit: I'm sorry, I didn't realize this was not clear in the post. But I didn't kick my son or his mom out of the party, they stayed till the end. I greeted them, I asked him about his school and his martial arts classes and he told me he's doing fine, so I congratulated him. His mother hasn't texted me at all to tell me that the kid's sad after seeing me.

188oxx1,AITA for not pretending to like my husband’s gift?,"I (33F) have been married to my husband (37M) for 10 years. He’s a great husband and father but he is absolutely terrible at gift giving.

Several years ago, I told him I wanted a specific, inexpensive t-shirt with a funny to me saying on it for Christmas.  I showed him the shirt on Etsy multiple times. I thought it would be super easy for him to order and he didn’t have to worry about coming up with his own idea. He did not buy me the shirt.

The next year, I mentioned the shirt again and, once again, he did not buy me the shirt. 

I could have purchased the shirt myself, but at this point I became petty and let it stew over the years.

Flash forward to this year. At Thanksgiving he was bragging to my SIL that he always pays attention to me and gets me great gifts. I replied “Really? I asked you for one thing - X shirt - for years and you never bought it.” 

Today, when I got the mail, we had a weird package from a known knock-off t-shirt company. I immediately realized he must have finally ordered me “the shirt.” I searched for the phrase I had wanted and found that they had multiple designs with the same phrase but none of their shirts look like the original one I had shown him and wanted. The one I wanted had basic block text in black and the designs available on this site were multi-colored with cartoon drawings and are 100% not my style. 

I peeked in the package and can confirm, it is a shirt with the saying but in a design I absolutely won’t wear.

189fii4,AITA for Refusing to Share My College Fund with Step-Siblings?,"Throwaway so they don't find this post.

I (19F) recently found out that my stepmom (40F) wants me to split my college fund with my step-siblings (17M and 15F). My bio mom set up the fund for me before she passed away and it was meant for my education.

I love my family and they are important to me but I've been saving every penny and working part-time to contribute. My step-siblings have their own funds set up by their bio dad and I never expected to share mine.

189gl9c,AITA for telling my “boyfriends” kid I don’t intend on being her mom?,"TLDR: I helped my casual BF out by watching his kid while he went to a job interview. She didn’t want to abide by my house rules because “I’m not her mom and never will be” and I told her “I’m not trying to be your mom. I have my own kids.” 
**writing on mobile**

Context: 
I’ve (34F) have been in a casual long distance relationship for 2 years with “Matt” (40M). I set boundaries at the start of our relationship. We will never live together, he will not be involved with my kids or family, I won’t be involved in his. My kids have a dad that’s very active in their lives and we coparent amazingly. The relationship I have with Matt is just that, with *him*.  Matt agreed to these terms. Everything has been great. We never argue because we have nothing to argue about. We have our separate lives and when we’re together it’s like a break from the real world. 

Matt is relocating closer to me because he’s grown tired of the city and wants to live in a more rural place like I currently live in. He will still be roughly over an hour away so it’s within comfort. His daughter “Ava” is 12 and he was unable to leave her home as his mom had a slip and fall and wasn’t comfortable watching Ava while she was on heavy medication, she just wants to rest. He wasn’t comfortable leaving her at the hotel alone so he asked me to watch her. I agreed and we both understood it’s a one time thing. 

He tells Ava I’m an old friend but I’m guessing she’s heard my name before (it’s not a traditional American name) because of what follows.

 She was being hateful to my daughter “Rose” (11), making fun of the blemishes my daughter has on her chin. I asked Ava if she wanted to go to the basement to play any of the games down there, she said no so I told Rose to go to the basement. She did.

I then catch Ava slowly opening the basement door and I ask her to go to the living room. She refuses and opens the basement door all the way. I tell her she is not allowed down there right now but she’s welcomed to the Wii in the living room or she can pick a movie to stream. We go back and forth, then I walk to the basement door and shut it. She starts screaming at me that I’m not her mom so don’t try to act like it. That’s when I told her “Baby, it never crossed my mind because I have my own kids to parent. I have no intention of trying to be anything to you, I’m just helping your dad.” 
She went to the living room and occupied herself with her phone. I made lunch, served it, she didn’t touch it (it was sopita and cheese quesadillas). Her dad picked her up later and when he got back to the hotel he called me about what I said. He said he understands why I said what I said and it is true, but it was out of pocket to say it TO her.

18a5kxa,AITA for kicking out my sister in law after she lost my son while babysitting,"Over the past three months, my husband's sister has been staying with us until she got back on her feet. As part of her contribution to our household, she generously offered to babysit our kids, including our 3-year-old son with autism and with both delayed speech and language, without expecting any compensation.

However, about three weeks ago while she was babysitting, our son managed to slip out of the front door without her awareness, wandering around for approximately half an hour before a concerned individual alerted the police. 

Rather than immediately notifying my husband and I about the situation, she spent an hour searching the neighborhood before involving law enforcement. We only became aware of our son's disappearance after she had already found out that the police had picked him up and safely returned him home. There's uncertainty regarding whether she would have informed us if the police had not explicitly instructed her to do so.

In the aftermath I asked her to leave our home. My husband believes that my decision to kick her out was overly severe, labeling it as an honest mistake that could happen to anyone. He also emphasizes her lack of alternative living arrangements, arguing that it was “unjust” to leave her with nowhere else to go. She put my son’s safety at risk and broke my trust and I can’t get over that, but I can’t shake what my husband said. Now I feel terrible about putting her on the street.

18ax6af,AITA for only picking up my food and not my families,"This is a throw away because I'd prefer my family now know my main account.

I (24 f) live with my parents and siblings because rent is crazy right now and my job isn't great. My parents have this thing where they'll always wait to pick up food. If we're told it'll be ready in 15 minutes they won't get ready to go until 30 minutes later. This has ment that anytime they get pick-up orders the foods always cold. 

I have started to pick the food up myself since I prefer hot food. The issue with this is me and my parents take turns buying the take out but they hadn't been paying since I'm the one who goes and gets it. Whenever I bring this up they tell me that they'll pay but I ""can't be impatient"" and if I go get it myself then I have to pay.

This leads to the issue yesterday. I ordered take out but said it was 2 separate orders. When the time came to get the food I went and got only my own. When I got back to the house my mom had only just grabbed her keys to get the food. She smiled and thanked me more getting the food again but I told her I got MY food and hers was waiting at the restaurant. She got mad and we had an argument. I didn't really care but my younger siblings were upset that their food was cold.

So I want to know if I'm the a-hile in this situation.

Edit:

I want to make an edit to answer for some the repeat questions instead of replying multiple times in the comments

1. Yes I pay rent and chip in for utilities and food 
2. No we aren't eating out every night. We get takeout 3 to 4 times a month. This has just been a problem for a long time.
3. My parents mainly order from a local restaurant so we have to order over the phone and pay when we pick it up. We can't order online or get it delivered.
4. My parents won't pay if I pick it up at all. They say if they pay they'll go pick it up. So if I'm being ""impatient"" and going before they leave then I can't pay for the food myself. So asking for thier card/money is a moot point because they won't give it to me to use.

I was gathering my things when my friend said, ""oh, by the way, you might want to check on that one as I kind of borrowed it"".

I confronted her about it, and she said that since she was housing my stuff for free, it was basically a given.

18bobt5,AITA for making a big deal about my supervisor eating tuna?,"Throwaway, on mobile. 

I (30F) am 18 weeks pregnant. I had a very rough first trimester with morning sickness which is now tapering off, but I still have it some days. During my first trimester, I found out the hard way that the smell of tuna will trigger vomiting for me. 

My supervisor, let’s call him Dave, whose office is about 10 feet from my desk will usually eat tuna and crackers for lunch. I disclosed my pregnancy to HR and Dave in the same meeting, and HR shooed him out to discuss my maternity benefits. I took the chance to question if I could ask Dave to refrain from tuna until I felt better as it triggers my morning sickness and I can smell it at my desk when he eats it. I was told I can certainly ask, but that HR cannot enforce anything as it isn’t a documented allergy, which I was ok with. 

Talking to Dave one-on-one, I asked if he could not bring tuna in, or at least eat it in the break room that’s a good 50ft from our office area. He said yes without hesitation as he doesn’t want to be the cause of me being sick or interrupt my work flow. I profusely thanked him.

12 weeks later and I am feeling much better than I was. Last week we did a test run in the break room to see if tuna still bothered me, and it does. I apologized and Dave was a bit huffy about it, but I didn’t think much of it at the time.

Which brings us to today. I came back from lunch and Dave’s door was closed which is not unusual. I’ve been sitting for about five minutes when Dave pops out to chat with one of my coworkers and the tuna smell instantly hits me. Goodbye lunch.

Dave starts telling me I’m overreacting and just being dramatic. That I can’t expect everyone to cater to my pregnancy. My coworker tell him to back off and helps me get to the bathroom to clean up. I come back to my desk about 5 minutes later, someone used Febreeze but the tuna smell is EVERYWHERE and I get sick again. I grab a paper mask to try to mitigate the smell, but tuna is still all I can smell. 

After 20 minutes I can’t take it anymore and request if I can go home early. Dave huffs and asks if I can’t make it the final 3 hours. I told him no, and he hits back with that my leaving early will affect my end of year review. I said “so be it” and got  out of there.

On my drive home I get a call from HR. Dave told them what happened, and they again reiterate that they cannot keep Dave from eating whatever he wants in his office. I ask if my desk can be moved further away at least, to which I got “we’ll look into it, but don’t expect anything”. They ended the call by saying to should seek other medication from my doctor so my illness isn’t an office problem. 

So now I’m home, feeling like crap and waiting to hear back from my OB.

They mentioned wanting to dine out for Christmas dinner, but I offered to whip up a home-cooked feast instead. Unfortunately, they turned down the offer.  
Now, here's where it gets interesting. I am currently working as a server in our town after recently being laid off from my corporate job. Lucky for me, the restaurant is closed on Christmas Eve and Christmas.  
Well, turns out my mother-in-law had other plans. She called up my workplace without speaking to me beforehand and asked for me to be their server for their entire Christmas dinner. I found out through my husband that I'd be playing the role of their server for their festive family celebration, and my Christmas ""gift"" would be a sweet tip and takeout from my restaurant.  
Seems a bit odd, especially since our restaurant isn't even open on Christmas Eve or Christmas and I'd be available to spend time with them on those days. They're scheduling this dinner the day before we close and making it their designated family celebration. 

I politely declined because, let's be real, being excluded from Christmas dinner while working as their server? That's a hard pass from me.

18d7juk,"AITA for giving my niece a book of ""controversial"" fairy tales?","I (25F) sent my niece (6F) a book with the original collection of Grimms' fairy tales as an early Christmas gift, because I’m going abroad in a few days, and I won’t be home for Christmas. 

I texted my brother (30M), her father, to see if they had gotten my gift. He just said yes. I thought this was a weird, short answer (I mean, he didn’t even say thank you or anything else), so I followed up and asked if my niece liked it. Eventually, after some hesitation, my brother told me that his wife (31F) read some of the stories with my niece and she (my SIL, not my niece!) thought they were disturbing and inappropriate for a 6-year-old.   
  
Bear in mind, I read those tales myself when I was her around my niece's age. It’s the original version of those classic tales like Cinderella and Snow White, except they don’t sugarcoat the darkest aspects of the story. It didn’t traumatize me in anyway and millions of children have read them throughout history.

18d7ray,AITA for not letting my brother take credit for a pricey gift I got for his daughter?,"Heya Reddit!

So some backstory to start: I (32f) have an older brother Rob (37m). Rob has three kids (15f, 8m, & 6m). His two younger boys are he and his wife's kids, where as his oldest (who I'll call Kat) is from a previous relationship. 

Kat splits time 50/50 between her mom and Rob. This xmas she'll be with him. Usually Rob&wife+kids, our parents, and myself do a Christmas dinner/gift exchange together but it usually revolves around the younger kiddos nowadays. Rob and Kat's mom are both saving up to buy Kat a vehicle when she starts driving; Kat is aware of this and knows this means less 'big' gifts until then, but I felt kinda bad that all she's not getting that much for xmas.

Kat is very into gaming/mods/3d renders & has wanted a nice gaming PC for a while (all she has is an older laptop at the moment). I've got few expenses and a disposable income, so I figured ""what the hell"" and decided to go ahead and buy one for Kat for xmas. I told both Kat's mom and Rob about my idea for it before purchase; they both signed off on the idea. I found a nice prebuilt for around $1700 and ordered it. When I showed Rob the PC, he seemed taken aback and said he didn't realize it was an *ACTUAL* PC and *that* expensive.

Rob wants me to give the gift to Kat as from ""Mom, Dad, and Aunt \[MY NAME\]"". He's offered to purchase a monitor to include with the PC to make it ""fair"". I told him no, and if he wants to buy a monitor that's great, but a $200 monitor isn't the same as a $1700 PC. Rob isn't happy with this, and says I'm trying to undermine him and make him look bad to Kat.

1) I think thats crazy, I just want to do something cool for my niece.  
2) why is it bad that I want credit for a gift I researched & purchased on my own?  
3) wouldn't it be unfair for Kat's mom to ALSO not get credit if Rob does?

Rob wants me to either let him and SiL to also claim credit for the gift or wait until her bday (in 8 months!!) to give the PC so he isn't 'overshadowed' by me.

It's mostly split and we have a calendar that we revise if needed. Usually we swap him every week but around holidays we extend the times. So the ex gets him for half of this month and I get the other half.

The reasoning for this month's schedule is that she was planning on spending Xmas with her SO back at his home state. I wasn't planning on traveling. Just Xmas at home. This week the ex said her SO wanted to take her and Eli on a skiing Xmas holiday and could she actually have him the last two weeks of December. 

I said so let me get this straight. You have him for two weeks already and now you're asking for another two weeks. Where does that leave me? She told me we can talk about afterwards. I said no, we can't. I'll tell you what. You give me money upfront so he and I can take a summer vacation. 

She said that was outrageous. I said not as outrageous as asking me to give up my time up front and your refusing to give me anything up front in return. And yes, I'd be willing to negotiate if I aaked her to give up her time and let it be known and not hang up like she did.

I asked how hes matured and whats changed in the three years hes been no contact and he said that he has a new lifestyle and this and that. Come to find out hes married to a hardcore hippie vegan and living a completely different life. He lives on a farm now and has a lot of animals, none he makes profit off of. I was beyond shocked. He also doesnt smoke or drink and is just so… different. I spoke to my boyfriend, friends, and parents and they said to give him a chance.


He offered to start paying for his daycare and has been since May. I allowed him to meet my son in a supervised setting at the farm (I wanted to see the horses and animals lol) and met his wife. She inherited the farm and completely redesigned it. She was teaching me and my sisters about her raw organic vegan lifestyle and fed us a potato stew she made. It was really good and I thought things went well. They seemed trustable.


We’ve done a few more supervised visits throughout the year and I only now feel comfortable letting him stay overnights alone. They feed him vegan and I dont mind. The issue is they sat me down recently and asked that I start feeding him vegan full time since its much better for him and the world and that since he wants more involvement it makes sense he has a plantbased lifestyle. I said no, I myself am not vegan and they are not even the vegan chicken nuggets from Walmart type, they are the strictly raw fruits and vegetables type and thats asking me to learn a whole other type of cooking. They offered to meal prep during my time. He said in 2024 he wants 50/50 custody but that if I be “difficult” he will go for full custody siting our age and income difference and that I still live with my parents. I told him by threatening me he can see me in court and left. 


One of my sisters that came with me to a few of the visits has been vegetarian for many years now and she says Im being unreasonable since its healthier for him and they even offered to cook all his meals. And that by eating vegan for a while, it will mess up his digestive system if he eats meat and to just choose one and that since its a lifestyle for them and he will be involved in it, to just agree or Im the asshole?

18g73xa,AITA for taking my earbuds out of my wife's sister's hands?,"Ever since I was a teenager, I(39M) have been dealing with anger issues. My folks sent me over to an anger counselor when I was 16. He wasn't able to help me get rid of the anger, we tried medication, meditation, breathing exercises but the anger still remained, so he then focused on teaching me coping strategies and ways to navigate my anger so that other people won't be affected. From that point on, if I were standing up and getting mad, I would usually sit down(I'm a pretty large dude), blink a lot and try to break away my gaze since I was told that helps, but if all else fails I just leave. I have earbuds that I've had for over 5 years, and I take them and just listen to music away from everyone else. I have a special anger playlist I’ve been working on for a while, I’ve assembled all kinds of songs on it.   


This has helped me a lot but it's not always easy. For instance, my wife and I were having a huge argument over something that I'm not going to talk about. It started small, but escalated, largely spurred on by her sister, who was also participating and almost subtly egging me on.  


I told them both that I had enough and I stood up(I was in a sitting position). I took my earbuds out of my pocket and headed outside to my spot, but my wife's sister blocked the door. I tried to pull her away from the door but as I reached my hands she took my earbuds. At that point, I was so over everything, I told her to give my earbuds back, she said that we needed to talk about this and that I can't just leave, I told her again, but she tried to give my earbuds to my wife so I quickly grabbed them out of her hands and then loaded up my ""anger"" playlist.  


When I got home, my wife locked me out, and made me wait outside for 30 minutes. When I was finally let in, my wife's sister had left, but my wife said that what I did wasn't ok. I thought I was deescalating and preventing anything from happening, but my wife said that I scared her and her sister.

18gy5rr,AITA for not passing on an “heirloom” to my daughter in law?,"I am 48F and my eldest is 22M. He’s been with his fiancée (DIL) since they were 20 and he wants to marry her.

I’d always liked her before now, she’s a smart girl, she fits in well with the family, she’s driven, and she makes my son happy. Everything was all roses until they got engaged.

Now since I was little I was fascinated with jewellery. When I was older and married and had my own income I started to collect rings.

I would “design” them myself, used to ask friends and family to give me cash I could put towards them, and save up my disposable income towards whatever ring I wanted.

*Edit 2: Okay apparently this above paragraph is controversial. It is the custom of my family since always to give cash in celebrations. It’s also very normal in my community to ask your friends to give cash - I have done this myself for my friends.*

*HOWEVER THE MAJORITY OF THE COST OF EACH PIECE OF JEWELLERY WAS ALWAYS BORNE BY ME. Whatever I got from birthdays was a bonus top up - not something I relied on to be able to afford it.*

It would be less than 10% of each piece definitely not the bulk. 10% being the highest but mostly it was around the 3-4% mark if any.

*Sorry but quite a few comments are being derailed by this*

I wasn’t buying one every year but over time I have a nice collection of rings. My favourite are a sapphire with a halo of diamonds, an emerald in a trilogy with 1ct diamonds either side, and a Ruby set in a pavé band.

After son got engaged and we invited him and DIL to dinner at home, DIL asked to speak to me. She said she’s been seeing my emerald ring over the years and she has always wanted one.

She pointed out that I wear it least often, which is true, and demanded that I gift it to her as an heirloom engagement ring. This is in addition to other wedding gifts and expenses we had discussed as a family during dinner. This includes gold to the value of approximately £6000 which is honestly more than my entire wedding cost, and which I still think is a significant amount.

This rubbed me the wrong way and I admit I accused her of trying to pick through my estate before I’m even dead. I told her the ring is mine and I can even sell it on my deathbed if I want to; she has no right to expect it and she’s being a rude brat by demanding it.

She yelled at me that something like this can’t just be sold, it should be an heirloom and it’s normal for heirlooms to
Be passed on while the wearer is still alive.

I told her to leave if she was just in my home to demand my property and she stormed out, taking my son with her.

She’s mad at me and son says I should’ve just passed the ring to her since I have others and it would
Be a nice gesture to welcome her to the family! He says it’s no different than his sister occasionally borrowing some of my pieces.

My husband and my daughter are on my side but this is the first time my son has shut me out like this so AITA?

(Edit: DIL has an engagement ring already. It’s beautiful and I would call it expensive. This is not a case of her being proposed to without a ring.)",Existing_Ring_,8427,0.959999978542328,2636,1702419209,2023-12-12 16:13:29,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gy5rr/aita_for_not_passing_on_an_heirloom_to_my/,12,2023
18huhjo,AITA for staying with my parents and refusing to come home unless it is in the condition I left it whenever my in-laws visit.,"My husband cannot control his family. Or at least he refuses to. When his parents visit and give us shit for ""forcing"" our kids to do chores he gives in and the house slowly becomes a mess that I have been left to clean up. When his siblings visit we are expected to clean up after them. I never agreed to this so now I leave. 

I lock my office up and go to my parents' house. I meet up with his family at restaurants or other public places. 

His parents have learned now that when they visit they have to clean up after the kids or get them or my husband to do it. They tried saying that I was abusive for refusing to do housework while they visited. So I posted a picture of my home before they came and one I took during their last visit. I asked them why the house was so messy and dirty and did they have anything to do with it. They said it wasn't their mess. I replied that the house was clean before they showed up. Once they started getting dogpiled for messing up my house they threw the kids under the bus. They said my kids were uncontrollable and it was their mess. I pointed out that there was no mess until they came so obviously my kids were able to clean up.after themselves when there weren't people telling them not to. 

My husband's siblings have cancelled plans to visit because they know I won't be there to clean up after them or cook so they will have to cook or spend money on takeout and restaurants. Great outcome in my opinion. 

My husband says that I'm being unfair putting all the work of cleaning up on him. I said he has two children to help him as well as ADULT guests who should be able to not make a mess. I also told him he could just pay a cleaning service out of his discretionary funds if he wanted to let his family run rampant and not clean up after them. 

He said that I was being mean by not contributing and making him spend his money. I asked how much he normally spends on cleaning the house. The answer is nothing since the four of us keep the house clean and tidy when we are on our own.",Adept-Entrepreneur44,5263,0.9800000190734864,517,1702510149,2023-12-13 17:29:09,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18huhjo/aita_for_staying_with_my_parents_and_refusing_to/,12,2023

Its terminal and hes expected to pass within a year but that *could* change if we are lucky but with the type of cancer its unlikely. 

I just want to focus on giving my brother the best time for the time he does have left. The problem is our mother. She is putting her grief onto my brother and he has to sit around helping people grive the life hes going to lose rather than giving him a great life for how ever long he want. 

I understand grieving, i am too but i dont put that on him and its not like i want my mum to go through it alone but my brother is NOT the person to share her greif with. 

The other night i saw out mum just crying and holding him saying she doesnt want to lose him. Afterwards when my brother was asleep i told her she needs to stop grieving for him in fornt of him and if she cant do that she shouldnt at all. That shes making her own dying son deal with her own grief when hes already dealing with his own mortality. She should be supporting him, not the other way around. If she wants support she can talk to me, dad or a therapist but don put your shit on him. 

I do think i was a bit harsh, but it comes from a place of frustration. I had my own cancer scare when i was 16 and was stuck dealing with everyone elses grief while i wasnt able to deal with my own shit, i dont want that for my brother.

18k34sg,AITA for not wanting to invite a BABY to a party?,"I work at a restaurant with my parents, 2 brothers, and other people and we are having our Christmas party on Sunday. One of the people who doesn’t work at the restaurant but was still invited has a child, a 1 year old and I said that it’s stupid to invite a baby to the party. The youngest people at this party besides the baby are 15  and 17, both in high school. 

There will be tons of alcohol at this party, as well as people smoking weed (including myself), and there will be loud music, and it’s also inside of the restaurant where we work.  So I don’t think it’s the best environment for a baby, they will easily get overstimulated and cry, and it will just end in the mother (who was invited) tending to the baby all night. 

So at work I stated that it’s dumb to invite the baby, they will just cry the whole time and the mother will not enjoy it, and everyone including my parents started going off about how I’m a bad person?

Every item of snacks/soda in this house that is bought is gone within a few days because he binges until it's gone. AND he has in the past told the kids they couldn't have more dinner because there ""wasn't enough"", just so he could eat it later. I was at work for that one. I did make him get therapy but it's not doing much good because he doesn't apply himself at all (thinks it's pointless and refuses to do the steps they provide). 

Today I bought stuff for lasagna and bought myself a big salad because I can't eat red sauce. Within an hour of being home he was already in the fridge asking if he could have my salad because he was starving. I said no originally but he kept prying and said ""c'mon, please? I will share it with you."" I said ""what the fuck ever"" and walked off. He left me 3 bites. I tossed it in the trash. This was not even 10 minutes before I started cooking. He said multiple times ""I'm so full"" or ""now my belly hurts"" or ""I ate too much"". Which is common for him. But I was still salty about it honestly.

18llxr8,AITA for refusing to go to my BF's son's wedding?,"This is a burner account (obviously) as I don't want any trace back to who I am.

I (31M) have been in a relationship with an older man (65M) for 2 years. The age difference surprises some people but it's fairly common in gay culture + he is a sweet, intelligent, fun-loving man who looks fantastic.

Let's call this boyfriend James. He was married for a few years and while very civil with his ex-wife, they have been divorced for a long time and their marriage - each has admitted - was toxic. They had one son (Junior). James struggled coming out for several years but has proudly been out and proud for a few years prior to us meeting.

James's son, we will call Junior (Jr), has known about his father's sexuality for years and was polite to me at first but quickly soured after about 6 months when it was clear I was not just a fling.

Junior is a few years older than I am - which was weird at first but I think it's time he gets over it.

James and I love to travel, try new things, etc. and due to the fact James sets the plans and - let's be frank - its farther along in his career elects to pick up the check 90% of the time. Junior (the son) has started calling me ""the sugar baby"" or just ""the baby"". 

I don't cross paths with Junior very often and to keep the peace, simply have to let any negative experiences go to not give James any undue stress.

I know how our relationship looks - and James and I have had many long conversations on the subject. We are both comfortable, having fun, and have great communication.

NOW

Junior (the son) is getting married in a few months. I was not directly invited but James naturally has marked me down as his plus one. Junior is marrying a lovely girl closer to my age. Last week, during a rare dinner that we were all present for, Junior was really nasty to me and made some unkind remarks.

It is clear that Junior has resentment toward his parents for their divorce, toxic family life early in his life, etc. He also thinks I am trying to weasel my way into the father's life for financial benefit (James built several companies that do really well).

LOOK: I am not without sympathy - if my father started dating someone a few years younger than me - regardless of gender - I would be taken aback and weirded out AT FIRST.

After 2 years though it is clear - to all of James' friends and his employees - that I am good for him. He is happier, taking more time away from his businesses, and just overall most pleasent.

I have done my best but I am done being a punching bag at every event the son and I are together at.

**I am refusing to go the wedding and while James is trying to be understanding - he is clearly hurt.**

I have made it clear that I fully support him going or even taking someone else as a date. I am not trying to spoil the big day - but I can't put myself in the firing line again.

Her flight was scheduled to get back at 7:40pm Sunday night. On Sunday I went to dinner at my parents house and was going to go directly from dinner to pick her up. 

During dinner I was checking her flight status to make sure I was going to be on time. The last I checked was at 7pm and it said her flight was going to arrive at 7:28. At 7:12, as I was leaving to go to the airport, I got a text from my girlfriend saying she landed, followed by a text asking why I was still at my parents house. I said I was just leaving and would be there in about 35 minutes. She texted back and said she was “so fucking pissed”, and “don’t bother, I’m going to get an Uber”, “it’s extremely irresponsible”, “you better have a damn good excuse”… to quote a few of the texts I got on the way to the airport. 

Anyway, she ended up having to wait about 15 minutes for me to get her. She says that she shouldn’t have to wait to be picked up at the airport and that I should have given myself more time just in case her flight was earlier. To me, I don’t understand why I should have to be the one to wait in the cell phone lot, especially when I’m doing a favor (which she says me taking her to the airport and picking her up is not a favor, just something I should do). In my opinion, for a flight that landed 16 minutes before the flight tracking said it would, waiting 15 minutes is not that bad and should be understandable.

She was pretty upset when we sat down for dinner. I told her it was no big deal. He doesn't suddenly believe Jesus was the messiah because he sang about a shiny star. He's three.

She argued that its setting up a precedent, its worming into his subconscious. I told her she was being dramatic. Like half of his class is muslim and they are also taking part. It's just music.

She got pretty upset, said it was different and that she ""didn't expect"" me to get it. On Tuesday she spoke to the nursery nurses and told them she didn't want him to partake. They said they didn't have that option but she was free to take him out until after Christmas. 

She brought him home, to me, who works from home. I took him back. It's seriously not that serious. 

I told her she could take the time off work if she desperately doesn't want him there, but he already knows the songs so whats the point? Friday is his last day anyway.

She made a fuss this morning about having it noted in hia chart following that they need to make accommodation for him when celebrating religion. 

We've been fighting for a while over it. Everyone we know is evenly split - some think she's dramatic, some think I'm an asshole for making such a deal out of something that clearly means a lot to her.

18nzmei,AITA for losing it on my husband for announcing to strangers that we are going on vacation?,"My husband and I are going on a vacation in January. He’s announced to at least 3 strangers that we’ll be away and the dates. When I ask him to stop doing that, the biggest eye roll ensues and he says “only you could be so paranoid”. At first I would joke and ask him if he remembers the plot of Home Alone but now it’s getting irritating.

We live in a very safe and small town but I’m from a larger city, we didn’t go around announcing travel plans to random people. I’m not afraid of a break in exactly, but I don’t think it’s a good idea for anyone to know when you won’t be home.

Last night he tells the pizza delivery guy we are travelling, volunteers the dates and that my niece will be here pet sitting. I lost my mind in front of a small group of friends and gave him shit. He didn’t speak to me the rest of the night or this morning, I’m just livid with him.

I found out through my brother in law (30M), that FIL is not comfortable with having my wife ( 25F) and I (24F) over for new years dinner ( because gay). My parents support this, saying his house his rules. Which I get....

But, now he wants to come to our close family xmas dinner and frankly I just don't feel comfortable being around him. I also don't trust that he will behave himself because I feel like he's gotten worse over the years, saying things like "" the gays are ruining america"". 

I confronted my parents with how I felt and they said he's not homophobic. Which is just not true, everyone in the family knows and has acknowledged that before. I asked my mom if he could not come to our dinner and she said no.

18o0mzh,AITA for excluding my BIL on our Christmas gift to my in-law?,"My wife and her siblings decided to go in on a big Christmas gift to their parents instead of giving them a bunch of little gifts. After months of looking around, they decided to get them a new sofa set since the one they have now is a little old and crusty. They aimed for a price of about $3000. They decided that we will cover $2000 of it and they will split the remaining $1000. Their brother has been out of work and can’t afford to chip in so my wife decided to cover his portion and still add his name to the gift. She asked me about it and I was perfectly fine with it.

The problem started when we went to look for it. We spent weeks driving around looking for perfect set and he never once joined us. Despite not having a job, he never had the time. That annoyed me but I let it go. The other day we went to a local store and saw the perfect set but it was the last one they had and they can’t deliver until January so we had to take it with us. My BIL has a truck so we called him to come help us get it but guess what? He was busy. I ended up calling a couple of work buddies and they came to help us pick it up, take it to the in-law, and set it up. At this point my BIL has put in zero effort.

Her parents are out of town visiting relatives and will be returning around Christmas. Last night I told my wife that we’re not covering her brother’s portion and if he wants his name on the gift, he’ll have to come up with his portion or the other siblings can cover it. We got into an argument about it and she accused me of cutting him out of the gift because I know they can’t afford it. I argued that he can’t just expect to show up and take credit after not doing anything to earn it. She said he’s been sad since he’s been out of work and I said he can still drive his truck and lift boxes while being sad. I said my buddies have done more than him so their names should be on the gift. She called me an AH for saying that but I obviously disagree.",WorkingBarracuda3550,1642,0.959999978542328,203,1703201570,2023-12-21 17:32:50,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18o0mzh/aita_for_excluding_my_bil_on_our_christmas_gift/,12,2023
18oqjjy,AITA for not buying my son a car like I did for the rest of his siblings.,"I (49M) have four kids, twin boys (both 27), one girl (25F) and another son (21M). This post is about my youngest son, Jack. Since they were children, I promised my kids two things, one, I’ll fully pay for all of their college expenses (housing/tuition/food etc) and two, once they graduate college, I will buy them a car. I kept that promise for all my kids, except with Jack and now I want to know if I am an asshole for that. I paid for Jack’s college expenses, but I am refusing to buy him a car, below is some of the reasons why:

1. I co signed my name on the lease for Jack’s room that he rents with a friend, and I send Jack his portion of the rent every month. The friend started taking advantage of my name being on the lease and stopped paying for rent too, knowing I will cover the amount because I don’t want missed payments on my credit score. I asked Jack multiple times to ask his roommate to pay his portion, but the boy did not care to even respond to me and I ended up paying for six months of his friend’s rent too until I finally solved the problem by getting my name out of the lease.
2. Jack have a very rude and entitled attitude. He speaks to us like we are his low performing employees, the only time he contacts us is when he wants money and goes no contact otherwise, and we don’t know what we ever did to him to treat us that way.
3. Last year when my wife had to be hospitalized, all of my kids flew back home to be there for their mother. Jack didn’t want to but one of his siblings bought him a ticket and talked him into flying out. Instead of being glad to be beside his very sick mother at the hospital, he spent the entire visit making everyone run errands for him (his sister has to cook a very specific type of meal for him/we had to drive him to the gym at a very specific time he demands etc) and acted like it was one huge inconvenience for him to have to fly out.

I even talked to my other kids about  whether we were bad parents that caused Jack to act this way but all my other kids don’t know why he ended up so entitled and spoilt. The rest of my kids are extremely different  from Jack, we all get along with each other and care about one another.  For the rest of my kids, I spent maybe $100K on each kid’s total college expenses.  With Jack’s  careless spending habits and unwillingness to save us any money, Jack’s college years ended up costing me $180k. So I refused to buy the promised car. Jack’s upset and has gone to his grandparents complaining about me. My MIL already hates me and now is calling me an asshole saying I am playing favourites because I bought everyone a car and not Jack.",Ill_Air_2551,5730,0.959999978542328,1170,1703283670,2023-12-22 16:21:10,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18oqjjy/aita_for_not_buying_my_son_a_car_like_i_did_for/,12,2023
18or36x,AITA for refusing to speak to my husband over his Christmas plans,"My husband is Jewish and I am a culturally Christian atheist (went to Catholic school, grew up celebrating Christmas and still celebrate w family and friends). A few weeks ago I mentioned I was getting two extra days off from work at the holiday and that I thought we should use the time to start prepping the nursery. I'm 5 months pregnant and the room needs some work- furniture and guest bed removed, sickeningly bright green walls repainted, carpet deep cleaned. At the time he agreed. Well it turns out not only did he NOT take any additional time off himself (he has weeks and weeks of unused vacation), he has made plans to spend Christmas with his (Jewish) parents. They apparently invited him since he didn't get to visit on his dad's birthday or Hanukkah because of COVID in their household. I just found all this out today when I said we should start the nursery on Christmas day, since we usually visit my family on Christmas Eve and I'll be busy Saturday doing last minute shopping and wrapping.

I'm floored. My husband chose to disregard our plans and spend the holiday with people who DO NOT celebrate it rather than with his wife who DOES. And he wasn't planning to tell me about it. I already knew he struggles to ever say no or set boundaries with his overbearing parents (who could have easily scheduled time Friday or Saturday before Xmas Eve or next week to gather), but this seems so beyond anything I would have expected from him. I'm starting to feel like we're not even married anymore. He didn't consult me on his plans for *Christmas*. He's leaving me alone that day and the next to deal with the nursery *on my own*. I've had to nag him every other week for the last two months to start checking out local daycares since I'm swamped at work and his workload is relatively light (he finally got info from ONE daycare). I've nagged him for the last two months to look into life insurance in consideration of the baby but he hasn't. I'm starting to feel Iike I might as well be alone. He's sheepishly tried to apologize but I won't speak to him and am genuinely wondering if this relationship is coming to an end. Our anniversary was a few months ago and the day before he realized he double booked himself and canceled our dinner to go to his grandmother's birthday dinner. He never rescheduled anything for us. Am I overreacting?

18or5p8,AITA for asking my daughter to check up on our house while we were away for vacation?,"Back in the summer, my wife, son and I went to Singapore for two weeks for vacation. Our daughter had to stay behind for work.

I am 64. My wife is 61. Our son is 20.

Before we left, I asked my daughter to drive by our home while we were away to check on it every once in awhile. I even gave her our keys.

The day she picked us up from the airport, I asked her if she had stopped by our house while we were away. She said no, which honestly was disappointing and confusing. Even if she didn't remember my request, I thought my daughter would be thoughtful enough to check our home to see everything was okay. But, I decided to not ask more about it and left it at that.

A few months after we got back, my daughter took an apprenticeship where she had to live only an hour away from her apartment. She asked our son to occupy and housesit her place for 6 weeks, a much bigger request then we were even asking of her to just check our house for a 2 week vacation.

All of this has felt like a slight, and a bit self-absorbed on our daughter's part. I didn't feel it was a big enough point to bring up to her, but I did want to get it off my chest, so I have mentioned how I felt about this to my wife and son a couple of times.

I just learned today that my son told our daughter about what we've been saying. He said that her explanation was that she simply ""didn't think about it"" (checking our house during the two weeks), but that's my point: the carelessness bothered me. As well, she said it's unfair to compare the two, but I feel differently.

18pml4o,AITA for making my daughter write an apology letter over comments about Christmas gifts?,"My husband (32M) and I (33F) have 4 children (13F, 11M, 8M and 2M), our two oldest are our daughter Kayla (13) and our son Liam (11). Every year, we give the kids money to spend on other family members, this year they got $100 to spend on each sibling, $50 on us, their cousins, and their grandparents and $30 on aunts and uncles. The 3 oldest can pick stuff that they think the others would like fairly easily, obviously, we substantially helped our 2 year old pick gifts.   
  
Earlier this year, Liam saw a tiktok of some guy going to a thrift store and finding basketball merch, Liam plays basketball and wanted to see if he could do the same and he found some really nice stuff. Ever since then, Liam has been a huge fan of thrifting. He has found $50 or $100 items for a few bucks. Liam also wanted to thrift gifts this year, and the vast majority of the gifts he got were thrifted, this also means he was able to get each person quite many gifts, my husband and I had to get some big black trash bags to fit them all.   
  
The kids all shop for Christmas gifts seperately, so they didn't know which stores each other were going to. Last night, we were in the living room watching The Polar Express and my husband had paused the movie to make hot cocoa during the hot cocoa song/scene. We had started talking about Christmas and Liam had mentioned he got some gifts at various different thrift stores earlier in the day. Kayla said that was ""gross"" and ""you better not have gotten me any gifts there"", she said that she was ""above that filth"".   
  
I will admit, we are quite priveleged and live in a priveleged area, so when my daughter said that, I asked where she learned that, she said her friends said similar things. I told her that was not nice and she needed to apologize, she refused and we started arguing until my husband intervened and said he would come up with something. After talking to me once the movie was over, we agreed that Kayla should have to write an apology letter to Liam for insulting him and why thrifting can be a good thing to do. She said she wasn't going to do it and has been aruging with us all day over it, I asked some friends who are also parents of teenagers if I was out of line and got mixed results, AITA?",busr2e784,1866,0.9399999976158142,43,1703389167,2023-12-23 21:39:27,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18pml4o/aita_for_making_my_daughter_write_an_apology/,12,2023

The child just said something unrelated and laughed like normal but my bf came behind him and without even addressing his son, immediately said, “can we not just sit around the house butt naked, please?”

I just looked at him incredibly dumbfounded and said, “can you please teach your son to knock?” The whole interaction was maybe about 6 seconds long. He closed the door without responding and I immediately started crying. 

I don’t know why, but this hurt me pretty bad because I feel like I was made out to be some type of predator for doing absolutely nothing wrong. I am incredibly upset by this. He came in a few minutes later trying to comfort me, and in his comforting he reiterated again the importance of not sitting around naked. I became upset all over again. Like, am I missing something? Am I wrong here?

18pmzc7,AITA for taking my kids away from their grandparents?,"For some context: I am 42M and my wife is 39F and we have two kids who are 10M and 7F. My son and daughter are everything for me. However, for the past 5 years or so, since before COVID and a bit after, I worked overseas and I rarely came home(I am a petroleum engineer and work on offshore rigs). I came home maybe 4 times in the past five years, only staying for a week max. My kids basically think of me as a stranger, and that is not their fault, it is mine. But everything I do is to provide for them, and my wife works overtime and I cannot even begin to express how much I appreciate her for that. She has been so understanding. We need the money, hence why I do what I do. 

The issue: I recently came back and switched to an on site desk job, about a month or two ago. My kids are still shy around me, and I want to get to know them better. My kids recently started coming out of their shell, and they usually spend a couple weekends per month at my in-laws place, whenever my wife has to work weekends. My wife had to work this weekend, and told me on Thursday. I asked my kids if they want to spend this weekend with me instead of their grandparents. No pressure of course. I did want to incentivize them staying though, so I promised ice cream after dinner both days, and a fast food lunch(both with my wife's permission). My son accepted immediately, and my daughter had to be bribed with a later bed time on Saturday(wife approved once again).

I just did this because I want to spend more time with my kids. I know I cannot make up for the times I've missed, but I don't want to miss anymore. However, my in-laws called me yesterday and gave me an earful about how I am interrupting their time with their grandkids and how I am breaking their tradition. I told them I just wanted to spend time with my kids, and next time my wife has to work the weekend I will send them over for sure to make up for it. They said I should find my own time to hang out with them and make traditions with them, and not interfere with what's going on. They accused me to bribing my kids for affection(partially true I guess) and for taking their grand kids away from them. They also called me a ""deadbeat"" which I feel wasn't fair since I didn't want to be away, my job made me, and I was constantly sending every penny I could back home. Had my kids still said no, I would've sent them to their grandparents. I did bribe them, but it's just with school and everything, I barely get time with them and weekends are the best. And with my wife on her business trip too, I get one on one time with them. I was just so excited and may have gotten carried away.

18pnhvw,AITA for booking my wife and son a Christmas 2024 Disney trip on Christmas Day?,"For context: My wife and I recently had our firstborn son this past Fall. The birth was traumatic and since then our poor little guy has had bouts with RSV, pneumonia and an ear infection. It’s been a hard few months on my wife to say the least. We also live in the south, half an hour away from my in-laws who we get to see regularly and they have helped us tremendously (which we’re both very grateful for). But I’m originally from the East coast and we haven’t been there in a couple of years so we’re spending Christmas with my family this year. We’ve spent the past few Thanksgivings and Christmas in our home state. As a Christmas gift and a way to give my wife an experience she’s always wanted, I booked the three of us a mini getaway to Disney World for Christmas 2024, which also includes Christmas Day.

Today however, when doing our gift exchange with our family in our home state, my mother-in-law became very upset about our trip and started asking why I would do that to her. I said “this isn’t about you. It’s about giving [wife] something she’s always wanted and deserves.” We also said that I only kept it a secret so that it wouldn’t get spoiled and that if they wanted to join us they were more than welcome to. She visibly got upset and then stormed off and locked herself in her room. She started accusing me of intentionally keeping my wife and son away from her and the rest of our family during the holidays. She also stopped talking to us the rest of the night. My wife felt guilty for receiving the gift and I began to feel like an asshole for upsetting my MIL because I was only thinking about doing something to make the missus happy that would also help us make some fun memories. I even was considering shifting the dates of our trip just to make peace. However, my MIL then started texting my wife and 1) accused me of plotting a Christmas trip away with my family over on the East coast on purpose in order to have two back-to-back years away for the holidays, and 2) berated my wife for allowing me to mistreat her in such a way. So now I definitely don’t want to move the trip because I feel like it would just reinforce my MIL’s behavior.

18pnp6m,AITA for yelling at my boyfriend for eating my donut.,"

Edit: Boyfriend  insist I add that we've been together 8 years and that if this happened a month into our relationship, he agrees it would be psychotic, but what's a donut or two after 8 years. 

This is so dumb but this is somehow one the bigger fights we've had. 

I bought a shitty donut earlier today after me and my boyfriend finished some Christmas shopping and had dinner. I bought one and we were gonna share it. We regularly share food.

We go to my parents house to pick up our dog and chill out a bit before going home. I'm in the bathroom, and my boyfriend starts eating my donut and telling me how bad it is, stale and there's no creme in it (it's a Boston creme). I tell him that there's no way he's eating my donut right now and to stop or at least save me some.

He eats the whole donut. 

I get out of the bathroom and I'm kinda upset I wanted some donut tonight, he's being silly and put himself in the ''corner'' in the kitchen pretending he's there out of shame. I'm upset and ask him if he really ate it and he makes a joke and says it was so bad and not worth the calories. 

I just wanted a donut so I tell him that and he should save me some. (He says he apologized here but I do not remember this.) We go back into the living room and my dad is telling me drop it and that I'm overreacting for no reason. My mom is telling my boyfriend to apologize just because it obviously bothered me and that reason enough to apologize. My mom was kind of condescing towards him and the vibe got tense. 

I don't want to start some dumb fight over nothing and so we say our goodbyes and leave. 

On the way home I ask him to apologize and he says I'm making a big deal out of nothing and hugely overreacting. I say he's gaslitting me. Were both upset. 

We get home and keep talking about it in circles. I just want an apology to end it and he starts yelling that I'm being a ''five year old"" and that I ""made a scene in front of your parents"" and that I'm ""overreacting so badly he doesn't recognize me"". I'm mad cause he's ""gaslighting me into thinking I'm wrong"" and ""yelling at me for no reason"" and ""it doesn't matter if the donut was bad or not at least half of it was mine"". Anyways he yells my feelings are hurt and we go to seperate rooms and chill out for a bit. 

Later we talk about it a bit and both apologize, but maintain that we are in the right. 

So Reddit, who right in this extremely dumb fight?

We have both reviewed this post and agree with its facts. 

TLDR: 
Me - mad he ate my donut because we were meant to share. Doesn't matter that it was a bad donut, it's the principle of the thing. 

Him - he claims he wouldn't have been mad if I ate 'the last oreo' as an example. And that I dragged it out for too long (meaning my anger cause it was just a donut.) He says that he felt singled out my by mom and that that's worst than the donut.


UPDATE : He bought me a box of 6 donuts the next day, my favorite ones. 
And he apologized.
All is good, but thanks Reddit!!

18t89ry,AITA for telling my daughter she needs to move out before getting engaged?,"Leah is 20 & is currently working part time while attending community college part time. She contributes a small percentage of her income (less than 20%) to help with rent/utilities/household expenses and the rest is hers to save/spend. She doesn't have a car and doesn't pay for any other expenses (insurance, etc) as those are all covered.

She's been dating her girlfriend Sophie for almost two years now and they're serious about each other. They're long-ish distance (about an hour away from each other) and only see each other once a month or so. Sophie lives with her family still as well, only she doesn't pay for household expenses and isn't responsible for any chores. Recently they seem to be getting really hype on talking/fantasizing about getting married and picking out engagement rings &tc. 

Last night Leah was telling me all these plans. ""Sophie is going to get me a sapphire engagement ring when she proposes"" ""I think I'm going to wear (x)"" 

And I was like ""It all sounds really nice hon, but I hope you're keeping your priorities in line. If you're grown enough to put a ring on your finger, you're grown enough to move out and support yourself.""

Leah wasn't happy to hear that and said they can move in together when they get married, and being engaged wouldn't really make any difference so why should she have to move out right away if they get engaged.

& I told her that personally, I don't believe in marrying someone you've never lived with. I think it's terrifically short-sighted, especially because Sophie is 21 and her mom still does everything for her. But also because neither of them truly understand the responsibilities and pressures of supporting themselves. Especially in the current economy. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with having these fantasies and dreams with a partner, and I emphasized that. My intention was to caution her against getting swept away in it/prioritizing it above other milestones that would help her survive independently.

18tzlbv,AITA for leaving Christmas dinner early because my SIL wanted to name her daughter the same name as mine but spelt different?,"I'm a 30f and my husband is a 32m. We have one daughter, Madelyn (8f). I have a SIL, Jasmin (32f) and she has been having infertility issues for a while now and has had a couple of miscarriages. Jasmin and I aren't that close but we're friendly to each other.   
  
She got pregnant a few months ago and she had her gender reveal party about 2 weeks ago. Everyone was so excited and happy when we found out she was having a girl.  
  
During this year's family Christmas dinner, she announced that she was going to name her kid Madelyn, but spelt differently of course! (as if that made it any better) Her daughter's name was going to be Madilyn. I was completely shocked. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect that Jasmin would want to name her kid Madelyn as well. If she told me before we named our daughter, I probably would've taken that into consideration before naming her.  
  
I asked Jasmin why she would want to name her daughter the same name as mine, and she said that technically it wasn't the same name since it was going to be spelt different. She also said that her great aunt's name was also Madilyn and that she thought that Madilyn was a cute name. Jasmin also mentioned that Madilyn was supposed to be the name of her kid before she had a miscarriage (this was before Madelyn was born). I never even knew that was what she wanted to name her kid because she never told anyone!  
  
I was really upset and told her she could've just told me before I named my daughter that she also wanted to name her daughter Madelyn. She said that I was always such a witch and that I probably would've named my daughter Madelyn either way. I don't even know what I ever did to this woman. I then asked what we were going to do about the confusion of them having the same name and she told me we could use my daughter's middle name! Like, what? I told her if anything, we should be calling her daughter by her middle name since my daughter came first.   
  
We went back and forth a few more times before I decided to leave early with my husband and Madelyn. My daughter was also pretty confused and asked why her aunt would want to name her daughter the same name as her. I'm still really upset and hopes she changes her mind, but this morning my BIL texted me and said that I should try to better understand Jasmin and her feelings. I texted him back and told him that she should stop being such a witch and try to understand my feelings instead.

18uyff9,AITA for moving out of my parents house during their divorce,"My parents got married young and had me in their teens I (15f) grew up as someone they blame their problems on and honestly they act like i'm the cause of their divorce. My choice in the divorce was to live with my mom and do weekly visits to dad or vice versa but they pulled me aside and said I could also decide if I wanted to stay with my grandparents because they requested custody. Their is nothing i would want more then to live with them as they act more like my parents then my real ones. When my mom heard this, she got really upset at me and started calling me a bitch and an asshole and complaining that no one loves her. She called my grandparents and started at them too. My dad is a drunkie and one of the only times he's sober, he tells me ""you're a bitch like your mom and your going to hoe around and get pregnant by the time your 16. ""  
  
I of course got really upset and called the child service person and my grandparents to see if they could get custody. Well they are and my parents are really upset over the whole thing especially cause they believe they haven't been abusive to me. I'm at my grandparents house officially now and they keep calling me to scream and curse and I feel really bad. My grandma tells me that their insecure and bad people but I think I am an asshole for doing this to them

18uzbge,AITA for giving my child the same name as my friends stillborn baby?,"I (26F) am currently 7 months pregnant and a few weeks ago we found out that we were having a little girl. My husband (28M) and I had already decided on what to name our baby depending on the gender, and upon finding out that she was going to be a girl, we announced that we would name her Adelaide. I first heard of this name when I was a kid and thought it was beautiful, and decided that if I ever had a daughter, I would name her Adelaide.

After hearing this, one of my friends (27F), who I have been close with since we were at University, began acting distant towards us. Throughout my pregnancy I have tried to be sensitive to her feelings, as I knew it was a sore point for her. Two years ago, she tragically lost her baby girl to a stillbirth. I can’t even begin to imagine how heartbreaking this must have been for her and I made sure I supported her through this devastating loss. Despite her trauma, she has never been anything less than kind and empathetic towards me, up until that day. A couple of weeks later, she confronted us, suggesting we change the name of our baby, to which we rebuffed. She kept on trying to convince us, suggesting different names, or saying that Adelaide was too old-fashioned or that it wouldn’t suite our child. We kept on denying to change her name, until eventually my friend started crying and revealed that Adelaide was the name she’d chosen for her stillborn baby.

When she was pregnant, she refused to tell anyone her baby’s name, as she wanted it to be a surprise for when she was born. After the stillbirth, she decided she would keep the name to herself because it was personal to her, to which we understood. Until recently, no one knew what her baby was going to be called. She claims that, by keeping our name, we are disrespecting the memory of her baby. She said that if I chose the same name then my daughter would be a living reminder of what could have been. I completely understand her grief, but I believe I should have the right to name my own child without being burdened by someone else’s trauma.

18uztpk,AITA for quitting because I was called an employee?,"AITA here?

My SO and I started a business and am doing decent, not well off, but we have turned a profit a lot quicker than I thought we would.

I am literally doing 100% of the work. I have worked myself into exhaustion and sickness getting this off the ground. He is working a regular job to keep paying the bills.

Anyways his mother and him have been no contact for a while and they just started talking again. She offered him a hefty loan to help ""his business"" I'm talking over $20,000. As long as I was ""just an employee"". She has ALWAYS hated me, but I won't get into that.

While yes, he has gotten me a few orders from his coworkers, I am still creating and doing 100% of the job while also doing the social media part. He doesn't even know how to work the machine or the programs to run it. While it was his money that got everything in the beginning, I have earned that back twice over on my own. 

When I heard him say that I was just an employee so I said, ""As just an employee, I QUIT."" I seriously stopped in the middle of a project (not an order but a prototype for a possible product) and went to our room. Heck I still have paint on my hands while typing this.

190bwx2,AITA for telling a doctor I don't need their consult?,"I was born with a cleft lip and had extensive surgeries to correct it. Now it's significantly less visible and the result was told to be impressive. On the unrelated note, I also have a wax issue with my ears so I have to see an ENT specialist doctor from time to time to get the wax removed.  
  
It happened to me before to have doctors (which are supposed to just remove my wax) to marvel at my cleft lip and the whole work done around it. For me it's weird because 1) I don't consider it THAT ground-breaking and 2) they're doctors, shouldn't they be more USED to that? However, I usually don't say much about it.  
  
Anyway cue doctor Jane who was supposed to remove my wax for the day. I scheduled an appointment SPECIFICALLY for that. She does it and then proceeds to ask me to open my mouth (although I told her the issue is with my EARS). I comply, foolishly imagining it's gonna be relevant to my problem but she begins talking about my cleft lip and how great the result is and wants to examine my nose point at which I stop her. I tell her there's nothing wrong with my nose and ask her if she suspects there might be an infection spreading to my ears or something. She says something like ""No, I just wanted to have a look and see more about your cleft lip..."". I stop her again (literally pushing her hands away) and keep asking if she's done with my ears. She says yes and KEEPS TRYING to see the work for my cleft lip.  
  
I told her to quit it, that I'm not sort of a museum piece that she gets to look at from all the sides and that for my cleft lip problems I see other doctors. Meanwhile I got up from the chair and started to get my stuff to leave. She said that there's no need to react like that and all she did was try to help me. I explained all the help I needed from her was with my ears and if I need more, I'll let her know. By then I was already dressed with the hand on the door handle.   
  
She kept telling me this is no way of behaving and I'm disrespectful to her. I (almost) snapped but told her as calmly as I could that for me this is not an ""interesting case"", but a lifelong condition and I'm not fond of people pointing fingers at it. I explained to her I find it unprofessional and rude. I then just left to avoid further conflict. Was I wrong?

190ccru,AITA for telling my boyfriend he deserved to get humbled.,"I (18F) and my boyfriend (19M) have been dating since we started college in October 2021. For the past I’d say 8 months my bf has become very interested in UFC (mma? idk what to call it). He gets up at like 3AM to watch fights and often has play fights with his friends one of these friends are important in this situation (I’ll call him S). We had a very large group of friends,we all graduated in summer but we all kept in touch over summer until now. Now these play fights or “spars” as my bf would say were all fun and games but they actually led my bf to believe he could actually fight because S (who says he does mma) said he’s naturally good. 

This led to a massive ego and he said he wanted to have a actual fight, and one of our other friends dad owned a gym with ring and he said he could let him fight there (idk if that was even legal). S proposed a guy for him to fight and it was a guy back from school I’ll call A. S was friends with A(not close friends) and I knew A because we used to sit next to each other in class. S said he’ll try get a hold of him. A agreed, shockingly. 

When A agreed I did express some concern to my bf (multiple times) and he didn’t listen. A was a quiet guy, but as we sat next to each other for a year I knew probably more than others about him, he was pretty much just one of those traditional masculine males in a physical sense, worked out 6 days a week, rode horses and did archery, owned large dogs but was one of those guys that looked intimidating but was actually a nerdy and friendly guy. My bf didn’t like A or A’s friends, and neither did the rest of the boys in our friends group. I always questioned my bf on this as A had literally never even spoken to him, and my bf used to say it’s because A is so arrogant and thinks he’s so good looking, this led to a lot of arguments with my bf, because why did my bf care if other women were attracted to A when he had me?

Nobody knew if A could fight but S said he told him something about he had been training in some form of martial arts. The whole build up to this my bf was acting so childish, he’d constantly try insult A in a group chat that was made and A wouldn’t even open them 90% of the time and I dont think he responded once. When the fight came along there was only one outcome from the start,  A was visibly towering over my bf, and he had clearly bulked up. On top of that, turned out he could fight, my bf lost in i’d say 90 seconds. 

After it I didn’t bother consoling him, I berated him because I expressed my concern multiple times and he picked not to listen to me. He said I’m an AH because I should support him unconditionally if I really loved him. He now wont speak to me, because he says I embarrassed him in front of his friends while he was vulnerable. Part of me feels bad but I feel like he needed to hear the truth.",Rare-Rock-4875,1499,0.9200000166893004,516,1704580771,2024-01-06 16:39:31,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190ccru/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_deserved_to_get/,1,2024

1916dia,"AITA for not paying attention to the kids at my niece's(4) birthday party when the other adults left the room without making me aware that I'll be alone with the 7 kids, which resulted in an injured kid?","I (35f) love kids, always worked in child care jobs. During gatherings of friends or family I somehow always ended up in the kids room, helping the birthday boy and his friends assemble the new Playmobil fortress (because he asked me for help) or something like that. While the other adults eat cake around a table. Nothing wrong with them. I just always wonder how I got myself sitting on the floor surrounded by tiny humans.


But lately my health took a nosedive. Burnout and other stuff. I'm no longer good with noise and crowds or focus. I'm on disability because I can't work. My family knows this. 

When my niece had her birthday I was invited but I had a really, really bad day. I knew their apartment would be too crowded and noisy for me during the party, so I told my brother I had to cancel and come the day after. Discussing the reason, my brother convinced me to still come over for a little while, eat some cake and hug the birthday girl ""to show up and not disappoint her"". I made my limitations clear, that I can't help and that I might zone out. He said it'd be no problem.

When I came over, I sang happy birthday with them all, gave my niece her birthday hug and gift and sat myself in the living room with them, eating cake. The kids were playing, I didn't know the guest parents, it was as overwhelming as I suspected, so I stuck to my piece of cake and zoned out a little.

I don't know how much time had past, but the next thing I knew was that there was a scream from my niece and when I looked up, there were no more adults around, my niece had fallen down from a bar stool she had climbed and had a bloody knee (nothing more serious, luckly). When I got to her the other adults rushed in from the balcony a room over. My niece got checked over, got a bandaid and was already playing again 5 min after. But my brother asked me what happend and why I didn't prevent her from climbing. And when I told him I zoned out, he got angry and blamed me for her accident. 

It's a few days later now and I got several messages and calls from family, how irresponsible and asshole-y I am because I was not paying attention to the kids. I thought it wasn't my fault, because I wasn't made aware that I was the only adult left in the room. But I'm beginning to doubt my point of view.

192thmi,AITA for not wanting to spend the entire vacation sun up to sun down with my husband’s family?,"My husband and I were planning a vacation for us and our 2 kids. We’ll be gone for 8 days in the summer. We’ve saved for this trip for years and were super excited.

This place is about 3 hours away from my husband’s family. They invited us to spend some days with them. However, from the start I said I wanted alone time with just the 4 of us. With the kids getting older, we don’t get a lot of time with them. We don’t have the money to travel often. I suggested 3-4 days with his family, then we’d go to the actual vacation spot. I also set the boundary we’d stay in a hotel. They all seemed to agree.

Then out of nowhere, my husband’s family decided to go to our vacation spot for the full 8 days. That’s when the hints began that we all get a house to rent. I said no. I love my husband’s family but it’d just be too much and I wanted time just us. We don’t need to be around each other 24/7. After that, my SIL started making plans for all 8 days that included us. 

I put my foot down to my husband and said no. We could spend 4 days with his family, maybe 5. But I wanted just a few just us. We never get to go on vacation. And his family visits once or twice a year so it’s not like we don’t see them.

My husband says I’ve hurt his family’s feelings. When I spoke to my SIL she said I should understand why it hurts I won’t spend the entire time with them. I asked how they’d feel if they planned a trip and we tried to change the plan. She said family does this stuff for each other.

193kvnp,AITA for reporting my college professor to my school?,"EDIT: Please understand I am not from America! I’m from Europe. This is in fact how college “works” in my country. I know it might sound strange if you’re thinking about American college. (Homeroom teachers and all) but this is how college works in my country. 

Before this starts I would like to apologize for any spelling mistakes. English is not my first language.

I (F21) have been going to college since September of last year. From September to November we had a really nice lady as our main professor (homeroom teacher).
She was already at the end of pregnancy when we started the school year so unfortunately she had to go. In December, we got a different professor (M38). I’ll call him K. 
K was a nice guy. He wasn’t too old, so he got along with a lot of the students, he was funny and everyone who knew him loved him.

A week before winter break, he had everyone do a PowerPoint presentation about themselves. Which, although some of us found childish, we all liked him so nobody complained. Multiple students did their presentations before me, and all was fine, until it was my turn.

I am a contortionist and the summer before college I got to perform in a travelling circus. I had been to that circus many times before so it was very cool that I got to be part of the show.
Contortion being my biggest hobby, I obviously mentioned it in my presentation.

When I mentioned that I got to perform in a circus, and that it was my dream job, K burst out laughing. He said: “I’ve never heard someone be this excited to be a clown”. Everyone else in class started to laugh. It’s a bit ignorant to assume that everyone in a circus is a clown, but fine. My mood changed however when I showed them a picture of me in contortion. (Like many poses in contortion, I was pretty much bent in half). When I showed that picture, one of my classmates yelled: “Now that’s an arched back”, to which K, who should be more professional than that, responded: “I bet you’re quite popular in the bedroom”. My heart dropped when he said that. I could not believe it.
I refused to finish my presentation. My classmates said I was overreacting.

After class, when I was about to walk out, I turned to K and said: “Gross joke”. Then he said: “We’re all adults here. We can joke with each other. Sometimes you just have to put your ‘big girl pants’ on and suck it up”. I didn’t respond and walked out. At home I could not stop crying because I really felt uncomfortable with that joke. I can usually handle it, but for some reason I felt like an idiot standing there.

I told my mom about what happened and she made me send an email to the school. They took it very seriously and said they would take immediate action. January 8 was my first day back at school after winter break. We were introduced to a new professor. She’s okay, but she is quite strict and not everyone likes her. She had a long lecture about inappropriate comments and how we as adults need to respect boundaries since we’re no longer little kids.

Now a lot of my classmates are mad at me because they are blaming me for K being gone. I don’t know if K still works at our college. I’m not sure what happened to him. 
But everyone thinks I’m an asshole now.",isssaryn,1407,0.949999988079071,272,1704924909,2024-01-10 16:15:09,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/193kvnp/aita_for_reporting_my_college_professor_to_my/,1,2024

194e8cr,Update: AITA For Canceling My Family Trip Last Minute,"
Before I start, I want to say thank you for all the advice from my previous post. 

I decided to take Reddit’s advice and talked to them one more time about the situation. 

I called my parents and let them know that we love them and we really want to be there for Christmas. Being so far from my family during my entire pregnancy was really difficult and I had been looking forward to this trip for a long time. I explained again that I know it’s not my room anymore, but if THEY want us to travel cross country with an infant to visit, then they need to make at least a small attempt to make the home baby friendly. Our baby can’t crawl yet, so they wouldn’t even need to baby proof. All we asked for was a reasonable space for the baby and us to sleep in. They cut in saying they have a room for us but we decided it was not good enough. I asked them if they would feel comfortable with me sending pictures of the room to our extended family as an explanation for our absence. They said “no” because it’s inappropriate to air out our business. We ended the call by saying all we need is for them to clear out some floor space to make the room more livable. 

The next day I got a picture from my mom of the room. They tidied it up. It was still a bit cramped, but it was usable. From the room they removed a old TV , a swamp cooler, a big stack of of paperwork from the floor, a broken printer, a broken clock, a stack of clothes, the desk chair, extra blankets and pillows that don’t fit in the linen closet, the broken bunk bed ladder, and a large broken picture frame. All of these things were previously either on the top bed bunk, or on the floor. With all this “junk” removed it was actually possible to walk into the room

I thanked my mom and told her that since we had not officially canceled our flight tickets, we would love to still attend Christmas. 

My parents are not used to being called out, so whenever it does happen (usually by me) they get defensive but then they later change their attitude and act better. The lack of an apology didn’t really bother me since they adjusted their behavior. They never addressed the room situation, but they cleaned it up and went above and beyond during our visit to make us feel welcome. I guess they just needed some time to think about it. 

The trip itself was great. The closet and dresser drawers were still crammed with junk, but that didn’t matter since we were just living out of our suitcases during our trip. My extended family got to meet my son. There hasn’t been a baby in my side of the family for 20 years, so my son got lots of love and attention. He also had the chance to play in the sand and put his toes in the water of the beaches I grew up in.

194fwpj,"AITA for buying something someone had already ""claimed""?","So I (22F) was at Goodwill the other day looking around. On one of the shelves I noticed a basket turned upside down, picked it up to look at it (I was looking for a container to put my jewelry in) and found this really pretty little marble statue underneath. Like one of those ones of a lady with the arms and head cut off. I really liked it and it was only 5 bucks, so I decided to get it. But this lady near me noticed what I was holding and said ""Uh oh. This other lady was looking at that. I think she hid it under the basket so no one else would see it"". I asked if she was gonna buy it, the lady said she wasn't sure. She looked around and said she didn't see the woman anywhere. I felt a little bad, but I carried it around for a while looking at other stuff, and figured if that lady saw me holding it she could come argue with me if she felt like it. 

After maybe 10-15 more minutes of looking, I was ready to leave and went to the checkout. Right when I set my stuff down I heard this voice say ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" And this older lady came up right next to me and put her hand on the statue. I noticed a man was with her, probably her husband. ""I was gonna buy this, I hid it. It's mine"" she said. I don't like confrontation, but I was also kinda mad that she was already getting in my face. I said ""I've been carrying this around and you haven't come up to talk to me about it until now. I didn't know you were set on buying it""

""Well didn't you notice it was hidden? I was making up my mind and I hid it so no one else would see it. And I decided, I'm gonna buy it"" 

""Someone told me a lady was looking at it, but I didn't know you were gonna buy it. I'm sorry, I'm already getting it"" And we both looked at the poor cashier, who kind of shrugged and said ""yeah I mean she's already up here buying it. And you can't really call dibs on something, you haven't purchased it yet"". Then the lady's husband gets involved and says ""cmon kid, let her have the statue. We're gonna put it on the dining room table. Where are you gonna put it, your desk?"" And I said YEP I am because I'm buying it. 

They both just kind of scoffed and looked at each other like I was some young punk who had just disrespected them or something. I give the cashier my card, I sign for it, he hands me my bag, meanwhile they're still standing there. I don't think either wanted to do something as blatant as physically take it from me. The lady said ""You want it that bad, even though I already was gonna buy it? I've been looking for a decoration like this for months. Are you gonna die if you don't have it? And I said ""yes I am"" and I walked out cause I didn't feel like fighting anymore. Meanwhile they followed me outside (and lucky me we parked near each other) saying stuff like ""no respect!"" and ""unbelievable!""

Which is in my driveway. I asked her before to move her vehicle, but got nowhere. Yesterday I had it. I was pulling out and as I was nearing her car she laid on the horn for at least two minutes. She got out and started screaming “If you hit my car ill sue you for every dollar you make.” Along with some insults. I had it. I called a tow truck and they impounded her vehicle today because it was on my property.

194gbbk,AITA for not letting my ex husband to bring his now wife to our daughters birthday party,"(I will be using fake names btw)

My ex husband (David) and I were married for 5 years and last year we divorced. We have a one  daughter (lily) who recently turned 7 this year.

Lily's birthday was around the corner so I was busy with decorations,  the cake and the invitations. I asked her who she wanted to attended her birthday party and she said she wanted her aunts , uncle's,  cousins basically everyone she knew from both sides .

I wasn't bothered with  lily inviting anyone from her fathers side because we were both familiar and comfortable with them . I called David and I told him about the invitations and he was cool with it until he bought up his wife. He told  me that he will bring his wife , he didn't ask me , he told me like he was forcing it because he knew I would say no and I did say no . 

I told that I was not comfortable with his wife especially her meeting lily and lily doesn't even know her that much   and I haven't even had a proper talk with her before she can see my daughter. The only thing I knew about this lady was that she did something wrong with my husband knowing very well he's married and has a daughter and I was supposed to feel comfortable with that. 

He then told me that I was making this about me and not lily , that lily is child , she doesn't even know anything yet and he really wants lily to meet his wife and she also wants to meet her . I said to him that if she really wants to meet lily then she has to speak to me first and see how she really is before I can trust her with my baby. 

He replied to me by saying that I was jealous and that I didn't want lily too see her new family and be comfortable with them and that i was hurting his wife because I wouldn't let her see her step daughter who is like her own daughter. 

I was done with him and told him if he didn't want to come then it's fine it's not like he payed a single dime for anything for the birthday party and he was crazy for me to say yes to a woman who ruined my marriage and is the reason why my daughter has to grow up with separated parents .

EDIT: The step mom does know lily and lily knows that she does have step mom but they haven't met which is not my responsibility and yes David does have visitation rights so I don't know why he doesn't introduce them to each other. That's reason why step mom said she also wants to meet her.

1958726,AITA for refusing to eat my food because my aunt put stuff on it,"My aunt lives pretty far away and my parents and I were staying with her, my uncle and 2 cousins for a week. They’re like really obsessed with eating healthy food so they only have organic stuff and like no sugar. They also live in the countryside and there’s only one little shop near them to get food from (unless you order online which is what they do.) I’m autistic and there’s a lot of food i don’t like. I’m not picky or anything and i still eat healthy stuff but i just hate a lot of foods too.

My aunt had nothing that i like eating (apart from a few little things) so i mainly just had pot noodles from the shop (they didn’t sell much i like either) but i don’t mind because pot noodles are my favourite food because they always taste the same they never change it’s great.

My aunt offered to make me a pot noodle because i was looking after my cousins when i went to eat it though she’d put lettuce and peppers and stuff in it. Basically making it into a salad. I don’t hate salad i just don’t want it in my noodles it ruins it and it makes it taste different and ew. I told her i’m not eating it and i got kinda upset at her for messing with it. She told me that i was being unreasonable and she was just trying to make me something healthier. My parents agree with her and said i should apologise.

195zlrv,AITA for cooking dinner for my girlfriend instead of taking her out like I promised?,"My girlfriend (f22) and I (m22) have been dating for little over a year.

We're both in college. Tbh I don't feel like going out most of the time, so I almost always suggest my girlfriend to stay in my apartment and order something/ cook something instead of going out. I often don't want to go to parties or such with her, which annoys her a lot. 

The other day my girlfriend mentioned a new sushi (I think, or Asian food) restaurant in our town and asked if we could go. Originally I agreed, I said that we could go on Friday. However, I didn't feel like going out last night, so instead I cooked dinner for us and when she came to my apartment (so we could go to the restaurant together) I told her that we could leave it for another day and eat at home. She was annoyed and said that I always do the same thing, I told her to chill because we could go another day. It's not like the restaurant will go anywhere, right? 

I cooked carbonara pasta for dinner, but my girlfriend said that she won't have it because she wants fish, not pasta. I told her ""okay, we can order sushi if you want"" and rolled my eyes, which made her go off on me, telling me that she feels like I want to hide her? Like if I'm embarrassed of her or something, when it's not the truth at all.

She knows my family and friends, I make all the time I can to spend time with her and I'm certainly not ashamed of her because why would I be? I'm just not an outgoing person and she knows it. She had said something similar a few months ago because I didn't post enough about her on social media (I post like twice a year). I also got upset over her comment and told her to leave if she didn't like how I am, and she left. I sent her a message today so we could talk and try to make up and she told me to give her one or two days to think.

196tokp,AITA for refusing to speak to MIL and cancelling our wedding?,"I (f35) and fiancé (m30) are considering cancelling our wedding because of MIL

MIL has never tried to have a positive relationship with me. She makes sure I’m not included in conversations, belittles my achievements & talks down to me.

Things escalated when I was planning fiancés 30th. MIL fought me on every detail and accused me of not knowing my fiancé at all. (I planned a golf weekend away for him and his family) he loves golf. 

Fiancé confronted MIL and asked why she doesn’t like me? MIL admitted she doesn’t like me. (Doesn’t like my partner driving to events, didn’t like it took me a month to find employment when I moved to a different town to be with fiancé. Fiancé receives calls and texts from MIL daily. If he doesn’t respond, she blames me. 

Fiancé told her if she doesn’t stop this behaviour toward me he will no longer speak with her.

I agreed to meet with MIL to smooth things over and try to move forward. MIL never took me up on it. But things seemed ok for a time. 

Fast forward to fiancés brothers wedding. 

Wedding day arrives and we were to be at the venue at 4pm. Five minutes to 2pm fiancé receives call from MIL saying the family photo shoot is in 5 minutes. We hadn’t been told of a family photo shoot? MIL demands we arrive at 2pm for it. We frantically get ready and arrive at the house where the wedding was. There was never a photo shoot planned. MIL comes out and tries to hand my clothes to iron. I refused. 

MIL snaps at me asking where my son is. He was never coming. He’s at the hotel. MIL continues stating everyone thought he would be there. I respond he was never coming and we RSVP just us. She has been told multiple times he wasn't coming.

The ceremony is over & I started to have guests come up to me asking where my son is. I don’t even know these peoples names. I tell them he’s at the hotel. Looks of disgust are thrown at me. My new friends stopped talking to me. I realised these people were being told my son was at the hotel but not telling them how old he is (teenager)The wedding was a place of ridicule and disgust on me.

Christmas Day at MIL house. Her family scurry away from me on arrival, refusing to hug or greet me. One man, whom I had met once 2 years ago, aggressively accused me of leaving my son alone on Christmas Day. (Son was at fathers place this year). The rumour has continued and now not only does the MIL hate me, so do her family. 

I made up an excuse to announce the fact my son was a teenager whom just finished his first year of high school at the top of his class. Everyones jaw dropped. None of them knew he is a teen. MIL hurried out of the room.

Now fiancé wants to cancel wedding and elope because of MIL.

196u0uv,AITA for telling my sister and her family to leave my house after my sister started to curse at me,"AITA for telling my sister and her family to leave my house after my sister started to curse at me.

My sister, her husband, and my niece come to my house almost every weekend. This weekend, my daughter had committed to my niece to help her put together a lego set. They arrived at our house and when they came in my daughter was playing a game, my niece was eating some dinner they’d brought for her and my sister was eating but also was clearly expressing some anger/frustration with her husband who was in the family room playing video games with my husband. This was the plan all along— for our husbands to play games and my daughter and niece to build legos. It was super early in the night (maybe 5:30/6ish) so there was a lot of time for everyone to get to everything because they are usually here until 10:30 or 11 on a weekend. 

My niece finishes her food and my sister was fussing. I actually said to my husband I may leave and run some errands because I don’t like the energy in here. I packed up the food my niece didn’t finish and put it in a bag for her. My niece starts to open the legos. She’s 7 and capable to start this task—- we were letting her do her thing. My daughter was still playing her game. 

My sister says “Sarah, are you going to get up? Jane is opening everything and she’s ready.” Sarah responded that she was coming in just a bit. My sister goes in and starts helping my niece and says “well now you need some scissors. I thought the teen almost young adult was going to get up and help you”. 

This is when I chimed in with, “Sarah doesn’t have to hop up just because Jane is done eating and ready. She will be in in just a minute” and I put the pair of scissors on the table. 

After about 3-4 minutes Sarah goes in and starts helping. My sister is on the phone and grumbling about something else and then says “oh Sarah it’s okay I don’t want your mom to think I’m forcing you to come help”. 

I respond, “hey that’s not really necessary” and try to explain that I was just saying they both could be patient while Sarah finished what she was doing. My sister cuts me off and I say “listen whatever you’re upset about you don’t need to take it out on me.”

She proceeds to start yelling and cursing at me. Telling me I need to shut the fuck up and I really need to not take this to another level because she’s already not in the mood and she about to “go there” with me. 

Without yelling I say, “you need to go. You gotta go home.”  

She says fine and said “I didn’t want to come over here today anyway.” I didn’t say anything and let them leave. 

Later my husband says “you and your sister ruined us(him and my brother in law) hanging out.” I asked okay but was I wrong? I don’t think anyone should be able to come in my home and disrupt my peace because they are in a bad mood. 

My husband responded “you don’t put family out of your house”.

196uaoo,AITA for refusing to pay rent in my bf mom’s house for staying there?,"So I (F19) and my boyfriend (M20) live separately. I have a place of my own that I rent, but my boyfriend lives with his mom still because she’s pretty sick and has no one else to care for her. 

I stay over there pretty often (maybe 2-3 nights a week) because my boyfriend works night shifts and his mom still needs someone to look after her, so I’m more than happy to stay over and do whatever needs doing. 

However, now she is asking me to pay $350 a month for staying round so often. 

This honestly baffles me, because I literally only stay there overnight a few nights a week, I barely use her food, I have the odd shower but that’s IT. I certainly dont use $350 worth of her stuff a month. This is on top of the $350 that my boyfriend pays her, which is fair enough because he lives there full time. 

Why should I pay rent on her house when I already have a place of my own that’s quite expensive?

I told her no, that’s not fair, but now she’s angry at me. My boyfriend is on my side but i can’t help but feel like I could be an AH.

EDIT: thank you guys so much for the support and advice, i really appreciate it. 
I just wanna clear a few things up for everyone. I’ve seen a few comments stating that I “don’t do anything” for my boyfriend’s mom. 
It was my mistake for not stating it in this post, so i’m sorry about that. I did address this in the comments but I understand that not everyone will see that. 

My boyfriend’s mom is bed bound and needs assistance into her wheelchair to get around. She can’t wheel the chair herself as she has arthritis (amongst other things) , so wheeling her chair would be much too heavy and strenuous for her. 

She needs assistance onto the toilet, into the bath, reaching into kitchen cupboards etc. Everything in her house has been adapted to be as accessible as it possibly can be, but she still needs a lot of assistance for her daily activities. 

I do a lot of these tasks for her during the night, as she sleeps a lot in the day so at night she’s pretty awake and is wanting food/water/bathroom visits. It was very clumsy of me to state in the comments that i “literally just go there to sleep and make sure she’s okay”, as that’s not the case, I just djdnt think before typing. I hope that clears things up!

197nwb0,"AITA for telling my husband that his mom is contradicting in how she shows ""concern"" for our toddlers health?","So my (25F)  husband (26M) is upset with me because last night his mom called him to ask us if we wanted to attend a family event later this week. I told him we could but he sensed some lack of enthusiasm from me or just got the general feeling that I already wasn't looking forward to it. He asked me why I always act like that when some kind of event involving his family comes up. I finally told him its because his mom will make me uncomfortable when we go to these events. 

She's always commenting about our toddler sons weight (who is nearly 2.5) and how he doesn't eat enough. We recently took a out of state trip for the holidays and stayed with some of his family. For a total of 3 days I feel like they nonstop talked about our toddlers eating habits and how he's ""so skinny"".  She made comments like ""he used to be such a good eater"" and by used too she means when he was 6-7 months old and barely starting to even taste food. She even specifically asked if he weighs 40 pounds yet, to which I replied I think he would be considered overweight if he weighed 40 pounds after a quick google search that said an average child will weigh 40 pounds closer to 4 years of age. My son was born ver small at only 5 pounds 7 ounces and is super active, nonstop playing all day. He probably weighs around 26 or 27 pounds which his pediatrician says is average and has never once showed concern regarding his weight/eating habits. Not only around his family does she do this but every time we take him to her house, which is not that often but maybe 3 or 4 times a month she never fails to comment that he's ""wasting away"" or ervytime she sees him he is much thinner than before. 

&#x200B;

I also told him his mom does it to pick on me since every time she is sick with the cold or flu she makes huge pots of soups and invites us over to eat since she's made so much. Last time we were thinking of somewhere to go out to eat because I had cooked all week and didn't have the energy that specific day or even feel like cooking. His mom called while we were deicing and let him know that she made a big pot of soup if we wanted to go over to eat. He said oh thats great since we were deciding on going out to eat anyways and I was up for it (to go eat at his moms) she then asked how I was doing because I had just recently gotten over having covid. Mind you I am currently 7 months pregnant with our second. My husband told her I was doing much better and she said oh good because she was very sick with something which is why she made soup. Needless to say after the call I told my husband we wouldn't be going over because I could not get sick again and I didn't want our son getting sick either. This part of the rant is more to show that she really can't be that concerned over our toddler's health since she's always doing stuff like the above.

Anyways, my husband thinks I hate his mother and I don't know how to tell her if she could lay off the comments about toddlers weight not sounding like an AH",New_Trainer2913,1511,0.959999978542328,199,1705362245,2024-01-15 17:44:05,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/197nwb0/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_his_mom_is/,1,2024
1999qzl,AITA for not giving up my plane seat?,"I 23 (f) recently had to fly across the Country to attend my sister Wedding. At the Airport there was a mom (around 40) with her little son (6 or 7) and the whole time she was demanding things from the airport staff. 
When we boarded the plane i went straight to my seat which was a middle seat, sat down and took out my earphones when the mother and the son arrived. 
They had the window seat and the seat and the aisle seat. Directly the woman demanded that she MUST sit next to her son and i MUST sit at the aisle so she could sit next to him.
 I dont like sitting in the aisle seat very much so i told her (friendly) that i dont really like giving up my seat as i dont like sitting there and she then started to yell that it is her right to sit Next to her son.
 I politely told her that i would be willing to change seats with her son (who had the window seat) and she continued yelling that she NEEDED the seat and that she wont accept that her son has to give up his seat as he is a child and deserves the window seat. In the end a Stewardess came and i got to sit in my originally seat. 
The mom kept 'accidentally' kicking me the whole flight and made her son annoy me on Purpose so i might give up my seat. 

When i went to the toilet i thought it was finally over as she might have accepted it but when i came back she was in my seat and my jacket and my bag which i left there were thrown into the aisle. I called a Stewardess and they made her get back onto her place.

199a6r5,AITA Telling my roommate her boyfriend can't visit her,"I am a freshman in college and got randomly assigned with my roommate. In the first semester her long distance boyfriend, who is 4 years older then us, came to visit twice. Once when I was away for the weekend and once during a break when I went home. Both times he stayed a day longer then I was away. The first time this happened I slept in my own bed sharing a room with them. The second time my roommate asked if I could give them alone time and I slept on my friends floor.

Recently she asked if I would be traveling this month and I said no. She informed me that she was hoping for her boyfriend to come visit and stay in our dorm room for 3 nights as hotels are expensive. I told her that I did't feel comfortable sharing a room with them for 3 days and didn't want to sleep on my friends floor again. She said that her friend has an air mattress I could borrow and I told her I didn't want sleep on a random persons air mattress nor did I want to impose on my friend and her roommates room for 3 days especially as she wanted him to come during a time when I have exams and need my room to study. I asked her if it would be possible for her to wait till spring break to see him or to visit him as he has his own apartment rather then him come here. She said she really wanted him to come here. And I repeated that I didn't want him to come. She then left the room.

When she returned it looked like she had cried and she told me that it makes her very sad when she can't see him for a long time and that I'm not letting her see him and that if my long distance bf came to visit she would gladly sleep in someone else's room.

This places me in a pretty awkward position. she's 18, and she's not my kid, and it's against my general moral compass to tell other adults how to dress. however, I'm awfully tired of looking at a random persons bum floss in my own home.

I did try talking with her about it, but she brushes it off as if it was just an accident. 10 of 15 minutes later, I see her casually lift the band of her underwear so that it's back to being above her pants.

So, here's what I did about it. I needed to go run some errands and give her a ride to the the post office. Only, as soon as we arrived at the grocery store, her eyes went wide when I stepped out of the car. In the back of my drawer, I had found the loudest most bedazzled thong that I owned, and was wearing it a proud several inches above my own pants. I knew that the best way to make it uncool would be to adopt it myself.

I could see her dying inside, but I pretended not to notice and told her how seeing her thong made me remember back to the 90s, how it was so cute and I was inspired to try it again, how fun it would be to whale tail together etc etc. Needless to say, she didn't say very much for the rest of the evening. If her thong wasn't out of her pants, I would act pouty and tell her that it would be fun if we were matching. 

Since then, she's been really stand offish with me, to the point that other family members have noticed (nobody but me knows about my little prank). It's making me start to wonder if perhaps it was too far.

19aw9yl,"AITA for being a ""choosing beggar""?","I'm (27f) currently in a bit of a financial bind. I have some collectibles that I'm selling for a decent price (little cheaper than market price) for money. Some of these are limited edition video games, out of print edition books, and some rare manga. Most of them would sell for $150-300 because they're collector's items.

I listed the manga for Cowboy Bebop on eBay and the start price for the auction is $75. I paid that much when I bought them and the median price for all 5 volumes seems to be about $150-200.

My friend messaged me and said she wants the manga for her boyfriend's birthday. I asked her how much she's offering and she said $30. I said no and the price is firm, even for a friend. Then she upped the price to $35... Still too low. I sent her a link to the auction and said she could bid on it like everyone else. I added that if she doesn't like it, she's not worth being friends for such a lowball offer knowing that I'm in a bind.

19bocje,AITA for dressing inappropriately in front of my BIL?,"So to start this off, this issue is with me 22f, my sister 26f and her husband 30m. 

To add some backstory, basically ever since they started growing, my breasts have been large, I have a very small frame otherwise and I am 5ft2, so almost my whole life I have thought that my body looked weird. I have always covered up as best as I could with large hoodies, big t-shirts and so on. I have always dressed this way as I genuinely was ashamed and hated my body. I started working at 16 knowing my main goal was to afford a breast reduction, last year I was finally able to afford it and got them done. They are still a bit on the bigger side, but I have never ever felt so comfortable and happy in my own body as I do now (not to mention the weight that has LITERALLY been lifted off my shoulders!?). 

So this last weekend my sister and her husband came to visit our family, and we had planned a dinner at a restaurant. It was nothing extravagant, but still a pretty nice place. I just wore jeans with a tight fitting shirt, it did not show my breast but since it is tight fitting you can see the outline of them. I thought everything went well, we all chatted and talked like usual, but a bit in I noticed BIL was staring at me extremely much. I got kind off uncomfortable and I think my sister also noticed and she was silent for almost the whole night after that. I thought she was mad at BIL and that she could see that I was uncomfortable with his stares.

But the same night she texted me, telling me that I did not need to dress so inappropriate in front of a married man, that I need to have some self respect and that she did not think I was the type to try and seduce a married man. I texted her, explaining that it was not my intention and told her that I actually felt uncomfortable with his stares. She texted me back just saying that if I did not want him to stare, then I should have not dressed that way.

I was extremely upset by all of this and talked with my mother, but my mother agreed with my sister. I am starting to feel like I should’ve thought about covering up and do more, especially since my mother also thinks I was an asshole for this..",throwaway2847362662,4712,0.959999978542328,1063,1705791263,2024-01-20 16:54:23,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19bocje/aita_for_dressing_inappropriately_in_front_of_my/,1,2024
19boljy,AITA for locking my boyfriend out of the house?,"My boyfriend, Cody (27M) and I (25F) live together. However, I don't like it when his sister, Jessica (23) visits because 9 times out of 10 something in my closet always goes missing. I've confronted her and she admitted that she took some clothes (allegedly with my boyfriend's permission) because she likes my style and was hoping to return them. NONE have ever returned. So I talked to Cody and we agreed he should not allow her to come into our room when she visits, going as far as to lock whenever she's around.

That was nothing because she started taking other stuff from around the house, ranging from some food and at extreme, an entire kettle. I put a stop to this and threatened to open a theft case and that I didn't want her in the house anymore. Cody agreed with me and I thought we had an understanding.

Yesterday I came back home and at first I didn't notice but as I spent more time around the house, I noticed that some stuff was missing. This included a few pots dishes, cups, silverware, groceries and other honestly a lot more. I literally thought something broke in so I called Cody, who told me he lent Jessica his keys for her to take a few things from the house because she was supposedly ""having it rough"" lately. I argued that way more was taken and that he should have talked to me but he promised he would buy the stuff back.

It wasn't until I went to thoroughly look around our room for anything missing that I reached my breaking point because some of my clothes, hair dryer, straightener and unused lotions were gone. I called up my boyfriend again and he told me not to fuss about it as he was just gonna buy all of it again. I was beyond livid at that point.

When my boyfriend came back, I refused to let him in until he got back everything his sister took. He didn't take me seriously at first but I was not letting this go. It was either he got my stuff back or I would open a case. After about an hour, he left and he's slept over at Jessica's but is still yet to return. To no surprise, Jessica thinks I'm being petty.

Cody isn't taking my calls and I think I hurt him by refusing him entry. I'm afraid it may affect our relationship.

19chea9,AITA for getting frustrated that my mom lied about my medical history?,"I (36F) am expecting a baby in late May. When I met my midwife, she asked me if I had any allergies, and I said sulfa drugs. She asked if I've ever had a reaction or if I was just told as a kid, and if it was the latter I could be referred to an allergist because I may have outgrown the allergy. In her words, it would just make my life easier if I was able to say ""no allergies."" 

So I went to the allergist last week, and the doctor explained that there is no test for sulfa drugs, I would just have to be exposed to them to see if I have a reaction, and he wasn't going to do that because I'm pregnant. He asked if I'd ever had a reaction, and I said not to my recollection, I had only ever been told ""if anyone ever asks about your allergies, you say you're allergic to sulfa drugs."" So that's what I've always done. The doctor said ""I'd be very interested to speak to your mother, since this was such a long time ago and you were a child. Is it possible speak to her?"" I told him she's working but I'll text her to ask. I left the appointment with the agreement that I could come back to the allergist once I'm not pregnant, and I can find out then if I'm still allergic to sulfa drugs. 

That evening I received the following text from my mother: Here is the 411 on Sulfa drugs. I never let the doc give prescriptions for anything especially antibiotics that contained sulfa because it constipated me and gave me a headache. I just figured it would do the same for you and [brother]. You were allergic to ragweed and I think dust mites as well.""

So I feel quite frustrated, because I'm reading this text and saying to myself, ""so for the past 30 years, I've been unknowingly lying about my medical information, because you couldn't poop?"" 

A part of me can appreciate how funny this is, and says ""ok no harm no foul"" but then another part of me is super frustrated that my mother has (once again) made questionable choices that have impacted my childhood and adulthood. When I spoke to her on the phone afterwards, she didn't even bring it up, and I didn't feel like I could bring it up without airing my frustration.

19e1en8,AITA For going on holiday with my grandchildren and without my daughters partners children?,"My daughter, Alice, has two children, one is with her current partner, Liam. He has three children from a previous relationship.

To celebrate my youngest child’s 21st birthday,  I was planning a surprise holiday for us all to Disneyland. I found a great flight deal and was keen to get it booked. Prior to booking the holiday I spoke to Liam on the phone I told him my plan and asked him about his three children from the previous relationship coming. It was decided he’d speak to their mother, who is a very difficult character, to ask her permission. I booked the flight deal for 5, resigned to the fact that the flight cost would increase for the remaining 4 flights. 

The flights are over the Easter holiday, and Liams Ex has said the children cannot come. She wants to do an egg hunt with them. Liam wants to move the holiday to suit his ex. The dates suit my daughter whose 21st Birthday we are celebrating, and of course the cheap flight deal is a factor also.

This has all backfired onto me because Liam is disappointed they can’t go, he says the other two shouldn’t go. He claims I am not treating the family the same, and has completely overlooked the conversation I had with him before booking, and the subsequent messages I have sent regarding an update on the booking.

What should have been a lovely surprise for everyone has been ruined by Liams fury at his ex partner.

So am I the asshole for booking the deal flights for my children and grandchildren and not waiting for response from his ex about their three children?

19e1hra,AITA for confronting my SIL that she was trying to make our wedding a showcase for her kids?,"My husband and I recently got married and I felt that my SIL tried to make our special day about her kids.

  
I proposed to my SIL's kids if they could be our flower girls for the special day. The kids were so excited and said yes! Everything seemed to go according to plan until two months before the wedding when my SIL asked me if the kids should have two dresses for two entrances (wedding ceremony & dinner reception). I told my SIL that the kids will only have one entrance, as our flower girls, during my wedding ceremony. My SIL looked upset and said ""they MUST walk during the dinner reception too."" Note that my wedding ceremony and dinner reception was at the same location and the wedding aisle was long (85ft long) so it takes some time to get from one end to the other (especially for kids).  
  
I am not the confrontational type, so I asked my husband to tell his sister that her daughters will only walk down the aisle once. My husband agreed and told his sister. My SIL disapproved and said to my husband that he is the kids' only beloved uncle and that her daughters will never get a chance to be flower girls again.

  
I thought everything was sorted out... until the big day. The wedding ceremony went as should and the flower girls were so beautiful; however, when the dinner reception time came and my husband and my entrance to the dinner reception was about to happen, the SIL inserted her kids in front of us with fresh baskets of rose petals. The SIL never told me nor my husband about this entrance.

  
I was blindsided. Turns out that my SIL went behind my back and told my MOH to tell the wedding MC (emcee) to announce the flower girls first to the dinner reception. The flower girls entered the dinner reception laying out a fresh set of rose petals down the aisle once more. While I was surprised, I was not angry (nor sad) because it was a special day and I did not want to let bad emotions ruin the day. I was also going to let the MC introduce and thank the flower girls during the reception anyways, so I did not mind.

  
This quickly changed when my SIL planned a surprise dance by the daughters in the middle of dinner as a gift to us. The MC once again announced the flower girls and they started dancing down the aisle onto the main stage again. So, all in all the kids ""walked"" down the aisle not once, not twice, but three times! My husband and I were supposed to have our first dance during this time, but instead her daughters danced on the stage, while my husband and I had our first dance on the side...

  
After the wedding I told my husband how upset I was at his sister and said she was trying to make the day about her kids. I confronted my SIL about this, but she shrugged it off and said that they were just kids and I am being a bridezilla/an a-hole. Instead my husband apologized on her behalf, which angered me more since it was not his fault.

19euvrm,AITA for refusing to share my vacation home with my in-laws for six months after they sold their house without consulting me?,"
AITA for refusing to share my vacation home with my in-laws for six months after they sold their house without consulting me?
Background: My husband (35M) and I (33F) have been married for five years. We own a beautiful vacation home on the beach that we built ourselves and use throughout the year. My in-laws (60s) have always been welcome guests, visiting for a few weeks here and there, and contributing financially towards maintenance costs.

 Last month, my in-laws suddenly announced they were selling their house to ""downsize"" and move into a tiny condo. Apparently, they've been secretly harbouring this idea for months, never mentioning it to me or my husband. They plan to close on the sale in two weeks and then... move into our vacation home for six months while they ""figure things out.""

I was floored. This house is our sanctuary, not a retirement home extension. We use it frequently, have friends and family booked to visit throughout the year, and rely on the income it generates during peak season. My in-laws, on the other hand, haven't lifted a finger on the property themselves and contributed only minimally.

 My husband, bless his sweet heart, is more understanding. He feels bad for his parents and believes we can ""make it work."" His in-laws, sensing my resistance, are now guilt-tripping us, claiming they have nowhere else to go and offering to pay ""significantly more"" than their usual contribution.

1abvevj,"AITA for letting my Stepdad tank my mother's birthday, ""To Make Myself Look Good""?","So, it was my 20F mom's birthday, and it was her 40th, which my family regards as a milestone birthday. This birthday is a bit more important, because my mother is anxious about her 40's. Her father passed in his, so it was important to me that she begins this decade on a positive note.

My mother has been married to my stepdad for 9 years, together on and off for 16 years. My stepdad is notoriously bad at birthdays. So since I was 17, I've planned my mother's birthday, mother's day, Christmas, etc.. I've tell everyone what we're doing, what she may want, who is allowed to know what, etc. She's been noticeably happier with that arrangement. Which has left a dent in my stepdads ego. So he said he would be planning my mother's birthday, without any of my ""ornery"" supervision. He made it very clear he did not want my input. So I let him do it, sure I gave him a good example to go by.

However, as the day approached, it became clear that his plans weren't turning out as my mom would have wanted. He didn't celebrate because he mixed up the days, and took the wrong day off work, so he planned for the day before. He ordered a marble cake with whipped icing, tickets to The Color Purple, and a reservation to an Italian restaurant. Her favorite cake is chocolate with buttercream, she hates musicals, and her favorite thing to eat is steak w/ lobster tails. He didn't invite me or my siblings, to any of these plans either, as the cherry on top. Worried that my mom might be disappointed, I discreetly made backup birthday plans, thinking it would be a nice surprise.

So when the day before came, I let my stepdad give her the wrong cake, a musical, and a plate of pasta. He also lied and said he had mandatory overtime at his job on her actual birthday. Obviously she did not have a good time

 So the next day, I surprised her with ""everything"". Flowers, breakfast, spa day, comedy show, and a dinner at a steakhouse, with all of her children included. And she cried happy tears into her chocolate w/ buttercream cake. Overall a wonderful success.

When my stepfather found out, he was furious, feeling like I undermined his efforts and made him look bad. He argued that I should have trusted his plans and not taken matters into my own hands, for the sole purpose to make myself look good.

I explained that I only wanted to ensure my mom had a special day, and the backup plans were meant to be a thoughtful gesture. Despite my intentions, tensions escalated as he felt his authority was challenged.

Now, I'm left wondering: AITA for trying to salvage my mom's birthday, or did I overstep by creating backup plans without consulting my stepfather?

EDIT/INFO: First off, thank you for the kind responses. I did go into it wanting to make my mom happy, and I'm happy the consensus is that it was all that mattered. Now to answer a few questions.

1.Why did my mother's husband not know jack ish about my mama? - He does know these facts about her, and I've mentioned all of these things to him before. Apparently, he got all of these ideas from his mother. Because she's the best source of information about my mom. And her words override everything I ever said about her.

2. How do I know she was upset with his plans? - The first sign is the fact I know she doesn't like those things to begin with. 2nd HE was upset with her for being quiet/short with him since dinner, he was fussing at her since they came in the house. 3rd She came home and went straight to bed, without speaking to anyone. The difference between that, and how my events ended, are very apparent. I'm not pulling that out of my behind.

3. Why did I allow him to make the plans at the expense of my mother's day? - I didn't ""allow"" him to do anything. He's a grown adult man, and I'm not a babysitter. I had nothing to gain from his failure, but a sad mom. I probably would've said something if he had bothered to celebrate on the proper date. She still had a great time at the end of the day. 

4. Do I dislike my stepfather? - No. I don't happen to like him though either. My father was present growing up, so he wasn't comfortable taking a parental role, or really any role, in my life growing up. So he's really just the guy my mom is married to.

5. Why is my mom with him? - She was young mother with 3 young children, his apathy towards is made her feel we could be safe in the same household with him. Now though, she's just comfortable with the status quo. She's really no fuss, so this is really only an issue on special milestone, holidays. Like for their 10th anniversary this year, she wants something really nice. But for their 9th last year, they went bowling, and she was happy. He what she needed in the beginning, now she has no reason to get rid of him, because she doesn't feel mistreated.

6. What does my mom think? - She doesn't know this wasn't the original plan. She really thinks I planned that dumpster fire, to make her birthday seem more special, because my stepdad couldn't attend. She hasn't asked me to clarify, so I won't say anything unless she does ask. So she's still happy with everyone.",Expert_Tomatillo5401,4508,0.9700000286102296,436,1706309444,2024-01-26 16:50:44,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1abvevj/aita_for_letting_my_stepdad_tank_my_mothers/,1,2024

1aco6ek,AITA for not wanting to give my step-cousin my new dress?,"My (16f) whole family (grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins) is attending a formal event in a couple of weeks.

My step-cousin “Jen” and I are the same age, and her dad married my aunt when she was 6. Jen’s dad doesn’t make a lot of money, so Jen didn’t have a lot of things growing up, and my mother would always give my old things to Jen rather than throw them away. Especially for formal events, which we all attend quite often because of my grandparents, my mother would always take the dress I’d worn to the last function and give it to Jen so that her dad didn’t have to buy one. As we’re now older and not growing, I now only loan the dresses to Jen.

I assumed it would be the same this time, so a few days ago when Jen and her family came over for dinner I took Jen upstairs to give her the dress. Jen saw the new dress I had for the event and asked if I would loan her that one instead. She said she’d never got to wear a dress everyone hadn’t already seen me in and it wasn’t fair she always had hand me downs. I said no, because I’d bought the dress to wear to this event, I was being nice to lend her a dress, she doesn’t get to demand it be the new one. 

Jen and I were arguing and eventually the adults got involved. My parents stick up for me and said I don’t have to share the dress, but Jen was very upset and her dad took her side, saying it wouldn’t kill me to wear one of the many other dresses I have and just let Jen have the special one for once. I then said if she wants a specific dress he should buy it, not try and take it from kids, which set him off. 

The parents are now fighting over this dress drama, and part of me thinks maybe I should have just loaned Jen the dress. I love that dress and I was excited to wear it, which is why I didn’t, and my parents say I absolutely shouldn’t. But I don’t want everyone to fall out over it.

1adfrs7,AITA For not wanting to claim this child as my (half) sibling,"Alright so I, 20M, have 4 siblings (T 22, N 17, D 6 and M 3, all F). D and M are half siblings from my dad’s second marriage , but T, N and I all regard these two kids as our sisters, and we don’t care about the “half” aspect of it. 

Important information before continuing. 

1. My mum is still alive. Parents split around 8 years ago. Dad was unfaithful and manipulative so mum left with the kids. He is also a narcissist. 
2. I have a good relationship with dad’s wife. She’s a great mother to my sisters. They live together and I video call them very often. When we’re in the same city, we’re always hanging out with these kids. 
3. Contact with my dad is very very low. 
4. Dad didn’t pay child support for us…mum did it herself. 
5. T and I left for college three years ago and three months ago respectively. 
6. We’ve known about the unborn love child for 6 months, but he only told us about it in the last 24 hours. 

Here’s the mess. 

Dad had an affair with some new (married) woman. Don’t know who she is (dgaf either). He is still married to my step mother, but there have been murmurs that she may leave with the two girls. He’s essentially broken up the marriage again, in the same way he broke his first marriage. He wants his kids to have a relationship with this new child, and we’re all refusing, as this child is the product of his affair with another married woman. While we weren’t thrilled about our parents’ divorce, we accepted his wife and their kids as our little sisters. We have solid relationships with them. His justification for his affair is that he “didn’t plan it” and that it “wasn’t meant to happen”. He doesn’t want this child to grow up without his “family”. He claims his wife is gonna raise the baby with him and his AP gonna give up parental rights (we know it’s bullshit.) He also claims his wife was cool with the matter (also bullshit). 

We have told him that we don’t want anything to do with his love child or his affair partner and that they have no place claiming siblinghood or any sort of family status, given that he wasn’t supposed to be fucking other women since he’s married. He wishes for this kid to have the same privileges that my youngest two sisters have (we take them out, we spoil them, etc) but this kid won’t get those perks. That’s his mess.

1adgype,AITA for not wanting to help my mom after she didn't buy me food?,"I am 16f and I live with my brother 17m along with our parents. Since I'm an artist my mom asked me to paint something for a project she's working on. At first I was hesitant, and originally not going to do it since I don't make art for free, but she was being very persistent so I agreed to help just to get her to stop asking. Today she went to drop off some library books and asked me to go with her. 

She told my brother (17m) that she was going to stop to get some lunch and asked him what he wanted, he said he wasn't very hungry and not to get him anything. She never asked me what I wanted, but I assumed since I was going with her she would ask me once we got there. We dropped off the books and she started making her way home. 

I asked her if we were still getting lunch and she said ""no, your brother isn't hungry"". I said ""well I'm hungry, I haven't eaten today and there's no food at the house"". And I'm not exaggerating, we are out of food because my parents need to go grocery shopping, my mom said she'd do it tomorrow, so we won't have anything to eat until then. If we had ingredients I would just make something but we don't even have enough stuff to make a homemade meal. She called my brother and once again asked him what he wanted to eat, he said ""I'm not that hungry, just get me something small."" She never asked me what I wanted. 

We pull into the drive thru and she still didn't bother to ask me what I wanted to eat, she orders what my brother asked for and something for her self, then without asking me if I wanted anything or giving me enough time to spit out my order, she said ""that will be everything"". Then drove through the line. I was shocked, and really upset. But what really irks me is she seemed completely oblivious to what she did. She was just like ""you didn't want anything, did you?"" After we got the food.

Of course I wanted something, I told you before we pulled in that I was hungry and didn't eat anything today. She wasn't even going to get food, ahe was going to drive straight home until I said something. Then she had to audacity to tell me that I need to work on her stupid project when we get home. I'm really fed up that she keeps demanding I do this for her, without even offering me compensation, or at the very least getting me something to eat so I'm not working on an empty stomach. When we got home I told her she can do it herself, and that I won't be helping her with it. She called me rude and entitled, and maybe I am, but I feel disrespected, and I won't take that from my own mother.

I invited my wife's parents, who declined with the statement ""we are unavailable that night, that is why we brought her present to her on Friday."" I invited both her brothers.

According to my wife I should have offered an alternative day (again, AITA for thinking that my mother in law's answer meant ""we have already celebrated""?).

Further, they scheduled this secret celebration on a day they knew I could not participate.. I have a long-standing volunteer commitment every Sunday from 8am to 5pm. The in-laws know it. I would have had to say ""no"" to the invite regardless - not enough time to arrange a sub for my shift - but am hurt that I wasn't even asked or made aware of the event. AITA for thinking they could have still at least asked?

1ae8c67,AITA For telling my wife I don't want her sister at our house all the time,"My wife (38F) and I (39M) have been married for 12 years and have 3 kids (10, & 7-year-old twins).  About 8-months ago, my wife's sister Ann (29F) went through a pretty traumatic time.  She found out she was pregnant with her long-time BF of 6 years.  It wasn't planned, but that didn't lessen the heartbreak when she lost the pregnancy at 10-weeks.  To make things even worse, her BF left her 2 months later.  Ann lives about 15-minutes from us so obviously we were there to support her with anything she needed.  Neither my wife nor Ann are close to their parents at all so we are pretty much the only family Ann has.  

Ann was understandably heartbroken by what happened and was struggling pretty hard.  My wife was very diligent about making sure Ann didn't do anything stupid when her mental health was struggling so she pretty much included her in everything we did so she could keep an eye on her.  This included turning an extra room in our house into a bedroom for Ann.  The room had previously been a gaming/play room.  

For the past 6-months Ann has been staying at our house 4-5 nights a week.  She still has her own apartment, but she spends the vast majority of her time at our house and is included in pretty much all of our family plans.  

At first, I was understanding and knew my wife wanted to keep a close eye on Ann because she was struggling so bad.  But having another adult in our house pretty much all the time has been wearing on me.  Ann doesn't do much of anything to help around the house and anytime there is a mention of chores or cleaning, she will scoot off back to her apartment with some excuse.  Whenever I bring this up to my wife she will make excuses for Ann and say that she is a ""guest"" so we can't expect her to help around the house.  

Ann is also now very different around our kids.  She used to be a very involved and fun aunt and would babysit for us so we could have date nights.  But now, she refuses to be left alone with the kids for even short periods of time because she says it is bad for her mental health after what happened.  

The other day I asked my wife if she can ask Ann to watch the kids on Valentine's day so we can go out together and she refused and said I should know we can't ask that of her.  It started a fight between us about Ann and I expressed a lot of frustration with how Ann is always at our house and I don't like it.  I made the mistake of saying ""It's been 6-months, how much longer are we going to do this?""  That pissed off my wife and she called me a heartless asshole.  

Before anyone asks, yes Ann is in therapy and from what I can tell she is doing much better emotionally and mentally.  I've never said anything about this to her, but her BF breaking up with her was a blessing.  The guy was a loser and I don't think he would have been a good father.  

I understand my wife feels responsible for Ann, but I also feel like she has a responsibility to keep me happy too.

1ae8maz,AITA for choosing my wife instead of my niece?,"I (m25) have a niece (f6), I'm her godfather, she's the only kid in the family for now so she's quite spoiled

Her birthday party was last Saturday, my sister said that my niece wanted a Disney themed birthday (Encanto), so my sister asked me to dress up as one of the characters. This is something that we usually do for my niece, since she likes it and it's fun. I said yes like three weeks ago, so please have that in mind. 

My wife (f25) is pregnant, she's nine weeks along, but she's already having a lot of symptoms and she doesn't feel great. She has a lot of nausea, some smells get her very sick and she's just feeling tired/ moody since she's not getting a lot of sleep either. 

The day before the party she had been sick most of the night, so we didn't sleep well. The party was at 2pm, my wife actually told me to go to the party *** because she could stay alone, she was tired and feeling quite needy but she was mostly ""fine"" (no nausea at the moment, she was able to eat something and was a bit more comfortable) but I felt terribly leaving her alone. So I decided to stay with her so we could cuddle and rest.

I texted my sister to let her know that I'm not coming to the party at around 1:45 or so. Now, I know my sister, I know that she and our family would've called me and send me texts to try to get me to go, so my wife and I turned our phones off so we could have a peaceful nap. 

Just as I thought, hours later when I turned on my phone again I had tons of calls and missed texts. I read the texts and it seems like at some point my niece made a big tantrum because I wasn't there (because I promised her to go as one of the characters of the movie and play with her/ the kids. She refused to do anything and listen to her parents, so long story short they had to end the party early. My whole family is absolutely blaming me for ruining the party. My sister said I'm an asshole because I promised her daughter to be there dressed up and then didn't show up, I remind her that I said yes three weeks ago, so a lot of stuff can change in those three weeks. I told them what my wife was going through and why I wanted to stay with her.

They called me off and said that she (my wife) is somehow trying to get me away from them, they said that she's an adult and doesn't need to be pampered all the time, she could be a couple hours alone. I told them off for acting and talking like that about her, and said that I can do whatever I want with my time and I told my sister that if she would've raised her daughter better than she wouldn't have made that scene. We had a big argument which ended in insults. 

Now almost everyone is on their side and not mine, am I really wrong here? I feel like they're not trying to understand the reason why I didn't go to the party, like I'd rather have my wife feel great and go to the birthday party than this. They say that I'm acting selfish but to me they're the selfish ones. Please give your opinions and I'll answer any questions if there's any

*** My wife told me to go to the party if I wanted, but she preferred me to stay since she wanted cuddles. She wasn't feeling very sick physically at the moment, but she mostly wanted emotional support

Please bare with me if I don't explain myself too well, we're Spanish 

I can't answer all the comments I'm sorry!! 

My family knows that my wife is pregnant for those who were wondering. My niece is six years old, not sixteen!! I told them I wasn't going fifteen minutes before because I was debating weather to go or not. My wife said to go but she wanted me to stay since she needed emotional support, she's needy and emotional for now... 
I know that turning off the phone is rude, sorry, I'm just used to doing it since my family is too much sometimes and they can't take a no when I do something they don't like, so I wanted to prevent that or at least postpone it

Also this was my niece's birthday party but her actual birthday was another day, that's why I didn't mention telling her happy birthday or something like that, I greeted her on her birthday day (last Wednesday)",Affectionate-Rip5017,5206,0.8999999761581421,3210,1706568310,2024-01-29 16:45:10,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ae8maz/aita_for_choosing_my_wife_instead_of_my_niece/,1,2024

With permission from our boss we decided to fill up her entire office with balloons, normally we start working at 9AM but for this we came in 3 hours early at 6AM.  


Together we spent around 50$ worth of equipment to do this, we finished this within 2 hours and started waiting until Lily came to the office. After 45 minutes she arrived and she went up to her office, once she got to her office she opened the door and the entire room was filled with balloons. But since there were so many, alot of them escaped the room and fell onto Lily.   


She suddenly started screaming and backed off really quickly, we went out of hiding and surprised her.  Then she said she was very allergic for latex, but I didn't understand. She explained that balloons are made of Latex, and that I should've known that she was allergic for Latex.  


After 30 minutes the allergic reaction became so severe that she had to be rushed to the hospital, I didn't mean to do this since I thought balloons were made out of rubber. It's been 2 days and she's recovering at home since returning from the hospital today.

1af0v6p,AITA for coming to dinner basically topless?,"I've dreaded posting for a while because I'm afraid I might be the AH. But i just gotta know. So here goes. 
My parents in law and brother in law came to visit and stay for a month with my husband (27M) and i (28F) after i had my baby.
For context if it makes any difference, I'm German, husband and his family are Italian. 
The baby was 3 months old at the time and i breastfeed her. Usually I'd just nurse on the couch in the living room but because company was staying, I'd go to my bedroom. 
After i nursed her, she'd fall asleep and take a nap and I'd have some free time. Since family was visiting, i tried to plan her naps around our mealtime to spend time with family uninterrupted.
My mother in law has this thing that when food is on the table, you be there pronto.
Sometimes I'd be late coming to a meal because babies can be unpredictable and she wouldn't fall asleep right away or nursed longer than normal. To this my mother in law would barge into my room and annouce food was ready, all impatient. This startled the baby and made the process last much longer than it should have. The result is I had to eat much later than everyone else, alone, and the food was cold. It left me fuming. More work to do with the baby and I'm secluded. 
This happened several times. I asked my husband to talk to her and explain i can't always come on time.
He talked to her but she still did all this anyway. So i simply decided to stop being late to the dinners. 
The next time she barged in my room and announced food was ready, i came without hesitation. I came to the table exactly as i was. No shirt, half a bra, baby hanging on one tit. (nothing was seen as the baby's head covered up everything anyway but still) 
Ensue uproar. Goes something like:
MIL exclaims what the hell I'm doing at the table like this. I'm indecent, there are men at the table. I should be ashamed. I yell back what the hell does she keep calling me to the table for if I'm not yet ready. I have no reason to be in my room alone with my baby while everyone else is out having a great time together. 
Brother and FIL are trying not to get in on the argument. Husband ushers me back to my room and scolds me, taking his mother's side. He means he gets I'm frustrated but this action didn't help anything. But... 
After that MIL didn't bother again while i was busy with the baby. So what if i came to some meals a little after everyone had started eating. The roof didn't cave in!
Anyways everyone lived happily ever after. The end.

1af0zdl,AITA for not disclosing cakes are dairy free,"I’m a hobby baker not a professional. I make cakes/cupcakes/treats for family and friends of family. I’m also lactose intolerant.

I’ve been used to cooking and baking dairy free for years now and it’s just become second nature to me. Due to regular baking I often bulk buy supplies such as dairy free butter. In all my baking I use the dairy free butter and I’ve never really thought anything of it, so unless there’s a specific flavour that’s been requested, the cakes or cupcakes are essentially dairy free.

I’ve never hidden the fact I use dairy free butter but I’ve also never made it a big deal either. Everyone always compliments the cakes and I’ve never had someone say they notice the cakes/icing etc were dairy free.

Last week I made a chocolate cake for my cousins birthday. We had a party and during the party I had a piece of cake (dark chocolate and cocoa powder are naturally dairy free so with dairy free butter the entire cake was dairy free) another cousin noticed me eating and commented on the fact that I would end up with a bad tummy. When I explained it was dairy free, she absolutely kicked off claiming I was trying to force my beliefs down everyone’s throat and that I should be declaring the fact it’s dairy free. Also should note, she had already eaten some cake and said it was lovely 🤷‍♀️ she started getting everyone involved. Some knew I tend to do dairy free and didn’t have any issue, others didn’t know and were still ok with it, and some were annoyed about it and said if they had known they wouldn’t have had the cake. Again no one disliked the cake in any way. I then got told from now on I should make sure there’s dairy in all the cakes, cupcakes and treats which means if it’s for a family event I can’t eat them.

Now I’m at the point where I don’t want to make anyone else anymore cakes for people. There was no maliciousness on my part. I understand that years ago, dairy free was a massive deal and quite often the food wasn’t tasty but nowadays things have changed. It’s not actually that big a deal anymore.

So AITA? Should I have been telling people that most of the cakes were dairy free?

  
\*\*edited to add as it’s been mentioned a few times- I always ask about any other allergies. theres a few different allergies in my family and I always try to cater to everyone. if there’s someone I don’t know that has an allergy they’ve often asked what they can eat and I direct them. In this case the only allergens in the cake was egg & wheat which no one In my family were allergic to. the butter used has no main allergens.

1af13u3,"AITA for refusing to ""cover up"" in my own house?","I (f19) am fairly well-endowed. I have a size 40D chest that is pretty difficult to hide unless I layer.

This morning I walked out of my room in a 
tank top with no bra underneath. The tank top had one of those ""built-in"" shelf bras, but that is certainly not supportive enough for me, and my boobs don't defy gravity, of course. So, I had a lot of cleavage showing.

My mom (f50) was the first person I saw when I walked into the kitchen, and directly after saying hello to me, she added, ""you need to go put on a shirt, your dad is home and you have way too much showing."" I replied with ""I *have* a shirt on,"" and then changed the topic to food, since she was looking through the fridge.

We sat down to share a big sandwich, and at that moment my brother (m16) got home from school. He took a piece of the sandwich and started eating, hardly even looking in mine or my mother's direction. My mom repeated again, ""you *seriously* need to go cover up, you are way too obvious. Go put a shirt on.""

Again, I said, ""I have a shirt on."" She said, ""it's not covering you enough."" I said, ""yes it is, I'm sitting in the privacy of my own house."" She said, ""it's not *your* house, your male relatives are around."" I said, ""my male relatives shouldn't be looking at me in that way."" (Mind you, my father was nowhere to be seen and my brother was silent.)

She got up from the table in a huff, rambling angrily as she put things back in the kitchen. She said that I am disrespectful and insinuated that I think I know everything because I am a legal adult. She ended her monologue with, ""get a clue about the real world."" 

I didn't say anything to that, because I was confused. The real world? We are not talking about walking around in public, we are talking about sitting at home in comfortable clothes.

She was still standing in the kitchen when I went to put my plate away, and as I washed it, she said, ""you know, that's like if your brother was sitting in the living room with his testicles hanging out of his shorts, refusing to cover himself because it's 'his house.'"" I started to say that I am certainly not exposing my genitals, but I couldn't get more than two words out before she said, ""no. No. You want to be disrespectful, don't talk to me."" She headed downstairs and I went to my room.

The thing is, my chest size did not magically happen. I had to get these genes from *somewhere,* and that somewhere is my mom! Hers are even bigger than mine, and absolutely nobody makes a fuss when she sits at the dining table with no bra under her tank top. Because there's no sane reason to. 

My opinion: sexualizing your family's bodies by telling them to cover up, lest their father/brother/son state? That is weird. I should be able to be physically comfortable in my own house.

1af1tlx,WIBTA if I press charges on my MIL for selling my collection of vintage skeleton keys to buy a new phone?,"This is somewhat urgent. My MIL is insanely entitled. And my wife's enabling of her has made our marriage very hard at times. MIL has come to us for money many times because she keeps spending herself into a hole because she's a hoarder. Recently she came to us wanting me specifically to buy her a new smartphone. And she threw a massive fit when I refused.

I had quite a collection of vintage skeleton keys. And I mean good ones. Like ones to particular hotels, the large ornate Sargents, brass railroad keys, etc. My collection as a whole should have easily been worth two to three thousand dollars. I kept them in a locked display cabinet. But yesterday I came home to find my entire collection gone. The cabinet had been forced open. I checked the CCTV for the living room, and saw my MIL force open the cabinet with a small crowbar. I called MIL and demanded she return my entire collection. She nonchalantly told me she sold the entire collection at pawn already, and used the money for her new phone. Then said it was my fault, and she had to do it because I wouldn't give her the money.

My wife was seemingly on my side, until I said I was going to call police. Now she's begging me to just drop it. And even suggested I just start a new collection. A lot of those keys are irreplaceable, and I spent 10 years building that collection. MIL has been trouble in the past. But this is the first time I know of that she's stolen from us. I need help!

On Friday night we were having a family dinner and it honestly felt like every other sentence was a dig at me or a less than subtle brag by my siblings about something they have been given by my parents that I was denied.  They talked about how nice almost all of our weddings were, but made sure to mention it was ""ok"" that my wife and I had a small low-key wedding. And it was Ok, we loved it. But they brushed over the fact that my parents paid for all of my siblings weddings... but not mine. Because somehow they couldn't afford it... because they were saving up for Jade's wedding.

​They brought up how little student loans they have… because my parents helped them. All of them lived on campus at expensive 4 year schools. I lived at home and went first to a (very prestigious, very hard to get into) watchmaking school. I got paid to attend this school… so I paid rent at home. My parents paid for my tools. And I appreciate the help. I really do. But they paid 120-150k each for my siblings... they gave me 7k for tools. But to them it’s equal. When I went back to school on my own I didn’t ask for money and wasn’t offered it. When my brother went back to school they covered EVERYTHING without him even having to ask.

There were many other small moments (comments about cars and other lifestyle choices) but what made me snap was my brother and his wife mentioning their marriage being so great because they do things like spontaneous dates, like the one they had the prior Friday night. The Friday night where my parents called my wife and I last minute to cancel plans they had to eat dinner at our house because they had to watch Chuck's kids because of an ""emergency"". Turns out that ""emergency"" was a dinner for Chuck and my SIL at Texas Roadhouse. I had spent HOURS making my grandpa's ziti and meatballs with homemade marinara because its my mom's favorite. 

I wanted more than anything to scream at them but instead I got up and left without saying a word and my wife followed me. when my mom called me later to ask why I left I just explained exactly why. I explained the favoritism, the unfairness, and the fact that it doesn't feel like they care about me. She didn't say much and I wasn't really looking for an explanation or an apology in the moment, I just felt like it was self evident but if she really didn't see it I'd spell it out. Evidently at least parts of what I said have been shared with my siblings because now Chuck and Laurie are furious at me and saying I ruined dinner and my mom is upset that I am hurt. They say I'm immature for ""keeping score""

1af2d42,AITA for asking my sister to leave because she took a nap after moving into my new house?,"I(F 23) recently bought a house. My partner and I spent 2.5 months remodeling as much of it as we could before our lease was up and we had to move in. We were over there almost every day working on it. It was really draining and I feel completely burned out. My sister(20) and friends helped us on weekends.

Fast forward to the move in date, I was so mentally, physically and emotionally drained at this point. Move in day went as smooth as moving does, we had friends to help us. My sister was going to help us but she had been asked to sing for a funeral which understandably was important for her and was at the same time we planned to move and so she planned to show up for the last part of it and stay to help us unpack.

She did exactly that and showed up as we were clearing out the last 10 boxes from the uhaul. She went to change and realized she didn't bring socks for her tennis shoes. She asked me for some and I was a little annoyed because NO, I can't find you socks right now. I have no idea where anything is  and I've been moving heavy things for the past 4 hours. I'm also disabled (I broke my pelvis when I was 17 and have mobility issues and chronic pain) and this day was really hard. She refused to do anything unless she had socks, so my boyfriend found some of his and gave them to her. She did put them on and helped with the last few boxes.

We all took a moment to eat lunch. My sister ate with us and our frineds left. My sister still planned to stay and help me unpack. I had to return the uhaul first, and I had to be the driver since I was the verified driver. I asked my sister if she would come with me to return the uhaul and she stated that she NEEDED a nap. She then proceeded to climb over all of the furniture we just moved in. She found a spot on the taken apart sectional and asked me to get her a blanket. I asked her again if she was sure she wasn't coming with me and she said no, she really needed a nap. She showed up for 20 minutes. It felt so inconsiderate. This is reacurring behavior and I feel like this was the final straw. There's history that's hard to get into. She never seems to care for anyone but herself.

I had to fill the uhaul up with gas before I returned it and got stuck trying to turn out of the gas pump area. It was a 20ft uhaul and I accidentally hit the side of it into a pole. No one was there to help me manuever it and I was doing the best I could. I was reallly upset that my sister didn't come with me because she could have helped me and this wouldn't have happened. I will have to pay for the damages.

When I got back to my house, she was still ""sleeping"" for another hour even though I was playing music and unpacking dishes loudly. I asked her to leave when she woke up because I was so upset with her behavior. If she would have stayed I would have blown up and said regrettable things. She was livid that I asked her to leave and has blocked me and told me she no longer wants a relationship with me.",Huge_Wrangler8286,2683,0.8500000238418579,642,1706656067,2024-01-30 17:07:47,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1af2d42/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_leave_because_she/,1,2024
1afvwkh,AITA for Canceling My Stepdaughter's Birthday Party?,"*Throwaway*

I (35M) have a stepdaughter turning 16 this Saturday. Recently she told me that she doesn't want my biological kids (17M and 14M) at her birthday party. When she told me this I was confused. I asked her why and she simply stated, ""I just don't want them there."" I asked for a reason but then she got defensive and started yelling at me and told me that it's her party and she doesn't want her step-siblings there.

She NEVER yelled at me before or even talked back so this really hurt me surprised me. I told her that if she doesn't want her step-siblings there, then there won't be a party. She then started crying and told me that she didn't ""fucking care.""

I talked to my kids and asked how they felt about their step sister because I thought that maybe she wasn't telling me something. However, the told me that they have no problems with her and were confused on why I asked. I shared this with my wife, and she supported my decision, and said that her daughters behavior was disrespectful. We both tried talking to her, but she's locked in her room, ignoring us and just crying. I decided to let her stay home today since she refused on coming out.

My wife  was aggravated and tried talking to her sister who sided with our stepdaughter. She said that she has the right to choose who attends her party. My wife stood firm with our decision, but her sister is threatening to tell to the rest of the family and I'm honestly worried and confused. 

I don't want my kids to feel excluded, and the thought of telling them they can't come hurts. I'm worried about whether our decision was right. The way my SIL acted made me question if I was actually in the right or not?

AITA? My step-daughter still refuses to speak to us as and my wife is starting to get worried.",Stepdaughte-r,1318,0.8999999761581421,1109,1706743054,2024-01-31 17:17:34,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1afvwkh/aita_for_canceling_my_stepdaughters_birthday_party/,1,2024
1agnz27,AITA for not telling my husband to go to his sister's wedding even though I'm not invited?,"My husband (m26) and I (f25) have three kids, our eldest is 7, then we have a 4 year old and a ten month old baby. My husband's sister (f30) is the one getting married. 

Our relationship with her isn't so great, she is always making unnecessary comments. I know that she dislikes me a lot, she didn't like me from the first time my (then boyfriend) introduced us together. Then when I got pregnant I was still in school and my boyfriend had just started college. He dropped out and we needed a lot of support from our families to settle down back then. So my SIL thinks that I f*cked up her brother's/ family's life because I didn't get an abortion at the time. She has always been rather hostile, we mostly only see her at family gatherings, she doesn't visit or anything and honestly that's better. She has caused problems before because she says that my husband was the ""golden child"" and she was the ""scapegoat"", and then when I got pregnant their parents basically adopted me and spoiled me because I was with my husband. 

So, she sent invitations for her wedding. She sent my husband his invitation which had his name and our three kids' names, not mine. My hubby asked her about this and she said that I'm not a pleasant person to be around, so I'm not invited. He told her that is extremely disrespectful since I'm his wife, they argued a bit through text and my husband told her to not count on him or the kids because they're not going. 

She blamed it on my hubby being immature. My in-laws tried to mediate between them, she replied to them saying that she's not surprised they're taking our side. They argued and my in-laws said that since she's having this attitude, they're not going either to the wedding. Immediately after she started blaming me. She said that this is all my fault because I could've just accepted that I am not invited and ""allow"" my husband and children to exist without me for a couple hours. She also called me stupid and uneducated, also spoiled, and said I have ""princess syndrome"".

I told this to my husband and his parents, they told some other family members and now apparently a lot of them cancelled their assistance as well. She keeps blaming it all in me. Yes, I didn't tell my husband to go, I admit that, so I think that's why I'm possibly an asshole because I could've prevented such a big drama and I didn't. Also I think that she's just an asshole in general, but in this case she might be for expecting my husband to be okay with her leaving me behind.",Tiny_Violinist9932,1938,0.9399999976158142,338,1706827443,2024-02-01 16:44:03,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1agnz27/aita_for_not_telling_my_husband_to_go_to_his/,2,2024
1agotpu,AITA for saying “you should’ve thought about that before you procreated”?,"My ex and I have a 13 year old daughter, “Nicole”. Nicole has several medical conditions that require a lot of attention. She will need some sort of in home assistance for the rest of her life. While we have an aide to help a couple of days a week, it is still a challenge. The outcome of Nicole’s condition became clear when she was 2. At that point, my ex and I agreed we wouldn’t have more kids because it wouldn’t be fair to anyone. There’d be no way we could focus attention on two kids. Someone would lose out in this situation.

We divorced when Nicole was 5. We originally had 50/50 custody. 3 years later, my ex remarried. His new wife, Callie, is nice. My ex did say that she didn’t understand the severity of Nicole’s condition . I figured there was a learning curve. Eventually, Callie basically said she wanted to be hands off. Which I respected, though I wondered how it’d work considering Nicole lives with them half the time. 

Last year, my ex and Callie had a baby. I was a little surprised given my ex was always firm on not having more kids but figured it wasn’t any of my business. He did begin to complain that it was a lot of work juggling Nicole and the baby. I sympathized but really didn’t know what else to say.

Recently, the venting got worse. He said Callie yelled at him for taking Nicole to her physical therapy appointment instead of helping her with the baby. He brought up potentially having Nicole stay with me more. I wasn’t entirely shocked but it pissed me off. I said Nicole was his daughter. He can’t just abandon that responsibility. He asked what he was supposed to do about the baby. 

I said “maybe you should’ve thought of that before you procreated? I mean, really, we discussed this 10 years ago as to why it’d be hard to juggle two kids. Why did you think having another would be a good idea?” He got quiet and said Callie wanted a baby. I said that isn’t enough of a reason and maybe he should’ve thought harder before bringing more life into this world. 

The conversation ended with me saying I’d call my lawyer and we could arrange for him to have less custody as I’d rather my daughter be properly cared for than be viewed as a burden.

Callie called me that night very upset that I had made my ex cry and that I said her baby shouldn’t exist. I said that’s not what I said completely, more that they didn’t think it through. She called me a jerk.

1agpmqm,AITA for telling my SIL/best friend that she overshadowed my wedding?,"Burner account. I(29F) am married to ""Nate""(29M) and his sister his ""Denise""(29F) we are all childhood friends and I married Nate almost a year ago. Denise, at the time was 7 months pregnant with her first child, her husband is ""Wayne""(30M). Not too long after our reception started, Denise went into preterm labor. Her pregnancy up until that point was not high risk so this was completely out of nowhere and stunned all of us. She understandably had to leave with Wayne to the hospital and most of their side of the family left out of concern. She insisted we stay and have fun and lord knows Nate and I tried but knowing that she was in unexpected, high risk labor was at the forefront of our minds and we made the difficult decision to end the reception about  an hour and a half early and joined up at the hospital.

My nephew ""Ben"" was born that night and we were all excited but I'll admit Nate and I felt a bit miffed that our wedding day was kind of stolen by this event. We kept this to ourselves though, as this was obviously unplanned and it's cruel to put that on Denise and Wayne. But, from that point on nobody ever talked about our marriage, just baby Ben. The times I think a relative mentioned our wedding can be counted on one hand. I get it, new additions to the family are ultimately more important but my wedding day will never just be about my wedding, it'll be about Ben, and whenever he comes up  or I see him I feel bitter because I'm reminded of what happened at the wedding. Yes, I know I'm jealous of a baby. I feel like shit for it. Nate was like this too for a while but grew out of it, I'm still working on it.

Ben is turning 1 in 2 weeks and that's all everyone's talking about, not a peep about our anniversary. I already know I'll just be depressed and mopey the whole time so I asked if Nate could politely tell him I would not be there. He did and Denise was pretty upset and demanded to know why, he refused, so she confronted me via text. She told me that she's picked up on how I seem sad whenever Ben is mentioned and said I'm hurting her that I can't tell her why. I decided to be honest and tell her that I've been very depressed(not just for this issue, but it's contributing) and that I felt that my wedding was overshadowed by her unexpected labor. I did tell her I'm not mad at anyone because it was unplanned, I just need to not be reminded of it on my anniversary. She did not respond and just blocked me, but Wayne uninvited Nate and told him to keep him and I far away from his family. Nate's confused and I feel like shit. AITA?

1ahh5yk,"AITA for not ""just dropping it"" and putting a blanket veto on all TV show names for our son?","Me and my wife are having our first kid soon and know it is going to be a boy. It's been hard to come to an agreement on names—she is very firm on picking a name that we both agree on, but we pretty much have opposite taste. I have a very very basic and common first name, which I like, so I gravitate towards simple and classic names like James, William, and Daniel. She likes...not that.

She suggested the name Dean the other day and I was considering it, until I found out she picked it because it was the name of her teen TV crush. She dug in her heels and insisted that she just liked the name and wasn't gonna name her kid *after* the character, and watching an old episode of the show just reminded her of the name. I'm like...that is *exactly* what ""naming your kid after a TV character"" means. 

So I said how about this, I am gonna give you a preemptive blanket veto on TV show names. I don't want to hear suggestions for a little Zuko or Sherlock or anything like that, and literally any other name is on the table. Is that fair? And she said ""NO"" that is not fair and I'm being a dick and putting words in her mouth. My position is that if you're gonna try to pick a TV name for your own kid, at least own up to it and admit it's a TV name. I'm more annoyed at the transparent denial at this point than the fact that she suggested it in the first place.",RohanMars,2076,0.800000011920929,2313,1706915401,2024-02-02 17:10:01,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ahh5yk/aita_for_not_just_dropping_it_and_putting_a/,2,2024

1aj0blb,AITA for refusing to babysit for my aunt and uncle until I'm paid for the last time?,"Borrowing a friends account (Thanks btw)

I (17/F) have been voluteering at my previous elementary school. I'm not sure if its relevant, but my cousins ( Ella 6/F & Liam 8/M) go to this school as well. 

I'm known as the ""fun one"" at school (kids words, not mine). Because of this, a lot of the parents of the younger kids ask me to babysit. I love kids, so its not hard for me. The parents are usually out for a few hours, and I only ask for about $20 per day. I've had no problem with this since.

about a month ago, my Aunt and uncle went off on a vacation for a week, and asked me to babysit. I agreed of course. I stayed over each night, to their request. My cousins are not hard kids to deal with, they're actually very sweet and well behaved for their age. Because of this, and that they're family, I only charged $10/day. So, about $70 since they got home later in the night. 

I waited a day or two after they got before asking about the payment, and they outright refused. Saying that because they're family, I should do it for free. They also said that since I said they werent hard kids, I didn't have to do much.

After a little back and forth, I decided to cut my loses and didn't babysit for them again. Now, they're planning to go on a bit of a road trip together, and they asked me to babysit again. I said if they paid me for the last time I babysat then I'd be more than happy. They kept complaining and whining, saying I'm the only person they have (I'm not tho, they have multiple other people available).

 They're now complaining to my parents, trying to get them to make me babysit, but I'm still refusing until they pay me for the last time. My parents are asking me to just do it to keep the peace.

1aj2fa1,AITA For Arguing With My MIL Over Laundry,"This seems like such an insanely petty argument but it's causing some friction in my family.

My daughter (Brandi for the purpose of this post) is 13 years old and last year started doing her own laundry. I showed her how to do it a time or two and she has taken over from there.

Over Christmas break, my in-laws took my older kids on a ski vacation. Brandi said MIL offered to do her laundry but Brandi told her it was fine, she would do her own. Seems like a non-issue, right? You would think so!

When they came back from the trip MIL pulled me aside to talk to me. She said she noticed Brandi didn't turn her clothes the proper way before folding them, so everything was inside out when she folded it and put it away. I said, ""okay"" because...okay?

Apparently this was the most egregious thing to MIL. So much so, that she mentioned it every time I saw her. I told her that Brandi is doing her laundry, so the way she does it is her business. So long as it's clean and put away I don't care if it's turned inside out.

This was not good enough for MIL. She went to speak to Brandi about it.  Brandi's stance was: 1. why does it matter if she puts them ""outside in"" before folding them or wearing them? It makes no difference and 2. She likes picking a shirt to wear at random, not knowing what the design of it is, and building an outfit around it. She called it ""outlet roulette"".

Again, MIL thought this was unacceptable. I've told her to stop. My husband has told her repeatedly to stop and after he said if she didn't stop, she wasn't allowed over, she stopped mentioning it. Until today.

She brought it up again. It's not proper. It's lazy. It's a bad habit. Then she said, ""if you were a good mother, you would teach her to do her laundry properly"".

I snapped back, ""your son is 44 years old and I have been doing his laundry for 17 years. Before that, he paid to have it done for him. If we want to talk about parenting skills and teaching kids to do laundry, maybe we should start with YOU. Mind your own business.""

My husband cackled but my MIL was furious and stormed out. She also told everyone else in the family and while many if them are on my side, more than I would expect are not and have said I was unnecessarily cruel and unkind and now I'm not sure if I went too far.

(And for the record, yes, I do my husband's laundry because he hates doing it himself. But he cleans all the toilets, and we have two teens and two potty training toddlers so I'd argue I have the better end of the agreement tbh)",Defiant_Pay_7923,1295,0.9700000286102296,291,1707090752,2024-02-04 17:52:32,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1aj2fa1/aita_for_arguing_with_my_mil_over_laundry/,2,2024

1akmu7i,AITA for eating the food my FIL served me and “ruining” my boyfriend and I’s holiday.,"  
Background info: I (M 41) am a white American, and my boyfriend (M 38) is Moroccan and half black. His parents took a dislike to me the moment we met. We’ve been together for two years, and he lives in America. The incident in question took place a few days ago. This is only my second time meeting his parents. His mother has been relatively quiet, but it’s obvious she feels the same as his father, who is on an all out warpath.   
  
They think that I’m a typical, useless, American party boy and not good enough for their son, who is an all around goodie-two-shoes. They are wealthy government employees who think that they’re contributing a lot to the world. Unlike me. Now, it is important to note that I am also wealthy, self made, and high ranking in my career. So I am not attempting to get on any gravy train. My boyfriend and I are staying at their home in Morocco.   
  
The four of us sat down for dinner, cooked by their private chef. Everybody got a bowl of some moroccan food, that smelled really good. I noticed that mine looked paler than the others and didn’t have as much of a smell. I didn’t comment at first, but then his father outright said, as if he was doing me a favor, that he told the chef to put a portion for me aside before she added ANY of the seasoning, because he thought that “my palate wouldn’t handle the spice well”. 

I have no issues with spicy food. I could tell that my boyfriend was already uncomfortable, and he told his father that I could eat what they’re eating. I managed to keep my cool, despite being really pissed off and told him in no uncertain terms that I could handle spicy food. Next thing, he took my food and went back to the kitchen. When he returned, my food was a shade darker than everyone else’s.   
  
I realized after the first bite that it wasn’t just spicy. It was inedible. My boyfriend noticed my reaction and told his father off before telling me to stop eating it. But I didn’t. I ate the damn food. And I have never in my life eaten anything like it. There must have been an entire bottle of hell in it. The pain. But I persevered, much to my boyfriends protests. His father simply watched. I was sweating buckets, felt sick, almost had an asthma attack (Another reason that my boyfriend was angry with me, because I put myself at risk) but I ate the whole bowl. Then I left the table victorious, but dying a death.   
  
Fast forward, I’ve been in bed for three days, still feel messed up, may not survive. My boyfriend says I should have been the bigger person and that there were no winners, that eating the whole bowl was as childish as his father was for serving it, and harmed only me. He’s been taking care of me, but he’s also blaming me.   
  
I don’t think I was the asshole, even if the last three days of our vacation have gone down the drain.   
  
TLDR: My boyfriends father served me inedible food to be petty, so I ate it to be petty and derailed me and my boyfriends vacation plans. And I wouldn’t change a thing.

My 13M nephew and his mum decided to visit us yesterday and in teenage boy fashion he went snooping, he somehow managed to unlock the door with a pocket knife he had and was not pleased with what he saw.

My sister and parents are livid with what he saw and think it will scar him for life, while I believe he is at fault for snooping.
They won’t let up about it and think we shouldn’t have that sorta stuff so close to where people sit and hang out.

1aleaaj,AITA for embarrassing my sister in public by accusing her boyfriend of stealing my tip money?,"We live in different states and she just started dating this guy although he’s been a part of her friend group since college. This was also the first time I met her boyfriend.

This past weekend I was in a city near hers and called to see if she wanted to meet up. She had plans with her friends so she invited me to come along, which I did. We had a fun day with the group and eventually went to dinner. Nothing was out of the ordinary until the check came. Her boyfriend took the check, read aloud the amount, and split the bill and tip (which we rounded to $10 a person) amongst the table then he placed his credit card for the server to take away. Everyone handed him cash for their portion. I guess I gave off a look so my sister explained that he doesn’t like to go to the bank so whenever the group goes out, he pays with his card and the group gives him cash. I didn’t think anything further about it so I handed him my portion.

The next day I couldn’t find my prescription sunglasses in my hotel room or rental car and I knew I had it yesterday. I remembered the last time I took it off was when we got to the restaurant. On my way to lunch with my sister and some people from last night, I stopped by last night’s restaurant to ask if they found a pair of sunglasses and was greeted by the same server but this time she looked angry. 

The short of it was that I found out my sister’s boyfriend only tipped her $10 for our group of 12 people. I was taken aback because based on our split, she should have gotten $120 in tips. I asked to see the receipt and sure enough, it was $10. I apologized and gave her another $10. When I got to lunch, I immediately asked him to give me back $10. That started the questions from the group that descended into an argument until the restaurant asked us to leave. 

My sister is now mad at me for causing a scene and embarrassing her in front of her friends and the people in the restaurant.",InformalSignature436,2063,0.959999978542328,248,1707341513,2024-02-07 15:31:53,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1aleaaj/aita_for_embarrassing_my_sister_in_public_by/,2,2024
1alg5zg,AITA for asking my boyfriend to skip his afternoon nap.,"I'm 26F, hes 30M. We've been dating for 3 years but just moved in together 6 years ago. 

I have felt crazy busy since moving in together. I work outside of the house, commute for an hour a day, and I'm going to school part time to try and get a better job, so my schedule is already packed, but since moving in together it feels like my time spent doing chores has almost doubled. 

I talked with my boyfriend about this hoping that we could come up with a reasonable chore schedule, but hes adamant that hes doing as much as he has the capacity to do. 

Something else I've noticed since moving in together is that he takes a nap from 4pm-8pm daily. He otherwise sleeps through the night usually 1am-10am, but that afternoon nap is like clockwork.

Long story short, I told him that he is getting 14-15 hours of sleep every day, and that he can start making more time to help around the house by even shortening that nap. I dont even think that amount of sleep it healthy. But he insists its a necessary part of his day and that im crossing a boundary by suggested that he not nap.

1an0foy,AITA for assuming my friends were paying for my birthday meal?,"This happened a few days ago and I have been conflicted since.   
Before my birthday, five of my friends asked if I would like to get some food and drinks out for my birthday event. I said sure where would we go Mike said ""Anywhere you like"".  
I suggested a nearby Steakhouse that I have been to in the past.  


We all met each other there, Mike was quick to order himself a drink and started talking about appetizers. I said I don't normally eat them but I will try one.  
We ordered our mains and we all had ordered the steak and another round of drinks at which point Adam also ordered a bottle of champagne. I said you guys don't need to get me Champagne it's only my birthday nothing too special when Mike said ""Lighten up birthday boy have some fun"" I did think maybe I was being too uptight and since I was being treated it's not too big of a problem I may as well celebrate.  


Mike started arguing with the table next to us because they threw a french fry at him. I tried to explain to him that they weren't even eating french fries he had them earlier and must have dropped one. Then he stood up and started swearing at the table. there was a child at the table about 3 years old who looked absolutely shocked. I told Mike to sit down and he started pushing me saying ""That man threw something at me"" The waiter came over and said there had been complaints against us. 

Mike just silently drank his beer and Adam started arguing with the waiter saying the other table started it. The waiter said we needed to pay up and leave in the next few minutes before there was a problem. 

I said ""Thanks guys do you want me to help pay"" At which point they all looked at me and Adam said ""You're the birthday man right? you got money"" I said ""I thought you were inviting me because it's my birthday as a present"" Adam chuckled a bit and said, ""Weren't you the one that chose where we were going bud?"" 

Adam got up to leave and said ""Let's go boys"" I started to worry I thought they were pranking me or something and said ""You can't really go"" Then Adam started to walk away So I grabbed him a bit and he looked at my hand and said  ""Get your hand off me pal"" I just looked at him and said, ""Why are you acting like this man?"" They walked out and left me with the bill.

&#x200B;

 I tried to explain to the waiter about the situation. He said ""Someone's gotta pay and your table was causing a lot of trouble tonight"" I tried to apologise but he just looked at me like I was dirt. So I just paid it was most of my money.

 I spoke to my friends after and they just acted like nothing happened I said ""You guys need to pay me back"" and I got several replies along the lines of It's already over leave it. 

&#x200B;

So I haven't spoken to them in a few days I received a few messages asking me if ""I am still crying"" or if ""I grew up yet?"" I haven't replied and I want to know if I was wrong to assume that I wouldn't be paying. The whole situation had me feeling weird.",Throwawayguy980421,5818,0.9300000071525574,1874,1707517413,2024-02-09 16:23:33,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1an0foy/aita_for_assuming_my_friends_were_paying_for_my/,2,2024
1ans74b,"AITA for yelling and cursing at my mentally ill parents for ""trying to protect me""","( To give a little background I (29F) have been with my wife, Lesli (32F), for 6 and a half years now. She has a daughter from a previous relationship, named Gwen, who I have adopted. )

I have been no contact with my parents for years, but recently they got diagnosed with dementia, and my siblings agreed that someone should stop by at least two times a day. 

A few days ago I got guilt tripped by my brother, to ""pull my weight"" and check in on them that afternoon. While visiting they got all serious and said there was something important they wanted to discuss with me before I left. They sat me down and asked me to just hear them out and consider what they had to say. Not knowing what was coming I agreed.

They stated that they believed, that my wife, Lesli, was going to cheat on me, now that I am legally obligated to be take care of Gwen. They went on to explain that she has been isolating me from my real family to prevent me from hearing the truth. They urged me to just call a lawyer they know and they pulled out a business card and kept trying to force me to take.

I kept asking them to just stop, but they kept speaking over me, telling me they just want to help, so I kept getting louder and louder till I was shouting. By the point that I was yelling I wasn't thinking entirely reasonably, if I was I would have just left. Instead I yelled that I don't visit because they are terrible people who made my childhood miserable. Then I told them they are not family, and I don't care if they rot.

As you can imagine this did not go over well with my siblings. They believe they are all making sacrifices to care for them, so I should just deal with it like they do. They went on to explain that  it wasn't so bad since at least their intentions were to try to help.

I feel bad for my siblings, but I plainly refused to contribute and refused to acknowledge any wrong doing.

1anthf3,AITA for refusing to pay for a dinner party I was not a part of?,"Last semester me and one of my classmates did a project together (we are both architecture students). We did most of the work on our own but since we were nearing the deadline we asked a junior student to render a single sheet in Photoshop (which took about 15 min, cuz it was a really small section). However, 4 of our friends had multiple juniors working nearly 12 hrs for them, wrapping up most of the post-production work which is pretty standard practice at my college. All of us ended up submitting the work and now after 2 months those 4 friends decided to throw a dinner feast for all those who helped them out, they decided to pool in all the money and asked my project partner to chum in, which he did as his gf was one of the 4 people and he obviously wanted to have a dinner date with her. He asked me to join the dinner to which I declined because:

a) I felt ridiculous throwing a party for a bunch of unknown people who did not help me with the project. (mind you only one fellow helped us and there were about 14 folks at the dinner party) 

b) I am not close with any of these people, and they constantly make fun of me and talk very condescendingly to me.

I told him and he understood. They had the party while I stayed at home 

But the same day he called me (at 1:00 in the morning) asking me to pay him 1200 rupees (14.5 USD) because even if I did not attend the dinner I was still this project partner and I passed the semester because of him. So I tried explaining to him that we only had one person to help us and that we could have given our junior helper a pizza party instead of going out and having a fancy dinner with the 14 people group all of whom did significantly more work for our other friends who all are paying the same amount as us (they're pooling the money). 

I told him that our common friend group is using him to make a bigger money pool and I very clearly stated I did not wanna be a part of it and if he does it's on him. But goes off on me and tells me I'm a scrooge for refusing to treat people who help me. 

I understand that he is in a desperate position. I would have paid if it was like 500 Rs (6 USD). but 1200 Rs is too much for me. Again we aren't even good friends or something and have gotten into very public arguments before. Still, he continues to text me asking me for money.

1aokcnh,AITA for telling my bio moms family that I don't visit because I don't have a bed there,"I've lived with my dad my entire life. He married my mom when I was 2 and she's all but adopted me (15f). 

My bio mom lives about 5 miles away with her husband and their kids (12f and 8m). I don't live with her, never have, and probably never will. I visit her sometimes, like once a month, but we both know she's not my mom. I've called her by her first name since I was like 5. I don't have a room or a bed at her house and there's no pictures of me in there. 

My bio mom talked me into going to some family party with her and her family. I don't know anyone there so I was mostly just hanging out with her while I was there. She started talking about how I never see her and it took an act of god to get me to go to this party so I told her to show them my room. She tried to show them her daughter's room so I said ""no, that's Amanda's room, see the A by her bed?"" and she was out of rooms after that because it's only a 2 bedroom house. She pulled me aside and said to stop and that I was making her look bad so we went back and I told her siblings that I wasn't allowed to talk about not having a bed at her house anymore because it makes her look bad. 

Apparently that wasn't good enough either because she tried telling me to give her my phone. I reminded her that she's not my mom then called my mom and told her to pick me up. 

My mom picked me up and she's really mad at my bio mom for all of this but my dad says it sucks but I should've taken it since im probably never gonna see these people again. im not in trouble but they can't agree whether I was right or wrong so I wanted to know if I was the ass",biomombedroom,7571,0.9700000286102296,527,1707690237,2024-02-11 16:23:57,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1aokcnh/aita_for_telling_my_bio_moms_family_that_i_dont/,2,2024
1aolnna,AITA for deciding my baby’s name even though my husband hadn’t agreed on it?,"I, 32F, and my husband Chris, 33M, had our daughter about 2 months ago. We have similar tastes in names and we agreed upon Lara for a girl pretty early on. We found out a year ago that my sister Andrea, 35f, had been diagnosed with cancer. By the time I got pregnant she was already very sick. At 24 weeks pregnant, she passed away. We had not decided on a middle name at the time, but my husband wanted to give Lara his mother’s name, Jane, and he was set on it. After Andrea passed I wanted Lara’s middle name to be Andrea. He said he hated the name Andrea and it would make more sense to name her after her grandma than an aunt. This made me upset and I told him that his mother was alive and well, and I wanted to remember my sister. I brought up giving her two middle names and he didn’t want to do that either.

When she was born we still hadn’t agreed on one. Towards the end of the birthing process, the visuals were a bit too much for Chris and he passed out. So when the nurse asked what the name was, I said Lara Andrea. Once he was conscious again I told him that I put down Lara Andrea. He mumbled “fine”. I thought he was okay with Lara Andrea now, but now I realize he was trying to be nice because I just gave birth.

Last month he brought up changing the name to Lara Jane. I said no because we had already named her, and I brought up doing two middle names again. He got mad at me and we’ve been arguing about this practically every day. He keeps calling her Lara Jane. He STILL doesn’t want to do double middle name. I feel our family and friends are biased because they either knew Andrea or know Jane. I feel like maybe I should’ve done a double middle name or put down Jane, and I’m wondering if I should change it.

I feel like I might be in the wrong here for ignoring his opinion and taking advantage of the fact he was unconscious to choose the name I wanted. So AITA?

  
edit: Thank you for all the replies and suggestions. Most of them were either YTA or ESH, which I both understand. I apologized to Chris. The most liked name combo on r/namenerds was Andrea Jane.

We recently got our first home and are officially homeowners so a few weeks ago we decided to throw a big party with family and friends. We did have a bunch of alcohol drinks and mixed drinks, but I had them separated bc my SIL is 3 months pregnant. 

My SIL has had 4 miscarriages in the past. It’s heart wrenching, and I feel horrible for her. I’ve always been supportive.  She has a form of PCOS.  Anyways at the party I had told SIL that the non alcohol drinks were in the indoor fridge, and to feel free to make herself virgin drinks if she liked. On the table outside I had mixed drinks outside and in the outside cooler. Long short short  sister in law ended up getting trashed, a week later miscarried. She’s been blaming my husband and I since early January for this. Sending us hateful messages spamming my phone, saying one of us must’ve mixed up the drinks (which didn’t happen.) When it first occurred I told her I was so sorry, but it wasn’t our fault we had other guest who were drinking and I had made her aware of where the other drinks were.

Two days ago she tried pulling that stuff again when we ran into her while at my MIL, and again said it and followed me through the house arguing with me. I finally blew and said your the stupid one for A)not listening when I told you where the non alcoholic drinks are, B) for continuing to drink bc she had to of realized she was getting drunk, and C) bc your already prone to miscarriages due to your conditions this isn’t our fault.

She broke down in tears crying and wailing saying I wasn’t sensitive, I was a horrible person. My MIL asked us to leave. My husband and I feel bad for her miscarrying ofc, but she has been harassing us for weeks.

1aq7hxr,AITA for telling my sober friend it's not my job to have the exact non-alcoholic drink she wants at the parties I throw?,"I'm in college right now. My best friend Joshua (made up for anonymity purposes) is dating one of my other friends Ashley (also made up), and she barely ever drinks. Which, good for her, I respect people that are sober. 

I have parties at my place around once a month and like to make a batched alcoholic punch of some kind, but I get Coke or fruit punch or something non alcoholic as well, cause I don't want to pressure people to drink. 

At the last party I threw, despite having Coke Zero and Dr Pepper, Ashley was like ""Do you have sparkling water?"" I said ""No."" I don't really like sparkling water, so I'd never buy it for myself. She looked upset but she said regular water was fine. 

She sends me this long text message the next day, basically saying ""I really wish you would have sparkling water for me when you throw stuff and consider me. I don't like really sugary stuff like soda and don't want to drink, but it's boring having just water to drink. Just because I don't drink doesn't mean I don't deserve a fun drink too."" 

I basically told her ""It's not my job to buy something I don't ever drink with MY money just for YOU to have. I provide non-alcoholic options because I am considerate of you and the other people that don't drink and if you don't want to drink them then go to your store and buy some yourself. I advertise it as BYOB, so that can apply to you. Or at least have Joshua buy it for you, I'm not your servant.""

Joshua's not mad at me but he told me I should talk to Ashley and apologize. I just don't get why I should apologize. That would imply I did something wrong. Sparkling water doesn't cost a lot so it's not a money thing, but it's the principle of it. Wanting me to buy something *else* for each party when I provide 1-2 NA options, *and* you're capable of buying it and bringing it yourself, and you don't even offer to buy me something or do something for me in return. Plus why am I being held to a higher standard than her literal boyfriend?

Sometimes it just feels like all I do is serve to give people stuff, and it's never a consideration about me.

HOWEVER… my boyfriend feels because we are a couple and plan on getting engaged soon.. that I should split my winnings with him so he doesn’t take such a big hit, and really since it’s extra money it shouldn’t mean that much to me. Some friends also agreed with this. I do not feel I should give him a single cent and it’s his fault for being irresponsible. He called me selfish and brought up all the things he has done for me/paid for (dinners, vacations, etc) and said he’s going to be tight on money the rest of the month now.

1ar1ay7,AITA for not carrying on another family's tradition?,"In our house, we have two birthdays coming up. My wife's son Marcel (turning 16) and her daughter Marceline (turning 13). Asking them what they want for their birthday, they both said that just the ""normal gift"" was great. Seeing that I was confused, my wife helpfully reminded me of the ""traditional luggage gift"", and then I realized. 

There was a family tradition of giving kids a luggage set for their 16th birthday, yes, but that was my ex-wife's family, not mine. I was never even involved. It was always a thing for them. A few decades ago, one of my ex's sisters got a job at a high-end luggage company, and took over for the next gen of the family (my daughter and her cousins) because she could get it for really cheap with her discount. My daughter is the youngest of the kids on that side, and around the time she was turning 13, between the aunt knowing she would be retiring soon and some personal drama, they decided to give my daughter her set for her 13th birthday so she wouldn't be left out. 

I've always thought that tradition was stupid and a stupid amount of money to spend. Even $1,000 is way too much to spend on luggage for anyone, especially a kid. I wouldn't spend that much on myself. I tried to tell them all of this. My wife thinks that by letting my daughter participate (by accepting the gift), I've made it my family tradition as well, and now I'm just singling her kids out. I'm not. 

Not caring about her accepting a gift from her own aunts doesn't mean I don't still think it's stupid. There's a LOT of difference between ""you can't have this because it's not worth buying"" and ""you can't have this because I think it's inappropriate or dangerous"". 

Also, it would be even more expensive for us to buy it for them than even the aunt spent on my daughter. My daughter's set cost me $0, and her aunt $1,000 as she had a discount. Buying the other kids' sets would cost me $2,000 each, so $4,000. 

Now everyone is upset at me because I'm apparently making it clear that I don't care about Marcel and Marceline as much as my daughter because I'm breaking tradition and telling them they don't ""deserve anything"" that my daughter had.

1arszon,AITA for saying my stepmom can't take back how she treated me?,"I (24F) have always had a rocky relationship with my stepmom ""Cindy"" (51F). She came into my life when I was 13, and pretty much as soon as she and my dad were married, she became very pushy about taking up a parental role. She came to all my events and stuff, which I tried to appreciate, but she was also very ""it's my house too and I get to make rules"" after moving in with dad. She was the ""bad cop"" I guess; she was the one who thought I didn't have enough chores, that my grades weren't good enough, that I needed screen time limits, etc, and that lead to a lot of arguments.   
   
I hit the last straw at 17. The lawn needed cutting before Sunday; my dad said he'd do it Saturday afternoon, so I made plans to go hang out with friends for the day. While I was out, Cindy messaged me saying I shouldn't have let dad do the lawn because he'd had a tiring week, and that I would be doing it; her usual MO basically. I said no and stayed out with my friends. when I got home, she was furious and tried to ground me and it turned into this big stupid argument where I pulled the you're not my mom card. Dad ended up stepping in; I wasn't grounded, but also asked me to try and get along with her.   
   
It didn't matter, because she decided she was done. She just kinda stopped acknowledging me; we basically became roommates who hated each other. I wasn't even allowed to eat food she bought (not special stuff; like, when the bread ran out and she was the one to replace it). It was all just really tense, and I ended up spending a lot more time at my mom's apartment until I went to college.    
   
I've never formally blocked her or gone NC but we just haven't spoken since; she never came anytime I met up with Dad etc. Until me and my fiance announced our engagement. The wedding is over a year away, but Cindy sent me a long text, congratulating me and asking for all the details so she could help plan. She was asking about coming to dress fittings and if we wanted an engagement party and if she could make a speech at the wedding, basically asking about all the mother-of-the-bride stuff and pretending the last 11 years didn't happen. I didn't reply, until Dad reached out asking why I hadn't.   
   
I was honest with him; I'm weirded out by this. I'm happy for Cindy to come as his plus one, but she's not getting any role at the wedding (we're actually not even doing a head table, just because I don't want to share a table with her or separate her from Dad) because she's not my mom and the last time I saw her she was insistent about that. It's turned into a whole thing; he says she's really hurt and that he's rethinking coming to the wedding(?!) because she doesn't want to go, I say she can't take back what happened, and at the very least she should have apologised before reaching out like this.   
    
Mom and my partner are supportive of me, but I've had messages from several people on dad's side saying I'm an AH for 'punishing' Cindy and it's getting to me, so, AITA?",Character_Address53,4858,0.9700000286102296,534,1708037979,2024-02-15 16:59:39,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1arszon/aita_for_saying_my_stepmom_cant_take_back_how_she/,2,2024
1asmgxn,AITA for refusing to pay for private school for my step daughter,"A bit of backstory regarding this. I (36m) have been with my wife (37f) for 8 years. Of the two children there is my stepdaughter (13) and our daughter (6). We have been discussing sending our daughter to private school (PS) for the last few weeks and it has now boiled over into a full blown argument. She believes that if we send our daughter to PS that I should send my stepdaughter to PS as well as it would be “neglecting” her otherwise. My wife has majority custody of my stepdaughter and does not recieve child support for her as her ex husband made very poor life choices which I understand. My wife also has not worked for the entirety of our relationship. I have covered all of my stepdaughters expenses from day 1. After seeing how poorly the public school system has done for my stepdaughter I brought up and have been insistent on sending our daughter to private school. In my mind I want to give our daughter the best possible chance in terms of education which from what I’ve seen does not bode well in public school. Although I love and treat my stepdaughter as my own I do not feel as though I should be responsible for her education as I have never been given a say in regards to it from the beginning. I do have the financial means to send both however, it will be pushing the limits of what I can feasibly do in terms of vacations, birthdays, holidays etc. for our family. My wife disagrees and says that if I can do it for our daughter then I must do it for my stepdaughter regardless of if we have to give up vacations and cut back.

1ateunj,AITA - I refuse to move my wedding date,"Sorry guys, this is a bit of a long one. 
I (34f) got engaged to my fiance (37m) September 2022. My sister (27f) was getting married in summer 2023. When I got engaged, I had my wedding date already picked for early summer 2024 and immediately told my family the date. My sister is a photographer and so I warned her with plenty of notice to not book for that date. I tried talking to her about my wedding planning but she asked me not to talk to her about it because she just wanted to focus on hers only. Fine, no big deal but doesn’t mean I’m not going to continue to plan mine. This past October (2023) she asked me to remind her of the date. When I told her, she said that she booked a wedding back in January for that date and asked me to move it. I have said no because this date was properly planned out and picked for me and my fiance. I’m now being told it’s my fault and clearly she’s not that important to me because I’m refusing to move my wedding date. I see it the other way around. Why wouldn’t she cancel her client in order to prioritize me. I’m the oldest child of 4. I never ask for anything, this is the 1 thing I am holding fast on. I am heart broken that she won’t be there, but also extremely hurt that she is putting all the blame on me rather than accepting she also has control over her decisions. Am I wrong? AITA?

Update: 
Thank you everyone for your support. I am not okay in all this and never stand strong on anything and 9/10 usually cave in to give family what they want vs my own needs. But, that’s boundaries and that’s what I’m learning for myself. To answer some questions. When I first got engaged she told me she wanted to photograph my wedding. Then we talked about it and decided it wasn’t the best idea because she wouldn’t be able to be present at the wedding and would just be behind a camera the whole time. 
I’m now being told that my mom and other sister agree with her and that I didn’t tell her until this past October, yet I have a family group text proving otherwise.  
I’m staying strong. I’m not moving my date. But like I said, I’m just heartbroken that this is how it is turning out.

1atfyqh,"AITA for refusing to give a girl a ride because she had a ""therapy dog""?","I (M18) have a pretty decent relationship with this girl, Mira (F18), who lives in my residence. She's next door to my roommate and me, and we have many classes together. Mira and I also hang out in overlapping social groups and are part of some study groups together, so we know each other decently well.

While we get along most of the time, Mira can be a bit whiny and annoying. She complains about everything and seems to love to argue about every little thing with me. Its bizarre because some of my friends noticed that she seems to have some strange fixation with arguing with me.

After the December break, Mira came back to school with a small retriever puppy named Max, which she claimed as her therapy dog. Mira takes Max everywhere with her, and it's pretty clear to everyone that this dog ain’t trained at all. For the past month and a half, Max has done several annoying things which Mira just let happen.

For example, the first week she brought him, he ran in front of my dorm room and took a shit on my welcome mat. Another time, Mira let Max shake himself all over me in the elevator. He had come inside from playing in the snow, so he was filthy. I know it’s petty, but I’m still pissed about that since I had just brought those clothes out of the laundry that morning. Most recently, he ripped a bag of takeout I had (again in the elevator). Mira did reimburse me for that, but it was still annoying since I had to go back out and get food again. Max also starts yelping and barking randomly some days at 3 am, which is inconvenient. Mira says its because he has nightmares apparently.

Yesterday, Mira asked me if I could drop her off on my way home. The city her family lives in is on the way to my town, and she offered to split the gas money with me. She said this was because Max gets anxious on the bus since there are so many people.

I refused. I told Mira (as politely as I could) I couldn’t risk Max randomly taking a shit in my car. Mira got defensive about this and said he wouldn’t, and that she’d warn me to pull over if she thought he would. We argued; she said I was being heartless and didn’t care about Max and cared more about my car. I made a point not to deny that (even though she seemed to wait for me to) and this pissed her off even more.

I ended up driving home on my own.

In the past hour or so, I’ve been getting some text messages from some of my friends saying that Mira is accusing me of abandoning her and Max after I promised to take them. Some people are saying I’ve been an asshole, though I fail to see how.

1au8vl0,AITA for hiding food from my little sister?,"I (15F) am very dedicated to running, and have achieved a lot of success this year. I run cross country and track, and while the seasons aren’t going on I am constantly conditioning. I run for over an hour every day, and because of my dedication (and some lucky genetics) I’ve been selected for my schools varsity team as a freshman. I just broke 24 mins on a 5k. Since I’ve been exercising so much, my appetite has increased a lot as well. My younger sister “Beth” (12F) has noticed and decided that it’s her job to count my calories. She comments on every meal or snack I eat, and it has been really bugging me. This came to a climax recently, I got home from track practice, made dinner for my family (1st time making lasagna!). As soon as she sat down, the first thing Beth did was stare at my plate and say “that’s a big portion for a big girl!!!” (I’m 5’6” and weigh less than 100 pounds). My parents lightly scolded her, but I was still pissed since I made dinner and she was mocking me. It was a whole tray of lasagna, there was plenty for everybody. I brushed it off, but it bothered me. Later that night, I was studying and needed a snack. I went into the kitchen and cut up some strawberries. Beth jumped around the corner and yelled “GOTCHA FATTY!” Obviously her insults are sub par, but I was really upset. For context, we have plenty of food in the house. My parents don’t starve us or anything, which is why I don’t get why she’s acting this way. She then had the audacity to report me eating strawberries to my mom. Obviously my mom didn’t care, but didn’t care to discipline her either. So after she went to bed, I took a portion of food in the pantry and hid it in my room for me to eat. I wanted to be able to have snacks without someone judging my eating habits. My mom found the food in my room the next day, and is mad at me. I’m not allowed to keep food in my room. I understand that, and it is her house, and I told her why I was hiding food in my room. She told me I needed to be quieter while snacking to avoid conflict, or “eat less”. I felt awful, because she was implying I eat too much. I’m not at a point right now that I can eat just 3 meals a day. I’m running a minimum of 25 miles of week, and something’s gotta give. I’m afraid it’s gonna be my body. My mom took my phone, but I don’t care anymore. I plan to do the exact same thing again, but hide the food better this time.

1av0yq3,AITA for throwing my MIL out of our house because she made my wife cry?,"My wife (34F - Chloe) and I (36F) live in a different city than her original family. Chloe has always had a strained relarionship with her mother and she clearly likes our current arrangement. (The issues they have are numerous and for several years even included her sexual orientation and choice to marry a woman.)

My MIL (Ruth - 60F) came to stay with us and see her grandchildren (We have two kids, 7 and 5 year old boys) for about two weeks. For the first couple of days, everything was smooth. She had her own space and the she spent some time with kids.

Later on, I noticed Chloe was in a bad mood when I came home from work. I asked her about it but she brushed it off as tiredness. I didn't push it but I did feel a tension between Ruth and Chloe (they have a long history of problems).

Yesterday, I came home to a crying Chloe, and Ruth was nowhere to be seen. My heart literally broke and shattered into pieces. Chloe said her mother had told her awful things. I'm usually a very calm and controlled person, but that sight just did something awful to my heart.

So I just went online, booked a ticket to her hometown (the plane would take off 10 hrs later), knocked on my MIL's door and told her that she had overstayed her welcome and was leaving now. We had a huge argument. She used that oportunity to throw in a few insults in Chloe's direction because she didn't even come downstairs despite all the shouting. She later said she was relieved her mother left early because she had no idea how to go through the remaining days with her.

I arranged a car and told Ruth to immediately get going. She finally left. However, Chloe's phone has been blowing up with messages from her siblings, aunt and uncle saying we were extremely rude to Ruth, and most of them blaming her for marrying and arrogant AH like me.

Her father called and said how we were horrible to Ruth, that she just wanted to see her grandchildren and we had ruined the family. Was I the AH in this situation?

The guest list also included my daughter (Sarah - 24) and her wife (Elizabeth - 28F). Elizabeth works in a demanding, stressful but well compensated corporate position. She does have a tendency of overworking herself.

Unsurprisingly, she was late to the dinner. Sarah said Beth had cleared her schedule for the day but there was a last minute issue and she had to leave for work. Elizabeth made it while everyone else was starting dessert. She apologized, gave us a fancy bottle of wine as a gift and sat down.

We were all done and ready to go but Elizabeth hadn't fully eaten yet. It was getting late so as people started leaving, my husband and I also decided to leave as it was getting late. We didn't wait for Elizabeth to finish her dinner.

1av2qx9,AITA For not caring that my daughter is going through a difficult time with a friend and returning her birthday gift after the way she treated her cousin?,"What Happened: My daughter Brooke’s birthday was on Friday, so we had a celebration at home. Everything was going well until it was time for singing. Brooke blew out the candles and her cousin Aria blew on the cake too.

My SIL and BIL said oops and apologized. Aria obviously didn’t understand. It was just an accident. But then Brooke turned it into a scene. She snapped at Aria, raising her voice and calling Aria a “F\*\*\*ing brat.”

I immediately got firm and told Brooke to apologize. Brooke tried to argue that Aria ruined her birthday candles. I told Brooke that I don’t care who you are or what day it is. It is **never** okay to treat a 3-year-old that way as a 20-year-old adult. Brooke refused to apologize and stormed off.

After everyone had left, I informed Brooke that because she refused to apologize for the way she acted towards her cousin, I was returning her purse which was the main gift I had bought her. She also got a Stanley Cup but I let her to keep it since it’s something practical for school.

Brooke tried arguing that she’s too old for me to be confiscating her things and returning the purse was going too far. But I just told Brooke that I bought the purse with my own money and was free to do what I pleased with it. And if she wanted to act like a child then she’s going to get treated like one.

Why I’m Writing: My wife Kimberly said she is not going to re-buy the purse for Brooke and she agreed Brooke was out-of-line for how she treated Aria during the birthday celebration. But Kim said that I should have more understanding for Brooke because of what’s going on with Jessy.

Jessy has been Brooke’s best friend since they were in 4th grade. The problem is that Jessy recently got engaged and her fiance is not a good guy. Brooke and Jessy’s family staged an intervention to talk to Jessy, but Jessy is insistent on the marriage and has been talking to Brooke less and less.

Of course, I understand that it is a heartbreaking situation and am sorry Brooke has to experience that with her friend. But what is happening with Jessy has nothing to do with the way Brooke treated Aria.

If Brooke had snapped at Aria but immediately apologized after, then I could see how returning her purse could be seen as unfair. But I think Kimberly is being too lenient with our daughter, and Brooke needs to understand that going through a difficult situation is not an excuse to behave poorly towards others. AITA?

Edited to answer a common question: My SIL was holding Aria and keeping an eye on her during the birthday celebration. My BIL was explaining to Aria why she can't blow on the candles on someone else's birthday.

1avwl7y,AITAH for not getting a nose piercing when my husband really wants me to?,"My husband and I have very similar taste in all aspects but one - body modification. He’s a tattoo toting, piercing loving guy. I like to appreciate the art on others. I don’t personally have a problem with body modification - I just don’t want to modify mine. 

I have a friend who is beautiful beyond reason, and she really pulls off piercings so well. She’s made me consider getting (gasp) second lobe piercings. 

I asked my husband what he thought about me getting second love piercings, and somehow the conversation turned to getting a tattoo. I told him flat out “No.” We’d been through this ten years ago when we were dating. He can get as many tattoos as he wants, but I don’t want any.

So then he asks, “What about a nose piercing?” He said it in a cheeky kind of way, so I rolled my eyes and said, “I’ll think about it.” And I did. For days. I didn’t mention it to my husband because I knew he wasn’t really being cheeky - he was being half serious. But I did consider the nose piercing. Honestly, I don’t want a piercing on my face. 

Well, today my husband sent me a picture of ear piercings and asked me which one I wanted. Then he says, “And a nose piercing?” I decided that I needed to come clean to him. I told him that I don’t want a piercing on my face. He then said that I’ve broken his heart and that I never do anything he likes. 

That was five hours ago. Now, he won’t return my calls or texts (we’re long distance for a few months while I’m working abroad). He responded to my fourth message by saying he’s busy, but I have my doubts.

1awpnrj,"AITA for uninviting my parents to my wedding after they said they would be leaving early to throw a separate ""celebration"" at their house?","First post here, sorry for any grammatical errors.

Me and my girlfriend just got engaged after almost 9 years of dating and are planning on having our wedding spring of next year. With this we have begun planning the wedding and one of the topics that came up was if we want kids at our wedding. We are both the oldest kids/cousins in our family and with this have had multiple little kids at every major event in our lives. We decided that we do not want young kids (under 10)  to attend the reception as we want to have a more adult style of reception. 

When mentioning this to my mother she was not happy with the decision we made as some people will have to leave early because of the no kids rule. There are 3 families that are invited that have kids under 10 with a total of 7 kids under 10 years old. Me and my fiancé were expecting at least one of the parents if not both from each family to leave early to take care of their kids and were completely ok with this as they have other responsibilities to tend to. 

Now my mother is saying that her and my step dad will be leaving early so that they can throw a separate celebration at their house so that the people that are forced to leave since they have kids have somewhere to go and can still have a good time. With this she is telling most of the guest from her side of the family  (about 50 of the 125 invited) that they should come to her party instead of the reception. 

After hearing this from her we got into a heated argument, with her saying she is doing what she feels is right and doesn't need my permission to throw a celebration. it ended with me saying ""You are choosing to throw a ""celebration"" at the same time as our reception against our wishes, which you don't need our permission for, you are right about that. but if you are going to leave early because you feel it is the ""right thing todo"" you can just not worry about coming to the wedding in the first place. Because i certainly feel the right thing todo would be to support your kids wishes on his wedding day instead of leaving early to go party somewhere else."" 

This is very difficult for me to accept as I have always imagined my parents being there on my wedding day but at the same time we do not want her there if she is just going to leave early to go party somewhere else and try to take half of our guests with her.

My wife has been having intense cravings and I am more than happy to bring her favourite food from work. Most of the times, I also cook for her when she wants something really specific.

My wife has her own cupboard and a section in the fridge that has JUST her snacks - I don’t take her stuff without asking her. Last night, I had coconut yogurt and some rolled oats with fruit for a quick dinner - and this yogurt was kept in the shared space. I ate the last pack not knowing my wife has been having cravings for it, so it was unusual what happened today. 

I work a physically demanding job and today was a pretty exhausting day. I was looking forward to just relaxing at home and watching a movie. An hour into relaxing at home my wife came into the kitchen area looking for coconut yogurt, I told her I ate the last pack and she got a little upset because she saw this choco-based recipe on tiktok and coconut yogurt was a key ingredient in this meal. She said that since I ate the last pack, I should go outside right now and get it for her. Now, the nearest grocery store is like 30 minutes away and I really didn’t want to go outside. 

I told her as much and said had she asked me to bring it while coming home from work I would’ve gone to buy it for her. She started pestering me and putting pressure on me and I got irritated with her. She said that she’s pregnant and has intense cravings and as a good partner should make sure she’s feeling happy and comfortable. And that food is the only thing that brings her joy. Said that I can’t understand what she’s going through. 

I told her that she’s being really unfair and making me out to be a bad husband and that she needs to manage her expectations. I said that this is just a craving, it’ll pass in some time. I’ll get it tomorrow for her but just not now.

I’ve tried showing him how to change her diaper but it grosses him out. He says he can just have his mom do it because he still lives with her. I told him that as much as I love and respect his mom, it is not her responsibility and she is not going to be the one with custody. I’d trust her with both mine and my child’s life, but he is the father and he needs to know how to change her diaper. 

Another issue is he works a lot and a lot of the time, he goes away on business trips. I asked him how that would work if he goes away on one of his custody weeks, and again, he said he’d have his mom take care of her. It’s important to note that his mom is a hard working woman and works about 60-80 hours a week. 

I think the biggest thing that worries me is that he lives two hours away and I can’t imagine the anxiety it would bring to have my infant that far away from me. 

He’s been calling me selfish, saying that I’m keeping his child from him, which I understand, but that’s not true. I have a spare room in my house that I told him he can stay in whenever he wants, so he can stay for the night or literally however long he’d like, or I can come to his place (his mom has a spare room and said that I can come stay if I’d like). This arrangement would work very well because our daughter is exclusively breastfed (we’ve tried breastmilk in a bottle but she won’t latch). 

Also, he has not bought a single thing for her (despite having more than enough money). All the baby stuff at his house was bought by his mom. I am so grateful for her love and support, but again, he is the father and he has not shown any sort of responsibility. 

He’s pissed at me for “implying he’s not a good dad” but all I’ve been saying is I would like to be sure that the person taking care of her knows what they’re doing. I’ve been trying to show him how but he gets really defensive and doesn’t want to learn. I told him we can just go to court to figure it out (neither of us want a nasty court battle but it we can do it amicably) but he doesn’t want to so they can’t “order him to pay child support,” which pisses me off because regardless of whether or not you’re ordered to pay child support, you should want to do everything possible to support your child. Anyway, AITA for not “letting him” take care of his baby?",Godimsodamntired,1496,0.9200000166893004,1096,1708640452,2024-02-22 16:20:52,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1axjlkz/aita_for_telling_the_father_of_my_child_that_i/,2,2024
1ayf6xz,AITA for not helping my wife around the house?,"I (M36) and my wife (F38) have been married for 8 years and we have two kids (M7) and (F5). She is a stay at home mom, in charge of all the housework and childrearing while I work and cover us financially. Before you start attacking me, hear me out. We ran into a bit of bad luck with debt a few years ago and as a result, on average I work 50-60 hour weeks to help get us out of it. I am a carpenter so the days are long and sometimes I drive quite a bit to get to the work sites. By the time I get home, I am exhausted and pretty much eat then collapse into bed.

On saturdays I take my son and daughter out to his soccer games then back home for lunch, while my wife goes to bookclub, lunch with her friends then usually some sort of hike or yoga class. She is back by mid-afternoon at which point she takes back over the kids and I make dinner, maybe do a bit of laundry and clean the floors. On sundays it is reversed. I go out with my mates, by mid afternoon, I return, we have our baby sitter come around and we spend the night together. 

Recently my wife has come to me saying that I need to start doing more around the house. That I need to do more cleaning, organising, looking after the kids, grocery shopping, cooking. I know that she does a lot and I am in no way saying she doesn’t deserve a break, but I am working really hard too. Especially at the moment. I feel like I do the best I can with how much work I’m doing. I know there is a lot in social media right now about men not doing enough at home, but I never thought I was one of those guys. 

I explained this to her and she said I was being ridiculous. That I spend all day having fun at work with my workmates, while she deals with the children and all of the house chores. Then I get home and just eat and go to bed. This isn’t the plan for forever, but I thought it was going alright for now.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: my son is in school full time and my daughter is a daycare 2 days a week, starting school this year

EDIT: just adding in my comment since lots of people are asking. I look everything to do with my my sons sports stuff aside from driving him to Wednesday practice since I’m at work, same with my daughters swimming lessons. On those Saturday’s I make lists of groceries I think need to be picked up (though admittedly she decides what she wants to cook so has the final say), I go round and empty the laundry baskets/pick up stuff and wash/dry/fold them. I make the Saturday dinner (which is my job to plan and put stuff on the list for). I take care of all the bills, car payments, insurance dates. 

I do ask my wife before I go to bed if she needs anything else done before I crash, which yes I get the mental load thing but I figured if she needed extra help she’d ask, usually she says no. I guess in the mornings I could start making my sons school lunch while I make mine and also my daughters when she starts this year. 

When she expressed her need for help it was nothing specific and when we had this discussion she did not give me any specific examples and even if she did I leave at 5am and I’m not usually back til 730. I get home and shower, eat and put laundry into the machine, unpack my work gear, I play/read/clean up our kids and I’m in bed by 830.

1az7lll,AITA for telling my mom that I won’t postpone my wedding if she pays for my nose job (that I blame her for),"My fiancé (34M) and I (31F) got engaged in Nov 2023. We were planning a Dec 2024 wedding, but we’ve learned that I need a nose job for medical & aesthetic reasons, so we’ve postponed the wedding until after due to finances. My mom (65F) is mad about the whole thing & how it will be perceived by relatives.

*BACKSTORY*

When I was 9, I fell off my bike & broke my nose.


Sadly, my mom didn’t believe that it was broken. She said I was “over-exaggerating” the pain. She refused to take me to the doctor. It hurt so much, I cried daily for weeks.


*Note: she was a SAHM & we live in Canada, so taking me to a doctor wouldn’t have cost money or time off work.*


Since then, I’ve had issues with breathing and awful sinus pain- occasionally to the point of vomiting. Flying is torture. Random weather changes are torture. I spend 16-23 days a year in bed immobilized by pain/pressure in my left sinuses. 


Also, my nose never looked the same after. In middle school, kids said l look like Gollum and I’m still a little self conscious about it. 


In 2021, I decided that I can’t live like this anymore and started working with my doctor to figure out the root cause of my sinus issues.

The Canadian healthcare system moves slowly. 

A couple weeks ago, I got MRI results back and they established that:
(1) My nose was broken in childhood
(2) It didn’t heal properly because it had no medical intervention 
(3) I need surgery for my nose/sinuses to work, so I can live/breathe like a normal person.


Since they’re doing surgery on my nose anyway, I decided I want my nose’s aesthetic fixed at the same time. They will make my nose look like it would’ve naturally.


Canadian healthcare will pay for the “medical” part of surgery. It won’t pay for the cosmetic part. Nose jobs are expensive. 


We decided to postpone the wedding so we can pay for my nj ASAP instead. I can’t wait to breathe properly, and to have a “normal” nose. 


Last week, I told my mom about the postponement and she flipped. She says relatives are planning their whole year around my wedding, and this is a really unfair to do this to them over “vanity”. 


I told her that I can’t afford a nj and a wedding in the same year. & that it was unfair to me that she refused to take me to a doctor back in the day. & that if she really wants the wedding this year, she could pay for my nj so I don’t have to. 

We haven’t spoken since.

Tbh, since it was confirmed by a doctor that I *did* break my nose as a kid, I’ve had simmering anger/hurt towards my mom. I’ve lived with awful pain for decades, and now need surgery for something that could’ve been avoided if she had just believed me & been a parent… but maybe telling her to pay for the nj was unfair/too petty. AITA?

**tl;dr - broke my nose in childhood. Mom refused to take me to doctor. improper healing caused pain & suffering into adulthood. now I’m paying for corrective cosmetic surgery instead of a wedding and Mom’s mad about it. maybe I’m too vain**",wynawtt,4092,0.9700000286102296,344,1708814238,2024-02-24 16:37:18,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1az7lll/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_i_wont_postpone_my/,2,2024
1az7ufr,AITA for telling my wife it’s weird that she and her mother share location 100% of the time on their phones?,"This just came up casually in conversation with my(37f) mother in law (68f). 
In reference to meeting her at the waterfront near our home, I was asking her to narrow it down a little when she said my wife (40f) could look for her location to make it easier. 

Assuming she was mistaken, I said she would have to share location for that to work and she informed me that she and my wife have that set up 100% of the time. I laughed and said that’s so unhealthy. 

Got off the phone and asked my wife to confirm and she said yes, I asked “Does that mean the opposite is also true? Are you sharing  your location with her 100% of the time?” 
She said yes, 

I was being snarky cos I thought she would agree with me. I said something like “come on, you must think that’s weird. Not even when you say it out loud?” 

Anyway, she’s furious with me, says I’m being mean, she’s crying and left the house furious with me. 

Am I the asshole here? I feel terrible about having blundered in and upset her , and will definitely apologise for the insensitivity as soon as we talk. 

But please someone tell me - is the maps thing normal and I’m the crazy one? 


UPDATE:

Wow, that was an absolute deluge of responses. Truly wasn’t expecting it to have that much engagement. Posting to hopefully wrap things here because I really need to stop reading this for a while. Just going to address a couple of things quickly:

1. Thanks so much to the people that came here sincerely to give me a different perspective on the location sharing thing. My takeaway from lots of people giving their input is that the 24/7 sharing is a much more passive activity whereas I think my experience of using things like dropping a pin or sharing an Uber ride, I think my perception of it is like more of an active thing. 

I get there is a range of perspectives and comfort levels on this and I clearly need to make a bit more space for that. 

2. I’M A WOMAN! 😂😂 Despite me including it in the OP , lots of people did miss the fact that my wife and I are in a queer relationship. Really no offence taken, it’s an easy mistake to make when reading through these quickly. Wanted to highlight it so that hopefully anyone who visits this subsequently doesn’t get into a whole “I don’t get it because I’m a man” conversation. 

3. I behaved in a shitty way to my wife. I thought I was clear on the fact that I knew I was the asshole for my response/attitude/how I said it but I obviously didn’t do a great job of that. My focus was more on the location thing and I definitely saw that my take was definitely in the minority about location sharing. 

4. Lots of people asked follow up questions about my wife and mother in law and people’s health, back stories with lots of further questions about their relationship, my relationship with parents etc. 
I’ve responded to questions about my own relationship with my mum a few places in the thread but I really get the ick at the prospect of adding more personal info about them. 

5. Everyone saying: 
what if something happens? What if she gets in a car accident? What if *all the worst possible things? I’d respectfully ask all of you to stop it. I’ve gotten the point  you’re making but please stop making me visualise the worst possible things happening to the best person I know. 

6. Last but not least, I had already apologised on the phone when I posted this. When my wife came home I apologised again , in person, and she was gracious enough to accept my apology. A little later I told her about this post and told her the internet has decided that I suck and she’s right so that gave us something else to giggle about it. 

Thanks everyone xx",mayorbette,1356,0.7699999809265137,2055,1708814853,2024-02-24 16:47:33,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1az7ufr/aita_for_telling_my_wife_its_weird_that_she_and/,2,2024
1b01blt,AITA for ordering food that my husband can’t eat?,"I 28f have been with my husband 28m for 9 years, married for 2 this summer. We have a daughter who is 7 years. We rarely even fight, and if we do it has been more major and serious things, but this, what to me was a small issue is now turning into the biggest argument we have ever had.

So the problem is that me and our daughter loves LOVES spicy food, I always have and ever since I felt comfortable with her trying it, she has loved it too. Sure we couldn’t compete in a spice eating contest and even though our tolerance is high, it is not extreme. But my husband, he hates it, he is one of those people who thinks spice is unnecessary and only likes to use salt and pepper. This is not a problem, sometimes I make a batch that suits his taste, another one for me and our daughter. Sometimes me and our daughter will just eat how it is to his liking, as too little spices is easier to handle than to much as it would be for him. 

Now this Saturday he was away with friends to go pick up some car parts, it was a 12 hour drive in total, and they left at about 9. I went ahead and ordered from a Indian place that our daughter has as her favorite, my husband also likes this place and just orders something mild when we eat from there. Since my husband was not home, I did not order him anything as I thought that they would’ve eaten on the road. When he got home, he greeted us then immediately went to the fridge and saw some boxes left of food. When he opened them, he obviously noticed he could not eat any of them.

Now we argued just for about 5 minutes of this, the consensus of the argument was him saying that I should’ve either thought about him and ordered him something, or I should’ve asked him if he had eaten or wanted anything. I argued that I would’ve probably done so if it was just for a few hours he was away, but he was away for over 12 hours and came home about 4 hours after we usually eat, so I assumed he had eaten. 

Now he has barely talked, he cooked his dinner for himself because in his words “I can’t be bothered”, he texted me from the living room when I was cooking for me and our daughter that he hoped I was happy to have my food my way now. He is extremely weird about this, he has never ever acted this way about something like this and I am getting even more confused by it all.

1b02yjt,"AITA for calling my wife irresponsible, possibly being overprotective of my daughter?","Hello, I don't really know how to start this, I'm sorry if there are any mistakes, English is not my first language.

I'm 37M. I live with my wife, Jen, 37F and our two kids,13F and 7F. Last weekend, my wife went out for the day with our oldest daughter, who for this story I will call Emily, while I stayed home with our youngest.

Three hours after they left, I got a call from Emily. She was very upset on the phone and was crying. She explained that they went to a clothing store together, they split up to look at different sections and now Jen is no where to be found and her phone is going to the voicemail. She had asked an employee to make an speaker announcement and no one has come forward, and Jen had been gone for around an hour.

I told Emily not to panic and I come straight down. When I got there, Jen was still gone, and I couldn't see her car in the parking area. We searched for Jen in the stores that are next-door in case she went in one of them, and I also try to call her.

Around 40 minutes later, Jen calls me and says she is on her way back to the clothing store. I asked where she had been, and she says she drove to another nearby store that she wanted to go to. I asked why she didn't bring Emily or at least tell her that she was leaving, and she said because she did not expect to take a long time or for Emily to even notice that she was gone.

Emily has been distraut and avoiding Jen, she is still very upset.

When we got home, Jen and I had an argument as I said that she was irresponsible for going away and leaving Emily in the store without telling her. Jen says I just want to treat Emily like a baby and that she is old enough to be able to be on her own in a store. I asked Jen why she did not answer her phone and she says she accidentally put it on do not disturb. Jen is angry that I called her irresponsible and says that what she did is nowhere close to being an irresponsible parent.

I know I can be overprotective of my kids but we do live in a high crime area and it makes me very angry that Emily was left feeling scared.

1b0va9w,AITA For excluding my wife’s friend from trip solely because we think she is annoying?,"Maybe not as dramatic as other situations here but here goes, My(M31) wife (F30) has a friend, we’ll call her Dana (F34), they have been friends for a little more than 10 years and it’s important to note that the only friend Dana has is my wife (for the sake of the post I’ll call her Laura).

  
Dana has always had difficulties making and keeping friends, this is because she’s a classical “one upper” if you tell her about a vacation you had and enjoy, she’ll tell you it’s nothing compared to her last vacation. You’re going through a bad time? We’ll it’s nothing compared to what’s she’s going through and stuff like that.

  
Since her only friend is Laura, I got to hang out with her a lot, I don’t like her and don’t consider her a friend but I am civil to her.

  
Laura has tried to integrate Dana to another group of friends of ours for a few years now but it not going well. The breaking point was one night when we were drinking and a friend opened up about losing a beloved pet and Dana responded by saying it was nothing compared to when she lost a blouse her mother had given her last year. After that some people wouldn’t hang out if she was coming and so.

  
Now to the issue, we’re planning a week long camping trip along with 2 more friends and their spouses, of these friends, only one of them has met Dana. 

  
Laura thinks this might be a good chance for Dana to meet new people, so she suggested we invite her I was obviously against it, I get tired just imagining a week with her and told her so, she knows I’m not a fan of hers but is hoping  I will help her improve her social skill but I don’t think our vacation should be her opportunity, we fought a little and didn’t solve anything.

  
Here is why I think I could be an asshole. I continue planning the trip and every time Laura told me to invite Dana I would just tell her I’ll do it once all is set up (I had no intention in doing so), anyway the trip is a few weeks away and last Saturday the cat was out of the bag about me not wanting Dana to come. 

  
Laura argues that “being annoying” is no reason to exclude her and if she needs to improve her social skills we should be helping her, I obviously disagree but I have never seen Laura this angry so I’m doubting myself. So Am I the Asshole?

1b0wndk,AITA for Asking My Niece to Stop Speaking French Around My Dyslexic Wife?,"My wife (28F) Sarah and I (M30) have been married for five years. She's incredible, loving, and my favourite person in the world. Now, my entire family has tradition of learning and speaking French. It's always been a fun way for us to bond. However, for Sarah, it's been a bit of a challenge.

Sarah has tried for years to pick up the language, but due to her dyslexia, she's found it extremely difficult. It's been a great source of frustration and insecurity for her, especially when we're around my family who like to speak French with each other.

My niece (17F), Eva, is staying with us for a while. She's speaks English and French too, and understandably speaks a lot of French around the house. While I understand its just a normal thing for her, it's been a bit upsetting for Sarah. She feels excluded from our conversations and she's started trying to brush up on it but its just stressing her out and hitting a nerve.

Given the situation, I approached Eva and asked if she could try to speak more English around my wife. I explained that it wasn't about controlling her choices but about helping Sarah feel more comfortable and included in conversations.

Unfortunately, Eva didn't take it well. She accused me of prioritizing Sarah's difficulties over her comfort and claimed that I was asking her to suppress her identity.

1b1oo52,AITA for 'taking up all the attention' at my SIL's baby shower?,"I (33F) am an OB/GYN and I've been travelling around different parts of the world on missions with MSF. Long story short, I hadn't been home in 15 months.  (For some context, I decided to join due to a depressive episode after my ex-girlfriend broke up with me but I ended up loving it and I just kept going on missions for 15 months. My ex-girlfriend is a good friend of my sister in law, Penny.) 

I decided to take some time off and come back for a while before deciding on what's next for me. I returned 2 weeks ago. My brother (I'll call him Harry - 34M) and his wife (Penny - 28F) are expecing their first child. They had scheduled a baby shower for yesterday, and obviously Penny invited me.

Family members and some of Harry's old friends and were asking me questions about different missions ans why I left for charity while I could earn a fortune here, was it hard being a woman in those areas etc. I gave them short answers but they asked more questions.

Penny subtly asked for me to talk one-on-one in the middle of the party. She told me I was monopolizing everyone's attention and taking up everyone's time and no one was paying attention to the purpose of this gathering due to my being there. 

I apologized and asked her if she wanted me to leave. She said I had been enough of a distraction, and told me to please leave early. I left about half an hour after this talk. So far everything's good. 

The next day Harry called me and told me I had been a rude guest the day before, because I had ruined their first child's baby shower. He said I should have kept quiet or at the very least left the party the moment Penny asked me to. Was I a. AH?

1b1q76f,AITA because I didn't let my son stay home today?,"My son (16M) approached me yesterday after school and told me that he didn't want to go to school the next day. I asked him why and he told me that he just didn't feel like going and he was tired of waking up early in the morning. I told him that that wasn't a good enough reason for him to stay home and that if he feels tired when waking up in the morning then he should try and go to get in bed earlier.

He got upset with me when I told him that and told me that he needs to stay home for the sake of his mental health. He then told me that making him go to school would only worsen it. I asked him why he thought that and he told me that the kids and teachers at his school irritates him. This made me concerned so I asked him if anyone was bullying him or if he was having problems with some of his teachers and he just told me that he wasn't and he just finds them annoying. I asked him if that was the only reason and he told me that it was.

I understood where my son was coming from and I tried to show my understanding. I told him how I sometimes find my co workers annoying too, but that doesn't mean I get to skip work just because of it. I told him that if he is serious about school being detrimental to his mental health then I told him that I'll try and find him a therapist to help him manage it. He then got even more mad at me and told me that he doesn't need a therapist and that he only needs time away from school. He told me that I don't understand how stressful school can be and that's why he needs time away. I told him that I do understand, and a therapist could be beneficial in helping him deal with stress.

He started arguing with me about not wanting to go again and I just got frustrated. I told him that he has an upcoming doctor's appointment this Wednesday so there's no need for him to miss both Tuesday and Wednesday. I told him that I don't want him to miss days of school unless they are absolutely necessary. 

He took this as me telling him that his mental health wasn't important and then he started telling me that I must not love him if I send him to school. He then told me that if I try and force him to see a therapist I'll have something else to worry about?? I asked him to clarify what he meant by that but he didn't specify. He just told me not to worry about it and to leave him alone. 

Cut to this morning, he was very hostile with me from the moment he woke up and was practically ignoring me whenever I tried to speak to him. Then when I dropped him off at school he told me  that he finds it weird that I hate him so much and don't want him to succeed in life?? Then before I could say anything he got out of the car quickly. When I picked him up from school today, I tried to talk about what happened and what he said but he just ignored me and is still not speaking to me?

1b2kw13,AITA for telling my mom I will move out vs paying $600 a month rent?,"I'm 25 years old, was paying $60 a week rent for a few years. I recently started a new temp job that pays pretty decent, and they decided to keep me with the company last week. This morning my mom texted me to say “Rent starts up again, $150 a week”. 

I just told her I will move out. I already pay for my own meals, I only have my small bedroom to call my own in their house. I can rent a studio apartment 3 or 4 times the size of my room for a few hundred more, or could rent a room with friends for less than my mom is trying to charge me. It would be one thing if they cooked and cleaned for me every day and I was raking up their bills but I do my own thing, pay my own bills, I never really even cross paths with my parents besides when I am getting off work. 

My moms definitely pissed that I said that, I can tell. But I'm also upset the person who birthed me is trying to get me to pay what I would pay a landlord for rent just to sleep in her house.  Even 100 a week I would have been more inclined to be okay with, but 600 a month just to be able to sleep at my parents house seems a little high. If I am paying $600 a month I think I would deserve my own spaces around the house also as I would with a landlord, it seems having a landlord would be a better deal for me in this case.

1b2lnwd,AITA for screaming at my sons gf mom to get out of my house?,"My husband and I come from a small religious town. Which we are strongly religious we don’t follow the same strict rules as everyone else were very open minded. Our oldest son(18Jacob) girlfriend moved in with us on her 18th birthday, due to finding out she was pregnant and her parents were extremely controlling. We were shamed by everyone in our town for the pregnancy itself, but we never paid a mind to it. Three weeks ago, Jacob girlfriend had her baby, she kept it a secret from her mother, but we’re assuming someone at the hospital opened their mouths.

 Two nights ago we had a banging at my door, and it was her mother demanding to come in and see “this secret baby.” My sons girlfriend said I could let her in if she promised to calm down, in which I relayed the message and obliged. Her mother was calm at first, until she began talking about how she’d pray for her daughters soul not to be damned, and began loudly praying in my livingroom. I told her she needed to stop, and she began to calm down then tried telling my sons girlfriend that they could fix this, that the baby is still young enough to be deeply wanted by an adopting family.  My sons girlfriend started crying and I told her it was time to leave. 

She started saying I was sugar coating things for these kids and that they have no clue how to raise a baby and they are too young. She called my son rude names and basically said he’d be working at the county for the rest of his life and I told her she needed to get out of my house right now, very loudly in which she obliged.  Later on I got a text on Facebook from her saying I was a horrible role model and shouldn’t keep her from her daughter and that everyone would know what goes on behind my door. I  went grocery shopping yesterday and our cashier who I know wouldn’t talk to me, and today I was actually asked to leave my church that I’ve been going to for the past 10 years by a deacon.

1b481pf,AITA For Expecting My Wife To Do Most Of The Pool Upkeep?,"I (36m) and my wife (35f) purchased our house 3 years ago. When we were in the market for houses, my wife stated that she explicitly wanted a pool. I didn't really care too much for a pool, but we had a flexible budget so I guess why not? I requested though, that if we bought one, she would have to do 80% of the upkeep, if not all of it. She agreed. 

&#x200B;

FF to now. I've done 90% of the upkeep, and my wife had an excuse every time I ask her to help me clean the pool, or check the alkalinity or pH level of the pool, she always ""too tired"" or ""she'll do it later."" I let it happen the first couple times, but it's kind of getting frustrating now. 

&#x200B;

But luckily, I have two employees that are extremely helpful: My son (7M) and my daughter (6F). Very well paid, no complaints so far. Yesterday, my employees were using their time off to go to school, so I got to cleaning. Technically draining, but it took long enough that is was just about done by the time my wife got back home. 

&#x200B;

By the time we were heating to bed, I asked her if she could clean it on Saturday (or I could help) but she hit me with the ""I'm busy."" She doesn't work on Saturday. I got kidn of upset about it and told her that she should be doing 100% of the upkeep anyways and I'm going to stop taking care of the pool from now. 

&#x200B;

She just told me to stop bluffing and went to sleep. FF to this morning, and she doesn't even want to discuss anything pool related or even anything related with me.

1b50c4a,AITA for naming my child after a villain?,"So, I recently gave birth to my husband and I's first child, a girl. When I was pregnant, we had a lot of trouble deciding on a name, but I finally found one I liked and my husband said he was fine with.

My husband was playing Street Fighter and I watched for a few seconds, and the character Juri was on screen, and something just clicked. I really loved the sound of the name, and brought it up to my husband. He was a bit unsure at first since the character is apparently a psychopath (I don't really know anything about the game or character) but I assured him it'd be fine since we aren't literally naming the baby in honor of the character, and that since it's also a real name it's not like it's inherently tied to that. He ended up agreeing to go along with it, and said it was a nice name regardless.

So, months later, the baby's born, and I'm talking with a friend of mine. She ends up asking how we picked the name Juri, and I brought up that it was kind of a funny story and explained how we picked it. She was kind of astonished, saying that I was naming my character after a villain who's a ""psychopath"" and that I was setting my daughter up to be bullied. I argued that it's a real name, and that it's not like I was naming the kid something like Darth Vader where anyone who hears it will immediately associate it with a villainous character. My husband chimed in saying he went to high school with someone named after Melina from Mortal Kombat (who is also apparently a crazy villain character) and everyone just thought it was cool when they found out. The friend just said that I was setting my daughter up for a lot of hardship in the future, and now I'm second-guessing my choice. I didn't think it'd be a big deal but a few other people among my friends/family found out the origin of the name and are now telling me it was horrible to name my child that.

1b51stz,"WIBTA if I move out, leaving my chronically ill roommate vulnerable?","I (30sf) live in Los Angeles, where rent is really high.  I live in a house with two roommates (30, 50f).

My 30-year-old roommate, Kay, has been battling an autoimmune chronic illness for a couple of years. She’s not able to eat a lot of foods and has these spells where her energy is drained. 

My 50-year-old roommate Tammy is emotionally immature, doesn’t help out with chores and has a tendency to be really forgetful. For example, she once broke a toilet seat and didn’t bother to replace it before going on a last-minute trip out of town. After I got the delayed utilities payment from her, it came with a poop emoji attached to it. 

I’m responsible for the major utility bills (water, power and internet). It’s hard getting payments from Kay and Tammy because of Kay’s health issues and Tammy’s irresponsibility. They also have two dogs who are very loud and cause a ruckus.

I’ve been having a hard time coping with Kay’s health problems.  It’s horrible for me to say it, but when she is down, she is down. That leaves the majority of household chores, bills, and trash on me.  

I’m in school and working full time.  I can’t stand living like this anymore. Recently, a friend of mine was looking to fill in a roommate vacancy. I will pay more for rent, but the location is closer to my college and my work. 

I feel guilty moving out because of Kay’s health issues. She relies on me to help her get groceries she’s sick. Not to mention, Tammy does f-all to help around the house.

Kay even said that if I move out, it will be bad for her because of her health problems. She says she’s trying to get better, but she’s been saying that for over a year and it’s affecting my life too.

1b5v77r,AITA for suggesting my minimum wage and part time boyfriend pay me back for half of my gas for taking him to and from work everyday?,"My (27 F) boyfriend (36 M) of 8 years works at the Amazon distribution center and I am the one to give him rides to and from work, as he works overnights and I worked days. He does have a friend who takes him to work 1 time a week. I also take him to appointments when needed and to the gym daily. He does not have a car or license at this time due to several unpaid speeding and parking tickets.

So about 3 weeks ago I was laid off from my job in marketing. I was making about $55 an hour and holding things down at home with the mortgage and bills without any issues, so I never found it necessary to ask him for gas money to take him to work and home. I figure he works hard and doesn’t get paid much so why make things worse for him? I fill up my gas tank about one time a week for $60. I understand that he is making only $16 an hour and working only about 24 hours per week. I am also privileged to have gotten an masters degree, so I can see how charging him for gas may be an asshole move. But now that I am unemployed and living on much less from unemployment, I am on a budget. I feel like I’m making changes to my lifestyle such as letting go of my personal training sessions, going natural with my nails and avoiding overconsumption.

So on Thursday I asked him about paying to fill up my tank once every two weeks, and I’ll pay the other two weeks, and he got really upset and told me how much easier life has been for me and how I take that for granted. He also says he doesn’t have the money to pay $120 a month for gas (which is understandable because he only makes about $350 every week) even though I have been paying all the bills since we moved in together 4 years ago. I told him that I am not a free Uber service and I feel taken advantage of at times. He still has avoided talking to me about the matter. Am I the asshole in the situation?


TL;DR I lost my decent paying job and am on unemployment and am asking my minimum wage part time work boyfriend whom is unlicensed to pay for the gas I use to pick him up now due to finances. AITA?

 I’d been telling my family since I first got hired that they ALL need to come. When I finally got the date I could have my dinner my 20 year old sister said she had tickets for a rave that day and cant change the dates anymore. This was an extrenely big deal to me and I’m very upset that she won’t just not go to the rave and come to my dinner. 

I rarely ask her to go places and she always flakes out and says she’s “tired” but has the energy to go out with friends every week. she then said if i gave her the money she spent then shed be able to go but also said id have to reimburse her boyfriend too, which i refused. not because i dont like him but because i dont want to pay 600 for my sister to come to an event i had been telling her about for months. She said unless i did that she can’t go, and im extremely upset and offended that my own damn sister would rather go to a rave then her brothers probationary dinner since this is like a wedding or graduation and not going is extremely messed up.  You go out to support your family cause you love them and want to be there for their accomplishments, seldom rarely do my other family members even fake smiles at these events but I know if it was the other way around I’d move heaven and earth to be there for my family’s big day.

1b6okh1,AITA for calling my sister out for telling my wife that she looked pregnant?,"My sister isn't a child, she's 30. The thing is that she hasn't had the most conventional adulthood.  She spent most of her late teens and early twenties in and out of one rehab or another, she didn't go to college, lives alone and I don't think she has that much of a social live. She lives out of town so we don't see her much.

My wife isn't a heavy person by any means,  but like many, many people, she isn't quite as thin as she was when we first married, pre child and all that. Totally normal and obviously I couldn't care less. My sister came over with my mom to visit several months ago which was her first time seeing my wife and I in years. She came into town again more recently and we met her at my parents house. She saw my wife and said ""oh I thought you were pregnant"". Implying that my wife looked pregnant last she saw her but clearly isn't as she would be showing more now. My wife is a very emotionally mature person and didn't make a thing of it and neither did I. 

I thought maybe my sister, perhaps being less exposed to societal norms than some, didn't know that you don't say that,  ever. So I sent her a text later on telling her that I know she didn't have bad intentions but that it's generally quite rude to comment that someone looks pregnant and really shouldn't be said, basically ever.

1b6pymg,AITA for throwing a piece of popcorn at someone who kept using their phone during a movie?,"The title is pretty self-explanatory... but here are the details...

We went to see Dune 2 (HIGHLY recommended) last night... in a VIP theatre with comfy seats and table service... which I mention because to attend, you must be 19+ -- they serve real drinks.

Seated two rows ahead of us, were three young women... 19-22 I'd guess.

They didn't shut up during any of the previews, and spoke loudly to each other throughout the movie... which is annoying, but, unfortunately, hardly unique these days.

But what was incredibly annoying... starting at about 20 minutes into the movie, one of them got onto her phone. She was only two rows ahead and it was full brightness, so it'd be an understatement to say it was distracting. She'd text, scroll instagram, watch TikTok videos... for a few minutes... then put it down. Ten minutes later, out came the phone again. 

After the third time, I said, quite loudly, ""Put the phone away!"" She looked back, gave me a look like ""STFU old man"", but put it down. And then, 10 minutes later, pulled it out again. Again, full brightness.

So I got a piece of popcorn and threw it at her... hit her on the head. As you can imagine, she turned around... ""Are you fuckin serious right now?!""

""Yeah, I'm serious, can't you live without your phone for a couple of hours?""

""Shhh!"", said someone

""Shut up!"", said someone else.

She put it away... and then, maybe 20 minutes later, out it came again.

I threw another piece of popcorn, which barely missed but flew by her face. She put the phone away and it stayed away for the rest of the movie.

Nobody stood, nobody clapped, nobody really cared. And that might have been the end of it, except after the movie, she quite bluntly said to her friend as we were walking out, looking at me, ""That's the asshole.""

In telling others about this this morning, I've come to understand that movie etiquette has changed from when I was 20. Back then, of course, there weren't phones... but it was unheard of to engage in behaviour that'd be distracting to others. And when phones appeared 30 years ago, you'd NEVER get on it during the movie, and if you had to, you'd walk out and deal with it. But these days, this is par for the course.

Anyway, if I'm paying $25 per ticket plus food plus drinks (expensive!) plus parking for a night out and a true theatre experience, I'd like to enjoy it with what I think is the environment all of that deserves. I can watch movies at home and get on my phone all I want, for free. This is supposed to be different.

Am I out of touch? AITA? Is this ok these days?

And maybe that behaviour is not OK, but AITA for throwing a couple of kernels of popcorn at someone?

I am not sure if I should have just minded my business but I said that the “th” sound does not exist in every language and that it is wrong to embarrass someone like that because of an accent.

1b9893v,AITA for taking my grandchildren to Disney for the first time without their mother and refusing to apologize when confronted?,"My son made this account and asked me to post this story, because he claims my normal meter is skewed and the internet is going to tell me I am an asshole.

I recently babysat my grandchildren (5 and 4) for a period of four nights and five days so my son and his wife could attend a wedding in Mexico, and spend a few days on vacation. They approached me since her mother would not be available, and I initially said I wasn't comfortable with that. It seemed like a long time to watch the kids, and she has point blank told me that the woman's family is more important than the man's, so I was irritated I was being asked and not her mother. I will admit that I did give in when my son became very emotional, but I felt/feel like they were being manipulative.

While I had the kids I was invited to a birthday at Epcot and wanted to go. It didn't even occur to me to run it by my son or daughter in law, as I had the kids for an extended period of time and obviously they knew they would be going where I went. My daughter in law had previously mentioned wanting to save up for Disney, but she's said that about a lot of things, and never made me aware it was something super special to her. Also it was Epcot. It's not like I took them to Magic Kingdom and they had some magical moment of seeing their favorite character. 

When they returned and found out my daughter in law was furious and burst into tears. She said I stole one of her kids first and called me entitled. To be honest I didn't react well to being called entitled, when she was the one who had previously demanded babysitting. My son asked me to apologize as she was distraught over missing their first Disney trip, but I declined and asked them to leave. 

My son reached out again and said I should have asked for something that big, and his wife feels robbed. I know she is a huge Disney person, but it was Epcot, not quintessential Disney and I don't feel I should have had to miss out on a birthday party I wanted to attend. I told my son I am not apologizing for anything and maybe they should think about how they made me feel when they didn't respect my initial no.

1b989ly,AITA For Telling A Stranger “Maybe You Could Have The Decency To Mind Your Damn Business”?,"I am a 23 y/o woman, the other two women involved were (and I’m estimating, I don’t know them) were a mother around 45 and her mid-late teenage daughter.

So I just left the pharmacy where this took place and I’m writing this in the car before I head out, but I was waiting in line to pick up my prescription. Line was pretty long, it went all the way down an aisle a few feet from the counter. I’m chilling in line, it’s inching along, and about ten minutes into waiting, this woman and her daughter come out of a different aisle and start browsing the one that the line is in. They’re talking about what they want to get, and suddenly the daughter goes “does something smell like a grease trap to you?” I laugh and turn around and say “yeah, that tends to happen after 11 hours in a kitchen” in a casual, joking tone. The mother makes a face and says “well you smell awful. You could at least have the decency to go home and shower first.”

I didn’t expect a stranger to get nasty with me, and after a long day I didn’t have the grace for it, especially with over an hour of driving ahead of me. I also didn’t feel like explaining to the woman that I had about 1.5 hours of driving ahead, that I wasn’t going home first, and to take this little detour would’ve meant 50 minutes of driving (30 from work to home, 20 from home to pharmacy) instead of 15 (from work to pharmacy). So, I snapped back “well maybe you could have the decency to mind your own damn business!”

1b993fj,AITA for telling my son that he should've told me about his girlfriend's dietary restrictions?,"My son (25M) started seeing a new girl named Lexi around a year and a half ago. She lives a few hours away, but they see each other often enough. I'd never met her personally until now. I don't know much about her, but she makes my son happy and seems to have a good head on her shoulders. That's all that matters to me. 

Last Friday, we hosted a barbecue and party, around 25-30 people. It was mostly family and friends. My son asked me if he could bring Lexi, and I told him that it was fine. We had ribs, burgers and wings, as well as some sides that didn't have meat.

What my son didn't communicate to me, or to anyone else handling the food, was that Lexi is a very particular eater and wouldn't be able to eat anything we served. Lexi is Catholic and can't eat meat on Fridays. My son was aware of this and invited her to a barbecue knowing what would be served. On top of that, she also has a sort of ED (ARFID) that limits what kinds of foods she will/can eat without feeling sick.

She was really sweet, and I enjoyed her company, but I felt terrible watching her sit without food. When I asked if she'd eaten beforehand, she told me that yes, and that she wasn't hungry. I asked my son separately why he'd gone out to eat right before a barbecue, and he told me that that they'd come straight from her house. So I asked him if she didn't like the food, to which he explained why she couldn't eat the meat, and that she wouldn't eat any of the sides either. Since he didn't say anything beforehand, I asked her myself.

I asked Lexi if there was anything I could get or make her, or if she wanted us to run somewhere and pick something up. She asked if I had any fruit, so she had fruit salad. After everything was sorted out my son came up to me and told me that I'd embarrassed her and shouldn't have drawn attention to it. I told him that he should have tried harder to accommodate her, or to at least tell us beforehand that she wouldn't be able to eat what everyone else was. We easily could have made some plain salad or had fruit available at no hassle for anyone else, and she would at least be able to pick at something instead of going hungry. If it were addressed beforehand then I wouldn't have had to ask. 

My son left in a huff to bring Lexi home, and he's still insisting that I made a bad impression and that it wouldn't have been a big deal if she didn't eat. Apparently I made her anxiety worse, but that's according to him, so I'm not sure I believe it. AITA?

1ba03qq,AITA for uninviting my friend from my Oscar party over a bottle of whisky?,"All names are fake.

Me (29M) and my wife ""Kate"" (27F) host an Oscar watch party at our house every year. We've been doing that since we moved in together 5 years ago. We dress up well, place bets on the winners and eat popcorn. It's a fun tradition that many of our friends look forward to every year. One of those people is ""Rick"" (28M), a friend of mine from college.

My wife loves whisky. Shortly before last year's party, my FIL gave her a bottle of Macallan. He said he'd spent $175 on it. Kate gave birth to our first child in 2022 and was still breastfeeding last year, so she decided to save the bottle for after our son had weaned.

During last year's watch party, Rick got wasted. While reaching for something else in our liquor cabinet, he accidentally dropped and broke the bottle. He apologized profusely once he'd sobered up. I was angry, but the whisky was Kate's and she forgave him, so I decided to drop the subject.

A couple weeks after that, we asked Rick how he planned on replacing the bottle. He was shocked at our question, and told us he didn't intend to. Rick's been having money problems for a while and struggles to pay his rent. He said that since we knew about his condition, it was unreasonable of us to expect him to pay for a $175 bottle of whisky.

I told Rick he had until this year's Oscar party (which was months away at the time) to save up for a new bottle. If he didn't, he wouldn't be welcome at our place for the party. At the time, he agreed. Throughout the year, I asked him about the savings several times. He always told me he was close to the goal.

Last week, I asked Rick about it again. He confessed he hadn't actually saved any money for the bottle. So I kept my promise and uninvited him from the party.

Both Rick and his girlfriend (who frequently joins him at our parties) are now angry at me for uninviting him over a ""drunken mistake."" They also insist that I'm being unsympathetic and entitled by expecting Rick to pay for a new bottle.

Kate's on my side, but is worried we're being too harsh. I really don't think we are, but as Sunday approaches, I'm starting to feel guilty.

I have less than two days to sort this out. AITA?",InternationalList333,4370,1.0,1,1709933973,2024-03-08 15:39:33,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ba03qq/aita_for_uninviting_my_friend_from_my_oscar_party/,3,2024

I'm going to keep this short. I'm in college and living with my parents. My parents had an oops baby. My sister is only 4. They can't afford childcare so instead of getting a part-time job to help out I take care of her when they're at work. 

We got into an argument because they haven't gone grocery shopping and we're running low on food. They used the last of the bread for themselves tonight and when I brought up what I would eat we got into an argument. They told me I'm grown and it's not their responsibility to feed me anymore. I told them that's bs and I'm entitled to food because I'm taking care of thier kid.

They're now calling me an entitled brat and saying if I don't fix my attitude they'll kick me out. I told them go ahead because then they'll be homeless because they can't afford childcare even with both of them working. My relatives are telling me I'm in the wrong because I am an adult and need to grow up.

1batxxj,AITA for being honest when my dad asked where my mom was on my wedding morning?,"I recently married my beautiful wife ""Amanda"" She isn't the biggest fan of my mom and that is probably mutual idk. Amanda knows I am on her side and here to support any boundaries. She was concerned about how my mom would behave at the wedding and admitted to not wanting to spend any more time with her than absolutely necessary.

I ended up going to my mom's husband ""Chris"" and asking if he had any thoughts so we could all have  a peaceful day and no bridesmaids would need to ""accidently"" spill anything. At first he didn't want to help, but he didn't want my mom to feel embarrassed and gave in. He said it was already going to be a long day for her, so he recommended no pre wedding festivities and said he would get her out of the rehearsal dinner early, so she had enough time in between. He took her out right after dinner and took her somewhere else.

The day of the wedding she was not invited to get ready with the bridal party or have a champagne breakfast. Instead Chris took her to the beach for a long run (get that energy out) Then took her to a nice breakfast, home for some one on one attention, and let her know he had a special day planned the following day. She got her makeup done at their house and came just in time for the wedding. 

My stepmom ""Lexi' was however invited to get ready with the bridal party. I guess she told my dad my mom wasn't there and he asked me. I told him the truth that Chris was taking care of her as it would be too long a day for her. I guess he told someone else because my mom found out and was furious.

She asked how I could humiliate her and said I'm a shitty son. She said I could have said nothing and accused me of not loving her. She said she knows the truth that we just don't like her or want her around.

1bavc2o,AITA for asking a hotel employee how they knew my name?,"
I’m staying in a hotel in Dublin City for the weekend and have a late flight home tomorrow evening. Around an hour ago I went to reception to enquiry if they could keep my luggage safe after check out and before my flight. There were two men at reception I spoke to. One was the young male receptionist who checked me in yesterday. The other was an older man, (50s) but he was not wearing the hotel uniform. 

The receptionist said “yes that’ll be no problem” and I smiled and said “that’s wonderful” then the older man said “what time’s your flight weary fruits?” I said the time and then realised, he knew my name which surprised me so I added “oh, that’s funny, how did you know my name? I didn’t tell you…” now I honestly believe my tone was more curious and confused since it had caught me off guard. I honestly thought maybe I was wearing something with my name on it and even looked down to see! 

The receptionist, said “oh, I don’t think he called you by your name, maybe he said Madame?”, I say “oh really? My mistake!”, honestly relieved if not a little embarrassed but the older man chimed in “no, she’s right, I know your name weary fruits. It’s my job to know everything and everyone here”. I reply with a nervous laugh “oh that’s bit weird…” I expected he was going to say JK or that he’s the manager and prides himself on knowing names etc. I clock that it all seemed a bit weird since he didn’t try to make it obvious he was joking. My real name isn’t even close to Madame so I don’t think I misheard him.  

The older man then asks what room am I in. I was caught up on how he knew my name but wouldn’t say how he knew it, so I started to feel a bit worried. Out of instinct I asked “why do you want to know that… I’m confused”. I believe I said this timidly but with a bit of anxiety as I remember scanning both their faces as I said it.

The receptionist interjects and smiles as if to reassure me, “i think he just wants to offer you a late check out”. I feel a better so say something along the lines of “oh I see that’s very nice of you but I guess I’m still just a bit weirded out by the name thing. Sorry I have had a long day so…” The older man says “well, I was going to, but since you’re been such a b word - I won’t do that now”.

 This  caught me off guard. Out of instinct, I said “I’m sorry I think this is gone the wrong way but it just confused me that we’ve never met and you know my name”. He then double down and repeats a similar line about how he just wanted to be nice but I had to go and be a b word about it. He’s not smiling or laughing just for context.

I can tell from the receptionists face he is shocked. I took a breath, said slowly, calmly, “okay well, I think that’s it. I really don’t know what to do with “that” (I gesture widely in his direction) language. I don’t appreciate it and I don’t have anything else to say so….” I go to leave, they both call me back but I just raise my hand and say “no, I’m done” and I left the hotel for air.

1bavkf0,AITA for leaving a barcrawl early without my girlfriend?,"I (27 M) just got home about 45 minutes ago and am currently dealing with my very pissed off gf (29 F). We have been dating since November after meeting off of hinge. 

Every year, the weekend before St Patrick’s day weekend, her friend from highschool “Dean” has a birthday barcrawl. A lot of people go; there must have been like 40 people there. My gf has known dean since highschool and she even dated him for a bit then. We are much older now so that doesn’t bother me. 

What bothered me is that my gf basically barely talked to me the entire time we were there. We got to the pregame around noon and went to the first bar at like 2 PM. She kept running off with her friends and I didn’t know a single person who was there. These aren’t friends she sees that often so I’ve never met them before. I spent most of my time at the first 3 bars looking for her. She was pretty drunk and hyper and I know she was looking forward to seeing these friends but it still felt like she ditched me. 

I even expressed to her that if she wanted to go without me it would be okay because I am kind of shy and not great with large groups of people i don’t know. She insisted that I go however so I did. Only for her to not be around me most of the time. 

When it came time to go to the third bar, I found her and told her I had an Uber coming back to my apartment and she can come over when she’s done. I said I didn’t care at all if she wanted to stay but I was done and didn’t really feel wanted at all. She tried to get me to stay but I insisted it was all good but I just wanted to leave. 

Now she is saying she’s not gonna come over and she’s mad at me for leaving. Even making snide remarks about how I don’t let myself socialize. So was I an asshole here?",Crazypaddythrowaway,5176,1.0,1,1710027058,2024-03-09 17:30:58,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1bavkf0/aita_for_leaving_a_barcrawl_early_without_my/,3,2024
1bbmrxj,AITA for telling my sister she doesn’t have a say in my nieces diet,"I adopted my 8 year old niece 5 years ago. Her parents just weren’t fit to be parents. They are still involved in her life as her aunt and uncle. 

My niece is homeschooled. She goes to a co op 4.5 hours a day, 4 days a week. I work 3 12 hour shifts a week so I usually need help getting her to and from co op 1-3 days a week. My sister works nights and is available to take her. Since it’s a bit of a drive back to the house, she usually hangs out at the co op and helps out with whatever they need. 

One mom at the co op makes lunches for the kids as her contribution. She has all of their allergy/dietary info and none of the kids have complained so far. Some examples of their lunches are turkey/ham sandwich, pb&j, mac and cheese, chicken nuggets, grilled cheese, hot dogs, and occasionally pizza. 

She also gives them sides like a cracker (goldfish, cheezits, chips, ritz, veggie straws, etc.), some kind of fruit (fruit slices, fruit cups, apple sauce), some kind of dessert (fruit snacks, cookie, brownie, etc), and a drink (usually milk or juice). 

My sister told my niece that she doesn’t want her eating that crap and that when she takes my niece to co op, she’ll be packing my niece a lunch. Apparently she told my niece that carbs are bad for her and that these lunches will make her fat. 

My niece came to me upset about it because she likes those lunches and that’s what everyone else eats. I told her that my sister was wrong then sent her to play before calling my sister. 

My sister defended everything she said and I told her that if she has concerns about my nieces diet, she will need to speak to me about it, not my niece. I also told her that I am my nieces parent, not her, and that if she feels that she has the power to make unilateral decisions regarding her health without consulting me I will get her a babysitter that can take her to co op. 

A lot of my family is against me on this and says that it’s my sisters kid so she should have a say and that me getting a babysitter will be cruel to both my niece and my sister (she already stays with my neighbor during the day but my neighbor can’t take her to co op).

1bcfrxs,AITA for asking my mother to leave because she won't stop wasting my food.,"My baby sister just had a baby and our mom came to help. My sister and her husband live in a tiny apartment with no room for my mom. I agreed to let her stay with me since I live only eight blocks away. It's walkable. My plan was to Uber her over in the morning and pick her up after work. 

I only eat one meal a day during the week. Supper. I have coffee for breakfast and some fruit for lunch. On Saturday I treat myself to a good breakfast and Sundays I take the woman I'm dating for brunch. 

My mother decided that this was unacceptable. She got up early and went through my fridge and freezer to make me breakfast. 

I told her that I appreciate it but that I do not usually eat breakfast. She said that was stupid. I very clearly communicated to her that she was welcome to eat anything in my home but to please not make me breakfast as it was a waste. 

She made breakfast the following day. I walked out without eating it. I figured worst case scenario I could  eat it for supper. 

She threw it out since I didn't eat it. I told her once more to please not waste my food. 

She made breakfast for me the next day. I asked her if she was developing dementia. She is wasting my food for no good reason. I'm not poor or anything but wasting food is a pet peeve of mine. She said I was being ungrateful for her help and she was doing it to be nice since I was letting her stay with me. 

I explained to her again that I did not need, want, require, or desire breakfast during the week. She said she understood. 

She made me breakfast the next day. I had had enough. I took her luggage with me when I dropped her off at my sister's home. 

I told my doorman that my guest was no longer welcome. 

I got so many messages from her and my sister all day long. Even my dad called me to ask me to change my mind. I said no. 

He had to drive up and rent an Airbnb close to my sister because my mom was too scared to stay by herself. He's retired so he didn't miss work or anything. 

My sister came over alone to talk to me. She said I was being a complete ass and that I could afford the food my mom was wasting. I said I could but that I didn't want to. She literally used up two months worth of my food. She made up huge breakfasts that I didn't even eat. I keep all my bacon in individual servings. She thawed out three for every breakfast. One for her and two for me. And I ate zero. 

My father has asked me to let her back in. I said I would under the condition that she understand that my food is completely off limits to her. She can pay for her own food. I said I would make room in the fridge and freezer for her. She said I was being ridiculous and petty.  

So my dad is staying neutral but my mom and sister think I'm a jackass.

We take our kids (12f and 14f) on trips 2-3 times a year. And over the year I usually put aside money for travel. My wife's niece also needs knee surgery due to soccer injuries (soccer season ended a month or so ago) and my sister-in-law can't really afford it. I'm not sure how much health insurance will cover or how much the surgery will even cost, but they've been looking for help to pay for it.

Well after we booked flights and stuff, we had about 15k-20k left in the account. We didn't really know what to do with it yet.

FF to this morning, and my wife and I are talking about attractions and stuff and my wife kind of sneaks in to the conversation that we would have to pay out of pocket since she gave the remaining money to her sister. I was absolutely fucking livid because a) That was our money in the account, which means my money was also in the account and b) I'm SURE they don't need that much, especially if they have insurance which will most likely cover some of the surgery cost.

Since then, I went to work, came back, and haven't spoken to her since. She's tried to talk about it, but I don't want to talk about anything except my money getting back into my account. I feel bad for ignoring my wife and giving her shade but at the same time I'm really fucking pissed. AITA?

I immediately told her that the dog was not coming as I was not going to put people at risk and have the vacation ruined.

My wife works part-time as a receptionist, while I'm a full-time plumber. When our 2 year old was born, he was very sick and as a result we have some medical debt.

We are not currently struggling, but are living just at the point where we are comfortable.

My wife hates her job, but keeps in it because she's good at it and it pays well enough for an entry level position. She has wanted to become a nurse for a long time, but was unable to attend college and with the kids it's fallen on the backline.

I'm sympathetic towards this, I really am and would love to see her follow her dreams and become a nurse, I've made that very clear. But, she wants to do it now, and honestly I don't really see how that is possible. Between the clinical placements, studying, paying for the course, working, our childcare situation, our debts, I cannot see how it would work.

My wife says she has spoken with her parents and the kids would be able to stay with them usually and she could get a nightfill job. But I don't feel like this is going to be enough, she will be earning a lot less and I will have to work more hours to make sure we are definitely financially alright. This will mean I spend less time at home, can't contribute as much to household chores, which she will have to pick up and balance even more work.

I said I can't support this choice and that she should wait a few years until the kids are in school and she has more time. She says I am an asshole, that she has a right to be happy in her life and I should be supporting her. She says its unfair that I get to enjoy my work (which I do) and she spends her days hating it.

I agree it isn't fair but I just don't feel like now is the time to go about this and can't support her choice to change careers.

My little sister thought I was wrong for not being able to spend nights away from him. Well we still are not married and my mom won't change her rules. We are visiting them though. And she accepts that we stay at a hotel. 

My sister Anna was one of the howler monkeys bugging me because ""I lied"" about not staying at a hotel last Christmas. She and her boyfriend got more serious since then and they got engaged on Valentine's Day.

I laughed at her and reminded her that she called me names for choosing to spend Christmas with my boyfriend's family instead of putting up with our mom. 

She started getting pissy and saying it was different because she was engaged and I am not. Our baby sister spoke up and said she already told Mom that she was going to follow my example if she ever gets serious with a guy. I'm pretty sure my mom thinks I'm the devil.

1bezcnp,AITA for not giving my house to my SIL?,"Throw away for obvious reasons. This happened 2 nights ago, and I'm still feeling some type of way about it. 

Background: My (30f) husband (32m) has a younger sister (SIL 25f), SIL is currently going through a divorce with 4 children. My husband and I also have 4 children. My husband and I live on a very quiet country back road in our little town, us and his family being the only residences on the road. So both his sisters and their families, and his parents, live within walking distance of our house. 

My husband and I have been married for 7 years and have 4 young children. My husband bought the land we live on from his parents when he was 18, and when we got married, we built a house on it. We designed our house with a big family in mind and designed it to be our forever home. It has never been a thought to move or look elsewhere. 

My SIL is going through a divorce. She is struggling, to say the least. She was in a very toxic relationship with her ex, with her contributing just as much as he was, and he filed for divorce and moved out, leaving the 4 kids with her. 

My mother in law called my husband 2 nights ago and asked if we would come over for a chat. We get there, and my In-Laws and SIL are sitting on the couch like they were staging some kind of intervention, it was just really strange. 

My MIL didn't beat around the bush at all. She explained how SIL's ex was getting the house in the divorce and they would be homeless within the month if we didn't give her our home. It honestly took me a second to comprehend what she even said, because it was so out of left field.

Husband didn't need that second and looked them dead in the eyes and said ""No."" 

In-Laws started telling us things like, ""You guys don't need all that house"" ""You guys can move into one of the new neighborhoods in town"" ""You guys can just built a new house"". 

I offered to open up our playroom and guest bedroom to them until they could find somewhere to live, we have air mattresses and the guest room has a full bath, but that was not good enough apparently. That's when we got up and left. 

They began yelling after us, saying we don't care about the children, family helps family, we're being greedy and selfish, etc etc. I'm Honestly so proud of how we reacted, because my first instinct was to go off and say some hurtful things, but we went just home, to OUR home. 

We love SIL's kids, and obviously do not want them to be homeless, but they don't need MY house at the expense of my own children and family. I don't see why SIL's family deserves my home, what about my kids? 

Now the In-Laws are calling/texting, saying we don't care about the kids, we're selfish and greedy, we're making her homeless, and I'm wondering if maybe we were too quick to say no.

She got the job almost 3 yrs ago and we have been at the same midwestern office. She was apart of my team but I dealt very little with her directly and wasn’t her direct report. 

Sara had done very well and was promoted within 6 months to a good position. She seemed to be on a fast track but recently stumbled in her latest interview for a sought after position. We gave the position to a more deserving candidate in my eyes. As we sometimes see Sara was upset and it was the start of her leaving the company. I could sense she was applying elsewhere and did put in a 2 weeks notice, offered to stay on 1 month inline with her projects deadline, which we accepted. We wanted to keep Sara but I could not give her a raise because she was already at the top of her pay scale. Her job offer was actually lower pay so there was no leverage there either. I told her this within a few days and Sara was pretty upset. She decided to leave immediately.

Here is where the issue comes up. Sara was aggressive with her 401k and the company stock options by my recommendation. We have a 10% 401k match (very generous) and stock buying options (match stock purchases - basically a 2 for the price of 1 deal). She would tell me later she maxed the 401k and stock options every year. The problem is my company has a 3 yr vesting schedule before the matching is permanent. So if an employee leaves before both 401k and stock matching is gone. Sara’s 3yr anniversary was within the 1 month notice date but not when she abruptly quit. 

It something I realize between Sara’s notice and her quitting. I wasn’t able to advise her of this nor did I know how much she put into these program. There was really nothing I could do when she abruptly quit. 

It was about 2 months later Sara came over with my wife and laid into me. She tried transferring her funds and found out about the vesting period and asked if I knew. She revealed the amount she would be losing during the transfer of funds and it was greater than $50k. Both Sara and my wife have said I’m TA for not warning her. I told her the situation and how I did not consider her quitting immediately (in front of others too).

So AITA for not warning Sara that she was just short of the 3 yr vesting period that would’ve saved for $50k?

1bfs9jt,AITA for telling my wife to get over my daughters short hair? ,"I(40M) and my wife(42F) have been married for 5 years. I have a 14 year old daughter from a previous relationship. Her mother wanted nothing to do with her when she was born. When I met my wife, she was worried about being a bad step-mother to my daughter. They became close and they do a spa day every mother's day. 

My daughter has very long hair down to her shoulders. She hates putting it up in ponytails and she complains about the length of time it takes to blow-dry. She's a big tom-boy and one of her friends recommended she gets a pixie cut. I booked her an appointment to get the cut she wanted and she was very happy. She's been in such a great mood and loves having the short hair. 

When I brought her home to see wife, my wife dropped what she was doing and looked like she was about to faint. She asked why I allowed daughter to cut all her hair off. I told her that this is the cut my daughter wanted. My wife got furious and started telling me about how I ruined daughter's image. I shot back at her to get over the hair-cut as it made daughter happy. That was all I wanted was my daughter to be happy 

My wife continued to complain about the haircut even around my daughter and I had to tell her multiple times to drop it. My daughter has been very depressed and it's worrying me. I have been giving my wife the cold shoulder and she's being very cold to both me and daughter.

1bghnkw,AITA not asking permission to use hubby's coffee?,"My (28F) husband (37M) is a huge coffee geek. He has a separate set of shelves and equipment for it. I have tried over the years to learn more about his process and how to brew but it just doesn't click for me like it does for him. I always buy instant/go to Starbucks because it's all the same to me. He never says the coffee I've made is bad, just that something is always off. It's too bitter/astringent/weak etc. But thanks me anyway for my efforts.   
My husband is going through a busy time at work and has for the past 2 weeks. He freelances, his latest client turned out to be very difficult and he's had to make a lot of edits for this project. As a result, he's more stressed than usual and is working longer hours. So I thought that if I made him a coffee in the way he likes, that would cheer him up about it all.   
Long story short, he did not like what I brewed. He didn't really have anything nice to say about my gesture and then when he learned what beans I used, he was very annoyed and shut me out of his office without any thanks.   
He had two containers of beans on the shelf. I used the container which was small and finished it. I did not realise it was a rare coffee and processed in a unique way. It cost more than triple the other bag which was mainly full and double the size. I thought that using up the beans in the smaller container made more sense so he can buy himself another bag from his long list of beans he wants. He refuses to ever have more than 2 bags at once so he can appreciate them a lot more (whatever that means).  
He's upset with me because I didn't ask permission and he could have told me which bag to use if I was going to try and make him a coffee. I'm upset with him for his reaction. No thanks and shutting me out of his office. I think the whole permission thing is so gross to me and I shouldn't have to ask whether I can use something in our home.

1bgj5u2,AITA for not being over excited for a coworker coming out?,"AITA for not being over excited for a coworker coming out?  I (married/straight/M34) have worked with Toby (fake name M30) for about 2 years. We don’t hangout outside of work, but interact almost everyday and have always gotten along. One day Toby seemed “off” so I asked “Hey, are you ok? You seem off.” After a pause he looked at me seriously and said “I’m gay…” and then stared at me without saying anything else. I didn’t suspect he was gay, but I knew he didn’t ever talk about SO. I responded “Cool!  Is that a recent development?” And he said “Yes, I’ve only told my family.”  I responded, “That’s cool man! Do you still go by He/him/Toby?” Him “Yes.” Me “Ok, well thanks for feeling comfortable enough to tell me” and we went back to work. 

A few days go by and he had told a few other people. One of those people pulled me aside and told me I hurt Toby’s feelings when he told me first. Toby thought I was dismissive in how I responded and it soured his coming out experience. I’ve interacted with Toby a few times since then and it didn’t feel any different than before. 

I responded the way I did because I didn’t want to make a big deal about it. He’s being who he is and I thought making a big scene out of it would cheapen that. Plus, I have no role in his life outside of work. I don’t want to do anything to make work weird for him or me and I’m not sure if I should do/say something or just leave it alone.

I’ve always gone out of my way to help others, and I take pride in being a good person. My husband (32M) and I have a beautiful relationship built on mutual respect and understanding.  
My late mother left me a precious heirloom, a vintage necklace that has been in our family for generations. It’s not just valuable, but it holds immense sentimental value to me. I’ve always kept it safe and only wore it on special occasions, cherishing the memories it holds.  
Enter my MIL (57F), who has a history of overstepping boundaries. Despite our differences, when she lost her apartment, my husband and I opened our home to her, asking for nothing in return but basic respect for our belongings.  
One day, I came home to find my MIL hosting a tea party with her friends, and to my horror, one of her friends was wearing my mother’s necklace. When I confronted her, my MIL nonchalantly said she gave it away because she thought it was ‘just old jewelry’ and that her friend admired it.  
I was heartbroken and felt utterly betrayed. My husband was equally appalled and supported my decision to ask her to leave. Now, the rest of the family is painting me as the villain, saying I’m overreacting and should forgive her because ‘family is family.’

1bjqegz,WIBTA if I tell my friend her son is not welcome to stay in my house unless he is responsible for himself?,"For context: My (F31) best friend (F31) is a single mom of a 14 year old boy. She has low contact with her parents because they kicked her out when she got pregnant in High School, so she doesn’t have  a big support system. We are really close and  I’ve always done what I could to help her, her son is my nephew, not in blood, but in every way that counts,   
  
She does everything for her son. I mean everything. He doesn’t even pick up his plate from the table after he finishes eating, she does it for him. While I personally don’t think this is a good way to raise a child, I never gave her my opinion, she never asked for it, it’s not my business how she decided to raise her child and I’m not a mom so how can I give parenting advice?  
  
Last week my friend  had to take a 2 business trip and had another one schedule for next week. She asked me if her son could stay at my house the days she is out of town, because she doesn’t feel comfortable leaving him alone in their house. I agreed and he stayed with me for 2 days last week.   
  
The 2 days were a frustrating experience for the both of us because he kept expecting me to do everything for him, including: packing his back for school, picking up his clothes whenever he dropped them, serving him cereal in the morning, washing his dishes, and waking him up in the morning to go to school. He even blamed me because he missed the school bus because I didn’t make sure he woke up after his alarm rang. I heard his alarm and assumed he was awake.   
  
I’m not eager to repeat this experience. I love that child but he is too old for this I think. BesidesI have  a demanding  job. I don't have time or energy to be the maid/babysitter of a teenage boy even if it’s just two days.   
  
I’m thinking about telling my friend that if she wants her son to stay with me next week he has to be responsible for  himself. I can promise to cook him 3 meals a day, and I can make sure he is up for school, but he needs to pick up his own clothes, pack his own bags, and wash his own dishes, Otherwise he cannot stay. I don’t feel this is unreasonable, but I feel kinda bad putting these conditions because she doesn’t have  a big support system, and if I don’t let him stay at my house it’ll be really hard for her to find somewhere else to drop him off.

1blbacm,AITA for calling my mother homophobic for suggesting that my girlfriend ‘fixed me’?,"I (18M) was gay for as long as I can remember. I recently started dating my childhood best friend Lexi (17F). We have been friends since we were 10. 

I haven’t had feelings for a girl before so I’m not even sure what my sexuality is anymore. All I’m sure of is that I really like (possibly) love Lexi.

My parents have always been supportive of my sexuality but my mother has always seemed slightly disappointed. She never said anything about it outright, but you can from certain looks/comments that she made that she would’ve preferred it if i was straight. My father always told me not to pay it any attention because at the end of the day, she still loved me and needed time to adjust. He also said that she wanted life to be easy for me and that being gay made my life more complicated.

My mother loves Lexi and before I came out, she always made comments about it Lexi and I being together in the future. Even after I came out, she’d insist on me keeping my room door open when Lexi was over because ‘anything can happen if a boy and a girl are alone together, it’s natural!’. 

Anyway, Lexi was over at my house last weekend and my mother kept commenting on how we were ‘soulmates’ or about how we were such an adorable couple. After I got back from driving her home, my mother was grilling me about our relationship (how long I had liked her, how long we were dating etc). When I was finally released from the hot seat, she made a comment about how all I needed was the right girl. I asked her to elaborate and she said that my being gay was just phase and all I needed was for the right girl to come along.

I got pretty irritated after that and said she was being homophobic. We got into a massive argument. Now, my older sister thinks I was being an asshole because I know that my mother isn’t homophobic and that she’s from a different generation so things she’s saying are outdated, not homophobic. I feel bad now. AITA?

1blbtmp,AITA for being relieved when I found my friend was not adopting a child?,"Context: Randy (41M) and I (35M) have been friends since we took college courses together, same major and later finding out we lived in the same city but never met before. We've been through a lot as friends and have always had eachother's backs

After moving back to our hometown, we started a social group of about 15, then it grew and grew until we could fill an entire section of a bar and/or restaurant. Slowly but surely, people ended up not attending the outings as often when started having kids. Understandable. I loved our outings as I started drinking socially, never getting drunk. As far as I knew, Randy was also childfree and said when parenthood came ringing for them he'd say ""Another one bites the dust"" I'd reply ""Maybe we'll see them in five years""

Two months ago, I saw a post on Randy's facebook saying he was adopting a 1 and a half year old. It threw me for a loop because he'd never talked about wanting to be a Father or a burning desire. I was in a tailspin thinking ""Oh God, another one"" as my social circle has narrowed as they've had kids 

One month goes by and I see another post from Randy. He's a proud Dad

Of a dog. I was sooo relieved! I felt like I could howl at the moon because I wouldn't lose one of my favorite people to the parenthood Portal. 

Onto the conflict: At another one of our hangouts, Randy had shown his dog's picture to a bunch of oohs and ahhs and stories relating to their dogs' odd quirks. I said ""My heart lept when I realized he adopted a dog and not a kid, I was afraid I wasn't going to see him for at least five years"" We laughed, but Randy was a bit quiet. We finished our food and left. 

As we walked to our cars, Randy later told me I was a AH for being relieved he's a dog dad than a human dad and why was I so concerned about it? I told him that as I go on in life, it's hard to find non parents/childfree friends and I'm all for people doing what they want to do in life 

Randy asked why does that matter? I said I would've had to get used to a new reality with him as a Dad if he decided to have a kid and he knows exactly what that means. He's seen what happens with our parent friends we don't see unless it's at an event for their kid.  

Some of our mutuals are on my side saying I wasn't exactly wrong but I didn't have to say it like that. Others are on his side saying that I was wrong for saying I was relieved he was getting a dog rather than a child

1blczql,AITA for not getting my “stepdaughter” a present?,"I (F40) got married to my ex-husband, James (M43), three years ago. He had a daughter, Annabel (F13) from a previous marriage. For background purposes, Annabel has next to no contact with her bio mother. She left when Annabel was two, and apart from the occasional birthday card, there’s no contact there.

I’ve known Annabel since she was nine, and we had a good relationship, especially in the absence of a maternal figure in her life. I never had children of my own and never intended to, but was surprised that I was fine with being in a relationship with someone with a child.

James, Annabel, and I lived together for four years in what you could consider the “normal” nuclear family. However, my relationship with James just got more and more strained. We were constantly arguing and bickering about really pointless things and the atmosphere in the house was sour. Annabel could tell and she became more withdrawn. Eventually, I told James I was leaving because I wasn’t happy in the house or the relationship. He was livid, swearing and shouting, saying that he didn’t want to see me again. I left and went to live with my sister until I found somewhere of my own.

This happened about three months ago, and I haven’t had any contact with James since then, other than to collect some things from the house. I asked how Annabel was, and he said she was fine, but didn’t really expand upon that. 

However, last week, I received an angry call from James saying how selfish and immature I’d been my not getting Annabel a birthday present. I knew it was her birthday but decided not to and haven’t tried to maintain a relationship with her because of the tension with James. James said how upset she was and that he couldn’t believe I put relationship issues over a 13 year old girl, who I knew didn’t have a mother. I told him he was being ridiculous and that if he wanted to cut me out of his life completely, that includes his daughter.

He said I was an asshole and a small gift or card would have meant the world to Annabel, before hanging up the phone. 

I sent Annabel a happy birthday text (the day after her birthday as the call was late), but she hasn’t responded.

She’s a sweet 14 year old shih tzu/poodle. She’s having joint issues, so when we take her on a city trip, we put her in a dog stroller so we can walk around. 

So we were navigating a busy sidewalk and this woman, her friend, and their kids, there were at least 4 kids—this woman points at our dog in the stroller and says “oh hell no.” She starts laughing, pulls her friend over, and they and their kids surround the stroller. The woman goes “are you for real? This is not a child. These are children.” Pointing at her kids. As if I was cosplaying a parent by having my dog in a stroller. I am child free by choice and parents like this are so rude. It’s like the world revolves around their kids, and how dare I put my old dog in a stroller. Strollers are for kids only! 

So I told her to F off and get out of my way and pushed the stroller forward to move on. She then starts yelling how dare i cuss in front of her kids. I kept walking and she left us alone, but it ruined my day and I can’t stop thinking about it. I think she’s an asshole, but was I wrong to “swear” in front of her kids? I was pissed off.

1bm5c92,AITA for refusing to wear an awful bridesmaid dress to my sister's wedding?,"My (Jane, 25/F) sister Lisa (27/F) is planning her wedding. She's detail-oriented, has a preference about everything, and wants it all to look perfect. Part of her plan is for all six of her bridesmaids to wear the same dress in the same color, and we knew that going in to shop with her at a boutique. Unfortunately, the other five are much smaller than I am, so picking out a dress that fit us all became an issue.

&nbsp;

We all tried on her favorite dress at the end, and it took me a long time to get it on. Outside I could hear her squealing with happiness as everyone else walked out of their rooms, and saying things like ""This is the one!"" with her friends hyping it up. But not only is it a horrible pale color that makes me look sick, it's unflattering to the point where I have massive rolls in the back and look pregnant in the front, especially with shape wear, which just bulges everything out across my hips and pinches the fabric up the sides. I also can't move well in it, and can't raise my arms more than halfway.

&nbsp;

I tried to talk to Lisa about finding a similar dress that could work better for my body type, but she and the other bridesmaids insisted that this was the perfect color and dress. Lisa was dead set on everyone matching exactly and seemed locked in on it, so we ended up (quietly) arguing in the store in front of our mom and the sales associate who came to check on us. They tried to calm things down by saying the dress looked fine and everyone matched nicely, but it was pretty clear they were just trying to keep the peace. When I asked the sales associate, ""Does this dress looks fine *on me?*""  her face turned red and she started talking about how it was important to honor Lisa's wishes on her special day, and at that point I hurried up to change and left. 

&nbsp;

Since then, Lisa and I haven't talked, while both my parents insist that I need to suck it up and do what Lisa wants for her wedding, while also relaying that she's been really upset about this issue, but I have been as well.

1bm6875,AITA for telling my mom that she's doesn't get to make the rules?,"I (17M) live with my three brothers (15M, 13M, 10M), and my ma (40F). We're not very well off. I pay almost half the rent, I pay for groceries more often than not, and I juggle having a job, going to school, and raising these three kids, one of whom is disabled.

I say raising, because my ma, between having two jobs and basically never being home, doesn't contribute. She's gone by 8am, and usually not back before 10 or 11pm. In the past year, she's been home even less, getting home later and later. I'm pretty sure she goes out drinking.

The fight went like this: My ma came home last night a bit before 9pm for once, instead of 11 or later as she's been doing. 15M came out of his room to say hi, and 13M was already on the couch reading something for school, so she hugged both of them, and said hi, and said she'd stopped by the gas station to buy us all something and gave us all a candy bar, which was cool of her. Then, she asked where 10M was, because she wanted to say hi to him.

Now, I've practically raised these kids on my own for years now. And I do my best. On the very rare occasion my mom comes home early, she usually just goes to bed.

I have 10M go to bed at 8pm, which I don't think is unreasonable, and I let the other two stay up until 10pm, because they're older. We all eat dinner at 6, get home from school around 4, and have a pretty clean routine altogether.

Now, my ma was asking where he was, so I told her he was asleep. She asked why, so I told her it's past his bedtime. She told me he didn't have to go to bed that early. I told her he did. She told me no he didn't, she'd said we could all stay up until 10. 

I said that doesn't work, and she told me she's the parent, and it does work. And then she said it's not my place to micromanage the other three. she said, her kids, her house, her rules. And then she exploded, that I could stop being such a control- freak, because it wasn't my place to do that, or to have signed up 13M for soccer, or to have repainted the fence, or to have taken 10M to the doctor some weeks ago, or any of the things I've been doing without asking her.

I told her, it's also my house, I pay a lot of rent, and they're basically my kids, because she's never around, so it's more my house, my rules, if we wanna play that game. I told her she wouldn't know what works for 10M, because she's too busy to know him. I told her I might ask for her input if she was ever around, but she never is, so I don't give a shit how she thinks I should raise these kids, and she doesn't get to have a say in it. Not anymore.

She broke down crying, called me ungrateful ""for all that she does"" said she ""doesn't know where she went wrong"" and left the room. She either went to her room or she fucked off and left the house, idk and idc. She's an adult, it's her life. 13M said I'm a dick for making her cry, and 15M left the room a minute later, saying he was going to bed.

Anyway, last week was my daughter’s Spring Break and on a whim we decided to take a last minute trip to Las Vegas.

But right before we left it popped in my mind that doing a vow renewal elopement style would be fun (in the spirit with the last minute nature of our trip). I grabbed a white shirt, a light up plastic ring, a janky bouquet of faux roses, and a dress up tiara for our daughter (the flower girl). I found the absolute cheapest, cheesiest vow renewal package ($69 lol) and we went ahead and said “I still do!” after about a 3 minute ceremony.

It was just something fun for us and we didn’t tell anyone ahead of time or make an announcement of any kind afterward because it was *just fu*n. It was our 8-year-old who went around announcing to everyone (including people on the sidewalk…grocery store…at school) that her parents FINALLY got married. She doesn’t really realize (or care about) the difference between a wedding and a vow renewal so we got some side eye from people we know thinking we’d been lying all this time about being married. Fun times.

My daughter told her cousins and my sister that we got married on our trip. My sister was the Maid of Honor in our real wedding so, obviously, she got that it was a vow renewal. She didn’t say anything in front of the kids but gave me a super fake smile and laugh when she heard. When we had a moment with the kids out of ear shot, she let me have it. She told me it was completely hurtful and inconsiderate for my husband and I to do a vow renewal while she is in the middle of a divorce. Mind you, her divorce has been in the works for 6 months with no end in sight. She told me our vow renewal was “rubbing our marriage in her face” and said we should either have not done the vow renewal or kept it a secret. She hasn’t spoken to me since and this was almost a week ago.

My mom is a people pleaser and refuses to take a side on this one. My friends think my sister is nuts to be mad about it (but maybe they’re biased because they’re *m*y friends!?). And my husband stopped caring about what she thinks/says years ago. We are not close with my dad at all so me, my sister, and my mom are all the close (nuclear) family we have. I don’t want this to become an issue because it was mostly just silly joke decided on last minute. I’m thinking about apologizing to my sister for making her feel bad and just trying to move on. But part of me is refusing to do that because I think she’s being ridiculous. So, kind friends, please tell me, AITA!?

TLDR: my sister says my Las Vegas elopement style vow renewal was inconsiderate because she is going through a divorce.

1bmwmu8,WIBTA For not abiding by the bride’s rules?,"WIBTA? I (36) female, am attending one of my best friend’s weddings in a few weeks in Mexico. She lives in Ohio, her family live in New York, and I live in Europe. She’s chosen Mexico for her wedding as it’s less expensive for her, and she thinks it can be a nice vacation for everyone attending. 

I was out of work for a few months this year and am actively trying to save to buy a house. Money is tight and going to the wedding is costing me thousands of dollars. I’ve made my peace with that and am genuinely looking forward to the wedding and the vacation. 

Today, the bride told me that she’s picked a very specific theme for the bachelorette party - one that would require me to buy something new or borrow something. I’m struggling to spend more money on this wedding so buying something, even second hand, is off the table. Borrowing something is tricky because I’m not the same size as any of my friends and I worry I couldn’t replace something if I ruined it. 

So, WIBTA if I just wore something I felt comfortable in for the bachelorette party?

Extra info. She picked a specific dress for the bridesmaids for the actual wedding which she paid 30% of and I paid the rest. It’s also not something I feel comfortable in (as it shows a lot of skin) but for the wedding it’s her day.

1bmybct,AITA for not inviting my ex best friend to my wedding even though I was the MOH at hers?,"I (31F) had a friend Maria (31F) growing up. We met when we were about 8 or 9, and quickly became best friends. We started slowly growing apart in high school as our schedules changed and almost completely lost touch during college. By the time we were \~23, we only saw each other once a year at Christmas for our old friend group’s Christmas dinner.  


Maria got engaged to her high school sweetheart and asked me to be her maid of honor in the wedding. At the time she asked me, we had not seen or spoken to each other in almost 2 years, so it honestly shocked me when she asked, but I agreed. She asked me about a year before the wedding, and after she asked me to be MOH, she did not speak to me again for 6 months. I had taken it to mean maybe she wanted to rekindle our friendship and reached out a few times during those 6 months to meet up for lunch or hang out, but she never responded.  


When she finally texted me, it was to meet up with her and her best friend (one of the bridesmaids) to pick out the dresses for the bridal party. She showed up 3 HOURS LATE. Apparently, she and her friend decided to meet up for lunch and to hang out before meeting me at the mall, completely ignoring our agreed upon time and the fact that I had already said I was there and waiting for them. I’m not going to go into details of the next 6 months leading up to the wedding, but that should give you an idea of how it went. By the time the wedding day came, I genuinely felt so used and disrespected. On the day of the wedding, Maria was just mean. I waited until the speeches and the first dance were over, then I left the reception and went home. I have not spoken to her since.  


It's been about 4 years since her wedding, and I am now engaged and getting married in 2 months. I did not invite Maria or any of our old friend group. In my mind, our friendship is well and truly dead. Apparently, Maria ran into my sister at a store and were chatting and my sister mentioned the wedding. Maria texted me (honestly shocked she still has my number) to send me her address “so I knew where to send her invitation” and I just responded “thank you, but the guest list is already set. have a nice day”. She told the friend group and now they’re all blowing up my phone about inviting them ‘for old time’s sake’ and that I owe at least Maria an invitation because I was her MOH. They’ve been posting on social media and now even my mom is getting involved, saying I should invite them all just to keep the peace and out of respect for our old friendship.

  
My argument is that I haven’t spoken to them in years, and I don’t care about this ‘wedding etiquette’ thing and I don’t owe her an invitation just because I was her MOH, especially considering everything that happened with her wedding. But literally only my fiancé is on my side. So, AITA?

She says ""So it's strictly professional, not for datin"" I say ""No I don't think my wife would like that"" and laugh. At this point, I totally forgot that one of my coworkers is open about being in a polyamorous relationship. 

That coworker took me aside later and said I should have been more careful since it seemed like I was mocking her lifestyle and 'promoting monogamy'.

1bpgq11,AITA for not wanting to dump $15k on my sister's 50th birthday celebration? ,"AITA for not wanting to dump $15k on my sister's 50th birthday? 

So, I am doing fine in life financially but my sister is like on another level, way richer than me. She paid for her house x10 what I paid for mine, no exaggerating. She is very family oriented and enjoys family reunions, even when they end badly or hurting people's feelings. Both our parents passed away some years ago. So family reunions are the siblings getting together with their respective families. 

1.5 years ago she announced that she wanted to do something special for her birthday: she gave me notice, basically, that she wanted to have a family reunion at a posh European location for at least a week (she and her family are exploring Europe for 6 weeks prior to the actual party). I told her I was going to try to go. I did not have the courage to tell her that for me it would be difficult, just financially speaking. Bringing my whole family (I have many kids) on this trip was going to cost me no less than 15k. Just airfare alone would be close to 10k. 15k is one year of tuition (my oldest is a Junior) and I have other money stuff to think about too. So, when a thing from work created a conflict, I was relieved to have an excuse to cancel. 
She was super disappointed, particularly because she had made it very clear how important this trip was to her. If it had mattered to me, she said, I would have made the trip happen. So, I guess IATA. 
But, AITA for not wanting to shell out 1 year worth of tuition $ in a one-week ""special birthday celebration"" for my rich sister?

1bq9tze,AITA for refusing to take any responsibility for my dog until my wife was forced to rehome him?,"I am going to lay this out of n the most basic way I can. 

I work from home. As does my wife. She wanted a dog. I said we did not have enough time to take care of a dog. She pestered me until I agreed. We took our time and found a rescue that had several pups that met our criteria. Small. Adult. Requiring just a couple of short walks a day. They did home visits and stuff. 

It was taking a while. During that time my wife found a farm that had working Blue Heeler X Border Collie pups. She got me one for my birthday. I had one just like her when I lived at home with my parents. 

She is a beautiful puppy but not in any way what we agreed on. We live in an apartment with no yard. My parents have an acreage. I a very busy. I do not have time for all the training and exercise that she needs.  I told my wife thanks but no thanks. She refused to listen to me. 

So I just refused to bond with the pup. I didn't even name her. I told my wife I would make sure that the pup was fed and got two half hour walks a day since that's what we agreed on. Everything else was on her. 

It took two weeks o barking, chewing, and pooping until she rehomed the pup. Now she is mad that I manipulated her into doing what I said we should do to begin with. She said she thought I would love a puppy that was like my old one. IF WE HAD THE SPACE AND TIME FOR HER I WOULD HAVE. I am pissed that I had to even do it. I feel bad for the dog.

1br0k7o,AITA for forcing my partner to see a musical with me?,"My partner (27m) is not a fan of musicals. He doesn't ""hate"" them so much as is just isn't something he would choose to do. My family and I (26f) love musicals and they were a big part of my childhood growing up.

We moved to London not that long ago, and as a going away present my Mum bought us tickets for the Back to the Future musical. This is a really nice gift since they aren't cheap.

I assumed by boyfriend would be fine to go with me, but now he is refusing, saying that he would rather just stay home, and he doesn't even like musicals anyway. He argues that I could just take someone else.

The issue is that I have not been in London long, and don't really have many friends here yet. I'm also quite a shy person, so asking someone I don't know that well to see a show with me is a bit anxiety inducing. Plus, it was something my Mum got for us to go and see together as I had told her previously that it was one of my partner's favourite movies.

I'm really annoyed at my partner for this, because the tickets have already been paid for, and I was hoping that even if he wasn't a huge musical fan he could suck it up for me. My options now are to either go by myself, not go at all, or force him to go with me (which he has complained bitterly about).

1br32ip,AITA for not removing my ‘inappropriate’ bathroom mat for when my mother came over?,"I (24M) recently got married and one of the homewarming gifts i received from my dad (45M) is a bath mat that says ‘GET NAKED’ on it. It’s hilarious and it’s proudly displayed in the bathroom. My wife finds it hilarious too because she appreciates the close relationship i have with my father.

As you can tell, my dad had me pretty young and we have a very close relationship. He bought me the house i share with my wife Bia (24F) and he is the coolest parent ever. We get eachother silly gifts all the time and it’s the way our relationship works. 

He raised me by himself until he met my stepmother (i call her mom but for the purpose of the post I’ll call her stepmother) when I was six. He was technically with my biological mother until I was four but she was neglectful and abusive hence why he did all the child care himself. I’ve been trying to rekindle the relationship with her since I was 14 but it’s gone bust multiple times. We’ve been consistently in contact for the past three years and we are slowly making improvements although there is a long way to go. 

At my wedding, we had a mother son dance alongside the father daughter dance and I danced with my stepmother instead of my biological mother. No one was shocked by this besides my biological mother. 

She was really hurt by this so I’ve begun to put a bit more effort into our relationship. I’m not going to hold her actions from 20 odd years ago against her anymore when she’s being apologetic and has done the work to improve herself. My stepmother is fiercely protective over me and even she admits my bio mother is making a lot of progress. 

My bio mother is also very religious and conservative. She came over to my house for the first time and saw the mat. I knew it may have been an issue with her but thought that she wouldn’t comment on it. She tried to tell me it was sinful and that i should remove it and when i told her it was from my dad, she said it was childish of him to give me something like that. Her main thing against my dad is to call him childish because he’s younger than her by 3 years (i think, not even sure how old she is tbh) and apparently the mat was another iteration of his inability to grow up. FYI, he is a successful doctor with five more children that are being raised perfectly, I can’t even call them demon younger siblings because they are angels. 

I told her that I was going to remove the mat just because she was at my house, she said it was inconsiderate, we argued and she left. 

My wife thinks that she was over reacting although my friends said i should’ve removed it because most older people aren’t as chill as my parents (dad and step mom) so i should’ve anticipated her reaction. She is mad at me now and thinks that i don’t care about rekindling our relationship. AITA?

1bsmeyn,AITA for telling my roommate's girlfriend that she needs to leave?,"I live in an on campus apartment with a roommate. I pay a reduced rent but I work for the school so I'm getting shit pay and still pay a decent amount of my paycheck for rent. Only me and my roommate are on our lease, however it's not uncommon for my roommate's girlfriend to stay with us for a while. As in multiple weeks at a time. So much that it's caused a noticeable increase in our power and water bill. It also causes a hassle when getting ready. She obviously takes super long in the shower and bathroom, uses all the hot water and leaves hair in the sink and shower which I refuse to clean. 

All of this has lead me to feel that she needs to go. I have a pretty busy schedule so I rarely see my roommate with enough freetime to tell him to kick her out, but I do see her pretty often. Yesterday, I got done at the gym and came home to shower before work and she was in the bathroom. I told her I needed to get ready for work and she said she wouldn't be too long. 

I ended up going back to the gym to shower and was late to work waiting on her. I get home and my roommate is now at work and she's in the living room. I tell her that she needs to get her own place to live. I said I cannot deal with another person here, she lives here for free and I don't want her her so she needs to get out by the morning. 

At around 11 I am woken up by my roommate yelling at me and calling me a bully for what I did and accused me of being jealous since I don't have a girlfriend.

1bsniht,AITA For not specifying that my sibling is a man?,"My older brothers name is Viktor but no one has ever called him that. Ever. Everyone calls him Vik. I call him Vikky, something I started as a kid. He's like ten years older than me, doesn't live at home, yada yada.

Anyway we're going on our family vacation in a week. I was allowed to invite a friend. I invited a friend from my dance class - we've gotten pretty close recently. I told her we'd be sharing a room with Vik. She was fine and we started planning our trip.

Anyway yesterday my friend came over - she's never met Vik, obviously, and our parents wanted her to meet him before we fly because he'll basically be responsible for us (our parents pair the kids off so they get to relax).

When she got introduced to him she immediately, like, freaked out, and told me she no longer wanted to go and got her parents to tale her straight back home. I was obviously upset and I didn't know what had happened.

She called me later and said shebwas upset because I'd never told her Vik is a man. I was confused because like, yeah, I'd never outright called him a man but I've definitely called him ""he"" before and referred to him as my brother.

I said this to her and she told me she never called me call him ""he"" (blamed my accent) and that she assumed ""brother"" meant my other brothers (I have seven).

She told me she doesn't feel comfortable sharing a room with a grown man for a week and no longer wants to come. I'm really, really upset, but feel like if it was that big of a deal for her she should have asked?

I told her she was being unreasonable. Like, fair enough she shouldn't go if she's uncomfortable, but it's not my fault she didn't ask. She thinks I should have been upfront about it.

My parents think I'm being mean, my brothers are divided. So AITA?

One of my friends, Nora (28F) has a 4 year old son (Jack) that is notorious for being naughty. Jack doesn't get along with other kids and is a constant source of crying and screaming. Nora brought Jack over. He said he wanted to take a nap so I showed Nora the guest room and told her to make herself comfortable. Nora came back downstairs after a while and we hung out.

Now, around 40 minutes later Jack came back down and was smiling like crazy. He had my wife's  (Kate - 29F) wedding ring. Kate is a doctor and doesn't take her ring to work. She leaves it on our nightstand. Jack had clearly gone into our bedroom. 

I told Nora I'd like him to give the ring back. Nora said he'd just get bored with it now and that I needed to relax. A few minutes later I asked Jack to please give the ring back. This triggered something because he ran to the window and threw the ring out in our spacious backyard. 

I got really, really mad. Kate adores her ring, and I had it custom made with many little touches. I told Nora her godd##n son had no manners and she needed to do something about him, maybe take him to a doctor because this is not healthy kid behavior. She got very upset and left. Other guests started leaving too.

Kate and I spent the entire evening looking for it but we couldn't find it. I am a crying mess, Kate keeps saying it's nothing but I know how much she loves that ring. Despite all this every mom in our friend group is calling me an AH for taking it too hard on Jack and Nora. Was I an AH?

1bubgh7,UPDATE - Brother of the bride’s girlfriend lost it on me and got dropped from the wedding party as a result,"So, I saw a lot of people saying they wanted an update and people were really kind offering advice so thought I would provide some closure on this saga. 

I decided that it would be best to speak to Jane and confirm how she wanted to play it. I told her as much as I don’t want to deal with Kathy I’m not seriously going to stick to the ultimatum. Jane said she is definitely not having Kathy as a bridesmaid, and that she’s sorry it even came to me having to say that. We agreed that Jane would handle any questions about Kathy and say that it wasn’t about my ultimatum. 

On Jane and the bridesmaid thing, a lot of people were saying her aesthetic choice didn’t make sense, and you were partially correct. She admitted she mostly just didn’t want Elliot and Kathy to be photographed together. i told her she’s a complete moron (affectionately) for not telling me because we could have prepared this better. 

Elliot and I also met up to talk. 

He explained that Kathy has a bad relationship with her family, that’s why she was really hoping to bond with his. He also said she has a lot of insecurities and that she projected a lot of these issues onto me. As for why, he shed some light on this, too. Elliot’s best friend (my family by marriage) shared some things with her and kind of over-egged some stories and it set Kathy on this path of thinking I was Regina George, basically. Elliot has tried to correct her but she won’t hear it.

As for her thinking I’m trying to “steal” him, some of you were right. She does think that my hanging out with his family means I must not dislike him as much as I say. She thinks because I have a history of dating people close to him (two people years apart) that I must secretly like him. Elliot agrees this is crazy but Kathy just won’t let go of this idea. 

As for us walking together, I said I would support him asking Jane if he could walk with another bridesmaid but that if she insists, I’m going to be on her side and Elliot agreed that was fair. 

He said he’s been trying to be understanding of her issues but he sees now it was wrong to force the bridesmaid issue and he’s going to focus on helping Kathy in a way that doesn’t involve everyone else from now on. I left it there in regards to Kathy because it’s not my place to comment. 

Our conversation actually turned out to be pretty productive, elliot and I aired out a lot of things from when we were kids that I guess were overdue a conversation. We’ll never be best friends but we are getting a joint Father’s Day gift for his dad so that’s something. 

I’m still going to be as civil to Kathy because honestly she clearly has a lot bigger issues than whatever issues she has with me and adding to it just seems pointless. 

That’s that. All’s well that ends…decently, all things considered. We will definitely be watching her for any drama at the wedding but for now that’s it.

1buc68g,AITA for laughing when my MIL and SIL got chewed out by my fiance?,"This is completely stupid and if nothing else might give y'all a good laugh too. 

I (27m) am getting married to my fiancee (26f) later this year. She's an incredible woman and I'm the luckiest man alive to have her in my life. Unfortunately, she comes attached to a very entitled and self absorbed family. I genuinely don't know how my fiancee ended up as amazing as she is with these people around. The main players in this conflict are my MIL (53f) and SIL (24f) to be. When my fiance and I announced our engagement last year SIL had a complete breakdown, throwing a full on tantrum that she deserved to get married first and my fiancee should be forced to wait. I was so confused by this reaction, but my fiancee just looked bored, which confused me even more. Apparently her sister does this a lot when she feels she deserves something more than my fiance. MIL took SIL’s side saying that dating wasn't as easy for her. My fiancee always tells them off for being annoying and ridiculous and they hate it, which is kind of funny to me. So here's where I need some help.

Three weeks ago I got into a nasty car crash and my left leg is broken in multiple places. The doctors say I'll likely have a permanent limp even after I heal because of how bad the injury is and might even need a cane. My fiancee is an absolute angel and has been by my side every step of the way. I'm going to need a couple different surgeries and some serious physical therapy before I can properly walk again, and she's been pushing my wheelchair since I got home. MIL and SIL stopped by yesterday and that's where the trouble is. SIL asked my fiancee when she would be leaving me. Flat out, while I was in the room. MIL also chimed in saying a wheelchair or cane would look horrible in wedding pictures so it would be best for her to cancel and leave. I was horrified. I didn't even get to open my mouth before my fiancee went absolutely ballistic at her mom and sister. She told them that they were delusional if they believed she was that shallow. She kicked them out almost immediately saying she was done and over their BS. They both looked like they sucked on extra sour lemons. I couldn't help laughing at their expressions. This was apparently what did it for them and they both huffed off still insisting they were just looking out for my fiancee. I laughed for a solid couple minutes before calming down. My fiancee just looked so exhausted so we had some cheer up snuggles.

I've been getting messages from SIL all day saying that me laughing at them wanting my fiancee to not have to spend the rest of her life looking after me was completely uncalled for and I'm an AH. She makes it sound like I'm completely paralyzed and I'll need 24/7 care until I die. I don't think I did anything wrong but what do you guys think? Should I have kept my laughter to myself? AITA?

Update: Hey y'all. This thing got a lot more attention than I thought it would considering how dumb the whole situation is. But I'm actually glad it did, because I've been reading the comments with my fiancee and we're both seeing how fucked up her mom and sister's behavior actually is. She said she hadn't even thought about going no contact since she was just so used to their BS, but now we're really talking about pulling the trigger. MIL and SIL have also officially been uninvited from the wedding, which they did not take well, especially MIL. SIL is blocked on my phone now, but her and MIL still message my fiancee. It's a little hard for her to block them completely just yet, but we'll keep working on it. 

And for those of you who've asked where the FIL was during all this, I don't actually know. He divorced MIL a long time ago and doesn't have contact with her or his daughters anymore. My fiancee says she doesn't care or miss him because he was just as bad as MIL and SIL. 

Lastly for those asking, yes I absolutely did spoil my fiancee later after they left. I already mentioned snuggles, but we also got her favorite take out and binged this new show she's been wanting to check out. It was actually really good. We can't do much bedroom wise right now, but I promise if I could I would have. I'm not sure if I'll update again. Maybe if something significant happens. But until then, I have a surgery to prep for in the next two weeks.

1bw10xk,AITA for telling my daughter she knows nothing?,"I (41F) have a daughter who is 17, and her father and I divorced when she was 7. We had a very rocky marriage, during which I was a stay-at-home mom, and I struggled a lot financially afterwards. Because of this, during our divorce, my ex-husband and I agreed that our daughter would live mainly with him and I received alimony payments from him for about 4 years after our divorce.

For the first several years after the divorce, my daughter would stay with me every other weekend and several holidays (the specific holidays depending on the year), and I always enjoyed our time together, but it would often feel like she didn’t want to see me. She was never interested in any activities or occasions that I planned for us and normally when I called to talk to her, she would be busy with school, an extracurricular activity, or something else.

Usually when she would spend the night with me, she’d ask about the divorce and why her father and I aren't together anymore. I always tried to be as honest as possible with her but I could tell the divorce had been hard for her and when she started high school she stopped visiting altogether.

She and I have been low contact for the past few years, and this past weekend we had an argument regarding her graduation. She’s graduating from high school this June, and I texted her to ask about the details. She responded with a very passive aggressive text asking if I would actually come and how she didn’t want to waste a ticket.

I wasn’t sure where it was coming from, so I called her and she started ranting about how I was never around, and that I always blamed her father for everything, and how I cared about my students more than her (I’m a high school teacher). I interrupted her and told her that she knows nothing about what happened between her father and I.

I told her that she made her choice to stop visiting and not to answer when I call her and that she couldn’t blame anyone else for that and she hung up. About an hour later she sent me a long text about how much I hurt her and that she didn’t want me at her graduation and that I “needed to change”.

Since that night, I’ve gotten several messages from my ex-husband’s family about how I’m a terrible mother and how I should’ve been more involved when my daughter was younger, and I’m not sure how to handle this.

1bwuexr,WIBTA if I don’t let my husbands female friend stay with us for a few days while she’s grieving,"Husband (32m) and I(27f) have been together 3 years and to preface this post, he has never given me reason to doubt him. He works remotely while I work in person M-F and don’t get home until 6:30-7ish pm most days. Earlier today, he texted me saying he spoke to an old friend (33f apparently) of his because she moved to a city 3 hours from us and after hearing about the things that happened in her life recently, invited her to come stay with us for a few days. 

He told me that both her parents and her brother passed away within a few months of each other recently (around a year ago) and she only has a sister left as part of her family now who she’s away from atm. She also recently broke up with her BF who she had been dating for a few years, not sure who broke up with whom. He said she seemed very distraught during their phone call and he didn’t really know what to say or how to console her, that he felt really bad for her, especially because she’s mostly alone now. She said she was off from Thursday to Sunday next week so he invited her to come and stay with us for that time.

This woman used to be his coworker at the first job he worked, probably more than 8 years ago now. I know and have met most of his friends but this is the first time I’m hearing of her, but it might be understandable because I haven’t met people he knew from 8 years ago unless they live close by. What I think really pissed me off was that he didn’t ask me if it would be okay, more or less just gave me a heads up that he invited her. I’m normally all for helping a friend out in a time of need but i expected him to ask me and make sure I’m okay with it before inviting someone over like that. I’m not comfortable with a female friend of his being in the house alone with him for a few days while I’m not around for most of the day. I don’t know this person or what they’re thinking so while I trust my husband, I don’t trust her. Grief and loss also makes you act in ways you might not normally act in and the fact that she had a recent breakup isn’t comforting either so I feel like letting this happen would be like inviting trouble into my marriage. I also know for a fact that if something inappropriate happened, even if she initiated it and my husband shut it down, I would lose trust in him for bringing this situation about despite me not being okay with it.

1bxo3yx,AITA for defending my son for using a different language when he was upset during an argument at kindergarten?,"I (36F) have been married to my wonderful wife (Anna - 35F) for the past 10 years. We have a 5 year old son, Liam.

Anna and I both work during the day so Liam spends the time until one of us can pick him up at his kindergarten. The other day, Liam's teacher called me and said they would appreciate if we both were available when we picked him up, because he had gotten in an argument and they wanted to talk to us.

Initially I was worried so I moved a few of my meetings and called my wife. We both went to pick him up. The whole issue was he had gotten in an argument with a girl over the rules of a game they were playing. The teacher said as he got angry, he started speaking in a different language, and no one could understand what he was on about. The other kid's parents said it was offensive to speak in a way that no one understood and we should have taught him better.

Now, I am a Greek woman, my wife is French. We live in an English-speaking country. While Liam can certainly speak English, he occasionally uses Greek and French. Both Anna and I learned each other's languages so our household is a mix of all three at different times. He picked up on both of them and can speak them more or less.

I said we have clearly taught him well since he has been able to speak in other languages fluently this whole time but only slipped when he was frustrated during an argument. I said it was in no way offensive, that it was human reaction, and that Liam would surely get it under his full control over time but he is FIVE now so maybe we all should take a deep breath.

The other kid's parents were extremely mad saying their daughter was so upset she cried after the argument and that Liam had to apologise about making her feel this frustration via using another language. My wife answered them with the same overall point as I did but they didn't back down. Even the teacher said we had to work on Liam not making this a recurring theme which is fair.

After the meeting was over and we were going to drive away, the other kid's dad made a comment along the lines of 'you're all arrogant rich people driving cars like this and thinking whatever you're doing is right.' In front of the kids. I got really mad and said I hope you're a better parent than what I'm guessing you are. 

After we went home, Anna and I did tell Liam to not speak to othet peoole in a language they don't understand. Later we talked among ourselves and wondered if we really did escalate the whole argument even more. I am asking on behalf of both us. Were we TA?

1bxq7o4,AITA for sending my parents a picture of the Biblical Rebeccah every time they try to get in touch with me?,"I'm a 19 year old woman currently in college. I come from a churchy family, and there was a big fight two years ago when I decided to get a septum piercing and a nose ring. My parents thought it was trashy and whore-ish, and that only awful people get piercings like that and display them for everyone.   


I'm not really religious, but I've read a lot of the Bible, and in one of the fights I pointed out that the Biblical Matriarch Rebeccah, the wife of Isaac, wore a nose ring. (Strictly speaking, it's not 100% textually clear that she did; but when Eliezer gives her one and some bracelets in Genesis 24:22, and a few verses later  her brother notices her with the jewelry, and the bracelets are explicitly being worn, I think the reading is much more natural that she just put the jewelry on) And if they're really all about me being godly and following the teachings of the Bible, there shouldn't be any problems with me having a nose ring.  


That did not persuade them, and things have been a bit chilly since then, although the distance when I went off to university has helped some. Still, my folks have reached out on several occasions, once every other month or so, and most of the time, I'll respond, but usually send back pictures of some sort of image of Rebeccah in an icon or something. I have not come home in person since I went off to study.  


This morning, my uncle called up. I've gotten along better with him than most of my family, and he asked when I was going to stop being 'childish'. And that while I have every right to keep my distance from my family, I should either say I don't want to have much contact and stick to it, or push for a reconciliation. And that sending passive-aggressive and catty pictures like this was just stirring up trouble for no actual benefit, and that I should stop. I have a lot of respect for my uncle's opinions, and maybe I shouldn't keep this going. 

&#x200B;

On the other hand, my parents make me so steamed about making such a big deal over such a minor thing, and they still have never actually admitted they've done anything wrong, just that they're sorry it created a rift between us.

1byh2ul,AITA for siding with my stepson over my wife about her being too overprotective?,"Quick backstory to this. I (42M) am married to a 54F (we’ll call her Janet) and she has a 35M son from her first marriage (we’ll call him Paul). Naturally, Janet had her son young and got married young. I’m closer in age to Paul than I am my wife, but I try to be a better father to him than his father who is way out of the picture at this point. Paul and I get along well, but he butts heads with my wife a lot. One of the biggest reasons is because she’s so overprotective of him, even though he is a grown man, has a career and lives by himself.

Paul is planning a 3 week trip to New Zealand this summer to visit some friends he has that live there as well as do some solo traveling around. He has traveled by himself before and Janet has always made him leave a copy of his itinerary. Janet again is asking him for a full itinerary complete with his friends’ addresses and phone numbers, hotels he will be staying at in other cities, etc. 

Paul told her that’s ridiculous that she needs all of that and that he’s a grown man, if she needs to reach him, she has his phone number. This turned into a huge argument where they both looked at me for my take. I was honest and told Janet that I think she’s being over the top and that he is a grown man. Later, this turned into an argument between Janet and I where she said I undermined her as a parent in front of her son and I should present a united front and not try to act like Paul’s big brother all the time instead of step father, etc.

So, AITA? Janet asked for my honest take and I gave it to her. Now she’s mad at me. Is it not unreasonable to give a grown 35 year old man his personal space when he travels without infantilizing him?

1c05j41,AITA for laughing at a friend that said my mother took advantage of my dad after their divorce? ,"I (19f) am an international student. I was with a friend recently, and we landed on the topic of parents. Our parents divorced when we were really young, so this kinda became a venting session for both of us lol. 

In my case, my parents divorced when I was 6 and they had shared 50/50 custody of me.

Then we got on the topic of child support, and this was where things got weird. I’m Muslim, and I was born and raised in a Muslim country with Sharia law. And under sharia law, it is the fathers that bear the sole financial (key word: financial) responsibility of having children. 

So when my parents divorced, although both my parents have good jobs, and were earning similar amounts at the time of the divorce, my father had to pay my mother child support for the time she would have me. 

And my friend thought this was incredibly weird. She asked me why my mother agreed to accept the child support if she didn’t need the money.

The simple answer: my parents are religious. My mother believes  that it is my father’s responsibility to financially provide for me, not hers. My father believes the same.  

My friend kind of laughs and says it’s easy to be religious in a situation like that when you can get money you don’t need off your ex. I laughed at her. It was funny.

She gets pretty offended that I laughed at her and she asked me why. I told her she doesn’t know anything about my parents but she automatically assumes the worst of my mother. Honestly, laughing at her was kinder than anything I would’ve said to her at that moment. 

She pretty much stops talking to me at that point and now I’m wondering whether I should reach out to make amends.

 He got to take me for the weekend and on the car ride over there ( I was with my stepmother) my little sister said she and my dad had a daddy-daughter day the same day I had my performance. I was so angry to hear he canceled on me for my younger sister.

I talked with him later when I saw him and he asked why I was getting so worked up over nothing, I told him of course I was angry he looked dumbfounded and told me I was being bratty that he missed one day of my life( he missed many days just saying) and said I was angry over nothing.

I work about 50-60 hrs a week whereas she works 40hrs a week and I have tried to increase the amount of home work I do over the weekends lately.

The problem for me lies in the fact that we take both kids to daycare which costs a pretty big chunk of our budget and is more or less 70-80% of her income per month. I make enough for all of us to be more or less in the same financial situation with a few more overtime hours a week if she quit her job. 

And since she has been complaining recently when she started venting yesterday I told her she might as well quit and just take care of the boys, and id bump up a few hrs since it's pretty much the same type of work (she works in social care).

Last week my wife told me that our brand new SUV was requested to be used as a ride and I thought it was for one of our kids school. Turns out it was her SIL (BIL wife), her SIL cousin is having a 'quinceanera' and they want to use our SUV as the ride for her.

I know her parents but not the uncle and aunt like friends or something like that, just seen them a few times at some reunions. Of course my response was not the best but I kind of laughed and said no way because it was unbelievable for me.

A little backstory: I grew up poor and I did not have much growing up, but I have worked so hard to earn and have what we own. And don't get me wrong, my wife is the sweetest woman I have ever met, she's kind and caring and always looking to help others when possible. She did not offer the SUV.

So now my wife is upset with me because I said no and the way I said it. I did not brought up the topic anymore and BIL and BIL-Wife went to my In-Laws and asked for their SUV instead. BIL-Wife argument was that renting a nice SUV was too expensive and they were 'ugly'.

Now I feel like our family doesn't like me or sees me as ""not nice, you could've help but didn't"". Oh well... AITA here?

We were not asked about our opinions or price range or included in the discussion.

Drinks are an additional $30 per person for a package or $15-20+ for a single small glass of wine (minimum some are apparently$60-90 per glass- not that I would order that)!

We told my partner's sister that this is well out of our price range at the moment due to having a single income and a lot of unexpected bills. She said she didn't care and to ""work something out"" as they have booked this restaurant and it is for their father's birthday.

1c2m00c,AITA for refusing to lend my daughter out to my SIL for a “mommy and me tea”?,"I never really had a good relationship with my SIL Sheila. She has two boys with her husband, my hubby’s older brother. Both of her sons are special needs.
I think Sheila has always resented me for having only girls. She is very feminine, likes to her hair and nails done, go out for girls nights and she doesn’t show much interest in her sons’ activities. She’s always talked about how nice it would be to take her hypothetical daughter shopping or brunch instead of being home alone while Brandon takes the boys out to basketball games or fishing. She adores my younger daughter because she’s at that age where she still loves ballerinas, princesses and anything pink and girly. 

Over Easter, Sheila asked if my younger daughter wanted to come to a “mommy and me tea” for Mother’s Day. I said no, because my hubby and I are already planning something for Mothers Day. And I want to spend it with my girls.

Sheila broke down and mumbled something about how she wanted to do something fun instead of being stuck at home with her sons.

I felt bad for her. Sheila loves going out to eat but can’t take Cooper or Teddy along because they can’t cope with being still or in loud places with lots of people around. She and her husband haven’t gone out since Teddy was born and it’s hard to find a sitter. 

At the same time, my daughter isn’t a doll to placate her “girl mom” wants.

I feel worse now because we had a family dinner last night and Sheila broke down crying when someone asked what she had planned for Mother’s Day and that she just wanted to do “normal mom things” for once.

This whole thing makes me feel nauseous. When I talked about it to work colleagues over lunch, they suggested that I let Sheila take my Kate to lunch anyway. It will make her feel better, they said, and I’d be the asshole if I didn’t do something to help her.

1c2m1ew,AITA for wanting an ASL interpreter at my brother’s wedding because my boyfriend is deaf?,"I (42 F) will be officiating my brother’s (37) wedding next month. Several months ago asked my brother and his fiance (35 F) if I could make arrangements and pay for for an ASL interpreter to be present for the ceremony since my boyfriend (43 M) is deaf and I cannot support his communication while officiating the wedding. After some discussion, my brother said that I could as long as the interpreter would not be in any photos. I made the arrangements and informed my boyfriend that I had secured an interpreter. Yesterday I received an email with the wedding day itinerary from the wedding day coordinator and it did not mention the interpreter’s arrival time. As a courtesy, I asked my brother’s fiance if the coordinator needed to know the interpreter’s arrival time. In summary, her response was that they decided that I cannot have the interpreter at the wedding because they are not hiring an interpreter for her non-English speaking family members, and they would be providing paper copies of the ceremony script for the non-English speaking guests in their native languages, and I could print it out for my boyfriend if I wanted. I expressed that my boyfriend needs the  accommodation of an interpreter, which I would be providing and paying for, in order to participate like everyone else, and that having a disability and being a non-English speaker are not comparable. She also said that she did not know I hired an interpreter because she thought the idea was discussed but a decision hadn’t been made. When I questioned my brother he said that there was a miscommunication, admitted that he did say I could hire an interpreter, but is now agreeing with his fiance. I have tried explaining why this is not acceptable and that my boyfriend needs an interpreter for the ceremony. I even gave the example that this would be like telling a guest with mobility problems that he or she can’t use his or her own wheelchair at the wedding, and argued that it is their choice to not provide an interpreter for their non-English speaking guests since they do not think it is fair to have an interpreter present for my boyfriend, but not their non-English speaking guests. They could provide interpreters for everyone who needs one if they wanted and I am sure that if her family wanted to provide an interpreter for their guests, it would not be an issue because we had already discussed having her brother translate for me while I am officiating, but he did not want to. Am I the asshole for arguing with their decision to not have an ASL interpreter, which I arranged and paid for with my brother’s permission, at their wedding to accommodate my boyfriend?",SyncSkateSteph,3107,0.8700000047683716,2176,1712960371,2024-04-12 17:19:31,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1c2m1ew/aita_for_wanting_an_asl_interpreter_at_my/,4,2024

1c3c7mw,AITA My husband tells me to stop asking for help and just do it myself,"Today my husband, my 15 month old son and I went to a friends place for her birthday celebration. While eating i was holding my son and asking for a napkin because he was making me and himself wet and dirty. And as my hands where full and my son was sitting on my lap i asked my husband as nice as i can for a napking. For this he had to get up and walk 5 meters…but he decided that i dont need one and made a joke to use my pants to smear the mess on….And i asked again. Nope he did not get one still….

Anyways..in the car later i told him i did not understand why he cant help me and he said again that he thought it is no needed to get a napkin… but if i ask that means i need one. He disagrees. He got mad at me for telling him this and said i should not nagg because afterall he spent sll day with me and for me with my friends.

also: he told me next time i should just give him the baby and go get them myself

AITA for asking for help???

update: this morning he acted very kind to me: asked how i slept, if he should cook for me and he cleaned alot. This tells me i was right to be upset and he knows that he was not good to me. but he has not talked to me about it yet or apologized.

Also thank you for all the powerfull comments and different opinions! I dont think he deserves all the harsh comments and also divorce is not necesarry. But he has to improve!

update 2: so far all he talked to me was about helping me or if i need something. and one thing was especially surprising today: he packed an emtpy luggage with winter clothes to make more room in the closet! first i thought he is leaving. but then he asked:“ i am putting my winter clothes away! thats s good idea no??“ with s cute voice. but no apology or explanation yet. And as long as i dont get this i wont interact more than necessary.

  
update 3: we talked snd he was sorry for all the points i needed to hear to be sure we think the same way and have similar values. He told me he had a little bit too much to drink and wanted to be funny but he knows also he should not do it like this. Also he explained me that when i mentioned the napkin he got mad because he helped me alot this day and all i do is finish the day with complaining about one thing instead of seeing all the good things he did. In the future he will tell me for example:“ i will help you more next time and take it seriously when you need me but i am also sad that all you think of was this one mistake i made when the rest of the day i put so much effort in.“

  
So no divorce, no abuse :) but it was really not fine!!",Majestic-Price-4879,7628,0.9399999976158142,1579,1713042457,2024-04-13 16:07:37,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1c3c7mw/aita_my_husband_tells_me_to_stop_asking_for_help/,4,2024
1c3cwlb,AITA for refusing to help a woman with her pregnancy bills because she had abandoned me during the day of our wedding?,"I am from India where arranged marriages are extremely common. 

My parents suggested a girl, Nandana. She was pretty, had a good job, etc.  I asked her whether she's fine with it, whether she's been asked to do it against her will, etc. She said she's agreeable to the marriage.

Months later, the wedding was supposed to be held, and on the day she appeared to not be talkative. She said (translating to English) ""It's true that I am not being forced, but that's because I haven't told my parents that I like someone else. I do not want to marry you. Please don't destroy my life.""

Needless to say, I was just numb. I wanted to yell, but I couldn't. 

I informed my parents about it, and then hers. There was an uproar. All of the hundreds of guests had to go back, and the wedding got cancelled. I am still single.

Some time back she called me to ask for help (pregnancy, etc). Apparently she left with the guy against her parents' wishes and married him, but he ditched her when she got pregnant. He's been isolating her from all her friends & doesn't have anyone to talk to. She had my number.

I straight-up refused, said that it's not my problem, etc. Some others who know about it are calling me cruel though.

So, here's the deal. My (28M) girlfriend (27F) of two years and I planned a two-week vacation to Italy. I paid for the flights, hotels—everything, because I make more than she does, and I wanted it to be a stress-free trip for both of us. Everything was great until the last day when she tells me she wants to stay longer to ""find herself"" and think about our relationship without me. She didn't discuss this with me beforehand, and it completely blindsided me.  
  
I was hurt and told her that if she feels she needs time alone, then she should also be independent financially during this extension of her trip. I said I wouldn’t be paying for her new return ticket whenever she decides to come back. Now, she's upset, calling me unsupportive and selfish, and some of our friends are saying I'm being an a-hole because I left her stranded in a foreign country without financial help.

I make dinner every night for myself (f in my 30s), my husband (m in his 30s), and our son (m 4). I don’t typically make things that take 100 dishes or leave a massive mess but there’s usually a couple of pots and pans, some utensils, and a cutting board. After I plate up our meals and serve we all eat together. My son is old enough to rinse his plate and put it in the dishwasher. My husband always does the same. I end up with all the the cooking dishes myself. I have brought this up to my husband and asked if he could do the dishes after I cook as I’m tired from doing the cooking. He says that since I made the mess I should deal with it myself. I was mad but didn’t ask again. The next night I made dinner that was just enough for me and my son. None for husband. He was confused. I told him if he wasn’t going to do his part for the meal then he could make his own. I think this is fair!

1c5u37m,AITA for refusing to co-parent my nieces on a vacation? ,"So my sister and I (35F) planned to take my nieces (9&11) to a major theme park and resort out of our country. We are sharing a room and planned to do the same sort of attractions each day. I love my nieces but they struggle with eating sometimes then they get really hungry and have tantrums. My sister was supposed to pack a bunch of snack options for them that they tried at home (older niece has issues with textures so it is hard to find safe foods that she will eat consistently). They also struggle to communicate how they are feeling at times. My sister has been less patient lately with them because she is extremely stressed but not really doing anything to help her mental health. I am child free by choice but I love kids and I am generally really good with them. I tend to pack a lot when I travel so I have everything I need and then some, including snacks, bandages and first aid supplies etc. my sister decided not to pack many snacks or bring them when we went out for the day to the different attractions. First day the 9y/o had a tantrum and refused to eat including lunch at the dine in restaurant my sister had booked. I stayed with older niece and we ate while my sister went outside with younger niece.  Things were rough with younger niece so they went back to the room. I stayed with older niece. Eventually they came back for a bit but by then they were both tired and I had missed out on the main attraction I wanted to do. Next day younger niece struggled again in the morning. I was able to talk to her and figure out she was really tired from all of the walking. I got one of those stroller type things for bigger kids so she could take breaks and I pushed it around most of the day. Later in the day she got overwhelmed and had to leave so my sister left and I stayed with older niece. Older niece and I went on another ride then went to a nice dinner together under our meal plan. My younger niece and sister had a nice evening at our resort. When we got back and mentioned a couple things my sister was pissed and jealous that we got a nice meal. 
Today we a lower key day but my sister let the girls stay in the pool for way too long and they refused to do their sunscreen as often as they should. I went to rest in the room. When they came back my nieces were extremely hyper and my sister was yelling at them to get going so we could go back to the nice restaurant. They left to step outside and asked me to ask them to get ready. I knew that even if they did it would be a nightmare at the restaurant and we were all hungry. When she came back and I said we should just get food here she started yelling at me about how it was so unfair that she kept having to miss things when one of the girls had a tantrum. I ended up leaving and she kept messaging me. She thinks that we should be splitting who leaves when one of them acts out. I said I am not parenting but she insists that’s what an aunt would do.

I jokingly said, now now, this is my sister, she will try to sleep with you. Her bf looked confused. Then I heard that he broke up with her because he found out about her sleeping with her sister’s fiancé. She is livid because it was serious between them and she always said she would marry this guy but now he has blocked her everywhere. Was I the ah?

1c9387b,AITA for refusing to make pizzas for everyone at my sister’s graduation party? ,"I (M 20) have went to culinary school and have been working in professional kitchens since I was 18. Even though i’m an adult since i’m the youngest child in my family and one of the youngest relatives in general. A lot of the time it’s difficult for me to get my relatives to take me seriously or keep me in the loop about things. I attended my sister’s graduation earlier today and right after I carpool home with my mom. It isn’t until while were in the car, driving to my mom’s house for the graduation party that I was told that I was suppose to make pizza for everyone at the party. I’ve made pizza for my family before. Not because anybody asked me to purely just because I wanted to. 

The thing that is frustrating me more than anything is multiple people knew about this ahead of time but they decided to tell the person that’s actually responsible for making them last minute. On top of the fact that my family is massive. There’s most likely going to end up being 14 or 15 people at this party. If you aren’t that into cooking, you might not understand how much of a grueling process making pizza from scratch is. Between making the dough, sauce, and actually cooking them. It is a process that I need to be let know of multiple days ahead of time so I get everything ready. 

I told them that I was sick of being kept out of the loop and not treated like an adult by everyone in my family and yet everyone still relies on me constantly to cook for everyone every time there’s a family event. I told them that I will not be making pizza today and if anyone wants anything from me I won’t do it unless I am completely kept in the loop of what’s going on and told about things multiple days ahead of time. I feel bad for my sister because she was very excited to try my homemade pizza but I had to explain to her why it wasn’t going to happen and told her that I can make one for her later in the week as an extra graduation present. My parents think i’m just being petty and just not making them because I am just being lazy. I really don’t think i’m the asshole here.

1c93w9u,AITA For keeping my kids away from their new uncle?,"
I have been with my wife “L” for 11 years now. We have two kids together, a 2 year old girl and a 6 month old son. My SIL, M, was beyond excited when she found out we were expecting, and wanted to be very involved in our kids lives as the “cool aunt” because she herself believed she would never have children.

Last year, M asked our group of friends, “If you were talking to someone, and they threw up several red flags in their personality, but they treated you nicely, would you continue to pursue that relationship?” We all, of course, said no. Red flags exist for a reason. But then, a week later, she introduces my family to her new boyfriend “R” and his daughter “S”. Before doing so, M made a note to tell me that R was conservative, which i thought was odd. We are all very progressive, and “M” more so than the rest of us, so i thought it was a bit weird but that’s ok. R was quiet throughout the dinner and after that, we didn’t see him for a while, though M continued to be very involved in our lives. 

A few months later, we went on a family vacation and “R” tagged along. On the very first morning, i was sitting in the floor playing with our daughter while a children’s show with a black man as the main character played on the tv. He walked over to M and whispered something to her and she got up and turned off the tv. When i asked why, she said that R didn’t want S (a 7 year old) watching it. Ok, whatever, it was background noise anyway. Then, when she went back to him, i heard him say “-that fucking queer” to her, referring to the main character. I was APPALLED. M is bi so i was astounded that he would say that to her and even more so that she laughed after he did. We parted ways for the day but that night, we all met back up for dinner. I wasn’t feeling well so i left early, but later that night my wife told me that he made several racist comments about the black family seated next to us with my daughter right there at the table. At that point i’d had it. I did not want this person around my kids. 

When the trip was over, i told M that i thought she was making a huge mistake with this guy, that he wasn’t “conservative”, he was homophobic and racist and i don’t want my kids growing up thinking it was ok to hate people because they’re different. She got very upset with me because this meant he wouldn’t be allowed at family holidays if my children were there, and that if i just spent a little more time with him, i would see he wasn’t all that bad. I refused. This caused a massive argument between L and M and now, M said that if R wasn’t allowed around my kids, she wouldn’t be a part of our lives any longer. To make matters worse, she’s now pregnant after believing herself infertile, and her and R are getting married next weekend. Now my wife wants us to go to couples counseling because she’s convinced that i’m overreacting about this. If she wants us to go to counseling, that’s fine with me, but i don’t think that i’ve done anything wrong.

1c9uviz,"AITA for repossessing my daughters car, after she took $20K for a wedding that never happened","My 26 yo daughter (Helen) & I always had a good relationship up until a few years ago. She started dating Marco in her final year of college. That same year, her mother & I separated. It was amicable, & we agreed on divorce terms without any disputes. 

After her graduation in 2021, she & Marco became engaged. I was very happy for her, however encouraged her to think about a long engagement, given they are both only now entering the workforce. She did say her ideal wedding location was booked out for 3 years, and they intended to save up for it. I told her that I would contribute $20K to her wedding. I also purchased her a car for her graduation, however kept the registration in my name.

Helen started to become distant, but whenever I asked if everything was ok, she said yes, & denied there was any issue. I just hoped everything would return to normal.

In April & of the blue, Helen posted on FB to announce that she & Marco had eloped & married at the registers office, with her mother, & MIL/FIL as witnesses. She said that they were planning on using their savings as a house deposit, & would have a small gathering at their home in lieu of a reception. I was so shocked & hurt that I found out in this way. I would have completely supported this decision had she spoken to me.

I called her to ask why I was not invited, & she said it wasn't personal, they just wanted to elope. I finally told her that I have been hurt the last few years with her being more distant, & I missed how close we were. Again, she didn't say much but was very cold & distant. I told her that the $20K I had given her was to be used for the wedding, & this is when she lost her temper, saying that if I was ready to part with that money for the wedding, why should she return it now? She would use the $20K as part of the house deposit, thought that's what i would have wanted, & hung up on me.

She ignored my calls/texts for the next week, apart from her finally responding to my last message with 'f\*\*\* off'. Here is where I may have been the AH. After I received that msg, I arranged for her vehicle to be towed back to my house. I sent her a text saying she had effectively been phasing me out of her life, clearly doesn't respect me, & I don't like that she feels entitled to take the money I had gifted her under false pretences.

Since then, both she/her mother have been blowing up my phone calling me every name under the sun, & she has told me she wants nothing more to do with me. I feel that had she told me she wanted to elope & save for a house instead, I would have offered her financial help, however her entitlement to think she is owed the money irrespective how she treats me is what i have an issue with. Where I feel i may have been an AH is that I think that taking back the car might have just been a petty thing to do to my daughter. I really don't want to give the car back to her after what she has said to me, but i just need to know if i overreacted or not - ready to accept my judgement.",agonisedfath,4504,0.9700000286102296,1026,1713738958,2024-04-21 17:35:58,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1c9uviz/aita_for_repossessing_my_daughters_car_after_she/,4,2024

Someone's overdosed in the bathroom!!"". I say to my co-worker ""Okay, hang on a second"". I walk over to my purse and grab the Narcan that I keep in there and go to the bathroom. I see the woman who is on the floor in the stall. I go into the stall and do a quick sternum rub (no response) then I administer the Narcan. Thankfully she responded very well to the Narcan and woke up, however, she was \*pissed\* (\*which I understand). She storms out of the bathroom and out of the store. Meanwhile, my co-worker is still screaming at me ""CALL 911! why are you letting her walk away ??? she needs medical attention"". I explained that 911 would have just done the same exact thing I did, only we would have had to wait on them. Also there's nothing else left to do, she already left the building.

We *do* though have a vacant home (3bd/3ba) that we usually rent, but our last tenant moved out, so it's just been existing for the past few months. I offered that they live there (about 45 minutes away from us) but my wife is persistent on them moving into OUR house since my sister needs a support system. 

I'm open to help out, but I feel the case of moving in needs some more consideration, besides les do it.

1caofb9,"AITA for telling my overweight friend that I maintain my body through a healthy lifestyle, NOT genetics?","A few years back, 7 of my friends from high school and I decided that no matter where we lived or how busy we were, we were going to meet each other for brunch once a year for the rest of our lives. We don’t have an exact date, but we usually pick a week in June or July when it is warm, and fly/drive to our hometown for bottomless brunch at our favorite spot. Keep in mind that for some of us, this is the only time of the year that we see each other. I, in particular, live 2500 miles away, so I hardly see any of these girls. Regardless, it is always a good time, until recently when one of my friends “Rue” would not stop commenting on my food intake.

For some background, I am and always have been a very active person. I ran track and cross country for our college and I now compete in ultramarathons. For this reason, I eat a lot of calories, and I stay pretty thin. I also eat reasonably healthy, balanced meals most of the time. However, for the one day a year at our favorite restaurant, NOTHING is off limits. I eat plate after heaping plate of cheesy eggs, pancakes, hash browns, sausage, bacon–literally I could eat the entire menu.

Rue has always been on the heavier side. While I don’t really pay attention to someone’s weight changes or eating habits, Rue points it out, so I can’t help but notice. “Every year I eat nothing but oatmeal and I keep getting bigger and bigger, and \[OP\] is over there gorging herself and is stick thin!” “It’s like every calorie \[OP\] eats shows up on MY body!” Soon my friends started to chime in, saying that I was lucky I have such good genetics and can eat whatever I want. This really bothered me in part because it completely invalidated the work I do to maintain my healthy body, but also because I could tell Rue was frustrated with her weight, and I felt my friends were doing more harm than good.

I explained that I do not normally eat like this, and I also exercise very frequently, and that people shouldn’t look at a snapshot of someone’s life and think that’s how they live on the daily. I also said eating salads for every meal and never enjoying a meal out with friends is just going to make her more frustrated, which will slow her progress. I thought this was going to be helpful advice, but my friends all looked at me livid. One of them called me incredibly privileged and said I wasn’t aware of my privilege, and accused me of shaming Rue. The rest of them followed suit and told me to get off my high horse. Eventually I’d had enough. I said I was just trying to help and that they’re only going to hurt Rue (Rue was silent the whole time. I packed up my things, paid my bill, and left.

Now I’m feeling torn because it’s been a few days and none of these people will talk to me. I reached out to the person in the group I was closest with and she said I really overstepped and should apologize to the group and at least to Rue. I had good intentions, but if these people won’t talk to me, maybe I screwed up.

My wanted to order pizza, so I said hey there’s this coupon for 40% off any large pizza with three toppings. That coupon could save us a ton of money, which we could spend on other things like gas for the car. I told her this and she starts talking about how her autism makes her not like certain textures. I tell her that 40% off is 40% off and that she can just pull the toppings she doesn’t like off the pizza. She then compares what I just said to insulting a person in a wheelchair, as if her autism texture thing is a serious as someone who literally can’t walk.

1ccambx,AITA for yelling at my mom because she ate the food that I bought with my money?,"
Our fridge is usually close to empty. There’s always condiments, eggs and some sort of shredded cheese but that’s it. Usually cream for coffee too which I sometimes use for cereal. The pantry is full of dried pasta, Cheerios and granola bars that are strictly for my sister. My dad locks away all of the good food for himself and wears the key around his neck like fucking Zoey101.  So there’s nothing to really make besides scrambled eggs, cereal or pasta. Yeah I should be grateful that there’s food at all but I’m sorry I can’t just live off of those things. Plus I have a really sensitive stomach so a lot of dairy and gluten will destroy my stomach.

 Yesterday, I bought my own food and left it in the fridge. Starved myself all day for as long as possible so I could eat towards the end of the day to not go to bed hungry. I got a big enough meal to eat half last night and half tonight. I don’t make enough money to buy solid meals for myself all the time so I was really looking forward to not eating the same old thing yet again. I opened the fridge today when I was hungry to the point of vomiting and the majority of my food was gone. Maybe a bite or two left but nothing I could actually get full off of. So naturally I got pissed because I’m starving, I paid for it with the little money I have in the first place and my mom didn’t even ask. So I walked into her (home) office and asked her if she ate my food. Her argument was that she thought it was old from days ago when she literally knows I came home with it last night. I even got her something too which she ate for dinner last night!!!!Then I got even more mad saying I’m starving and haven’t eaten anything in over 24 hours. She started bawling her eyes out and my dad started screaming at me for being over dramatic. Then she dramatically left the house saying she’s gonna blow off work for the rest of the day to go and get me the same meal. My dad ran out and took the keys from her before she could leave then came inside saying she’s crying. 

So not only did she eat my food, she guilt tripped me and made me feel like I’m the reason why she’s not gonna make any money today. Because she ate my food that I starved myself for. I think I feel extra guilty because we get along well but this isn’t the first time it’s happened. When I told my sister she sighed and rolled her eyes because this has happened to her too with the same excuse. All I know is that I’m mad, feel guilty and have extremely low blood sugar so I might just sleep it off or something. Am I the asshole for reacting the way I did?

1ccas2p,AITA for kicking my father out after he made “harmless” comments”? ,"My father is a typical guy for his age group. Never lifted a finger to do housework. I don’t think I can remember him doing housework in my childhood memory. My mom and him both worked and she would do all the housework and childcare. My brother and I were raised by my mom and my dad would hang out with us for 1-2h on weekends before disappearing to his man cave to watch TV. She complained to him a lot when I was a teenager and he didn’t take it seriously until she filed for divorce the second we were off to college. To this day he claims she gave him no warning and divorced him out of nowhere. 

As an adult I made sure who I dated knows how to do housework and splits it with me. We have a todo board where we list chores and who will do them and time it will take. That way we don’t do the same things and no one does too much. My father came over to visit from another state as part of work and was suppose to stay off. He was looking at the board and asked what it was and when I told him said “you realize it’s not long to last right?” I was like what? And he said it’s just natural that women want to do all the housework and take care of people and if I keep pushing it my bf will leave me. I was like WTF and told him the reason mom left was because he thought that way. 

He got defensive and said “well I make the money so she does the housework”. I pointed out she worked as well and he said “well she chose to work, it’s her own fault”. I was really pissed at that point and told him to leave. He was supposed to to stay over but I said he needs to find a place to stay but he wasn’t coming back. He left and I’m pissed he was so disrespectful. He texted later “apologizing” I got offended by his comments but they were harmless and for my best interest.

1ccbdnc,AITA for not explaining to my sister why she was stupid for asking me to share my art supplies.,"I babysit for my sister all the time. She pays me the same as anyone else. But she is a lot more entitled than anyone else. 

My nephews are really good kids but spoiled. They eat when they are supposed to and a don't need to wrangle them much to get them to bed. However they are fascinated with my art supplies. I am not an artist. I just like to draw. I have a few apps on my iPad but I like my paper and pencils as well. I also have oil pastel crayons. 

My nephews wanted to draw with them but I said no. They complained to my sister and she told me to let them draw with me. 

The next time I came by I brought pencil crayons for them. Not good enough. They complained and she said I was being mean not sharing. 

Time before last I just didn't bring anything except a book to read. She gave me shit for being immature. 

Fine I gave up. I bought them them some cheap oil crayons. I gave them to her as I was leaving. 

She called me today. She gave them the crayons but did not supervise them. She has spent the last two days trying to get the oil paint off her couch and carpet. She says my brother-in-law is pissed that I gave them art supplies that are so messy. I forwarded her the messages where she called me childish and mean for not sharing. I offered to send them to her husband so he could know whose idea it was. 

She is mad and demanding that I watch them for free to pay her back for the cleaning. I just said I would not watch the kids any more. She tried to trick me by not having cash when I showed up. I said I was leaving since I didn't trust that she would pay me. Strangely she actually had the cash. 

She did call our mom and tell on me for giving the kids oil paints without warning her. 

My mom wants me to keep the peace and offered to pay me to watch the kids and let my sister think she won. I'm thinking about it. But my sister still thinks I did it on purpose.",No_Permit6786,4697,0.9700000286102296,291,1713997080,2024-04-24 17:18:00,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ccbdnc/aita_for_not_explaining_to_my_sister_why_she_was/,4,2024
1cd47ej,AITA? Choosing Daughter over Husband?,"My husband (m,64) and I (f,65) have been married for 20 years.  He has two sons, Jason and Craig both married (m,41 and 39).  I have two daughters Jenna and Kiera both married (f, 38 and 37).   All of our kids are independent and living on their own.  His boys have families but don’t live anywhere near us.  My girls recently received an inheritance from their grandfather of close to 1 million each.  They are being responsible with it.  One is saving a big portion of it for retirement and her son’s education.  The other doesn’t have kids and doesn’t live near us.  So this is about the one who lives close to us and has a pre-school son, Kyle. 

My husband has gotten very upset lately about the help I am giving Jenna with babysitting Kyle before pre-school and in the afternoons 2-3 days a week.  He is a good eater and likes things that are driving up our food bill maybe 40-50.00 a month.  Husband resents me not getting paid for the food and to a lesser degree  my time.  He says it isn’t fair to his grandkids that they are not being treated fairly.  I suggested he send the grandkids’ parents money for treats each month.  He wants me to charge Jenna and then not have to give his grandkids anything.  I don’t want to charge Jenna anything.  I don’t think that grandparents should charge for childcare or food. 

He gets aggravated if he sees a new colouring book or markers here. He seethes with rage at times if I invite Jenna’s family for a meal.   He thinks Jenna and to a lesser degree Kiera should be helping us instead of hoarding their money.   He also gets very agitated about me not telling him if Kyle is going to be here.  He says that he doesn’t feel like it is his home and that I make all the decisions.  He is threatening to break up our marriage over the disparity and unfairness of the situation.  

Some info on our finances: Money isn’t plentiful but we both have pretty good pensions. After our bills are paid we have between 2 and 3 thousand a month to spend on groceries, gas and other miscellaneous expenses. We have very minimal savings.   He travels to see his grandkids maybe 2-3 times a year.  One he flies to see and the other he takes the train or drives.  Averages out maybe 500.00 a trip.  I don’t travel at all.

He thinks I am  the AH because I am willing to risk our marriage over this.  If we divorce we will have to sell our house and neither one of us will be able to afford to live to the standard we have now.

1cdx6jv,AITA for refusing to return a gift I was given 7 years ago?,"For context, I was dating a girl in college who went to Thailand and got me a handmade machete as a gift. I have kept it through the years, but it's mostly just been in my garage and I use it for random things like cutting boxes up to fit in the trash can. 

Long story short, we broke up over 7 years ago and she blocked me on every form of social media and other forms of communication. Last night, her friend (who I'm not friends with on Facebook) messaged me on Facebook saying that my ex-girlfriend wanted the machete back. I was pretty taken aback by the request and asked why she didn't reach out to me directly and pointed out how strange it was to make that request, especially after not talking to me for nearly a decade. She acted like I was an asshole for insinuating that the request was tacky and strange. The majority of my friends think the request is ridiculous and I should tell her to kick sand, but some friends are saying if I hardly use it, why not just give it back? I don't really care that much about having the machete, but the principle**(ETA) of it just really rubs me the wrong way.

1cdywf6,AITAH for humbling my colleague that her age is irrelevant compared to our other colleague’s beautiful wife?,"So I have this colleague Jada (f26) who is very obviously in love (or in crush is maybe a better term since I believe true love comes after knowing a person) anyway, she is in crush with another colleague. This dude is 40 and he is stunningly handsome so I get the crush. Anyway he brought his wife to work once and she is as stunning if not even more. She looked around his age too. Then I knew for sure that she is 42 because Jada did some stalking online. She said eiw she is old. I thought it was a silly comment but ok.

But ever since, she’s been relentless in her attempts in pursuing our colleague. It had gotten out of hand and it was getting unbearable sincewe three work very close together. I confronted her and asked her what she was doing. You saw that he had a wife and he seems very happy in his marriage. 

“That old cow?”

The “cow” is maybe 120lbs. I ignored this comment. I told her she wasn’t old, she was his age. What I said next might be AH. I told her that she was crazy if she thought just because she was younger she would automatically have advantage over the wife since beauty outweighs youth. She got very upset and accused me of calling her ugly. Not at all I said, just that the wife is very VERY beautiful. Besides all of this isn’t important because he obviously loves his wife and to go ahead and try and if she succeeded, it won’t be because she is young and the wife is an old cow. It would be because the guy is a cheater or doesn’t love his wife.

1cdza0l,"AITA for not letting my 6'6"" brother have the free first class upgrade the airline gave me on our 12 hour flight?","Hello AITA--

We are at the beginning of my dad's retirement family trip. He is paying for all of us to meet as a family in Hawaii for a week since he is retiring after working at the same company for 42 years. There are six of us but my brother and I live in the same part of the country. 

I guess it's relevant to say I am 5'1"" and my brother is 6'6"". I fly all the time for work and have quite a bit of status with the airline for which my dad bought our tickets. 

This is what happened way earlier today. We were all boarded and ready to go when a flight attendant came up to me and whispered that they had a first class passenger not show up and they needed the coach seat to accommodate a standby passenger. She said I had by far the most status of anyone on the plane so they were willing to move me to first class for free. I was like oh yeah--and I took it in a heartbeat. I told my brother I'd see him in 12 hours and let me know if he wanted any food or drink and I grabbed my stuff and moved. Needless to say I had a nice flight. 

When we landed and were waiting for our shuttle my brother was so pissy but wouldn't tell me what was going on. He didn't speak to me the whole shuttle ride. We had a nice hello with the rest of the family but after I got down from my shower my mom took me aside and said what I did ""was awful."" I asked her what she was talking about and she said that I should have given my brother the seat. I thought that would be the end of it but all 5 of my siblings and my parents are upset with me and the vacation is off to a very rough start. 

I was trying to play with my niece and nephew in the lobby waiting for lunch and my sister said ""no they only like to play with people who give a shit about their family--what were you thinking?"" I asked her if this was about the first class thing and she said ""what do you think its about?"" I said that he never asked me to switch with him, she said ""an asshole makes people beg, family members don't.""

1cfk918,AITA for kicking my baby’s father out of the hospital room?,"I (19F) just had a baby 1 day ago. His father (21M) and I have not been together since November due to him cheating. He’s had a couple other girlfriends since then and is still with one of them currently, but he still did go to most of my appointments with me. 

2 days ago when I went into labor I called him, he came to pick me up to bring me to the hospital and he had his entire TV and playstation in the backseat, with no car seat for the baby. I told him he is not bringing that to the hospital and he told me if I want him to be there for our son’s birth he needs something to do to pass the time. We argued about it almost the entire ride to the hospital, but he ended up not bringing it in. 

I was only in labor for about 2 hours before I gave birth, he was there the entire time. A couple hours after I gave birth, my dad and sister came to visit and he left as the hospital has a 2 visitor only rule. I told him while they’re here visiting for him to go bring his TV back home and install the car seat so when they discharge us we will be all set. After a few hours my family leaves, and I text him to tell him he is welcome to come back if he would like. 

Around 20 minutes later he’s walking back into my room, carrying his TV. We start arguing about how I already told him he is not having that in my room and he starts yelling at me saying that I don’t make the rules and that I should be grateful that he wants to be there for our son but instead I’m trying to make him miserable. I told him he can either bring the TV back to his car or he can leave, he said he has a right to spend time with his son. 

I called my nurse into the room and told her I want him to leave, so they ended up kicking him out. He yelled at me the entire time he was leaving saying that I’m kicking him out of his son’s life and that he will be going to court for custody. He has texted me since saying that I’m taking his rights away from him and there is no rules that he couldn’t bring his own TV and game system while he spends time at the hospital.

1cgd5fj,AITA for not getting upset or convince the bride after I was uninvited to my friend’s wedding?,"This happened over the weekend but there’s still so much tension. 

One of my good friends, Matthew (26M) is getting married next month to Jennifer (26F). I (25F) have known Matthew since high school. We’ve both connected when it came to video games, especially Minecraft. Matthew has had his fair share of girlfriends over the years but when he met Jennifer 3 years ago, he said that he knew she was the one and they are madly in love with each other and I am so happy for them both. 

Last year, Matthew popped the question to Jennifer and she said yes. Jennifer’s demeanor towards me drastically changed after the engagement. She was distant towards me, she wouldn’t look at me and she would hardly speak to me which was weird since Jennifer was always so sweet and nice towards me. 

I’d still talk to Matthew and meet with him and our group of friends, sometimes with Jennifer and she would still act cold and not speak to me much. I kept my distance from Jennifer. Three months ago, we all received a save the date invitation and their wedding is going to take place at Matthew’s cabin 2 hours away and they were going to keep it small due to the size of the cabin so we were only allowed to bring one guest. That was when Jennifer acted extremely harsh and hostile towards me and said “bet you don’t have a plus one since you are so into my man.” I was taken aback. I asked her what the fuck she was talking about and she smirked and said I knew and to not act stupid. I ignored her remark and told her my boyfriend was coming. She looked surprised and left. I of course told Matthew about what Jennifer said to me and he was not happy, so he made her apologize to me. 

Then, last weekend, I was invited by matthew’s sister to go dress shopping with her and Jennifer. I declined at first because I wanted to keep my distance from Jennifer but Matthew’s sister assured me that she will deal with Jennifer and that our other friends will be there with us. So we go dress shopping and I found a beautiful dress that I thought would be perfect and I took a picture to send to my boyfriend since he planned on matching (I.e with a bow tie) with me. I tried the dress on and it was a perfect fit so I guess I got lucky. Jennifer was angry, called me names such as a whore, a boyfriend stealing bitch, and that I was officially uninvited to the wedding. She caused such a commotion, the employee of the store asked us to leave. 

I told Jennifer I didn’t want to come to the wedding anyway but I was going to because MY FRIEND was getting married. I told her if she didn’t want me at the wedding, fine. I don’t give a fuck since I won’t go to a wedding if the bride is going to be so rude to a guest. 

Matthew and our friends found out and I was getting texts left and right begging me to just come to the wedding. I told them I was happy to get uninvited and I’ll just spend the day with my boyfriend on the day of the wedding instead. They’re all mad at me for not fighting hard enough. 

AITA?

Edit: so my decision is final. I will not be going to the wedding and there’s no changing my mind about it. I will be sending a wedding gift to Matthew the day prior to the wedding instead. I told Matthew and all my friends that I won’t be going and they can’t convince me otherwise. Matthew also called me and asked if we can talk somewhere. I agreed but it’s to tell him in person that I won’t go so that way he knows I’m serious about that. 

Update: I met up with Matthew and brought my boyfriend along. Of course, he begged me to come to the wedding and he said he would beg Jennifer to let me attend. I told him it’s best if I wasn’t there. I told Matthew that Jennifer has a problem with me. Period. He said he doesn’t understand and he did ask her many times but Jennifer would continue to say she was just “stressed”. I got angry and said that’s bullshit and he knows that. My boyfriend also intervened and said to Matthew that he needs to wake up and realize Jennifer is crazy and he can’t keep defending her. Matthew said he loves her too much and doesn’t want to lose her. My boyfriend and I got up and told Matthew to let us know when he has a backbone. In the meantime, it’s best we don’t talk. I messaged all of our friends in the group to let them know I’m keeping a distance from Matthew because of Jennifer. He’s still my friend but at an arms length. I will still be sending him a gift regardless but I’m keeping my distance from Matthew. It seems like he is in denial and can’t comprehend what’s going on at all. He usually is in denial, ever since high school he would have a sense of denial. 

Another thing to mention is that Jennifer is nice to all of Matthew’s female friends. Just not with me. I’ve also gotten a message from two of our friends saying they have dropped out of attending the wedding because of Jennifer and that they are on my side. 

Edit 2: Jennifer already bought her wedding dress a while ago. When I went dress shopping with Matthew’s sister, she invited Jennifer as a way to resolve this animosity she had towards me. So it was Matthew’s sister who wanted to buy a dress and I found a dress that I loved and Jennifer went crazy. Hope that clears things up since so many were confused.

1cge2qt,AITA For Refusing To monitor My Kids' Eating Habits? ,"I (42f) have two kids (14f and 13m) and a niece (15f) who all live with me along with my mom (70f). As all three kids are in the midst of puberty, they have been packing down food like crazy. But it doesn't matter to me, I just buy and make more food since I really enjoy cooking. The food in question isn't like brownies and cake and mostly unhealthy stuff, but stuff that we normally eat. They always come back for seconds and thirds and stuff. 

  
Yesterday, I made chicken wings, Suya, and rice (weird combo I know). I made about 25 chicken wings, 15 suya sticks, and a lot of rice. After everyone had eaten, there was basically nothing left over, and I guess my mom picked up on the fact, since during cleanup, she told me she felt like these kids were eating ""too much"" and I should stay consistent on certain food portions, and after that no more. I don't know about you guys, but I felt that was a terrible idea since I feel like every teenagers eats like crazy. 

  
My mom could see I was firm on my stance, but today after school (they love to eat after school) my mom didn't let them get anything from the fridge. At least until I asked her to please open it for them. 

  
AITA? I can see both points on how impulse control for food can be handled but i dont think its the way to go about. So im asking here for judgement.

1cgeffp,AITA For not considering the baby part of the family,"AITA For refusing to give up the baby items?

Ex and I were married for 20 years.  We had 2 kids together.  Our son was the 6th grand child 💙 born on his side, and our daughter was the 7th grand child and first Grand daughter 🩷 on that side. There were 5 more kids born after her.
On my side, our kids were the first grandchildren.

I have always been into vintage/ handmade items.  MIL would make blankets / sweaters / booties / mittens for all the babies.  When our daughter was born she also made rompers and dresses for her.  The other 'daughters' never appreciates what she did. In addition to what SHE made, she also gave us the sweaters that were given to her son (my husband) by his Nannies (grandmothers).  My mother, (first grandchildren) would shop at $$$ boutiques for out fits for my kids 🙄 She finally came to reality and started shopping cheaper.

My kids also wore the Christening gown that MY grandmother had worn. (Yeah, it was old).

In addition to the clothing, there were toys.  Toys from their grandparents when they were babies.  Toys from  their father's side that none of his siblings wanted for their babies.   Toys from my side I wanted them to have. Toys they got as gifts. And yes, I had all the toys tested for safety before I allowed the kids to have them.


The kids grew up and out these things.  I packed these items up in boxes so that when our children have children of their own, these things will be available for them if they want them.


Our marriage didn't last.  He walked our on us, and left all boxes (baby items) with me.  He quickly remarried. 


His wife has a daughter that was out of the house when they married. The daughter, recently had a baby.  Now, his wife had seen photos of our children wearing some of the items I had saved up, and SHE feels that since HER daughter had 'the first grandchild' 🙄 that SHE (her daughter) is entitled to all the baby items I had saved for future grandchildren.

AITA ... He walked away and left all the baby items with me. I saved the items so that OUR children will have them (if they desire) for THEIR children (OUR grandchildren).  They (him & wife) feel that since his wife's daughter gave birth, she is just as entitled to the saved baby items as our children are.

And yes, I could ask ex-MIL what she would like me to do with the items, but I really don't want to get her involved if I don't have to.

I MIGHT be TA for not allowing my ex to give baby items from OUR kids that I saved for their future children to his wife so she could present them to her own (already existing) grand babies.

1ch51za,"Update: AITA for refusing to pay for half of my ex-girlfriend’s flight that she can’t use because we broke up, and now possibly not even mine?","Hey, thanks to everyone who commented on my last post. I got so much more advice than I was expecting, and I appreciate it. A lot of you were saying the airline could do something. I told that to my ex, and she actually bought the tickets from a discount agency online and there was no refund possibility. If you’re curious, I can tell you how it all ended.  

I eventually told my ex that I was not going to pay her more than the $800 for my ticket under any circumstances, and she could take it or leave it and I’d just get my own ticket. She later asked if I’d be willing to let her use the AirBnb if she paid me the entire $1600, basically letting me out of the whole trip all together. To be honest, the Canary Islands were her idea in the first place. It’s not like it’s my #1 destination. I could take the money and go somewhere that I am more interested in. 

I asked my friend who was going to go with me if he’d be interested in something cheaper and closer. He hadn’t bought his plane ticket yet because he was waiting for me to sort everything out with my ex. 

We looked at options and decided to accept her offer and go to Belize. I had my ex agree in writing to pay for any fees or damages incurred at the AirBnb. I really don’t think there will be any. She’s not the type of person to damage a hotel room or something, but I just want to be sure. 

I got Venmoed the money by a male coworker of hers. They have been work friends for a while now, and I have met him a couple of times. I don’t know if this is like a couple’s thing or what. I don’t really think she cheated on me with him. I could see maybe her being interested in him possibly being a factor for our breakup. But I don’t even know if they are together or going as friends. 

At the end of the day, I don’t really care what she does. I got my money back, she gets her vacation. I’m guessing her coworker also bought his own plane ticket, so at the end of the day he’s the one eating the $800 loss. So he can have fun with that. My ex and I are technically “amicable” again, but I don’t really plan on talking to her again.

1chzcff,AITA for not paying my husband back for our daughters purchase?,"I'm not necessarily a stay at home mom but I do have our daughter everyday while I watch 2 other children (they are all 4) so I still make money and pay half the bills.

I was paying more attention to my laundry and my daughter went to the home screen and selected currency to purchase in a game. This was a 50$ purchase. My husband's card is connected, so he was charged, he gets the notification instantly that his card was charged and comes in the room asking what happened?

I didn't know, since I didn't see, and he explained the charge on his card and realize she made the purchase. He said it's fine, I'll just have to pay him back. I asked why, since it's also his child and he agreed to let her play and he didn't put pin protection on so that this wouldn't happen. He said ""you were the one watching her"".

1ci0153,AITA for thinking each of my kids getting their own room is more important than my new husband having 3 to himself?,"My new husband and I agreed before we scheduled our wedding that, even though space would be tight, we would lIve in his house. We have a master bedroom & a second bedroom upstairs, a main floor office/bedroom, and a finished basement with a legal bedroom, a second good- size room, and a storage room. Each floor has a full bathroom. We have 3 children who live with us, 17, 14 & 12. They are all mine, his are all out of the house. We decided to give the basement bedroom to the 17, upstairs second bedroom to the 14, and the office to the 12. That would leave the second room and storage room in the basement for my husband's exclusive use for his activities- magic & writing. WE ALL 5 AGREED TO THIS. 

We married in December and moved in towards the end of March. He was nowhere near ready (chronically late), but I had a tenant moving into my home and we had to leave it. Now we've been here a month (with a box or two & a suitcase each, most the rest is in a storage unit or was sold/donated/tossed) and my husband just decided he writes best in the office, so the 12 & 14 year- olds will have to share a room. I think he's being selfish, he could easily write in his magic room, which he has to himself. As a compromise, my 12 said he could have his office and give the her the storage room instead (I'm sure I could fix it up nice for her!). He says no, he needs all 3 rooms to be able to write and do magic. He & I have dated/been married for almost 6 years now and he's maybe used each room 5 times. He's disabled but wants to try to make some money on the side as a magician (he's great & he was an outstanding magician in his youth, so this may be possible). I just don't think he requires 3 tooms of the house to do this, that 2 should be sufficient. 
The only other 2 rooms in the house are the kitchen (my husband also cooks and has every gadget and ingredient, so there isn't always a place to sit in there...) and the living/dining room (one room). My husband spends most of his time watching tv or researching magic tricks in the living/dining, so the kids can't really hang out in there, either. So the only place they have where they can choose what they do or have alone time is their room. 
I am paying half the mortgage, all the food, and for everything the kids or I need. He pays the other half the mortgage, gas/electric, and for everything he needs. If he has a show (he did one last fall) we ALL help (making things, set up, tear down) and I invest $4 figures in it. So we feel like we're being supportive.
I think each kid should get their own room, AS WAS AGREED to before we got married. And my husband should make it work with 2 rooms instead of 3.

1ci13ea,AITA for refusing to knit a blanket for my new grandson even though I’ve made them for my other grandchildren?,"I 53F am married to my husband Dan 59M. Dan has 2 kids Jack 35M and Adam 31M with his ex and I have two kids 29M and 27F with my ex. As a blended family, our kids have all been supportive and they were all out the house by the time we started dating so they didn’t care. 

All of our kids have children, so for all my grandchildren I have knitted a blanket for when my grandkids first leave the hospital, which has been a tradition since I made the first one. 

Adam has recently introduced us to Kate 30F, his coworker. Kate was married and Adam was dating Sarah 33F, who at the time was pregnant with my grandson (Adam and Sarah’s second baby), when Kate and Adam started their affair. Kate realised she was pregnant so she got a divorce and Adam broke up with Sarah. Adam and Kate’s relationship has not gone down well with anyone, with Dan and Jack  refusing to see Kate or Adam. Dan’s ex cheated on him which is still a sore topic for Dan and Jack as he remembers his mom and why they have especially struggled. 

Through this, I have maintained a relationship with Sarah who is really struggling. Her family haven’t spoken to her since she had my granddaughter Annie 3F without being married. Adam didn’t go to a single appointment for Sarah and instead I have gone with her which has created a rift between me and Adam as I refuse to go with Kate.

The blankets I make are very intricate, and take months to make as I make them slowly. I decided to only make one for Sarah’s baby and not Kate’s, Adam never asked for a blanket so I assumed he understood I was not making him and Kate one. I maintain a civil relationship with Adam but I am also upset at how he treated Sarah, and how he now ignores her and their baby.

Sarah recently had her baby and I was with her whilst she was in labour. I gave her the blanket and she posted her baby’s hand and the blanket on her social media. Adam has contacted me to say Kate is infested in having a blanket for their baby and he told me how much it would mean to them as Kate has no family and they ant their child to be part of the family and think that we will all come around later.

I am on the fence, I am angry for Sarah and her baby but Adam is family and I don’t want to make rash decisions that can cause more drama in the family especially as Adam’s and Sarah’s two kids are involved, with Annie old enough to understand the dynamics.

1cirfdn,"AITA for ""spoiling"" my daughter by taking her on holiday? ","Made this as a throwaway account for personal reasons.

I (M53) split up with my ex-wife (F49) about nine years ago. We have one 17-year-old daughter from the relationship, Tilly, who we share custody of. Due to work commitments, my ex has Tilly most of the weekdays, and I have the weekends. So my ex isn't stuck entirely with the ""boring"" schooldays, she also gets the weeks when Tilly is on vacation.

While my ex got remarried a few years ago, I never did. Although I dated here and there, a combination of work commitments and just not finding the right person meant it never clicked and I've stayed mostly single. I've worked my way up the career ladder as a result and I have a healthy amount of excess income, which I mostly put towards Tilly. I wouldn't say she's spoilt because I still try to give her a sense of responsibility around the house by helping with chores and don't hand out pocket money unless it's earned. However, since I have the means to do so, I do treat her with any clothes, makeup, gadgets, and the like. It's something I enjoy doing and she shows gratitude for it.

On the other hand, my ex is a stay at home mom and her new husband/Tilly's stepdad has a pretty standard job. I don't mean that disrespectfully but.the income generated in the household is average at best for a similar family type. As such, Tilly rarely gets any presents from her mom/stepdad other than on birthdays or any other holidays.

As Tilly's 18th birthday is coming up, I wanted to do something vey special for her, to also tie in with her leaving for college shortly. I arranged a trip to Europe for the two of us for two weeks over the summer. As co-parenting plans have to be arranged, I phoned my ex to say this would be my plan and to sort out all the logistics. To be surprise, my ex exploded at me. She said how I was ""spoiling"" Tilly and was only doing this to spite her because she knew that any gift she gave by comparison would be meaningless, making me the ""favourite parent"". I told her that wasn't true, and I just wanted to give my only daughter a present she'd love and memories to cherish.

Nonetheless, this went on, and my ex called me an asshole over the situation, saying that I need to scale down my present to not spoil Tilly and put us at a ""level playing field"". I laughed and said she was being ridiculous but to avoid any argument, I offered to say this was a ""joint present"" from us both if she/her husband were willing to contribute. This idea was shot down because Tilly ""wasn't stupid"" and knew it would be my present. I was done arguing at this point, so put down the phone.

My ex has text me since, labelling me an asshole again and requesting I rethink. I have no intention of doing so and feel I'm in the right.

1cit51q,AITA for not going to another restaurant after my boyfriend refused to order from where I stopped?,"Earlier today I asked my boyfriend to go with me to run some errands. When we finished I was hungry and picked a Mexican restaurant for lunch. It was more of an authentic place which I absolutely loved but my boyfriend said nothing looked appealing. He gave me money for my meal and said he was going to go to a place down the street. 10 minutes later he's back because the place had a really long wait
time.

I made some suggestions from the menu he would probably like to try but he said no. He said he told me last week he was burned out on Mexican food when we went out for dinner with my parents because 'we always eat it'. He didn't order anything that night either which was really embarrassing to have someone at the table not eating the entire time and trying to explain to my mother and step-dad in a way that didn't sound disrespectful. 

Service at this place was rather slow so I wound up taking most of my meal with me. He said to stop along the way to my place so he can get something to eat. I said no because he knew I had to be home by a certain time for a maintenance person and everything he wanted was in the opposite direction.

We got back to my place and he said he was going to go home because he was starving. I said he could stay and cook something here but he said no and that he needed space after I 'made him starve'. I told him he wouldn't be starving if he hadn't been picky and he left. He's still mad at me so AITA here?

ETA: No I am not Mexican but my stepdad is so I grew up eating it most my life. My stepdad picks where we choose to eat each week or he won't go, and they want all of us there each week or its a whole drama. I do cook other kinds of food sometimes. I do eat different food when I go to his home. When my boyfriend eats with me including our weekly meal with my parents it's only 3-4 days eating some kind of Mexican cuisine. I'll start asking him where he'd like to go when I drive.

The place he walked to was like 5 minutes away but he thought he wouldn't have time to wait for take-out since take-out was a 35 minute wait. Usually the sit down places I go to are pretty quick, like get your food 10-15 minutes after ordering. When we realized the place I chose was slow he didn't have time to go back or place an order online. I acknowledge that just picking the restaurant on a whim driving by it instead of asking if he wanted to stop for food was wrong of me. I'll pick up something I know he likes and take it to him at work for lunch.",crow_of_paradise,6425,0.8500000238418579,2689,1714689861,2024-05-02 17:44:21,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cit51q/aita_for_not_going_to_another_restaurant_after_my/,5,2024
1cjk523,WIBTA If I kept some of the insurance money from my car (that my sister totaled),"Update #1: So far I’ve seen similar opinions from everyone and I appreciate everyone’s comment. We’re having a BBQ tonight since my sister just got back from school for the semester. I’m going to bring it up with everyone at dinner and I’ll post a second update letting everyone know how it went. 

Bit of background, I bought a new car in 2022 and gave my old one to my sister after she totaled her last one. Since then, my mother has been paying the car payment for her (she was a minor). With the payment history split between us, I've paid for 60% of the car to date, while my mother has paid the other 40%. My mother came in a told me they were looking at new vehicles today and that she wouldn't mind putting $4-6k down on a car if it meant a low interest and monthly payment (this money comes from the insurance payout being sent to me). I commented that I would need at least $1500 to pay off some credit card debt, and was told no. Now, I don't mind helping out, but I was just told that I wouldn't be receiving any of the insurance money meant to pay for my vehicle, because my younger sister needs it more? Why does the person who has totaled three vehicles in four years need to put $4k+ on a brand new vehicle, and $400 to pay off her credit card, but I can't get $1500 to pay off a credit card to make my life easier?   
  
Would I be the asshole splitting the money based on how it was paid? 60/40. The original loan was 48 months, we have 8 months left, I paid the first 20 and $1500 down, and my mother the second 20. That would give me $3500, much more than I originally asked for, and leave $2500 to pay off her credit card, and the rest as a down payment on another car. I feel like this is going to be an unreasonable offer considering they both assumed they would get the entire amount.

1cjksr1,AITA for asking a deaf person to stop signing in class because it was distracting? ,"First off, for some context, I am a music major in college and I’m all for accessibility, when, let’s say Joe, when Joe introduced himself and his interpreter I said wow! This is really interesting. Not because he’s hard of hearing but rather a deaf person majoring in something which specifically requires hearing is what baffled me. Everything was fine, we all got used to the interpreter being there and no one really payed attention to the fact that he was deaf. Except for one class. A class that everyone as music majors take, a performance recital class. In this class people take turns each week to Perform, in this class it was explained to us in the beginning of the year some of the basic common decency like clapping when they finish singing, not talking, turning off your phone, stuff like that. Just being nice for the performer… you know? Anyways, the year started off fine in this class, but lately you could tell he wasnt signing to his interpreter about the songs , the reason for this is because we sing opera/classical songs in this class so the interpreter didn’t know the language to be fair no one did so she definitely wasn’t translating the songs but rather just cracking jokes! He’s laughing! In the middle of the performances! You could just imagine as a performer seeing someone laugh as you are performing?!  On top of that, this is all happening in the front row! with the interpreter in front of the stage on the side laughing as well! Snickering and giggling all throughout the performance so much so that even one of the performers look to the side to see what happening but just kept singing and ignoring it. I tried ignoring it thinking you know what, he’s deaf, he already has a hard time, no need to bug him more but I finally had enough when a friend of mine sang her song and she and I previously translated the song, it was a very very sad song about death and deleteing yourself. What was Joe doing? Signing, not just signing, SMACKING his hands and laughing bout something else, he made a gesture that you do when someone is pregnant?!?!? You know like the making a circle over your stomach and rubbing anyways Maybe that means something else, but laughing like come on, not just quiet laughing btw audible snickering. Finally I had enough and went up to both him and the interpreter how I understand the need the translate the slate what the teacher is saying and everything the else but that the last song that by friend sang was not a funny song and that it was not only distracting but rude to be talking and laughing while someone is performing even so when your right smack in the front row. The interpreter stayed quiet and he just went on to say that I’m abilist and that it shouldn’t matter what he does because he’s dead and I can’t take he’s mean of communicating, but I’m not saying he should stop, I’m saying in the middle of performances to at least not laugh. Anyways, what do you guys think, AITA?

1cjlv3y,AITA for failing to stop my MIL buying ‘landfill’ for my kids at a funfair?,"
I went to a local funfair with my kids & mother in law (MIL).

We decided to walk around looking at all the rides before deciding what to go on. 

MIL had forgotten her wallet so it would be me buying any rides. (This let me relax about the sometimes tricky dynamic of who is paying for what.)

As we walked past a prize stall (pay money to win a prize), MIL commented in shock at the high price & I agreed.

At the next ride, my husband joined us. He & I were chatting when we noticed that MIL had gone back to the previous prize stall with the kids.

He asked urgently what I had agreed with her about that stall, & I (slightly confused at his urgency) remembered we had both thought it overpriced.

I knew she didn’t have money on her so I assumed they had just gone back to look.

We have disagreed with MIL many times about her excessive (in our view) gifts for the kids. Each visit she buys toys which soon get discarded, or more sweets & snacks than the kids can eat.

This is important to us because (a) we want to teach the kids moderation & value rather than excessive disposable expenditure, (b) we are worried about the environment & the excess of toys contributes to landfill, (c) while she has the right to use her money, the amount spent on this stuff feels wasteful when it could be used for more lasting things for the kids.

Back to the fun fair.

My husband insisted I tell him what I had “agreed” with MIL. We hadn’t agreed anything, I told him. We agreed it was priced too high?

I then noticed she had taken out her phone to pay using her contactless payment.

Husband said he didn’t want her buying it, & I said he should go tell her. He insisted he didn’t want to do that before finding out what I had agreed with her. 

I told him if he could see what was happening he should go & stop her.

By now it was finished & I said look it’s done now, it’s her money to spend & if she wants to have fun with the kids by spending £15 on a prize stall that’s up to her, & that I hadn’t “agreed” anything with her as I believed she had forgotten her wallet.

After we got home he picked a huge fight with me, telling me he was really distressed by the landfill of the prizes (the toys are already falling apart), & the repeated messages this kind of spending sends to the kids about the value of things. 

His main complaint at me is that when we first saw the stall before he joined us, he insists I should have told MIL not to buy it for the kids, & the facts that (a) I believed she had no means of paying & (b) had commented on how overpriced it was were not relevant, I still should explicitly have said that we didn’t want her to buy anything. 

I think this is unreasonable & would have made things really awkward at what was supposed to be a fun outing.

He says it’s my fault that MIL spent her money on poor quality prizes which will be landfill by next week.

1cjm3zb,AITA for kicking my MIL out of my house for being passive aggressive about my husband cleaning up?,"My husband, Tom, and I recently moved into our house, today we hosted our first dinner party with my mother in law (mil), FIL, BILs and their wives and SIL. I took a day off from the my business to make sure everything was perfect. I spent hours on my feet to make sure everything was perfect, I went grocery shopping, cleaned the house and cooked. By the time everyone got here I was exhausted but I still entertained everyone because I was so excited to have them over.



Everyone was having a good time, even MIL, I think its because Tom and I sat at opposite end of the table and she got to sit next to him. We moved to the living room to have dessert and that's when everything went to crap. I was in the kitchen with SIL plating up the desserts she brought and making more ice cream. A few minutes later Tom came back and started clearing up the dishes that were on the table, I didn't ask him to do this, he's just like this. MIL heard us talking and came to the kitchen and saw Tom loading the dishwasher, she asked if he knew what he was doing and he told he did.



MIL came in after Tom went back to the living room and said (I forgot some of the other stuff she said). ""PugLoverNo1565, if you needed help with cleaning up you could have asked us to do it instead of stressing Tom with it. He's not good at this sort of thing and he has had a long day at work. The key to happy marriage is working together and making life easier for each other. Tom works so hard, he bought this house and everything in it to make life easier for you. The least you can do is clean up"". I told her I didn't ask for help, Tom just helped because this is house too and he wants to make life easier for me. I also asked her if she realised it wasn't 1993 because Tom isn't a baby anymore he's capable of cleaning up, its not rocket science. I told her we don't need marriage advice, especially from her because she said something about making our marriage last while she's was on marriage number 3/7 at my age. She called me angry and said I had no need to be vicious, I told her I'd show her vicious and I left the room. MIL followed me to the door and I told her get out, she did and then started crying.



Everyone came to see what was going on and I told them I'm tired of MIL and her nastiness she tries to hide by being passive aggressive. FIL apologised for her and I told him I don't accept, she can apologise for herself or leave. Tom and his brother Andrew told her to apologise and she refused so I shut the door in her face and went to the kitchen. FIL and one of DH's brothers and his girlfriend left soon after. The rest that stayed had a good time and they left two hours ago.



All hell has broken loose and I'm getting messages basically calling me an asshole. I don't think I was but Tom and everyone who stayed is biased because they can't stand MIL, so I don't know.

1cke3wt,AITA for having a bigger reaction to a strangers gift then my husbands?,"For Context: I 30F just had birthday, my husband got me 30 gifts to mark the event. Nothing big, just different little items. None of the items were anything I’d buy myself in particular. My husband has the habit of buying things he likes or finds cool but not really thinking of the other person. For example: one of the items was a nice set of colored pencils, I have a specific art style and only draw with black pens. Or a nice vase that is very specifically his style. 

However I was still extremely grateful and made sure he knew this. 

My sisters own a bar, so I go there and am around quite often. They have a regular who comes to the bar maybe 2 times a week for the last 2 years so I see him pretty frequently. I’d never seen him outside of the bar. We have a joke about how aliens are probably watching all of us and every once in a while throw crazy things at us just to see how it plays out. 

Anyways the other day we went in to have drinks for my birthday, the regular came and told me happy birthday and handed my a small pouch. In the pouch was 100 dollars and a small silver alien holding a diamond. Also a note that said, “I’m hoping the aliens give you everything you deserve.”

I started crying, it was just so thoughtful especially since I was expecting anything. I thanked him and gave a hug, he went about his way. My husband was acting strangely the rest of the night. When we got home I asked what was wrong and he told me that he was upset about the way I reacted to the gift. He said I didn’t act that way about his gift that he worked really hard on. He said that it was inappropriate for the regular to give me a gift. He said I was a AH for reacting that way especially in front of him. But it was just a natural reaction. He doesn’t want me to keep the gift. 

I feel really badly but I want to keep the gift. So AITA? 

Not a real diamond and he gives $100 to all the staff on their birthday. 

I just want to thank everyone for the responses, it gave me a lot to think on. I will say this an a man twice my age, I’m 99% sure he likes men and in no way it remotely flirtatious in my opinion. Also this was not a ring or piece of jewelry it’s just something you put on a desk.

1cl4gmd,AITA for not treating my step daughter like my daughter?,"Iam 38F married to my husband 42M. Back when I was 16 I gave birth to my daughter, Mary, dad deadbeat but we’re fine now anyways. I started business in my early 20s and now Im considerably wealthy. My husband has a daughter, jane, who’s only 1 year older than Mary. We got married 2 years ago and one of our main “aims” with this marriage was to have a nice accompany as we both had almost the same experience with love/sex/birth as his ex left him with Jane just like my ex left me with Mary. However,Im objectively wealthier than my husband, he’s not poor , I just make more money and finances never been a main topic to us both thankfully. 

Now Mary works in a certain institution and makes her own money and pays her own bills. But I also like to spoil her with money and luxury and we travel alot together sometimes I give her money to travel alone. Like she’s fine on her own financially but I give her always. Also Mary has a boyfriend he’s somewhat well off and always pays for their dates so Mary wanted to surprise him on his birthday but her plans were kind off above budget so I paid the rest. 

Everything was fine until  Jane called me saying she wants me to give her 2K for her and her friends to travel for a little vacation. I told her 2K for a vacation is alot I can help her with sone but she then brought up everything I get and pay for Mary and never her. I told her because Mary has no one but me, as my husband doesn’t contribute anything to Mary so obviously I’ll direct my efforts to her and she also work she doesn’t just depend on me. Let’s just say that phone call wasn’t the nicest. 

I know the whole perception of if you marry someone with kids then they’re your kids too, sure Jane is not a kid she was 21 when I got married to her father. So that’s why it was never logical for me to become her mother just like she never tried to become my daughter just like my husband never tried to be Mary’s father. This family started with all adults and I never try to separate Jane and her father nor get between them.

1clw8w7,AITA for not wanting to attend my brother’s wedding because and for calling my SIL rules stupid? ,"Im 27F dentist and my brother 32M and his soon wife 27F are getting married in less than 2 months. Let’s call my SIL Abby. Abby and I never had a relationship of our own. We definitely don’t hate each other but we are not besties. We just exist in each others presence.
I noticed that in the invitation to their weeding that Abby requested the dress code to be all women in the wedding to wear off the shoulder dresses, suits or anything just off the shoulder. Doesn’t matter the color or the sequence unless it is off the shoulder.

Now as I said I am a dentist and as many people already know dentists may not have the best back/shoulder posture ever. And Im not an exception and I always tend to wear outfits that do not emphasize that part of my body.  Now the type of clothing this dress code demands needs someone with a good back posture because that’s the emphasis. I totally lack that and yes I did try one dress of the shoulder on looked absolutely horrendous.

So I asked if I the dress code is really that important and if I have to abide it but my brother told me Abby stressed on this dress code so much. And Abby was like if she “leeways” me she has to leeway everyone (I was kinda baffled that so much importance was placed on a certain type of clothing with no explanation given) 

I went with my friend shopping hoping I’d find one that I looked not so clownery in. I tried on so many different fits, looked like shit in all of them. So I told my mother since they are so attached to that dress code then I think the best option here for me is to not go. So I wouldn’t ruin their organization and I wouldn’t have nightmares about how awful I looked in that event. But my mum got mad at me and said Im being dramatic for not wanting to be there for brother and family just for a dress. I told her I want to attend but I also want to look good and feel pretty and they are sticking to such a stupid rule that they can’t provide a meaning. Regardless I respected that and decided not to ruin their image of how they want their wedding. My mum said my absence will also ruin things because the guests will wonder why the sister is not attending when Im healthy. I told her well the guests will also wonder why I look like I could be the guy of hunchback Notre Dam (okay Im not that bad but you get the gist here) My mum is still mad at me (haven’t told my brother and SIL yet)",Useful_Flower2687,2607,0.8899999856948853,2034,1715034868,2024-05-06 17:34:28,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1clw8w7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_attend_my_brothers/,5,2024
1clxt18,AITA for not putting off school to take in my nephews?,"Throwaway for privacy.

I (30F) have a very small, not very close family. I have an aunt and uncle, who have three children (my cousins, two of whom are still minors) and I had my sister (40f). My parents have passed away. My sister and I weren't very close. She had three boys (9,7, and 6) and was a single mom. 

Last year I was accepted to a PhD program. I am set to start in the fall and I plan on moving in a couple months to get settled before the semester starts.

My sister passed away just after the start of the year. She had some health issues that unfortunately caught up with her. Obviously I was still upset to hear of her passing and went to her funeral. After the funeral, my aunt and uncle asked to meet.

My nephews are staying with them for the time being, but they want me to take over their care. I explained to them that I couldn't since I was moving soon to attend my program. They urged me to put it off. I told them it didn't work like that. I couldn't put things off until all three of the boys were able to be on their own. They asked if I could take them with me and I told them that wasn't possible. 

We went back and forth, until everyone became very upset and we parted ways. Both of them have been calling, texting, and emailing me. They are getting more and more aggressive and this weekend my aunt called my a selfish little asshole and she couldn't believe how I was handling this. They both want me to put off going to school to take care of my nephews.

She cried to my mom about how rude I was to her and how I don’t love her or my  nephew. My parents tried to convince me to go half with them on a phone to make it up to my sister and I said no. My mom also offered to get the new phone through her carrier and we could do monthly payments. I said no again stating my sister is not my responsibility.

My mom admitted that my parents and my sister have had some money issues because everything is up in price and I told my mom it took two people to make that baby so it’s time to get child support from the dad.

My mom called me an asshole for that and said she doesn’t even want to see me this weekend and I’m ok about it after this argument.

1cnhi4x,AITA for not getting my daughter anything for her birthday?,"My daughter turned 13 yesterday. I made sure to ask her what she wants for her birthday a few months in advance. She gave me a list. Great. I explained she won't be getting everything from the list as it was big and some things were expensive. She understood.

About a week after we had that conversation, she tells me she wants tickets to a show for her birthday. Going to the show would also mean traveling a little out of the city. Neither are cheap. So I told her that would be the only gift she would get and would also replace a party. She said that's what she wants and I triple checked before I booked tickets.

A couple of weeks ago, would you believe, she tells me she changed her mind again. She wants clothes instead of the show. I told her I already booked everything so there's absolutely no way. She got into a strop about it and said she isn't going. I told her fine I'll take someone else, fully expecting her to later apologize and say she is coming.

But the apology never came. In fact her attitude got worse and she got into trouble at school. She asked me if I got her the clothes and I told her no, I'm sticking to my word. I don't think she believed me. Well her birthday came and she realized I wasn't bluffing. I didn't get her any gifts. She was appalled and I was the worst mother ever. I told her she's learned a valuable lesson. I really wanted to make her birthday special but she was being awful. Of course other relatives got her things but none from me.

She told her grandparents her side of the story. Which was of course all one sided making her out as a victim. They called me and I explained to them the whole truth. They also think I'm awful and the ""poor girl"" needs gifts from her mother. I told them next year will be different if she behaves.

1cnie84,AITA for evicting my brother and his family from the house I have inherited so my daughter can live there?,"I(40f) have a daughter ""Caroline"" (17f), my brother ""Adam"" (34m) is married and has 2 kids under the age of 5.

Back when I was in my twenties our great grandmother ended up with an illness which required someone to take care of her. This ended up being me as everyone else was busy with their lives and I have only recently graduated from uni back then. Due to this when she passed away I have inherited the house she lived in, which is a small 2 bedroom. I have lived there until I got married and me and my husband ended up moving to a bigger property. About a year later my brother asked if I'm willing to rent it out to him, which I agreed to do, but have warned him I will need it back when Caroline turns 18 (She was 3 at the time) since it is very close to universities and city center. Legal agreement was drafted for the rent (significantly below market value) so everything was followed by the book.

About a year ago I have informed my brother about needing the house back as my daughter is going to be 18 and I would like to have some repairs done before she moves in. My brother ignored me, so I have issued him notice to vacate, which was also ignored. As he continued to ignore me, I had no choice but apply for a court order to evict them, with hearing taking place last month. Last week him and his family were officially evicted. Upon getting into the house I have noticed it wad in horrible condition and it would take a few months just to make it somewhat habitable, let alone do redecorating or repairs.

I have raised this with my brother since he was meant to look after the house and let me know of any repairs, but this talk ended up in an argument where I was called an asshole for evicting him and his family so my ""spoiled"" daughter can live by herself and not giving them enough notice (they had just over a year to find something suitable).

1cob8oh,AITA for accepting a part in a play even though my boyfriend doesn't approve?,"I (16, F) have been a part of my school's theater company since I was in middle school. Theater means a lot to me, and it's given me a community of silly, talented, amazing people that make up my core friend group. While they would get all the leads for each show (both at our school and local community theaters), I never got anything higher than an ensemble part or a part with a few lines, and it always hurt me a lot because I would feel excluded. I've never let myself feel too discouraged by this, and I've been able to do a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff for shows I'm not a huge part of, like building sets, making props, and directing. This would always be super fun, but never as fun as being onstage and being a part of all the inside jokes my other friends would bring up outside of rehearsals (and this only added to me feeling excluded).

Anyway, me and my friends all auditioned for a local teen production of Little Shop of Horrors last week, with four of us (including me) all auditioning for Audrey. We audition, and I think I do pretty well, but part of me knows I won't get the part. Well, yesterday, the cast list came out, and to my surprise, I GOT AUDREY!! I'm so excited and still buzzing over the fact that I finally have a lead, and one of my dream roles no less. All of my friends were extremely supportive and there was no tension among any of us over the results of the cast list, so I accepted the part right away before dancing around my room and going out for ice cream with my friends. 

When I got back, I texted my boyfriend of a year (17, M) about the news, expecting congratulations and excitement (since he knows how big of a deal finally getting a lead is for me), but instead, he told me I should reject the part because I'd have to kiss the guy playing Seymour, and also generally act romantically around him onstage, and that makes him uncomfortable. The guy playing Seymour is one of my close friends I've known since 7th grade, and our relationship has always been purely platonic (he also has a boyfriend of his own). I can see how my boyfriend would be uncomfortable since I'd be acting romantically with someone who isn't him, and with someone I'm pretty close to. I told him I already accepted my part and he left me on read, and I don't really know how I'm feeling at the moment. I'm hurt because he hasn't congratulated me, but I feel bad for potentially hurting him and accepting the part without talking to him about how it would affect our relationship.

1cobi5n,AITA For Wanting Mothers Day to be About Me? ,"I (30f) gave birth last year and so this year will be my first Mothers Day this Sunday. This upcoming Monday also happens to be my MILs (63f) birthday. Every year my husband (32m), and his brothers ( 29M, 25M) and FIL have celebrated both MILs birthday and Mothers Day on the same day no matter what day Mothers Day fell on that year. I was all too happy to celebrate both occasions with them because I lost my mom when I was 8 to ovarian cancer so I never really celebrated Mothers Day until I met my husband.

This year however, I would like to celebrate Mothers Day with just myself, my husband, and our daughter. I tried to encourage other plans on Saturday, a day filled with fun, food, and activities that MIL likes but have been shot down. I even asked if the three of us could do breakfast/brunch and then we go over to MILs to celebrate but this was also unacceptable. Both Mothers Day and birthday must be celebrated on the same day. I tried to talk to MIL about it but she said that this is the way it's been for years and it isn't going to change now and that maybe we (my husband and I) can do Mothers Day things another day.

So this is where I might be the asshole; I told my husband he is welcome to go and spend the whole day with his mom, dad, and brothers but I will be staying home and celebrating with the wee potato who made me a mom, we're going to watch Bluey and make tiny blueberry pancakes (her favourite, lol). My husband says I'm being unreasonable and that we can celebrate another time, that his mom just loves celebrating being a mom and her birthday together with the ones she loves and that it would be awkward if her first grandchild isn't there to help her celebrate (BILs have partners but do not have children yet). I told him I am standing firm on this and he got angry and went to our room.

1cp1h69,AITA for not wanting to walk her down the aisle or lie in a speech?,"I (41M) have two kids with my ex wife, (42F) a son John(22) and daughter Sally (20), I'm remarried to my wife (28). I'm very close with my kids, my son is engaged to Abbie, she seems nice but has been a bit pushy trying to create relationships with me and my wife, though she's also awkward with her. Abbie isn't close to her family, she told us many stories why and while some of her complaints don't seem awful, it's not my place to judge and I didn't live it so I can't know anyway. 

We've tried to be welcoming but Abbie has forced her way into some family traditions where she wouldn't have been invited, and some where no one outside of specific family would have. She has been calling Sally ""sis"" since they were only dating a few months, has an odd sister/mother-in-law thing she does with my wife, and the one I'm not a fan of, wants me to be like father to her. Not because we've clicked or anything. We are very different people, not saying that in a bad way, just saying it's not based on how we get along or anything. 

My kids and I have a tradition when they come over that we have a private catch-up in my office/study before they leave, which is now even more important to them because while they both get along well with my wife they don't want to have personal conversations around her yet. Abbie asked if we could talk, and after I explained the tradition John later asked that I do it, saying she'd never had a caring conversation with her dad. We compromised that I didn't include her in the tradition but do join the two of them for coffee and let her talk. Then she started calling me dad, they werent even engaged yet, John pulled me aside and begged me to give her that, laid this whole thing on me about me always being the dad she always wanted right in front of her and she just wanted that, told me she cried watching me and Sally together (she still gives me random hugs, I'm a lucky dad). I didn't like it but I do feel bad so fine I gave her that. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and the father/daughter dance. I don't want to walk her down, and I walk with a cane so dancing is hard. At my own wedding I only danced twice. John is begging for me to do one, preferably the aisle. 

They came over Sunday, John and I were talking, I thought to address it, when Ab walked in without knocking, asking if he'd told me yet. I asked what, John said she wanted me to say something about having a second daughter now in my speech and how I loved her. I just looked at him. She asked if I'd do the walk and dance for Sally, I said of course. She yelled she's my daughter too and I said it will never be the same, Sally is my actual daughter.

1cp3df4,AITA for not giving my sister any of my money even though I am in a significantly better financial situation?,"My (26F) sister (32F) ""Bethy"" and I are both stay-at-home moms. I have 1F twins; she has three sons, 6M, 4M, and 2M.

My husband, Micheal, is a master plumber who makes excellent money; he owns his own business, and I couldn't be prouder of him. I used to be a librarian; I have my MLS and bachelor's in Education. During the birth of our girls, on the way to the hospital in the ambulance, we hit a speed bump, and I was injured. I am now an ambulatory wheelchair user and attend physical therapy, as I am learning to walk again. I hurt from my hips down, but my babies are worth it. We decided I would be a SAHM after my first surgery, and my husband gives me $3000/month to use how I want to, as ""payment for being such a good mom"" We are extraordinarily blessed financially, and I'm happy being able to see my girls growing up.

Bethy's husband, Jackson, is an elementary school teacher, but teaching doesn't pay much in our state. Bethy has been a SAHM for the entirety of her marriage and is used to having to scrimp and save for things.

She asked me out for coffee recently and I accepted. I was chatting with her when I mentioned that our girls would start baby swim classes soon. I was happy the pool was wheelchair accessible. Bethy started ranting about how expensive swimming lessons are and how she could never afford to put her boys in swimming. I said I was also excited about playgroup this week, as I had been nervous to go the first time we had gone because none of the other moms and dads in the group used mobility aids. When I mentioned the name of the playgroup I go to with my girls, Bethy became angry because it's one of the more expensive playgroups.

She was angry because ""I knew money was tight."" and ""I didn't even think to invite her and Jackson's son because then she wouldn't have to pay for daycare. She then asked if my husband gave me an allowance. She was a bit angry, and people were starting to stare, so I said yes and asked her to keep her voice down. She wondered how much it was, and I told her. She asked if I could give it to her, and I told her no because I like to treat myself after my physio appointments, and I want to save as much as possible for a rainy day fund.

Bethy said she and her husband have nothing but rainy days and left the restaurant without paying. I feel embarrassed and ashamed that I'm not helping her when I know I could. Still, when I asked Micheal he said that my sister could get a job and reminded me that I became a SAHM because it was something we agreed we were financially stable enough to do as well as because of my mobility limitations. He also said I deserve nice things and shouldn't have to give them up just because my sister wants me to.

I feel conflicted, AITA? If more people think I am, I'll consider giving her the monthly payment; I feel guilty for not helping.",SAHMAITAThrowRA,2275,0.9399999976158142,658,1715383471,2024-05-10 18:24:31,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cp3df4/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_any_of_my_money/,5,2024
1cpsggj,AITA for asking my friends what flavor their wedding cake is?,"I (22f) am in the wedding party of my friends we will call Em(25f) and Roe(25m) who will be getting married in about 2 months. I have been really excited for the wedding since it'll be an opportunity for all the friends from college to get together for the first time in 2 years. Not to mention Em and Roe are my best friends, or at least I thought they were. 

We have a discord for all the wedding stuff and they have a channel about food. They've been really good about being open about the food they intend to have at the reception including vegan/vegitarian/gluten free options for everyone and answering questions so I didn't think there would be any contention if I asked a question. 

Anyway, about 4 days ago I posted a message into the discord asking ""Hey, what flavor is the cake gonna be? I wanna mentally prepare myself lol."" I think looking back my choice of extra words is what caused all this, but I meant it in the sense that I have a long documented dislike of chocolate flavored foods like cake or ice cream.  So I added it in the event the cake was chocolate. 

I recieved a private message back that the cake would be chocolate and that if I had a problem with it then I could ""shove it"" cause it was their wedding not mine. And i felt really taken aback by this response. 

Never did I mention that I would have been upset and I certainly wouldn't have put up a stink about it. Its exactly like Em had said, it's their wedding. I explained as much and tried to apologize for any offending I did but she got even more defensive and started basically blasting me for implying that she was offended and I was just left overall very confused. 

I gave it two days before I tried to apologize again and smooth it over figuring she may have just been having a bad day but I got shut down again telling me she didn't need my apology cause nothing was wrong and I needed time stop trying to make it seem like shit was wrong between us and to just drop it. 

I texted Roe to see if I could gauge what was going on since he and I have always had an open dialogue about things like this but he basically just told me he couldn't talk to me right now and I have to imagine its cause Em told him not to. 

Its been 2 days since then and I'm just really confused. This whole thing has made me want to drop out of the wedding party and honestly not go at all. I wish Roe would talk to me and Em would be honest. I can't help but think maybe I just don't get how stressful planning a wedding is and like maybe theyve gotten pushback from other people on other things and somehow its being taken out on me? Or is it really a big no no to ask stuff like this? I don't know?

1cpt7jl,AITA for revealing at a Dinner I am the one who makes more money?,"A little context for this post I (33F) have been dating my Partner (34M) casually for 3 years and 8 months. Over the last 8 months we have gotten more serious. He works in IT and as I ""Only"" work behind a bar in a strip club he seemed to always assume I make much less than him, he'd always say that he never wanted us to discuss money as he didn't want me to feel embarrassed so I never brought it up as I didn't care even if I found it a bit funny despite the fact I own both my car and home while he is renting and paying off his car.

I like him though so I brushed it aside figuring if we ever moved in together then we could talk about our finances and be open about it. Despite him thinking I only work behind the bar, I am actually a Mixologist at a high end Strip Club, so on top of a very generous salary I actually make amazing tips most nights too, i've worked at the same place for 9 years and I love it there.

As things are getting more serious he wanted me to meet his parents and I agreed, yesterday we had dinner with his parents and they clearly didn't approve of me and during the dinner his Mother brought up that she didn't think this was a good idea but if he was insisting on doing this when we got married we'd need to have a prenuptial agreement to protect her son. I was silent waiting for my partner to say anything but he didn't. He just continued to eat and I got annoyed before agreeing with her. I told her I fully agreed that we needed a Prenup as i'd need to protect my assets, this led to some laughs from around the table and I finally asked my boyfriend how much he made, he tried to brush it off before finally revealing he made £25,000 a year and telling me it was fine and not to feel less.

I won't lie I burst into laughter right there at the table not caring that I was being rude and bluntly told him not including my tips I make £43,291 a year they didn't believe me so I began to point out how I go on holiday twice a year, how I own my home and car while he rents and is paying off, how I always bought him nice gifts. I then told him for perhaps the hundredth time that i'm a Mixologist not a Bartender.

The dinner got silent and on the drive to my home he berated me the entire time for embarrassing him, and how could I have not told him I made that much money, that I should have told him from the start. I reminded him that he didn't want us to talk about money and I figured when and if we one day moved in together that we'd talk about our finances then. He kept talking about how I should have just privately told him after the dinner then and not embarrassed him in front of his parents but when I asked him then why he didn't defend me when his mother embarrassed me he had no answer.

I don't know i'm just super annoyed right now and feel done with this, was I wrong to reveal it the way I did?",MediumChart5892,1959,0.9399999976158142,747,1715467284,2024-05-11 17:41:24,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cpt7jl/aita_for_revealing_at_a_dinner_i_am_the_one_who/,5,2024

1cqljhp,AITA for refusing to wear the dress my mother-in-law bought me?,"About 2 weeks ago was my brother-in-law's wedding and they were VERY clear that it was a formal event and they wanted everyone dressed nicely. My MIL told me that the dress I planned to wear wasn't formal enough and offered to buy me one that would fit the occasion better since I don't exactly have the money to buy myself a fancy dress right now. Let me be clear that I LOVE my MIL and I was very grateful for her offer. I sent her a link to a dress that I liked and she agreed to order it and have it shipped to me. 

The dress came the other day and it's NOT the one I asked for. It's nice, but its not what I wanted. Its a completely different cut and color from what I asked her to get. Even though it's a nice dress I hated the way it looked on me, so I just wore the dress I was originally planning to wear. It didn't perfectly fit the dress code but I figured it was close enough. Apparently not because the moment my MIL saw me she was asking why I wore it instead of the dress she bought me. She was very upset at me for not wearing the other dress considering she paid for it (which I understand but it still wasn't what I asked for).

When I told her it was the wrong dress she said that she ordered a different one on purpose because she thought it would ""fit me better"". Which it didn't because it looked awful on me. She also said the one I sent her was a bit pricey, but she's not exactly living paycheck to paycheck, she has the money for it. She let it go after a while but I'm starting to feel bad for it. I wasted her money and looking back what I wore did stick out a bit.

My sister and I are opposites.  She is a dog mom (god I hate writing that) to an extreme degree, My wife and I are not dog people.  When she got the invite she reached out and said her, her boyfriend, and 2 dogs (Small 10 pound dogs) would be there.  I was annoyed and called her to tell her no, her dogs are not allowed.  

She asked if kids were going, I said yes, some were.  She said well her dogs are family and they should be able to come.  I told her I don't consider your dogs family.  In fact I think your crazy for thinking that your dogs are my family.  She argued her dogs were just as much family as the kids were.  She said her dogs wanted to see their uncles new backyard.  I told her to shut up and never say that again to me.  I re-affirmed that her and her boyfriend could come, but nothing else from their house.  She got angry but I eventually hung up.

1cs4uw5,AITA because I didn't want to cook a steak on mother's day?,"I (40f) and my husband (41m) have been married 21 years. We have several children the oldest is 20 the youngest is 5. 
Mother's day has always been a point of contention. I really wish he would do something nice for me but he always tells me ""you aren't my mom,"" and does nothing noteworthy. It's gotten worse over the years and came to a boiling point two days ago (mother's day) 
I had reminded everyone that mother's day was coming up but on the day everyone except our 20 and 18 year olds forgot. 20m works all day he came over late in the evening, and 18 said happy mother's Day in the morning before he left for work.  I can't really fault the other  kids for it as many of them are young. By noon I was almost in tears. 

When my husband came out of his man cave and told me he wanted me to cook steak for lunch I almost broke down crying. I cook almost every day for everyone and I really just did not want to cook on mothers day. 

I left the house, went for a walk and bought myself a pizza. When I came home I put his steak in the air fryer. Which was apparently wrong and he got mad about it. 
As he was scolding me over cooking the steak wrong I started crying and said ""it's mother's day!! "" And his response was.... 
He yelled at me for wanting to be the center of attention and told me ""you aren't my mother! You did not give birth to me!"" 

He spent the rest of the day angry at me. He refused to eat the rest of the day. He said he wanted steak to be something nice we did together and I said I didn't want to have to cook because it was mother's day and I wanted him to do something for me but he didn't want to so I went for pizza alone. 

Around dinner time he made a steak and I thought it was for him as I had already eaten but he put it in front of me and told me I better enjoy it. I ate about half it was a huge steak the size of the plate.

I tried to talk to him later he got angry and stormed out. The next day he was still angry. I told him he really hurt my feelings and he said ""you say every other day that I'm hurting your feelings. You always take things wrong, so I guess I just won't talk at all that way you can't take anything wrong."" 

He wants me to act happy so I've been trying to but now it's been two days and he's still angry with me. He keeps sitting on the couch arms crossed refusing to speak or anything. 

Maybe I should have just cooked the steak and not gone out? Am I being unreasonable, after all I'm not his mom. It's just that, as the mother of his children it would be nice to be celebrated on mothers day for once.

He is obese and survives off of welfare cheques from the Canadian government. He is capable of working but chooses not to. My wife on the other hand (26F) moved out at 18, self-funded a degree, works in a good field (80K annually), got married, and has never sought a hand-out from her parents or her grandparents even though they both have the means.

We spent our vacation time the last two years visiting her grandparents who live across the country. Recently her grandparents (85), moved out of their house and into retirement living and no longer had space for both of their vehicles. Her grandpa decided to gift my BIL a truck with a fair value of $50,000. His justification was to ""help him build confidence"" and ""give him something to care for."" My wife was given nothing and they did not do anything to even out the gift.

We have a trip planned to visit them in a few months, but I have no interest in going to see them. I am mad at myself for letting money ruin my perception of them, but I do not appreciate how my wife was treated. I feel they take her for granted. We always go out of our to visit them. All of our trips are self-funded. We have never asked anything of them while lots of her cousins have been baled out financially. I just have an icky feeling about the whole thing.

My wife got upset when I told her I wanted to do something else with our vacation time. She got really upset and it led to an argument. She took the stance we have to enjoy our time with them while we have it.

My wife and I are currently saving for our first house, paying off student loans, and saving for our first child. We still drive my very first car I bought 10 years ago.

1cuhn0r,AITA for telling my girlfriend not to call my dad “doctor”?,"

My(28m) girlfriend recently got her doctorate. I’m obviously very happy for her and proud of her. 

Since then, she has been greeting my father as “Doctor” [lastname]. Although he does have a doctorate degree, no one has ever called him that, and he told me it makes him uncomfortable. 

I asked her to not call him that. She says that she wants to be polite and call him by his title. She now wants to be called doctor when might parents greet her as well. 

I understand it’s a massive accomplishment but I don’t think she should expect my parents to call her doctor? And she should not call my dad doctor if he asks her not to. 

She thinks I’m trying to downplay what she did but I’m not.

1cujoln,AITA for not letting my neighbors use my backyard?,"Created an account to ask.

My partner and I (F30s) just got some new neighbors. They moved in about a month ago. We met them briefly. They are a couple around our age and a daughter who might be 4 or 5, and a dog. 

We have our backyard fully fenced in with a privacy fence. Their yard doesn't. I was out front last weekend when the couple came up our driveway and started chatting. They mentioned that they were on a waiting list to get their yard fenced in but were told it would be a few months. They said they would really like their daughter and dog to have a place to run around but didn't feel comfortable with the lack of fence (our neighborhood backs up to a wooded area and a creek). 

They asked if they could borrow our backyard for a few hours a day so they could let everyone run worry free. I admittedly immediately didn't like this, but I told them I would think about it.

I talked to my partner, and we both agreed this wasn't a good idea. We have two dogs ourselves, and they can be a tad protective of their yard. One of them also doesn't love kids and the other one can be a tad dog selective. Because of this, we would have to coordinate when we could let our dogs out and that's just not something we want to deal with. There are just too many things that could go wrong. Plus that good ole American worry that if someone got hurt we could get sued. 

The guy stopped by again on Wednesday and asked if we had given it any thought. I told him we had discussed it, and unfortunately it just wasn't going to work out with our dogs and their schedule so we wouldn't be able to accommodate them. He immediately got sour and said it was nice to know how neighborly we were. He left abruptly but I could hear him muttering under his breath.

Him and his wife have made a big show of snuffing us the last couple of days. My partner said they will get over it, and while I'm not going to reconsider, I do feel kind of guilty.

1cv9vho,AITA for making my sister-in-law pay for a professional cleaning service after she cooked in my kitchen?,"Last week, I invited my sister-in-law, who loves cooking, to stay with us. She offered to cook dinner as a way to show her gratitude. However, I have a meticulously organized and spotless kitchen due to my severe anxiety around mess and disorder, something that my family is well aware of.

Despite this, after she cooked, the kitchen was left in what I would consider a disastrous state—spills on the counter, pots not cleaned properly, and utensils misplaced. It took me hours just to calm down after seeing the mess. The next day, I calmly explained how distressed it made me feel and asked if she could cover the cost of a professional cleaning service to restore it to its original condition.

She was shocked and upset by my request, arguing that she had already contributed by buying groceries and spending her evening cooking for us. My husband thinks I was too harsh and should have cleaned it myself or let it go this time. This has caused tension between us and his sister.

1cva3j9,AITA for not moving my wedding date? *UPDATE*,"Hey everyone! It's been a while (I forgot my password), but a few people asked for updates on how my last post turned out. Unfortunately, a lot of you may not like the answer. 

Almost all of you said not to change the date, and to enjoy my time without them there. I followed half of that advice. I eventually did relent to my family and change the date of the wedding. My fiancé (now husband!) said that the date wasn't as important as my happiness, and the fighting with my parents was destroying that. Now after six months, we both wish we hadn't because it was useless.

They still didn't show up. Not only that, but they convinced 90% of my family not to show up either. I ended up with only four relatives there in a crowd of about 100 guests.

My mother claimed that I had been ""excluding her from planning"" (by scheduling venue tours on days that my fiance and I were both free but I didn't realize she was working, and by finding my dress by surprise on a ""just here to look"" trip without her being there). They hadn't shown any interest in planning, so I mainly didn't want to bother them. To them, this was ""clearly a sign that you don't want us there"". So they went out of town on the new date.

In the end, narcissist mother still got her yoga, I still moved my date, and I still walked myself down the aisle.

But my petty self did, in fact, strike back. I had an amazing time, and I made sure that I left obvious empty seats marked for them and told everyone the truth with a smile when they asked. The few family members that did show are now no longer speaking to them either, as are all of the friends who came. The only exception is my brother (who I'm pretty sure they asked to relay the details of the party to them), and even he has almost entirely cut them out due to how they've acted.

I haven't spoken to my mother since about a month before the wedding, when she told me to get all of my old things out of her house. I speak to my father very rarely, and only over things like deaths in the family. My in-laws have basically taken me in as their own, and I'm far happier than I ever was in the nightmare of a family I grew up with. Life is good.

1cvanvk,AITA for questioning my husband about cross contamination in his food truck?,"Backstory: My husband runs a food truck with his mom in the summer and maintains a daily full time job, I work full time in mental health. We often bicker about everything from who forgot to fill the water pitcher last to whether our mother's are disrespectful to each other. We have a pattern of questioning each other on stuff we know the other knows more about. Further context, I don't work on his truck, but I do maintain the paperwork side of it (accounting, licensing, food safety certifications, etc).

The situation: I brought our toddler up to the truck today to see daddy and grandma, otherwise he doesn't get to see them as much in the summer. A customer asked what they had that was gluten free, and he said they have corn chips for the nachos and corn tortillas. We marinate all our meat by hand and buy fresh veggies and queso for toppings, but we do toast the corn tortillas and the flour tortillas on the same pan for the tacos. So I asked, ""but what about cross contamination?"" in front of the customer. He kind of snapped at me and said, ""it's fine, it's not a problem.""

1cvat3q,AITA For Requesting My Husband and Kids not Wear Noise-Cancelling Headphones?,"I (43f) have two children (M14 and F13) with my husband (M44). 

Both my kids, and my husband all have noise cancelling headphones. Airpods, beats, you name it (And fun fact, today I found out that my son had a box of Airpods Maxes in his closet, and I'm pretty sure those are mine) and honestly, I don't like when the wear both earbuds, or have headphones full on on their head. 

I don't like the fact that when they wear them, I could be screaming their name to the top of my lungs, and they still can't hear me. If something happens, I would want them to be able to hear me. In fact, even when my son is doing the dishes i could be saying his name and he wouldn't even know I was there.

I considered (and went through with) asking them to not not wear headphones in the house, but just no noise cancelling or one side in one side out. They all obviously put up a fight about it, saying that ""I can just call them,"" but what if something happens where I need to get their attention, but can't reach my phone?

She has always been a huge fan of a lot of rock bands, particularly emo bands. This by itself doesn't bother me at all, in fact I love the music too and we go to concerts together all the time. What bothers me is that she has posters of these bands tacked up everywhere around our house. Our bedroom walls are COVERED in them. And I mean covered. There is not a single inch of wall space in our bedroom that is not dedicated to her band posters. Everywhere I go, everything I do, therd are always eyes of a hundred emo men following me around. It sounds stupid, and it probably is to be honest, but I don't think I can stand another night's sleep feeling like I am being watched constantly. I don't want to be ""watched"" by the members of My Chemical Romance or Taking Back Sunday or 21 pilots as we make love.

1cwtc4p,WIBTA if I bought a car my wife couldn’t drive?,"WIBTA if I bought a car my wife can’t drive?

I need to buy a new car, and I would love to have a manual transmission. It’s my one non-negotiable. I grew up driving manual, and I miss it deeply. All of my cars have been inherited, so I’ve never had a say in my car’s features/specs. This will be the first car I’ve purchased for myself. Finally, I’m a “car guy.” I enjoy driving, and I’ve always wanted a sporty car, but also have it fit my needs.

My wife is 7 months pregnant and bought herself a new mid-size SUV last year (with her own money). She views cars as a way of getting from A to B, with practically and comfort.

Note: we have to park our cars back-to-front in our gravel driveway, with one car being in the garage. I will widen the driveway, which I can do it in a weekend, so we can park our cars side-by-side.

We have mostly separate finances, but have a joint CC and checking account, which we both contribute to monthly. The rest is our personal money that we keep in personal bank accounts (including separate savings and separate investments).

I’m paying the down payment and monthly payments on the new car. So I feel the decision is mine, but happy to listen to my wife’s thoughts (reciprocation from her car purchase). 

When I started the car buying process, I went with sport compacts (which are in my budget). Based on our prior discussions, the car has to be a daily commuter for me, allow me to take the kid(s) to/from Daycare, and quick local trips.

My wife thinks these cars are too small and cannot fit our needs with a baby and a potential second child. She says there’s not enough space for kids stuff (there is) and the backseats won’t fit two backward-facing car seats (they will). I’ve tried to show her my research, but she refused to watch the videos or read the articles I’ve bookmarked. 

Her main sticking point is she won’t be able to drive it because it’s a manual. She’s concerned she won’t be able to drive it when she’ll need to (in an emergency). I told her I’m happy to teach her manual, but at first she flat out refused to learn. Now she says she’ll learn, but gives an excuse of how we’ll be too busy. I said if it’s that important she drive the car, her mom can stay for a weekend to watch the baby and we can take a day for her to learn. Again, she said we won’t have time. 

Every time we discuss it, she accuses me of ignoring our family and that she needs to be able to drive the car. I say she’s creating a false dichotomy, and the car I want can fit our needs. I also argue that her car can be the big family car for trips or hauling, and my car can be for easy parking during city trips or sports events. Note: I don’t drink, so I will always be able to drive.

We’ve had many arguments over this. The most recent resulted in her giving me the cold shoulder for 2 days. I am at my wits end and ready to buy without her blessing. 

WIBTA if I ignored my wife’s objections and got the car I wanted?

Edit: I’m specifically looking at is a Honda Civic Si. We live walking distance to urgent care, CVS, and a grocery store. Our neighbor is a NICU nurse if shit really hits the fan. And we do “baby sit” my FIL’s SUV (he works/lives abroad), which we use on occasion, but we don’t know when he’ll be returning. So a third car is not an option for now

Edit 2: Classic RIP my inbox.
After parsing through this thread, there are separate issues at play that I’ve sorted out and here’s what I’ve gathered.

1. IWBTA for BUYING a car my wife can’t drive WITHOUT her blessing - yes, I fully acknowledge my timing of this is awful. I will postpone the purchase until after the baby arrives and I’ll get an automatic to ensure we both drive the car.

2. I’m not an asshole for WANTING a manual car and the model of car I want is reasonable. My wife could learn eventually, but that’s her choice. Again, my timing is terrible (which makes me the A-hole) so I’m going to get my “fun car” in a few years time. 

Clarifying point: I don’t want an SUV. They’re more expensive and I much prefer driving a car that’s not high up. I also think automotive companies have shoved a narrative down American’s throats that SUVs are the ONLY family friend options which is false. Literally just look at the rest of the world.

1cz7ezq,AITA for getting a kids bike taken away?,"First and foremost, I want it to be known that I have no issues with kids. As someone with a lot of experience working in childcare, I have a lot of patience. I met the end of this patience and want to know if what I’ve done is justified. 

My apartment is known for tight parking (there are probably 20 spots for 16-20 apartments.) There are no rules for parking, which causes issues from time to time with getting a spot near my building. Typically it doesn’t bother me, as it’s to be expected.

My neighbors have two kids (roughly 6 and 11)  they don’t take responsibility for. As a tame example, we have a quiet hours set at 9:30PM on weekdays. These kids have been in the hallways screeching (I am talking stuck pig, would’ve called the police fearing child endangerment kind of screeching) at midnight or even 1am on weeknights. The parents do nothing about it. To put it gently, these kids think they can do whatever they want, no consequences. 

Summer is arriving, and the weather has been great. The kids across from me have also been enjoying this weather, except they’re “enjoying” it so much that one of them (11 year old) has taken to blocking the parking spots in my complex by parking his bike in the middle of one and standing there on his phone for hours. The parents watch this happen, the dad SOMETIMES goes out and bring the bike back into their apartment late at night. Emphasis on sometimes. I’ve talked to them about this, as recently I’ve had to park over five, ten minutes away from my building because of the kid taking up an entire parking spot. The father shrugs and laughs, and does nothing about it. 

Next point is where I am unsure if I’m the asshole.  

Our complex has strict rules about personal items taking up public spaces (planters, grills, and most relevantly bikes.) They’ve sent emails stating they’re not responsible for reimbursing personal items removed from the public spaces. 

I came home from a particularly stressful day, and the kid was in the only spot left near my building. I asked him nicely to move his bike so I could park. The kid stared at me, then laughed as he left his bike and went inside. His father watched all of this from their patio and did nothing.

After parking 3 buildings over, I’d had enough. I called the complex and reported a bike taking up parking. Within half an hour, maintenance came and took it. 

Next morning I woke up to screeching from this kid. His dad realized what happened and came over to yell at me. Pissed at being woken up at 7am on my one day off, I responded “play stupid games win stupid prizes” before I shut the door and went about my day. 

Part of me feels justified, but theres part of me that feels bad this kid won’t have a bike for the majority of this summer. 

AITA?

TL:DR kid acted like he owned the parking lot, got a rude awakening when his bike was thrown away by maintenance, and his dad who encouraged the behavior is pissed.

1czwzo4,AITA for “breaking” my vegan diet?,"Hi people, 

My entire family are vegans, my dad especially is a very “vocal” vegan. He goes to vegan protests, was in vegan groups in our old city, he’s a vegan activist. Which I love, I’m not trying to paint those things as bad I really respect him for his thoughts. 

My brother and I have both been raised vegan our entire lives. At school it’s always made me feel “othered” is the best way to explain it. Never able to eat anything sold in the school canteen, at friend’s birthdays never able to eat a piece of cake with my friends, or have to be the one who says “we can’t go to that restaurant they don’t serve any vegan food”. Always having to explain why I’m not allowed to “try a bite” of their sandwich. They aren’t huge things but they are things that make me stick out. Since I’m an awkward guy anyway, it just doesn’t help me socially. So when we moved cities and I joined a new school last Monday I decided that I’m not going to follow the vegan diet while I’m at school. I kept this to myself because I know my parents wouldn’t support it and would be angry. 

When at home, or with my parents I will follow the vegan diet but if I’m out with my friends or at school I’m not going to say, in my mind this was respectful of my parents wishes. No meat in the house or around them but my myself is different. My brother and I both go to this new school. Since we don’t share a dinner time I didn’t tell him that I wasn’t going to follow the vegan diet, I didn’t think he would support it and I thought he would tell dad. 

Things have been going alright but I didn’t know that on Fridays my brother’s dinner time would be at the same time as mine. I was sitting with some new friend and I was eating a cheese pizza (this is the only non-vegan food I’ve eaten so far. I want to try pepperoni but still feel a little scared) and my brother caught me and asked what I was doing eating pizza. 

I tried to play it off but I knew I was screwed, my brother told my parents and now everyone is really upset at me. I’ve been grounded and my dad said he’s going to call my new school and tell them that if they sell me non-vegan food he will put in a discrimination complaint. Which is just going to make me seem like a weirdo now. 

I tried to explain to him that I was trying to be respectful by not doing it here, but my parents just gave me a huge lecture about how I’m so selfish for breaking the diet. He said he can’t trust me anymore and now I feel guilty in one half of my brain and in another I’m telling myself it isn’t that big of a deal and they’re overreacting. 

But I don’t know if I’m just being blind. 

Please, no debates about the ethics of the vegan diet. I don’t care to debate it with anyone I’m sure there are subreddits where people will be happy to. Please focus on my situation when giving your verdict.",Vegan-conundrum,1274,0.8899999856948853,893,1716589204,2024-05-24 17:20:04,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1czwzo4/aita_for_breaking_my_vegan_diet/,5,2024
1d0nn8i,AITA for not stopping to explain what I was doing to a bystander while I was helping a seizing man?,"Please do not share this outside Reddit. 

I’ll try to keep it short. I (40F) witnessed a dude have a seizure, which I was able to identify bc my best friend is epileptic and has been since we were kids. A few bystanders came over and helped me stabilize him as he was a big dude and I’m an average sized woman. Another woman and I were on the ground with him when suddenly a not-at-all-good-Samaritan we’ll call Dick shows up and starts barking (wrong) orders and instructions. Neither of us listen to him or act on his demands. He gets louder and louder and starts recording, saying it’s evidence that “these women refuse to let me help this man!”  

Eventually the seizing stops and EMS and the police show up. Dick immediately accosts the medics AND cops shouting about how he was trying to help and nobody would listen to or let him.  After everyone chatted, EMS confirms what we did for the seizing man was correct. 

Dick is outraged and then decides to direct his ire square at me and tells me that all I had to do was explain it to him in the first place. Internally I was like: What? You’re suggesting the “correct” answer was for me to take my attention off a medical emergency and explain to you why and how I was doing what I was doing/not doing? But I said, “I do not owe you or your ego any explanation for anything, ever, most certainly not in the middle of a medical emergency,  but for your information my best friend of 25+ years is epileptic. This is how I know what to do and not to do in the event of a seizure.” He YELLED, “That’s all you had to say!” At this point even the cops piped up and one said, verbatim, “No she didn’t, bro. She was focused on helping the guy.”  

I felt like I didn’t do anything wrong but was also kind of rattled, so when my friend’s wife later said I was being harsh and arrogant by not acknowledging and/or addressing Dick during the actual seizure and later referring to his ego in my “speech” to him I kind of felt like an asshole. 

She said he too was also just trying to help and “possibly prevent a disaster,” and then asked who anointed me the “Jesus of the situation.” I said I wasn’t being arrogant Jesus, I was simply the first one to get to the guy, knew he was having a seizure, and knew what to do, so I did it and didn’t concern myself with a dude screaming (again, WRONG!) orders in the background. 

Outside the screaming guy it was really a scene full of good people trying to help and made me feel better about humanity even. And then this friend’s wife basically called me an arrogant asshole.

1d1clkv,AITA for kicking my sister out and leaving my son unpunished for what he said?,"My (F45) sister (F37) visited our house with her boyfriend last week, and I couldn't say I was looking forward to it even though I love her to death; she's always been manipulative. I invited my mom along, and five minutes after my sister and her boyfriend showed up, one of my youngest daughters (twisted her foot running to the kitchen and cried. My sister told her to toughen up and critiqued my husband for getting her an ice pack, calling him unattractive for being so soft and continued to joke about how he got a wife. I told her to be quiet. 

Later, my oldest kids (F18 and M15) came to hang around and my sister commented on elements of my daughter's body, stating how lucky she was to have a ""hot body"" as a teen. My daughter politely told her not to talk about her body in any way, but my sister told her to be more aggressive because it would get her attention. I told my sister if she wasn't going to quit bullying my family she could take her boyfriend and leave, but she only laughed at me. My son told her to ""stop projecting"" just because she's wimpy and not attractive and my sister said ""it's not cute when you do it."" We all (excluding my mom and the boyfriend) were telling her to leave and she wouldn't until my son, of all people, raised his voice and said to make like her hairline and recede and called her a miserable freeloader. My sister rolled her eyes but left; I think she was intimidated. My son can be very scary when he wants to be and he's very no-bullshit. Later, once my mom recovered from the stress, talked with me and said what my son said was ""highly inappropriate and abusive."" I referred to my sister as abusive instead, and we argued until she eventually left. Knowing her, the entire family will know soon. But I'm not going to defend my sister's behavior.

1d1crmt,AITA for telling my brother I hate him and probably will never forgive him ,"
AITA for telling my brother I hate him and I’ll probably never be able to forgive him 

Background I 27f and brother 25m were raised by a single dad our mom left we didn’t really have family so we only had each other. I’ll refer to my dad as dad and brother as James. Fast forward to 18 year old me my dad was diagnosed with schizophrenia that took a lot on me mentally because my brother refused to help. My dad accepted help and was put on medication fast forward to 23 year old me my dad had a stroke and was diagnosed with heart failure. I was the sole care taker and it was breaking me. He still worked and could fully function unless he had an episode which was rare with the meds. Fast forward I move out of the state for my peace and a break my brother James promised to step up. September of 22 I could tell my dad was going off the deep end so I called James to advise of POA rights James told me I was being dramatic and didn’t need to worry about it cause I was selfish and left. Fast forward November 2 days go by I didn’t hear from my dad. I called a welfare check and they found him deceased believed heart attack. I immediately flew back home that day. When I get there james drunkenly confesses to me he seen him the day before and describe him as “unrecognizable, sick, couldn’t eat, move or anything.” James brought him some energy drinks and left quoting “if it was that bad he’s an adult and would’ve asked to go to the doctor.” I stood there stunned. No words. My brother kept pushing me to say something when finally I snapped and said “I hate you, I’ll probably never forgive you for this. The one time you had to be an adult you couldn’t and had you did there’s a possibility he could still be alive today.” He called me a heartless b* and now all of my family is saying the same but I feel my feelings are valid so AITA? 

Edit to add: I understand eventually I would have had to come to terms with him dying, but the part I’m angriest about is my brother robbed me of his final moments, I didn’t get to say goodbye. I didn’t get to tell him how much he meant to me. I didn’t get to tell him how he was my hero. I didn’t get to say thank you for still loving me everyday when my birth mom left us cause we were a burden. I feel like I was robbed of so many things. 

Edit 2: I did explain to the police the next week what happened and exactly what my brother had told me when the autopsy on my father was performed. When I spoke to the detective they said basically I was SOL because I had no proof other than his confession that I also had no proof of. An because I couldn’t concretely prove my dad was in a manic state at the time of the incident that nothing really could be done especially giving the heart failure diagnosis that was given 2 years prior. I also want to say thank you so much for all of the support even the non supportive ones. I understand that me leaving the state did make me responsible and I take accountability for that and regret that everyday. But I have taken up seeing a therapist who specializes in grief. Ive been very angry for a long time. My dad had living brother and sisters and a dad who lived in the same state who knew everything and also did nothing. I guess while my main focused anger has been at my brother for a long time I’m angry at everyone who I begged to help who promised they would and didn’t. Either way there’s a lot of comments and I can’t really keep up through the tears. But I again want to say thank you. This is the first time my anger and pain has felt seen in a while and I appreciate that.

1d23txo,AITA for refusing to pay off my boyfriend's overdraft?,"I've known Ron as a casual acquaintance for a few years, but we started dating about two weeks ago.  I'm 19 and he's 20.  He has a full-time job and only pays his mum £40 a week for bills/food.  His only other expense is his car.  So he has a lot of disposable income, but he doesn't save, he blows it all on nonsense like gadgets that he then never uses again.  So much so that he's overdrawn by £2K.

I'm a full-time student who babysits on the side, and I'm frugal.   I've managed to save £3K.  It has taken me about 2 or 3 years to save that.  Tonight I mentioned that some friends of mine are going on holiday in September and I am going to join them.  Ron asked me ""How will you pay for that, you don't have a job apart from babysitting.""  I said ""I have £3K in savings, so I will just use some of that.""

Suddenly Ron got a really calculating look in his eyes, and just outright asked me to pay off his overdraft.  He said he would pay me back £200 a month.  I said he should just pay off his own OD at £200 a month.  He said ""But then I have to pay interest!""

I refused to lend him the money for several reasons:

1. He's such a spendthrift I don't believe he would pay me back.  If he can't set aside £200 a month to pay off his own OD, he is not going to set aside £200 a month to pay me back.

2. I earn a small amount of interest on my savings.  Why should I lose that to save him interest?

3. What if I have an emergency, or an opportunity like my upcoming holiday?  I then  won't have any money to pay for it.

And I didn't say this one to him, but also I don't want to lend him the money because he has such a bloody cheek.  I know we've casually known each other (friends of friends) for a few years but we're only really just now getting to know each other properly and I just think it's such a rude and selfish thing to ask.  It's really made me see him in a different light and I don't like what I'm seeing.  Anyway he thinks I'm the one being selfish because the money is ""just sitting there"" and I ""don't really need it.""

Our new babysitter is only 16, but she had been babysitting one of my coworkers children for awhile and I trust him.

That bothered me, so without talking to my wife when I got home in the morning I had told my babysitter maybe she should set alarms throughout the night to make sure she’s awake since the baby monitor didn’t wake her and that it was not okay for her to leave the baby crying like that.

 I guess it hurt the kids feelings because she mentioned it to my wife and my wife is really upset with me because “she’s only 16” and what I was asking is unreasonable and that this has never happened before so again I’m being unreasonable and that I should’ve talked to her first because this could’ve been a “learning experience.” She also said I was completely out of line as well.

Towards the end of the meal, Abbie started whining about the food. She didn't like this, she didn't like that, she was unfamiliar with the food, she couldn't even ""choose"" the restaurant. Few people reminded her that I specifically asked her where she wanted to eat and it was a group consensus. (Just for the record, I'm an introvert but can be very opinionated and can speak up for myself.)

I asked Abbie why she didn't speak up earlier and she responded she didn't want to upset anyone. My tone turned harsher and said ""well you could've said something earlier instead of whining and causing a scene now. Why bring it up at the end of it if you didn't want to cause trouble?""

Abbie's face turned red as she got up, paid, and left.

1d2wc7d,AITA for repeatedly calling someone stupid after they accused me of lying about my children’s ethnicity?,"My husband is Dominican and I’m Irish. Our kids look like him in terms of facial features but they inherited my pale skin. Our son has his father’s dark hair but my daughter’s is borderline dark blonde. Genes are weird, what are you gonna do?

Both my kids and myself have my husband’s last name, which is a popular Dominican last name. There have been times we get looks when people hear our last name and my husband isn’t around. But it’s never been too bad and usually, I shrug it off.

Due to my husband’s work schedule, he’s rarely at school events. So, most people just know me. There’s another little girl in my daughter’s class with the same last name as us. Her mom also volunteers often. When we met, she flat out said “you’re not Dominican.” I said, “no. My husband and kids are.” She said “but your last name is (x)”. I said yeah…because it’s my husband’s. She pointed out how pale they are. I just said genes are weird.

But almost every time we see each other, she brings it up somehow. Making comments about how pale the kids are. Finding it weird they don’t know Spanish (my husband didn’t learn growing up so they don’t know it either). I just let it roll off because while it’s weird, I’m not about to get into a pissing contest.

The teacher asked the kids to make collages about their cultures. My daughter’s had stuff related to being a Dominican and stuff related to being Irish. They had a whole culture day where parents were invited. The mom of the other little girl saw my daughter’s collage and rolled her eyes, thankfully not in front of my daughter. There were no other kids around at the time as they were getting food. It was just parents looking at the collages. I asked what her problem is. She said I’m not a real Dominican. I said I never claimed to be. She said my kids aren’t either and that my husband is probably only a little Dominican and we’re claiming a culture that’s not ours.

I was dumbfounded. All I could ask was “are you stupid?” She said there was no need to be defensive. Finally, I had enough, pulled out my phone and showed her pictures of myself with my husband and the kids. She stared at it for a moment and mumbled an apology. I said “yeah, maybe research how genes work so you don’t make yourself look stupid in front of a bunch of 3rd graders”. She got teary eyed and walked away.

I got the stink eye from some other parents which I ignored. When I told my husband later, he said calling her stupid repeatedly, when she already apologized, was an asshole move.

1d2wf7e,AITA for leaving a restaurant because my kid decided he wouldn’t eat anything?,"Wife, son(6), and I are currently on vacation.  After a long day of sightseeing, we found a restaurant that had a decent looking menu for all three of us.  After we sat down however, my son decided he wouldn’t eat anything on the menu.  He agreed to eat some things that we brought with us, and since he was tired and hungry, I decided not to argue.  I did, however, check with our server before we let him open anything.  The server went to check with the manager, and unfortunately the manager said no outside food allowed.

I respect their rules, but I’m not going to make my son watch us eat while he’s hungry, so I apologized to the server and said we would have to go.  I wasn’t rude or upset at their decision, just tired and hungry.  I made sure to leave a tip for the waiters trouble.  This must have been an insult to the manager though, because he was talking to his hostess loud enough for us to hear, saying that we were leaving because we were mad we couldn’t bring outside food in.  It wasn’t worth fighting about, so I just kept going.

1d4gqm8,AITA for telling my mom I don’t want to care for her kids ,"AITA for not wanting to care for my siblings

I (20f) have a sister (16f) and two half siblings from our mom’s new marriage (3m) and an infant sister. My mom insists on my help with the youngest siblings, constantly, without notice. She wants me to babysit, or feed them, or give them baths. Most of the time it’s fine, but sometimes it’s overboard. For context in my reactions: I have autism, high functioning/ Asperger’s.

The situation: Today she asked me to give them baths, I did. It was hard because of my sensory issues and the fact they were both screaming bloody murder in my ear over wanting my mom to give them baths instead. It was okay though, I pushed through, got them dressed through the screaming. Then I left them in the living room with her and started to go back to my room. She asked if I could hold the baby a little longer. I did, but she was screaming and crying still, so it was hard. The only time she’d calm down was if my mom held her, and she didn’t want to because she was getting ready to leave for an AA meeting. At this point I was extremely overstimulated. I was standing sort of rigid, but still holding the baby acceptably, I thought. She began to yell at me, saying I wasn’t holding her with the right body language, and if I held her “like I cared about her” she wouldn’t cry. I told her she’s probably crying because she wants to be held by her mom, separation anxiety, because no matter how much I coddled her before, she still cried. This is a consistent thing that’s happened since my sister started going to daycare. Maybe I am a bit rigid after being screamed at, but still I don’t feel like my body language was the issue. My mom eventually got fed up and told me to put her in the feeding chair, so I did and started to walk back to my room. She then started to rant on about how she still needs my help with watching them longer and how I don’t care about my brother and sister. She said she shouldn’t have to ask for help. It didn’t even occur to me that it was assumed for me to stick around and watch them because their father is home. All she asked was that I give them a bath, then hold the baby, and I did that. This escalated into an argument in which I told her that her children aren’t my responsibility, especially not at 20 years old, and while I don’t have a problem helping out sometimes, I’m not her employee and both can’t (because of autism) and won’t (because I wouldn’t want to if I could) predict what she wants from me in order to wait on her hand and foot.

I do live at home for free, so it could be entitled of me to be so averse to helping her with them. I do other things, I’m the only one in the house who cleans regularly (every other day) and that’s easy for me as it doesn’t involve any crazy variables & never changes. But I do not want to help with my siblings the amount she wants.",kydism,2767,0.959999978542328,295,1717109587,2024-05-30 17:53:07,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1d4gqm8/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_dont_want_to_care_for/,5,2024
1d578oc,"AITA for ""tricking"" my brother into selling me his half of our childhood home then demolishing it? ","My mom and dad divorced when I was young. My brother loved the fact that our mom had no rules for him so he went with her. I abided by the custody agreement because I had no choice in the matter. My mom loves us both but she dotes on my brother like he farts perfume. 

My dad kept the house. He had to buy my mom out. It was an old house built in 1953. It had old wiring and was really less than suitable for modern life. What it did have though was a huge yard that was great growing up. 

My dad passed away during COVID. He left everything equally between my brother and I. I wanted the house. I told my brother that we should tear it down and put in infill housing like that neighborhood is zoned for. He just wanted money. I bought out his half of the house at the market value. It was sold as a teardown. He took the money and bought a car and went on a vacation. He still has money left. 

Then I had the house demolished and built a fourplex. Each unit has three bedrooms, 2 and a half bathrooms, a small yard, and a garage. I kept one unit for myself  and rent each of the other units for $2,000 a month. My mortgage is $1,800 a month for the entire thing. So basically I live free and bank $4,000 a month. 

My brother is pissed that I didn't give him a unit to live in for him since it was his home too. I actually offered to sell him one at cost and he said no. 

I'm lost. I offered him a partnership, I paid a fair price, I offered to sell him a unit, I did everything to try and be fair. He thinks I tricked him because I get ""free"" money every month. 

Our mom said she would be cutting me out of her will and giving everything to him if I didn't give him a unit or the income from one. I agreed that was fair and said that I would no longer feel the need to contribute to her upkeep or retirement when the time came. 

I am being bombarded by the two of them but I took the risks. I took on the debt. This is my money now.

1d5xcky,AITA for not allowing my brother to bring a random Grindr hook up as his +1 at my wedding ?,"I (27F) am gonna get married to my fiance (29M) in July. Initially I invited both my brother (23M) and his long term girlfriend of 3 years to our wedding, however my brother broke up with her last month and a couple of days ago he requested me to let him bring another 1+ to my wedding in order to replace his ex that wasn't coming anymore.

I asked him who he was planning to bring and he said that he wanted to bring a guy he met recenly on Grindr with whom he got along great. I told him that I don't want him to bring a random hook up to my wedding cause we're planning for a rather small ceremony with only our families and close friends. The reason I invited my brother's ex was cause she was a long term girlfriend, which obviously isn't the case with this hook up. 

However my brother twisted the truth and started accusing us of being homophobic for previously allowing him to bring a woman as his plus 1 but not a man and even contacted some of my and my fiance's friends that are LGTBQ+ to stir up drama and turn them against us. While some of them believed us we've also had a couple of friends saying they're gonna drop out from our wedding cause of what my brother told them, not to mention that now he started stirring up drama with my family as well.

AITA ? I feel like I was reasonable in a valuing a long term girlfriend and a random hook from Grindr differently, especially when I still wouldn't have allowed my brother to bring a hook up to my wedding even if it was a woman instead, however I'm getting tired of getting called a homofob bridezilla over this decision ?

1d6p4jy,AITA for not laughing at my sister-in-law making my son cry?,"
My sis-in-law and her husband looked after my 7 year old overnight for the first time a few weeks ago. My son was excited leading up to it as he was going to spend the night staying at ""his favourite uncles house"". The next day my sis-in-law was telling us how funny it was when they made the uncle hide and pretended he'd left for the night. My son took it as a joke for a while and kept saying ""haha no he hasn't"" but they kept it up until ""he had a mini meltdown"" and started crying. They (this was the second sis-in-law who was present) also did this by hiding his Nintendo Switch and pretended they sold it. My sis-in-law was laughing her head off while sat there just looking a bit confused/suprised at what was funny. SIL said something along the lines of ""you don't have to look so traumatised!"" And, knowing how sensitive my wife's side of the family can be, I just replied ""sorry, but I don't find those kind of jokes funny"". SIL then exploded in front of everyone and went on a rant about how she doesn't feel like she can treat my son how she wants and doesn't tell him off how she wants because of me. For context when my son was born he was very premature and in intensive care for the first three weeks so for the first year I absolutely was a bit overprotective and I also got my sis in laws back up when my son fell over when he was three and screamed and I went running over asking if he was ok, even though his other aunt was already there and that one exploded then too shouting that ""she knows how to look after a child!"". Again then I was a bit confused that asking my son who was crying and distressed if he was ok should get such an angry reaction. I'm now paranoid about how I parent in front on my in-laws. So, am I the asshole? Maybe I'm missing something and should see their pov?

Update:
Thanks everyone, I just wanted to check I wasn’t overreacting or losing the plot.

The dress itself isn’t hideous, it’s just . . . unflattering. It’s a bright neon green, which wouldn't normally be a deal breaker, but it’s a halter top with a super low back.  Now, I’m all for embracing my body, but I have pretty bad scoliosis and a prominent scar on my back from a childhood surgery. The low back would definitely show off both, and I’m not comfortable with that.

I talked to Rainn about it, suggesting maybe a shawl or finding a dress with a higher back. She shut me down completely. She said the dresses are “non-negotiable” and that “it’s her day.” I understand wanting everything to look perfect for her wedding, but I don’t feel comfortable feeling so exposed on such a big day.

I floated the idea of just opting out of being a bridesmaid altogether. Rainn got really upset and said it would be a huge betrayal. Now I feel stuck. I don’t want to be a bad friend, but I also don’t want to wear a dress that makes me feel self-conscious.

The day we were to leave, she was present while I packed & commented how I hadn't packed the toiletries. I said I never do because I don't need them & it doesn't feel right. That's it. Exact words. But she got really offended over it. Went on for minutes about how people like me ruin it for 'working class' people like her (we work the same job??). How it's our right, included in our bills, & snooty attitudes like the one I'd displayed make the world look down upon the ethical practice of taking toiletries. She couldn't believe I would choose to be a jerk who sides with big, profit making hotels instead of the little man. I thought she might be stressed about something else or may be I had somehow been insensitive with that remark. I let her be & didn't react.

1d8acpx,AITA for reminding my friend that she married for intelligence and look where it got her?,"I (35F) met my husband Vince (36M) after he saved me from drowning at a pool party when I was 18. I took him out for lunch the following week to thank him for saving me, and we soon fell in love and began dating. 

At the time, Vince worked a blue collar job while I was studying in university. We ended up getting married and Vince supported me throughout my entire education up until I got my PhD. 

Vince always told me that he wanted to study in university but had learning disabilities that made it difficult for him to study in a classroom. At times he was embarrassed by the fact that he had to work twice as hard compared to people around him, but I always found that to be admirable about him. 

When I finished my studies and got a well paying job I convinced Vince to give his dream of studying another go. 

Last year he was finally accepted into a nursing program at our local university. He is working hard to achieve him dream and I’m incredibly proud of him.

Last week my friend Alba (36F) came to visit with her son so our children could play together. Alba was my roommate during my first year in university, she began dating her husband Leo around the same time I started dating Vince. 

Leo was an obnoxious law student who later on became an even more obnoxious attorney. He was a know it all who prided himself on his intelligence, which for some reason attracted Alba. 

At the time Alba would sometimes tease me that I could do better than Vince, and would offer to set me up with one of Leo’s law school buddies, but I would always refuse and she eventually dropped the subject. 

Alba and Leo are currently going through a nasty divorce that stems from him cheating on her, quite frankly he is dragging her through the mud and is using connections to try and leave her as penniless as possible. 

As we were chatting and catching up Alba began to express concern over the fact that my eldest son (7M) was recently diagnosed with dyslexia, Alba began telling me how she is worried that my son will be academically challenged like his father and what that could entail for his future. Before I could respond she told me how I should have married someone smart while I had the chance so I would have kids like hers. (Albas son is an incredibly bright boy and a straight A student).

I told Alba her advice was unnecessary and reminded her where marrying for intelligence got her, I then proceeded to tell her that I would rather have my son grow up to be an honest, hardworking person like his father than an academically gifted jerk who wasn’t smart enough to know sleeping with his secretary could have consequences on his marriage like her husband. 

Alba was deeply hurt by what I’ve said and stormed out with her son. Some mutual friends are now chiming in and are telling me that
I was too harsh on Alba for using her failing marriage to prove my point and should apologize. ",Throw_awayy098,11411,0.949999988079071,1018,1717540642,2024-06-04 17:37:22,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1d8acpx/aita_for_reminding_my_friend_that_she_married_for/,6,2024

He just recently got his high school diploma from an online school and applied for trade school.

From the ages of 19-22, my brother worked a full-time job and another part-time job on the weekends, he would always flaunt his savings account in front of me. No shit, he had no bills to pay and is cheap as hell. The last time he flaunted his savings account, he had well over $60,000.

1d9367a,WIBTA For Missing My Cousin's Wedding because She Didn't Send Me My Own Invitation,"This is petty, to be honest, but I'll give some backstory, so maybe it will make a little more sense. 
So I (26F) have a large extended family, like 10 cousins, most of whom have multiple kids now large. Despite being one of the oldest (3rd), I'm still kind of treated like a child. I believe this is because my family has a habit of having kids pretty young (e.i., Lots of teen moms and even those who plan for children have had them in their early twenties) and I'm child-free. It irks me since I've always been pretty independent, and now that I'm approaching my late 20s and have been living on my own for nearly 6 years, you'd think I'd get a little respect as an adult. But apparently not.
So I live about 3 hours away from where the rest of my family does, and I have been planning for months to visit for the Pride Parade held there. I live in a big city and the one they do here is just too hectic, so I prefer to go to that one. 
Well, I messaged my mom today asking when she's free so I can figure out a good time to visit with her and my siblings. She tells me not to worry about seeing just them, that we'll be able to spend plenty of time together at Cousin's(F22) wedding on Saturday. Cue confusion. I didn't know Cousin was getting married this weekend, but I didn't get any kind of invitation. I tell her that, and she's also confused because there's no reason Cousin wouldn't have invited me. I tell her it's no big deal anyways because I already have plans for that day. 
Well, I guess she mentioned something to Aunt (Cousin's mom) because she messaged me a few hours ago to tell me that I WAS invited, that I was on my mom's invitation as ""and Kids"". I tell her that that's too bad, because I already have plans for that night and that if they had really wanted me to go, they should have sent me my own invitation. I am an adult and live 3 hours away, so, of course, my mom isn't going to think I'm included in her ""and Kids"" invitation. I wasn't going to change my plans on a dime because of their shortsightedness. 
Well, apparently, that makes me an asshole. I've been getting messages from family left and right telling me I should skip the parade, that Cousin's wedding is more important because it's a one-time thing, but they do the parade every year. I haven't prepared to go to a wedding at all and I'mnot very close to that part of the family (they are ultra  religious). I'm pretty sure Cousin, herself, doesn't even care if I'm there or not.

Ashley recently had to have an emergency C-section at 6 months pregnant. She and the baby are doing well but the baby girl is in the NICU and she is recovering. When I found out I immediately sent her a care package, bought a crib she couldn't afford, and reached out regularly within the past month. I live across the country  from her so I can't just up and travel. I noticed over that time Ashley would ask for things or complain about feeling that her friends and her child's father are not doing enough for her or being around enough for her. I would do what I can with the monetary requests she has made and reach out to check in when I could. I told her that I am very annoyed by her complaining and she needs to accept that my life does not stop just because she had a baby. She responds by saying ""I almost died giving birth"". I responded that she has said this every time I have spoken to her when she complains about something. I also said that she cannot make monetary requests, complain afterwards, throw almost dying in my face, then make more requests like I'm an unlimited ATM. She said that until I experience what she has then I won't understand where she is coming from and being there for her in these ways shows how important she and the baby are in my life. I responded that in the time since she gave birth I have injured my foot and can barely walk which led to unexpected financial problems and have other challenges in my life that she does not even ask about. I said I was not in the bedroom when she got pregnant so she needs to take this up with the man who knocked her up. We haven't spoken since then and I refuse to help her anymore as long as she acts this entitled.  AITA? 

EDIT: Ashley's child's father is in the picture.  He has been getting complaints from her about not being at the hospital enough. He has had to pick up overtime at work to make up for the lost income. They also have another child, so he has been mostly taking care of the older child while she is in the hospital.

1daplsa,AITA for hiding my large net worth from my boyfriend of 8 years while he paid for everything?,"Throwaway account.

I (34F) was recently engaged to my boyfriend (37M) of eight years. We've been living together for quite some time, yet we've always kept our finances almost entirely separate. When it came to discussing being married, the idea of a prenup came up. It was then that I came clean about my financial status. My net worth is just barely seven figures, yet he's been the one ""supporting"" the household.

Background: We met months after I returned to my hometown. My father had unexpectedly died, and I'd left a lucrative engineering career (six figures) that had started fresh out of college. Before that career hit, I had been raised to be frugal as hell, and I suffered like crazy through college. No home internet, no phone, no car, working multiple part-time jobs while being a full time student, etc. When money suddenly starting coming in, my lifestyle didn't change THAT much. Being able to afford a dozen more food options and having a $500 car felt like moving up in the world.

So when we met, I had '97 car, a crappy one-bedroom apartment, never went out to eat (including fast food), and was working a minimum wage job. I got the job for the sake of insurance, and I had wanted something extremely flexible in lieu of my father's death. So I imagine I came across as someone living paycheck to paycheck, when I really had quite a chunk of change in the bank.

As our relationship progressed, we found we had very different styles of living. He liked going out, and I disputed this. We always split the bill down the middle, and I was getting cranky - these outings were his suggestions, and my date ideas were free/cheap. He said he'd pay for both us. Move forward: We moved in together, and I again I disputed. We didn't NEED to rent a large house. It was ultimately decided to get his choice and I'd pay a smaller portion.

Then my mother died. The savings of my frugal parents went to me.

My boyfriend knew I didn't like spending money, and he knew I wasn't in debt. But he still thought his worth was higher, and he was still paying for most of the expenses. 

To clarify: He'd worked up to a six figure job, and I feel he should spend his income as he wants. He spends at will, retains little savings, but he's stayed debt free.

Fast forward. We're engaged, and I tell him how much money I have. He's initially excited at the prospect of being able to buy all these things. I'm scared. My finances will suddenly become ""our"" finances, and his spending ideas are NOT what I want. We discuss this, and now he's mad that he's been mostly supporting me for so long, unnecessarily. I point out that was the lifestyle HE chose, and that he absolutely refused MY suggestions. Still, I benefited.

I say we can use my savings to buy a house, to have solid funds for future children, for earlier retirement, etc. He's growing more resentful.

My net worth was a lie of omission. I never told him I couldn't afford things.

1dc607o,AITA for being rude to my stepdaughter and banning her from eating with the family,"I have 2 stepdaughters, Scarlett (18), and Ava (16). 

Scarlett is an amazing singer. She's been in some kind of voice lessons since she was 10 and just graduated from one of the best performing arts schools in the state, where she went on a full scholarship since 6th grade. She has a YouTube channel where she sings that she's starting to make money from and was accepted into some very prestigious music schools. Additionally, she has been working paid gigs for the last 2 years and makes at least $500-1000 per week, more in the summers. She's even been the opening artist at a few concerts. I'm not trying to brag, I'm just saying she's an objectively good singer. 

Ava, on the other hand, is not a good singer. She likes to believe she is and she might become one if she actually stuck with voice lessons or choir classes but she always quits after 1-2 weeks because they're ""bullying her"" (giving constructive feedback, I've seen the notes her classmates and teachers have given her). 

Ava also likes to sing very loudly and/or at bad times. For example, if she feels that we're too quiet at the dinner table she starts to loudly sing. It doesn't sound good and I honestly don't know how she doesn't hear it. If you ask her to stop she keeps going and if you're blunt and say stop, that doesn't sound good/we don't want to hear it she keeps going and gets even louder just to annoy you. 

If we're in the car and we don't let her choose the songs she'll loudly sing whatever she wants, not what's playing, to annoy us and responds the same way to us telling her to stop. The only person she listens to is her dad. 

A few weeks ago we were trying to eat and she was singing again. I told her to stop and she refused so I took her plate and told her from now on she is no longer allowed to eat at my table. She can eat in her room, the backyard, her car, the garage, wherever she wants as long as we can't hear her from the dining room and that this will continue until she can behave appropriately at the table. 

My husband and I argued about it but he's not home for dinner so there isn't much he can do about it. Today she was eating lunch with us and started singing again. I told her to stop and she didn't listen so I again took her plate and told her to eat somewhere where we can't hear her if she doesn't want to act appropriately. Ava argued that she's a better singer than Scarlett and that Scarlett sings all the time. I was done with her bullshit so I asked her how many times someone other than her dad has actually asked her to sing, not even paying her to be there, just ask her to sing or how many performing arts schools she's gotten accepted to (she's applied to many).

She started to cry and my husband wants me to apologize for being rude to her and is insisting I allow her to eat with the family again.

1dc6dza,AITAH for not paying for my coworkers lunch? ,"This is genuinely the dumbest AITAH I’ve ever made/read, but here we are. I’m a first responder and was riding along with another shift for training purposes. The first day we drove through chic fil a. I ordered a small Mac And cheese, in our area that’s about $4. He ordered a whole meal. When we got to the window, they gave us 50% off making mine $2. The guy I was riding with said “Don’t worry I’ll cover you”. Cool, thank you for covering my $2 I appreciate it lol. Second day we went to a local bistro that’s decently pricey. I ordered a salad that was about $10. His meal totaled out to just over $20. When we went to the register to pay he told them “She’s going to cover mine” while pointing at me. To say I was appalled is an understatement. The cashier looked at me and I calmly stated “No, I will just be covering myself”. The guy I was riding with got mad and started saying he covered me for lunch yesterday so it’s only right that I cover him. I’m not confrontational, but I’m also no punk lol. I calmly stated “$2 does not constitute $22 (or whatever the total was). If you’d like me to give you $2 to cover my small side I ordered yesterday I will absolutely do that. But I will not be paying for your meal” and handed my card to the cashier. He paid for his meal and we went outside where he refused to let me get into the vehicle. He continued to argue and cause a scene in the parking lot. He told me I’m not longer allowed to ride with him, so I called for a supervisor. Once the supervisor arrived he told them that he covered my lunch yesterday and that I refused to extend the same courtesy and that I embarrassed him and caused a scene and he no longer feels comfortable riding with me. I explained my side to the supervisor and apologized because this is literally so ridiculous lol. The supervisor essentially said I was wrong because I should’ve just been respectful and paid for him like he did me. At this point I was pissed and told them this sounds like extortion and that I wasn’t going to be taken advantage of. I told them that $2 is a whole lot different than $22. We’re first responders, we don’t make a lot of money. I continued to say if he wanted me to buy him a drink from the gas station or give him $2 I had absolutely no problem doing so, but I was not going to be bullied into covering his meal because he covered mine. I ended up riding with someone else because obviously riding with him is no longer an option. The person I switched to also said I was wrong and should’ve just paid for his meal. I don’t think I’m wrong here. Had I known the previous day that I would be expected to pay for his expensive meal after paying for my $2 Mac and cheese I would’ve never let him cover me. I feel like since he put me on the spot, me putting him on the spot in return was only fair. I don’t feel like I caused a scene, I wasn’t the one who argued and refused to unlock the doors. But now everyone’s saying that I’m not a team player and I embarrassed him as well as our place of work. Am I wrong here? AITAH?

1dc6enl,AITA for not taking back pajamas my bf’s girl best friend wore?,"The past weekend my bf and I joined his friends for a weekend getaway at a cabin (Airbnb). There were five people in total (me, him, a male friend, his gf, and my bf's girl best friend). 

I've never liked his girl best friend because she gives pick me vibes and I think she either has a crush on my bf or she likes attention. She doesn't like me either. I remain very cordial to her. 

When we arrived at the cabin, she told my bf that she hadn't packed any pajamas and none of her clothes were appropriate since they'd get dirty. 

She couldn't wear the other girl's clothes because they wouldn't fit so she begged my bf to give me my pajamas since I always pack extra. Without asking me he gave her my pajamas.

So I came out of the shower to find her wearing my pajamas and with the bottom basically shoved all way up her crack. She spent the entire weekend lounging in my pjs. 

When the weekend was over she tried to give them back to me and I said that she could keep them. She got mad at me and asked if I thought she was dirty or had cooties. I said she could just keep them since it seemed she liked them a lot. She called me a mean girl and said I was being rude.

It ruined the mood since the other friend took her side while his girlfriend took mine and my bf had to take my side. And now things are really awkward and I think I might be iced out by my bf's friends. AITA?

Edit: He did not know I do not like her. I was annoyed at him for not asking but I always pack extra and never fussed about lending clothes to other people because I believe in hospitality. I would have offered her the pajamas. He immediately apologized and even bought me new pajamas. I have no problem with my bf because he thought he was doing the right thing and he acknowledged his mistake and rectified it.

Edit 2: I would have given her my pajamas. I still wouldn't have taken them back. She didn't even offer to wash them.",ThrowRA_Acadia5523,3134,0.949999988079071,543,1717972819,2024-06-09 17:40:19,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dc6enl/aita_for_not_taking_back_pajamas_my_bfs_girl_best/,6,2024
1dc7fut,WIBTA for complaining about a neighbor using our apartment's laundry to run a laundry service?,"My apartment has two ""discounted"" washers and dryers in the basement for the tenants.  I say discounted because its fifty cents each device, so way cheaper than the laundromat.  Anyway, for the past couple weeks, I'm finding them almost constantly in use.  There's only 4 apartments in my building, so it seemed crazy to me that anyone's using them that much.

It turns out a woman in our building who earns her income through working for different app services (like Instacart and Doordash) is now also working for an app where I guess she does peoples laundry.  I imagine she's doing very well, too, based on how often she has the machines in use.  I wanted to just talk to her about it but English doesn't seem to be her thing, and she's strangely tough to narrow down.

Anyway, our lease says you cannot use the appliances for friends and family but obviously says nothing about this since who would have thought about such a thing.  I want to complain to the landlord, but I don't want to be that ""Karen"" who's wrecking this woman's livelihood when I could just drive two blocks up the road to do my laundry.  I haven't heard any complaints from either of the other apartments, so who knows if its just me.

My wife is a OBGYN and so I do most of the housework. I am a senior data analyst and work from home 3 days a week so I get the kids ready for school while my wife heads to the gym. As soon as we had kids my mom began critiquing my wife’s “laziness”. My wife working 60-70h a week and I work 40h and we can’t have the lifestyle we do without her income which I have explained repeatedly to my mom. But my mom is pretty old fashioned and conservative on these things and thinks my wife is being a bad wife because I spend more time with the kids and do more of the housework. She is very critical and I understand why my wife had enough even though I repeatedly told my mom to keep her opinions to herself.

My wife blew up at her after she stayed over during the holidays and I was doing all the cooking and cleaning as I had time off and my wife still needed to work. My mom criticized her for being a bad mom for not being there during Christmas and my wife blew up at her and refused to let her stay over. It’s been 5 or 6 years and she is still banned from the house. She has apologized to my wife but my wife ignores any attempts at communication and I’ve given up on them getting along. If my mom wants to see our children I drive them over. This has caused a lot of issues in our marriage. 

She recently had a heart attack which required a stent put in. She was released from the hospital and asked me to stay at our house for a week. She lives alone and I wanted to be there to watch her and agreed without thinking. I asked my wife who refused to let me mom stay saying she is going to driving her back to her home the instant I bring her over.

1ddq9xy,AITA for asking the teacher to tell the autistic kid to stop harassing my daughter?,"Tonight, my 8-year-old daughter was shaking, crying, and refusing to go to sleep because a boy in her class constantly keeps following her around at school during breaks/lunch. This has been going on for months, apparently, progressively getting worse. 

She has told the boy to stop, first softly, and then more assertively, until she was screaming at him to stop, while crying today. He ran to the teacher and told her that my daughter was being mean to him. The teacher had words with my daughter. Which leads us to tonight, when she broke down.

I spoke to the teacher. She tells me that they are aware of the boy's condition, and that he does not pick up social queues. The teacher is telling my daughter to be friends with him and tolerate him. 

My daughter just wants to be left alone.

From the boy's perspective, he probably doesn't think he has done anything wrong. He probably just wants a friend to hang with. I feel for him.

However, in my probably biassed opinion, my 8-year-old daughter should not have to bear the burden of a boy who makes her uncomfortable, constantly following her around.

1ddqijw,AITA for not giving my stepmother some of my inheritance ,"My stepmother, let’s call her Amy (now 59), was married to my father for over 20 years. She was quite a bit younger than my dad, but (plot twist) was the main breadwinner in the relationship. My dad was an alcoholic, had other mental health issues, and in his latter years had dementia, too, so didn’t work for most of their marriage. While she did take care of him financially, she did not take care of him in other ways - she was very dismissive of mine and my older brothers efforts to get him help for his alcoholism, and in fact moved back to her home country towards the end there when he was behaving oddly and showing signs of dementia, essentially abandoning him. Because of all this, she and my brother no longer speak at all. 

By the time he passed away two years ago, he had joined her in her home country, and together neither of them worked. By this point they had spent all the money that he had saved up early in his career when he was a high earner, as well as most of what she made in her high six figures job. They were just sloppy with money, did not know how to budget and blew a ton on dinners out, fancy hotels when traveling, and of course insane amounts of alcohol due to his disease. They did pay for my and my brother’s college tuition and housing expenses early on in their marriage, though that was stipulated as part of my parents’ divorce settlement. 

All this to say, in the last few years of his life, it became clear that they had spent all their money, and their retirement plan was basically wait until my grandfather died, and then live off of my dad’s share of that inheritance - about 350k. Unfortunately for her, my dad passed a few months before his father, so she received nothing. Also, because he barely worked in the twenty years that he was married to her, and she is not an American citizen, my mom (who was also married to my dad for 20 years) is receiving more of his social security benefits than she is. 

She now finds herself destitute somehow, and is apparently at risk of losing her mother’s home in her home country that she inherited when she passed. She already lost the home she shared with my dad in the US, along with all of their possessions. My brother and I never received anything when our dad passed - we were never expecting money, but family photos, his monogrammed cufflinks, other mementos would have been nice. All that is gone now, I assume repossessed and auctioned off without our knowledge. 

When my grandfather died, my brother and I split the inheritance that my dad would have received. Amy is now asking that we give her a monthly allowance to keep her afloat, because she is too grief stricken to work though it has been a few years. I refuse to do this and am no longer speaking with her either. AITA?

1dejtry,"AITA for ""financially big-footing"" my in-laws?","I (39M) am a few years older than my wife (32F), but we met (5 years ago) at very different phases of our lives. I finished uni at 19 years old, lucked into a great position in finance and became a partner of my firm, making me quite wealthy at a young age. My wife went through several changes of heart about her career path, involving two advanced degrees, through which her parents supported her. She had only recently started her first full time, “professional” job when we met.  Her parents’ (born to wealthy families on the last bits of their fortunes) financial support engendered a belief on their part that she ought to pay heed to their wishes.  While my wife found this behavior bothersome, she is conflict-averse and mostly acceded to their demands.

Her parents offered to pay for our wedding. It quickly became clear that they felt that their contribution entitled them to make most of the choices (including guest list), none of which were congenial to my now-wife. The conflict clearly wore on her, so told her parents that we appreciated their kind offer, but that we would pay for the wedding ourselves.  Perhaps having judged my financial situation by my modest lifestyle, they claimed we were “risking our finances” merely to have our way. I just laughed and said that wasn’t a worry.  We ended up having a swanky destination wedding, accommodations on us, for our friends and close family only.

After we got married, we experienced the same crap. Case in point – vacations. My MIL inherited a beach house, and she insisted that we spend our vacations there at a particular time, to coincide with my SIL, even though the dates were convenient neither to us nor SIL.  When my wife pointed this out, her mother’s response was that it would be difficult to accommodate us at other times, as they had set plans with friends over the course of the summer; that since she and FIL were generously opening their house to us, we needed to conform to her schedule.  Not again! I had been thinking about getting a summer place myself, so I bought one in my wife’s favorite area. It happens to be bigger and nicer than MIL’s.  MIL reacted peevishly to the news, claiming that we were spitefully “bankrupting ourselves to show her up” and that vacations should be spent with family. I replied that, as to the latter point, they were welcome to come spend time with their daughter and SIL (who is great!)…on dates convenient for us.  As to the former, I said, that while I consider it gauche to talk to about money, she should rest easy about our finances, as the new place amounted to less than my last year’s partnership distribution; and that they would be wise to stop trying to exert control with money, since to do it successfully requires an actual fortune,and not just the memory of one as embodied in a broken-down beach house.  My MIL called me a jerk.

But this year, when I started preparing everything, Debby came to talk to me and showed me prints from a group chat that i was not part, which had the exact date of the time we were on the trip, last year, where Sophie was talking bad about May and calling her names, like  ""Whale"", ""Fat bit\*\*"" and other cruel things.

(For context, May is a fat woman.)

I spoke to May and she confirmed that during the trip, Sophie was completely unpleasant to her, always commenting on her body and her personality, for no apparent reason. But she didn't say anything, so as not to ruin the vibe of the trip party, and to not create tension between me and my father's side of the family, and after the trip, she ended up forgeting about completly.

I went to my father's house, and told Sophie that I knew everything, and she turned pale when she saw the prints I had.

I basically kicked her out of the trip and told her I didn't want to see her again.

Now, the other girls in the group, apart from Debby and May, are saying that I was an asshole for kicking Sophie out for something so insignificant, and that if Sophie doesn't go, neither will they.

Am I an asshole for kicking her out?",Froggy-from-space,2161,0.9700000286102296,156,1718233185,2024-06-12 17:59:45,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dek5u2/aita_for_kicking_my_stepsister_out_of_my_birthday/,6,2024
1dfb9wp,AITA for refusing buy birthday presents for my SIL's dog?,"I (35M) have been married to my wife (35F) for 10 years now. We have 3 kids. My wife's sister (38F), we'll call her Debbie, has never been able to have children.

She's also a very problematic person. She's miserable, usually critical of my family, rarely has anything nice to say that isn't SUPER passive aggressive, I think you'll get the picture. She seems very jealous of my wife too.

We had a birthday party for my son last Saturday, he turned 6. Her dog's birthday also happened to fall on that day.

Wednesday of last week, Debbie sent a text to my wife and I, asking for us to buy her dog a few presents to open since she's bringing her dog to the party. We didn't want to do this, especially since we're already spending a lot of money for my son. She's clearly offended and said ""not even a couple fucking treats for like 10 dollars?"" She sent a few other vitriolic texts but we ignored her and hoped this would pass. We're used to this kind of attitude from her.

At my son's party, Debbie shows up with her dog as promised. She didn't bring any presents for my son (despite asking what he wanted). She was very irritable throughout the party. While my son is eating his birthday cake (after he opened his presents), she says to my son, in front of our family, ""I didn't get you a present because your parents are too cheap to buy presents for my kids."" Referring to her dogs as her ""kids"" is somehow the least annoying thing about Debbie. After exchanging a few words with my wife and I, we decide to kick Debbie out of the house.

1dfcvs2,AITA for refusing to accept my mom’s friend’s MacBook after her autistic son broke mine and asking her to buy me a new one?,"I (16F) got a brand new MacBook Pro for my birthday last month. My family isn’t rich and I don’t usually get gifts like that. My parents said they got me that because I’ve been doing great at school and they thought I deserved something nice after using an old Chromebook for years. 

A few days ago, my mom’s friend came over with her kids (14F and 10M). We were in my room and me and the girl were sitting on my bed talking while the boy was on the floor playing with some Legos (he is autistic). He walked over to my desk, opened my laptop, and told me to give him the password so he could play Roblox. I told him he can’t play on my computer and he started crying and saying it’s not fair and he’s bored. I told him to go get his mom’s phone if he’s bored and he said he wants to play on my laptop. When I said no again, he threw it on the floor and stomped on it.

I went outside and told my mom. His mom apologized and said she would pay for the repairs. I told her that I don’t think it’s repairable because it’s completely smashed. He threw it open with the screen facing down. The thing that connects the screen to the keyboard snapped, the screen was filled with cracks, and it was dented all over. We took it to a repair shop and they told us that it can’t be fixed and we should just buy a new one instead.

My mom called her friend and told her that. She came over with her MacBook and said I could have that instead. I told her that I don’t want her 5 year old MacBook Air, I want her to give me $1800. My mom is on my side and she is going to give us the money, but she’s not happy about it. She said she was planning to buy her daughter a laptop because she’s going to high school and her son a PS5 for his birthday and she won’t be able to do that because I was greedy. I don’t care that her brat isn’t getting a PS5 but I kinda feel bad for her daughter because this wasn’t her fault. She’s been telling all of her and my mom’s other friends that I’m a spoiled brat and this wouldn’t  have happened if I’d let her precious baby boy play Roblox or given him my phone.

1dgt4mo,AITA for telling my son it's a good thing he's pretty? ,"My wife and I have four kids. The first two are a welder and a doctor. My middle son just graduated with a degree in Dance. Our youngest is studying  engineering. 

My son is still living at home trying to figure out his future. We were talking about it and he said he wants to move out so he can live how he wants instead of by my insane rules. 

Those rules are 1. Be self supporting after you graduate. 2. Help with chores as long as you live at home. 3. Don't have sex I can hear. 

Those are too much for him. He went to my wife and said that he wanted some help so he could move out. She backed my rules. She also expects him to get a job, help around the house, and not expose us to the orgasms of his partners. Or his own for that matter. 

He came back to me asking how I expected him to make a living. 

We had both talked to him about getting a degree that had more prospects and maybe doing a minor in dance. Our daughter who is a doctor did her undergrad in music. But she also took premed classes and rocked her MCAT. 

He says that he didn't want to do that. He wants me to tell him what to do. I am just kind of lost. So I told him it's a good thing he's pretty. 

All I meant is that he is a tall, athletic, handsome young man. With a degree. He can find an entry level position and work his way up. Many successful people have. 

He took it to mean that I thought he should marry well and be a kept man. 

His other mom and him are pissed at me for undervaluing his potential. I think I was being realistic.

1dgtcsp,AITA for going to my daughter’s graduation after my son relapsed?,"My (M51) wife (F48) and I have two children: Jake (M23) and Jess (F18). 

Although they had the same upbringing, Jake sadly surrounding himself with the wrong people during his late teenage years and made some bad life decisions. Since he was around 17, he's suffered with substance abuse issues and alcohol dependency. He's been through counselling on more than one occasion, and I've lost count of the amount of times that either my wife or I have had to make personal sacrifices to go and tend to him. He's currently living in a Recovery Housing Program, where we hoped he would see improvements.

This has caused understandable issues for Jess. I've missed hockey games and choir performances because I had to go tend to Jake, as has my wife. We try and make it up to her at the time, but I don't think missing important milestones really makes up for it; it's heartbreaking for me personally. 

Jake has been doing better lately, and he hasn't had any relapses or issues for the past few months. Jess' graduation was the other day, and my wife and I had tickets and couldn't wait. She's off to college, graduating with a great GPA and we're really proud of her. 

However, only a couple of hours before the graduation, we received a call from the staff at Jake's Housing Program, who said that he had a relapse incident and was in a really bad way. My wife was hysterical and immediately started telling me we had to go there and help. I refused. I said that we'd missed enough events in Jess' life, and I wasn't missing her graduation. Although my wife told me how sad she was to miss it, Jake's health and wellbeing would take priority. I wasn't changing my stance. She got increasingly agitated and said she'd go herself, called a cab, and went. I took the car and watched Jess' graduation. It was one of the proudest days of my life, but when I saw Jess at the end, I could tell she was visibly upset that her mom wasn't there. I explained and you could tell her frustration.

My wife made it to our celebratory dinner later, and she apologized, but the mood was sour. The incident with Jake was serious, but not a life threatening emergency, and he has been admitted into treatment. 

My wife gave me the cold shoulder later saying how we should have been on the same page, been there for support, and that I'd been selfish. I disagreed, saying she'd been selfish in this scenario, and she tainted Jess' moment. This went on for a while, and I ended up sleeping on the couch. 

I still feel I made the right decision, but I know I hurt my wife, and Jake's recovery is obviously of paramount importance as well.

1dgutxg,AITA for letting a gay man buy me a cup of coffee?,"So earlier today I (19m) was hanging out with some friends of mine and we were downtown for the pride fair happening in my city. I broke off from my group and went to a nearby Cafe to get a cup of coffee. While I was waiting in line, a guy about my age came up to me and asked if he could pay for whatever I was getting.

I told him thanks but there's no need, and he kept insisting that I let him buy me a cup of coffee. I told him again there was really no need, but he didn't relent. I eventually accepted, much to his enthusiasm. We stood in line, he paid for my cup of coffee, and we talked for awhile while I waited for my drink. He eventually asked if he could get my number or if I'd be interested in exploring the rest of the fair together. I apologized and told him that I'm straight, and he got a bit annoyed. 

He scoffed and said ""you could have told me that before I bought you a coffee."" And then walked out of the Cafe.

Was I the asshole here? I kind of feel like it. I sort of figured he was interested in me when he first made the offer, but I didn't want to assume. I tried to politely turn him down, but he kept on insisting.

1dhishx,AITA for messing with in-laws when they pretended my vacation house was theirs?,"I (45M) bought land out west for a future vacation house years ago.  When my now-wife (37F) and I were engaged, I finally got around to having it built.  I paid for it myself and it is my name only (wife’s fine with this).  My MIL has always been a bit weird about it. She grew up in a family that had a “compound” (long gone) and when I started building she was excited about how “we would have a family compound again.”  It was odd, but I let it slide.  She and my FIL also would often more “tell” my wife (not me) that they would be staying there on certain dates, rather than asking.  We usually don’t have people stay there without us – if we wanted that, well, houses in the area Airbnb for $10K/wk. 

Recently they were staying there for a week.  We have a homewatch guy who comes after we leave to make sure water’s off, it’s all locked up, etc, and checks periodically when vacant. He showed up 2 days after ILs were to have left  and called us to say he found a couple there who said they were visiting the owners (whom they identified as ILs) and had asked to stay on four days after they left.  My wife recognized the name (“the Smiths”) as friends of her parents, nice people, and this wasn’t their fault, so we called them and told them the situation but let them stay the extra days.

Here’s where I might be the AH.  I decided to mess with the ILs.  I called them and that well-pump system had thrown an error code (said (our house is very internet-connected so it can be managed from afar).  Could one of them go to pipe room and FaceTime me so I could walk them through reset?  My MIL stammered and said that they had gone to town for the day and couldn’t; and that water seemed fine that morning so could we just have a tech come in a few days?  I said its hard to get techs out there and the caretaker is away, but I could wait ‘til they get back in the evening.  I also said, it’s weird that you’re in town, but I am getting alerts that the garage door has been opened and closed several times during the day – maybe I should have a neighbor check it out?   “No, don’t, we’ll be back!” I then told “the Smiths” that my ILs were banned and if they showed up they should have them call me to explain.  The ILs drove 4 hours to get back to the house to cover up what had gone on.  They called us and I told them that we knew they had been representing the house as their own, giving it to their friends and they were banned.  They protested that they’d have to get a hotel or drive 4 hours back, and I said I didn’t give a shit, so long as they got off my property immediately. They whined about how they had made plans later in the summer.  I told them they could tell whatever friends they had lied to about having a vacation place the truth or some other outlandish lie, but they weren’t coming.   My wife then posted on social media (where she is connected with many of ILs friends) that the house is mine and any invitations extended were not authorized.  ILs called us jerks.",PrizeNegotiation5637,5006,0.9700000286102296,305,1718576040,2024-06-16 17:14:00,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dhishx/aita_for_messing_with_inlaws_when_they_pretended/,6,2024
1dhjlyc,AITA for wanting nothing to do w my sisters baby?,"Long story so my apologies. Basically my mother met my step father and he took me on as his own, they then went on to have my sister (A) a year later. My mum died and my step dad kept me as his daughter and then remarried (B) when my sister was 2.

B hated me as I wasn't my dads and look a lot like my mom and eventually talked my dad into kicking me out the house in my mid teens and I went to live w my dads sister and her wife before I went off to college. 10 years later I'm married and have two children, When I was pregnant with my first A was super excited to be an auntie and came to my baby shower and everything, however once my daughter was born she never visited, I offered to go to her, meet her halfway, go do something like coffee date or beach day or something but she was always busy. Same thing happened with my second daughter, A was a no show. We'd message all the time but when I invited her for birthdays or weekends she'd say she was coming then just not show up. Fast forward my children are 8 and 9 years old and have never met their aunt, they don't actually know anything about her, no how are you texts for about 5 years now as I stopped reaching out because she just kept blowing us off. My sister had her baby 4 months ago which I found out via Facebook. I didn't message her because I thought she didn't want anything to do with my kids why should I bother with hers?

I borrowed something from my dads sister and went to drop it off the other day while the kids were at school. My dad, A and B were there with A's baby. I tried to just leave but A cornered me about not congratulating her about the baby or asking how she was doing, and I said why would I you didn't do it for my kids? She blew up at me calling me selfish, I yelled back I don't make a habit of asking after strangers babies and that's what she was to me. My dad said that we were sisters and family is supposed to be there for each other. I'm ashamed to admit I did lose my temper with him and call him a cold hearted bastard and who was he to talk to me about family wearing his no.1 grandpa shirt when he had grandchildren he had never acknowledged?. Where I am probably the asshole is this all happened in my aunts' house and in front of A's baby who was sleeping at the time but still it's not ideal to be screaming in front of an infant. My aunt thinks I was in the right and it was a long time coming but her wife thinks I could've used this as an opportunity to reconnect as maybe now A is mature enough to be able to have a relationship with me and my kids.

1diame9,AITA for not putting my MIL’s Maiden name in my child’s name. ,"My fiancé (24m) and I (24f) are expecting our first child in December of this year. We don’t know the gender yet so we were picking names for both a boy and a girl. We’ve fallen in love with names already. My fiancé has his father’s last name, and that name is on his birth certificate. While his mother has a completely different last name. She has been hellbent on getting us to make the last name of our child her maiden name which neither of us have. So in my head it just doesn’t make sense. She has been very manipulative in the past with various things to the point where we have given in to just get her to leave us alone about things. This time around she proceeded to guilt trip us on why we won’t give the child her last name. She proceeded to throw the “I raised you he didn’t” card and even said she was going to go to the court to change my fiancés last name which I found hilarious seeing he’s a grown adult. Now mind you MIL has 4 sons, two of which have her maiden name as her last name and all four children are straight and have potential to bare children of their own in the future. Im trying to convince my fiancé not to give in to even hyphenating her last name and keeping it just his current last name to help set early boundaries on raising this child. But MIL has it so deep in his mind that he has to please her and that she’s entitled to make these decisions because she raised him. Not to mention she had demanded to be at my gender ultrasound instead of waiting for the reveal we have planned at our baby shower. So I’m just curious if ITA because I want our child to have his or her father’s last name and not their grandmothers. 

UPDATE: My fiancé and I have talked and we have agreed to give the baby his last name as I will be marrying him and taking the last name anyway. Boundaries will be HEAVILY set with MIL and appointments will be kept private between the two of us. I thank all of you who have validated my feelings and who have given advice as this all has helped make us realize and make him realize that this is a creepy power control thing on her end.

1djvqyq,AITA for refusing to give my boyfriends’ cat back to his mother after his death?,"My boyfriend (26) of 3 years died in November of 2023 after getting in a car accident. He left behind his 2 cats Gizmo and Shortcake which we love dearly. Gizmo is 8 and Shortcake is 2.

Before we met, my boyfriend adopted Gizmo while he still lived with his mother so they all lived together for around 5 years before they moved out and moved in with me into my apartment and then we adopted Shortcake together a year ago from a local shelter.

Before his death, his mother and I had a decent relationship and we got along fine. I think his death brought us together more and she supported me throughout my grief. She would take me out for coffee and made sure I was eating well and taking care of myself, and I would try to help her out as well. 

Just recently she reaches out to me on whatsapp to ask about Gizmo and if she could come over to my place to say hi to him because she hadn’t seen him in a while. I said sure and she came over for around an hour ,we chatted about stuff and then she left. Later that night she messaged to ask me if she could maybe take Gizmo back to her house as he reminds him so much of her son and having Gizmo back would make her feel a lot better.

I said to her that it wouldn’t be fair on Gizmo to disrupt his routine on top of everything that’s happened as Gizmo was pretty shaken by the loss and was slowly starting to come back out of his shell. 

Her tone takes a 180 and she demands that I give her back Gizmo as it’s “technically her cat” and that she’s known him longer than I have so she has “more of a right to him than I do”. I refuse and try to reason with her but Gizmo is fine where he is. She sends me in full capitals that “the grief of a mother is more than the grief of a girlfriend”. 

I genuinely considered giving Gizmo back to her after she said that but I love Gizmo with my whole heart and I don’t want to make this harder on him that what it has to be and anyone with a pet would relate to that. 

In the morning she asked me to reconsider my answer to which I say it’s still a no and she leaves me on read. She then blasts me on facebook calling me a “selfish” and I get a dozen messages on facebook from her family calling me the same but I am still standing firm on my decision. This whole situation has put major strain on my relationship with her and my boyfriend’s extended family. This is a side of her I’ve never seen before and I think it’s damaged our relationship to a point of no return which sucks as they were my support system during my boyfriend’s death. It hurts me to think what my boyfriend would’ve thought of this whole situation as him and his mother were super close as well. I don’t know what he would’ve wanted me to do but regardless Gizmo is staying with me.

1dkoexw,AITA for asking my friend not to speak to me about a shared hobby after he found my “white whale?”,"I (31F) and my friend (30M) share a mutual hobby, comics. 

For context, he got into collecting them himself about four months ago after finding out just how intense I was about it. To be honest, it *is* the one thing we’ve really connected on, and while we do share other interests outside of this, nothing else really came close as far as quality time and mutual enjoyment goes. Traveling long distances just to look at Facebook marketplace posts, spending weekends hitting up yard sales, old book stores, flea markets, random shops, etc.

There’s a very specific run that I’ve been obsessed with since I was a kid, and one issue left that would complete my set that I’ve been working on for over 15 years now. I also have all of the figures, etc. that I know of that were released alongside it.

It’s the last thing I need and I’ve always been on the lookout for it - there are a couple available online, but priced above $5k, which I can’t afford. He knows all about this one as I rant and rave about it constantly. I have a tiny photo of it in a locket I wear as a joke, lol.

Last week, he found one in a shop for $2. He came up behind me, saw it before I did, and picked it up without saying anything. I didn’t realize what it was until he pulled it out of the bag later in the car, and showed me, saying how cool it was he found it so cheap and how he was going to get it graded and buy a case, etc.

If I said I was happy for him, I’d be lying. I’m so goddamn jealous, I cried about it for two days straight. I keep thinking things like, “If only I’d looked at the rack from top to bottom rather than bottom to top, I would have found it first.” TBH it makes me sick to think about, that I was so close and lost out to someone who, frankly, I feel like it isn’t as important to - Though now he says it’s going to be the start of his own collection for that run. “Now that I have this one, I may as well get the rest,” were his words.

I can fully admit I haven’t been able to let it go. He kept trying to talk to me about it, asking where I found all of mine, etc. I told him 
I understand he saw it first, bought it, and that he can do what he wants with it, but I was going to need time to get over my feelings - I just missed out on the object to my obsession to someone I myself introduced to the hobby, who previously didn’t particularly care for that specific run.

I asked him not to talk to me about it, and said I didn’t feel like going out and hunting with him for a while. He emphasized that now we can focus on finding myself one, but that’s the first I’ve seen outside of a glass case in nearly two decades. Plus, I just don’t want to go with him specifically, at least until I feel better.

He says I’m putting a strain on our friendship and sabotaging my own weekends (I’m refusing to go out and look for comics - I feel unmotivated) because I can’t be an adult about the situation. I feel like what he did wasn’t “wrong” but that I have a right to distance myself and handle my feelings if I need to.

Then last night, I cooked 2 chicken breasts for Zane and my dad (they don't like seafood), and I told them ahead of time they each had 1. Zane ate BOTH chicken breasts. My poor dad had to go get fast food for dinner. Zane said, ""Sorry I ate both. I was just hungry.""

In general, Zane has completely drained our snack supply - even things we bought for ourselves (gluten free/keto friendly snacks). He seriously eats all day long.

I confronted my sister and told her that Zane is a pig and needs to cool it. My mom and dad agree, but my sister is upset with me. AITA?

1dm8gze,WIBTA if I ask a special-needs customer to stop coming to my store,"I (34F) work in a higher end of town in a specialty boutique style store. I am currently seven months pregnant and the only employee. I maintain a pretty healthy relationship with everybody in town, other stores, even our competitors. I want everyone to feel safe, accepted and welcome. In the time I work, and there are many restaurants, and there is one gentleman who walks through the town and visits at some of the stores on his way to work. He has high functioning autism. He can drive he has a job. He has a masters degree and several other things. I recently told him that I was pregnant so that he could prepare for my leaving for maternity. I let him touch my belly that day. He has been in every single day since, almost three weeks, to come try to touch my belly to feel the baby. The issue is I don't like to be touched. I also don't like people coming up behind me. For contacts I have complex PTSD. And people behind me is one of my triggers.  Also being the only employee I can't often stop. I have expressed to him many times that I cannot stop every day to let him touch my belly and he has recently taken up on him to walk behind me even while I'm with other customers to touch my belly. I told him that was no ok. He didn't come in for two days and when he did a few days later, he tried to touch my belly, but he asked so I said fine. However, he tried lifting my shirt so he could touch my bare skin, and I snapped and said absolutely not. he came back in the next day walk straight towards me trying to feel my belly too, which I told him we cannot do this anymore. You may not come in to touch my belly. It is Taurus season and I am far too busy and I do not like this. Today he tried coming in again and I'm contemplating just telling him he's not allowed in my store anymore. He never buys anything and mostly browses anyway when he was here before. I understand that some people do not have the same concept of personal space however, I do not believe that that is an excuse as I told him many times in a way, he would understand that it was not OK. So would I be the asshole for kicking him out?

1dm8tul,AITA for pulling out of my sister’s wedding a year before the event and being mad that she won’t talk to me now,"I (28F), was asked by my (25F) sister to be the MOH for her wedding that was between a year and a half to 2 years out.

Six months ago, I found out that I am pregnant. My husband and I hadn’t really been actively trying but we weren’t using protection because I’ve been told since I was in my teens that I was unlikely to be able to get pregnant, naturally. We are over joyed and our families are, as well! …except for my sister.

A few weeks following my pregnancy announcement, my mom and sister had a conversation about being realistic on if I would be able to take on all the duties of being her MOH while pregnant and later with an infant. My sister later spoke with me and told me that if I could not follow through with the duties of being her MOH - it was okay! They could find something else for me to be involved in, with the wedding. (For context, my sister and FBILs wedding party is so big that they have two best men and two MOHs) I discussed it with my family and husband…but I ultimately decided that it wasn’t fair to my sister or my child to make a promise to fulfill those duties when I would have a 3-4 month old infant and was generally unsure if I could do everything she needed of me. 

The wedding is two towns away, 30+ minutes drive, and I would either have to bring the baby with me for the day of the wedding (What bride and bridesmaids want to listen to a baby all day while they are getting ready?) or I would have to leave the baby with someone else (From around 8am that morning to somewhere between 6-8pm that night)

So I ultimately pulled out of the wedding party, about 12 months before the date. And intend to help with other things.

The problem is…despite my sister giving me the out and me taking the out….she will not speak to me. She hasn’t spoken to me or answered my calls in about 6 months. She showed up to my gender reveal and completely ignored me. She ignores me at family dinners, outtings, etc. My entire family has told her she is in the wrong and needs to get over it…but I understand that it’s her special day. 

But now I’m angry too…because I know that once I have this baby she is going to try to come into my home and act like everything is fine. And I will not allowed that to happen. I have had a difficult pregnancy so far…full of complications and sickness…my sister has been my best friend for years, she was the first person I called when I found out. And she was the one that gave me an out, in the first place.

I needed her too…


Edit: 
- To clear up some confusion, I am still planning on being involved in the wedding to some capacity and attending. Just not as the MOH
- Also, it should be known that this is a CHILD FREE wedding. I did not mention that prior, however I realize now how important that minor detail actually is to you guys.
- She came to ME about stepping away from the MOH position, not the other way round. I still offered to assist in what I can. Her expectations on what she expects from her MOH is beyond just standing beside her on her wedding day. If it were that simple, there probably wouldn’t even be an issue.

1doikmj,AITA for telling my mom she wasn't perfect? ,"My mom was an absolute narcissist growing up. We had to have gendered interests (no Legos for me). I had to take extracurricular activities she liked (no drama club or band). I was grounded for not being allowed on the cheerleader teams, and she would call our friends fat or poor if they didn't meet her expectations. I was on a diet as a kid and not allowed to eat the same as my brother’s. 

My SIL (Kate ) mom (Debbie) was the opposite, allowing her kids to do what they wanted and have the interest just for them. Kate is a lovely, well-adjusted woman; her mother, whom I have met several times, is a kind soul. 

We had a graduation party for my youngest brother. Kate made us cupcakes, and they were delicious. My mom made a snide remark about wishing I could be as perfect as Kate. I told my mom I knew that feeling because Debbie was such a perfect mom, and I wished she was my mother so I could have turn out perfect like Kate. 

My mom flipped her shit and started yelling at me, asking how I could say that to her. I pointed out that Kate seemed perfect because she had a good childhood with good parents, and I’m sure I would have bloomed into a person like Kate under the same opportunities. 

My mom kicked me out of the party and got mad at me for upsetting everyone with my disrespectful behavior. I went home, and Kate and my brother stopped by later, bringing me some cupcakes and wine. We talked, and neither was mad at me. My mom, however, goes to Facebook to air her dirty laundry and shame me (this is not new behavior, so I’m unfazed by that). Several people called me ungrateful and said my mom did the best she could for us. I find it laughable, but family members say I need to apologize, but she started it by saying, “Kate is perfect.” ",Ordinary-Struggle154,1601,0.9700000286102296,153,1719354005,2024-06-25 17:20:05,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1doikmj/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_wasnt_perfect/,6,2024

She said something about student doing x, she did y, student got punishment, next day, SIL acts a certain way toward student. In the ""I'm not finished with yesterday"" type way. She had many examples of this same behavior. And I say ""Honestly, if you can't put one day behind the other, especially when it comes to conflicts with children, teaching probably isn't for you.""

1dqvms5,AITA for not eating watermelons my (21m) sister (18f) keeps buying?,"My sister is a big fan of watermelons. In the summer she's been buying watermelons from the grocery store almost every week. She cuts the watermelon and serves it, and she's really into food preparation in general.

However, I'm not a big fan of watermelon. I don't really like the taste of it. When she offers it to me, I politely decline. She says she feels hurt when I don't eat the watermelon she buys and prepares, and she says I'm ungrateful and wasteful.

Our parents agree with her and say that I should just eat the watermelon to avoid wasting food and to support her efforts. I said that I feel pressured into eating the watermelon, and I said that I'm not a fan of watermelon that much. They still insisted that I eat the watermelon, saying that food should not go to waste, I should support and appreciate my sister, and that it has nutritious value. I reiterated that I did not want to eat the watermelon because I do not like it. I pointed out that I like mango and my sister does not, so I asked if she would eat mango that I buy and prepare. She said that she would not because it's kind of sour and has a weird texture, whereas watermelon is the ideal summer fruit because it's sweet and juicy.

1drm1oo,AITA for not attending my best friend's wedding?,"My friend [27/f] asked me [28/f] to be one of her bridesmaids for her wedding. She was my maid of honor two years ago, and before that, we'd always say we'd be each other's maid of honor (we've been friends for 20 years). When she asked me to be a bridesmaid, it stung a bit, to be honest, but seeing as she has a twin sister that she is close to, it made sense that she should be her maid of honor.

The issue I really had with this is that at one point, before I did barely anything as a bridesmaid, she told me, ""You don't have to stand with the other bridesmaid's during the wedding.""  I found it weird that she was saying that, but I replied, ""no, I want to be there with all of you"". After a bit of back and forth, she admitted she doesn't want me standing there with everyone because of my fear of being the center of attention and my social anxiety.

She was worried that I would have a panic attack just like I did standing there at my own wedding. Honestly, it was bad during my wedding because I was shaking and couldn't breathe, and everyone's terrified reaction made it even worse for me. I had to leave and come back to just me, my husband, and my mother to continue our vows and such while everyone else moved on to the reception. I couldn't even go join them until I was drunk enough to not feel embarrassed.

I've been to therapy since then and have made huge progress regarding my social anxiety and my best friend knows this. I felt hurt that she didn't trust me enough to let me stand with the others. I told her I was so much calmer and less anxious now, and I won't even be the center of attention like I was when I was the bride. She said she acknowledged my improvement but just doesn't want to take chances.

She said she doesn't want to embarrass me again and that she would just feel worried about me the whole time, and was also worried that I would ruin the mood of the wedding if I did happen to have a panic attack. I eventually told her that I'd just rather be a guest if I can't do all the bridesmaid stuff. On the day of her wedding, I was just so sick to my stomach with hurt and sadness that I was merely going as a guest to her wedding that I just decided not to go because I felt so left out.

Now she is very mad at me for making her feel bad at her wedding. She thinks I was trying to hurt her and make her feel guilty because of what she thinks was a reasonable request. I didn't mean to hurt her but I just couldn't go because I was overwhelmed with hurt. The people I've talked to are all divided on who is the asshole in this situation. I feel bad for ruining her mood on her wedding day but I still feel what she asked of me was hurtful.

1drmdgb,AITA for telling my friend that she is making her fiancé miserable.,"I (21F) recently got into a pretty heated argument with my friend (22F) regarding her engagement to her fiancé (30M). 
For some background info, me and my friend (Carrie) have been on and off friends since middle school, but over the last 3 years, have become really close and I would consider her a best friend. I love her, but she is definitely one to be dramatic and overreactive. I’ve always thought that, but it has been overwhelmingly hard to handle for the past year. 
About a year into her relationship with her fiancé (Shawn) she started to obsess over the idea of getting engaged. She would constantly ask friends and family if Shawn had mentioned wanting to propose, would go through his bags during every trip they took to see if he had a ring hidden somewhere, and would sob to Shawn and anyone who would listen after any major holiday or event, wondering why he wouldn’t propose because it was the “perfect opportunity”. 
During a night out with Shawn, Carrie, and one of his friends, Carrie texted me begging for me to talk to Shawn privately about when he was going to propose. Knowing she wouldn’t drop it, I texted Shawn and said at some point that night, I would need to talk to him. Eventually, I got him alone and explained that he didn’t need to tell me anything, but that Carrie wanted me to ask about thoughts on engagement. He told me that he’s gotten to the point where he is going to propose to make her happy and that it will be about two months from when our convo took place.
 Now, they are engaged, but the issues have not gone away. Now Carrie is obsessed with wedding planning and Shawn has shared with me that he feels overwhelmed by her even more so now. Shawn isn’t allowed to go out for drinks once a week after work or play videos games like he usually does because of the wedding. 
Yesterday, I was over at their shared place because Shawn was golfing and Carrie didn’t want to be alone. At one point, she looked at his location, then pulled up a map of the golf course online and asked me to help her figure out what hole he was on. I told her it looked like he was on hole eight, which upset her because he had already been golfing for awhile and she assumed he would be close to done. She proceeded to call him 32 times in a row until he answered, and then sobbed when he picked up and told him he needed to come home now, because he had been out for too long. After their argument over the phone, I couldn’t stop myself from the comment I made which was: don’t you think you’re making Shawn a little miserable? 
This obviously didn’t go over well, she sobbed and yelled at me, saying I just didn’t understand how much she loves him. 
I left and we haven’t talked in a couple days. I regret what I said, but I don’t necessarily think I’m wrong. My overall concern is that I have definitely become too involved in their relationship, I have definitely become the middle man.
So, AITA for telling my friend that she is making her fiancé miserable.",ForeverCompetitive12,4565,0.9700000286102296,779,1719698957,2024-06-29 17:09:17,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1drmdgb/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_she_is_making_her/,6,2024
1drnora,AITA for ruining our family trip over matching outfits?,"**tl;dr** - I think my SILs intentionally left me out of matching family outfits on our trip & got upset; they said it was all in my head. AITA?

I just got back from our annual family trip & created this account to figure out if I am the A\*\*\* because I can't tell anymore.

My husband and I have been together for 15 years, and his family has a history of excluding me and our second kid from events. This year, we went on a 6-day cruise. A neighbor/friend booked the same cruise last minute. I made sure both my SILs knew they were coming.

One SIL (Jane) loves matching outfits, so we picked out swimsuits for the kids and an outfit for the kids to take photos in. I asked if adults were matching and was told no. On the first day, both Jane & my other SIL (Cindy) showed up in matching dresses with their husbands in almost identical outfits. They shrugged it off and said they just forgot to tell me.

The next day was my kid's birthday. At breakfast, my SILs disappeared with our kids and my friend’s kid without a word. When they returned, they dismissed my concerns and left again to eat lunch without us. We joined them later, but it was clear we were not included in their plans. They showed up for our dinner plans in matching outfits again and, again, we did not get the memo.

By the third day, everyone, including my friend, was in coordinated outfits except my family. When I confronted my SILs, they denied everything and blamed me for overthinking and moving to slowly. They said I made everyone miserable and that I was aggressive for expressing my hurt feelings.

The rest of the trip was awkward. I felt excluded and hurt, and now I fear there will be fallout with my MIL and the whole family.

She says her coolant fan is broken and she hasn’t changed the oil to her car for nearly 2 years and if I can put the rest of the money towards that.

1dsdhlx,AITA for not paying for my daughter's college housing and campus fees next year because she misled me about her summer classes?,"My (55M) daughter (19F) is taking three online summer classes this summer. Back in April, she told me that all her classes would be in-person, so I paid for her summer housing and meal plan so she could live on campus. I didn't think much of it at the time because I trusted her. Two of them are general education classes (English and physics), and one is a major-specific class, so I figured that she would want to get her generation requirements out of the way and I'm sure the major-specific class is important for her major.

However, I just found out that her classes are actually all online. There is a 3rd-party website that has information about classes each semester at her college, and I was just scrolling through it out of curiosity and happened to see her classes are all online, with no in-person component. I was very shocked about how I was misled for the last 2 or 3 months. I know that she really likes campus life, but things do tend to tone down over the summer, and she probably is aware of the campus housing fees and whatnot. This means I spent a good amount of money for housing and meal plans that she didn't actually need. I'm paying for her education out of her college savings, which we've been saving for many years, and I want to teach her the value of money and the importance of honesty.

I was on the phone with her, and I told her I decided that I'm not paying for her housing or any of her campus fees next year. I emphasized that she needs to understand that there are consequences to her actions. However, she is really upset and says that I'm being too harsh. She says that in April the classes were listed as in-person but they moved it to virtual at the very last minute, after the deadline for housing withdrawal and refund stuff. I don't know if this is actually true since I never bothered to check the class listings at that time and I didn't see a reason she would lie about it. I told her I'm very skeptical that they would move all classes to online at the very last minute because it would certainly disrupt some people's plans (especially those who lease off-campus). My wife said that what I told her was way too harsh, and that unexpected things do happen.

So AITA for not paying for my daughter's college housing and campus fees next year because she misled me about her summer classes?",RangerRemarkable3,3468,0.8700000047683716,2128,1719786753,2024-06-30 17:32:33,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dsdhlx/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_daughters_college/,6,2024

They were blaming her saying after everything he did to plan it she just embarrassed him like that she should’ve said yes and if she wanted to say no so bad she should’ve said it in private… WHAT?

Now this is what i said and some of my guy friends and most if not all my girlfriends agreed with me but some of my guy friends went as far as to say i lacked empathy 
I said if ur going to propose in public be ready to get rejected in public 
I thought it was common sense that you only propose in public if ur sure she’s gonna say yes (i’m talking about like hoco and proms) 
If it’s a crush then it should be in private in case she says no so you can save yourself from embarrassment but some guys were acting like she it’s her duty to save his ass from embarrassment and she was just being rude because she thinks she’s pretty because someone asked her out 

And some guys were saying she should’ve have said yes because of his effort that it’s the thought that counts like so if i say no to someone because i have other plans or i just am mot interested im the person i’m an ahole?

And their acting like he slayed dragons to get flowers to propose to her i could easily get roses and make a cute cardboard and gather my friends to help me if i wanted to make a public proposal but i’m not gonna be like:

1dt5i7m,"AITA? My sister, recently divorced after 11 years, raised her husband’s child from infancy after the mother passed away, and now she believes our family should sever all ties with the child.","My sister married a widower shortly after his wife passed away from cancer, and she effectively became ‘Mom’ to his 6-month-old son, Josh, whom she raised as her own. They also had a child together, Sam. Unfortunately, my sister and her husband divorced two years ago after 11 years of marriage, and while we’ve tried to maintain a relationship with Josh by sending birthday cards and holiday gifts despite living 1200 miles away, my sister hasn’t kept in touch with him.



Once he was born, my sister became entirely focused on Sam, who now has no contact with his father. From my perspective, Sam avoids anyone who disciplines him, including his father, leading to the stress in their family dynamics that ultimately lead to their divorce.



Recently, while visiting, we attended Josh’s basketball game and took him out for ice cream along with his father and his new girlfriend. My sister found out about this and cut off all contact with me, expressing her discontent through my daughter, stating she ‘likely won’t be able to get past this’ and that ‘after a divorce, cousins and uncles don’t come with it.’ My mother has also taken her side, upset that I ‘hurt’ my sister.



I’ve tried to apologize and reassure my sister that we didn’t discuss her or share anything about her with her ex, but she hasn’t responded. I even reached out on Mother’s Day without any response.



Am I in the wrong here? It’s not like we’re inviting her ex over for dinner or being overly friendly with him. It’s been two years, and she’s engaged to get married again. Considering past incidents, like when my sister conspired with my abusive ex to break into my house, I feel her reaction is excessive.



I just want to make sure I’m not being unreasonable. She hasn’t spoken to me directly about her feelings, choosing instead to message my daughter, which I found inappropriate.",soflobadpilot,1049,0.949999988079071,144,1719871604,2024-07-01 17:06:44,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dt5i7m/aita_my_sister_recently_divorced_after_11_years/,7,2024
1dt7idd,AITA for asking my husband to hold his pee during flight with 2 kids,"My husband and I flew a 3.5hr flight with our 3mo old and 2.5yo recently. We were unable to buy seats together so I was in the middle aisle with baby and he was across the aisle of me with the aisle seat and the toddler in the middle. 

About an hour into the flight my husband gets up to pee while I’m nursing baby and as soon as he leaves the toddler crawls over to me. I try to get the toddler to sit on my lap but he causes baby to stop eating so baby is crying on me while I’m trying to hold the toddler and not disrupt the two people I’m sitting next to. Plus my husband got stuck behind the beverage cart so he could grab the toddler for 20 minutes. 

Later, my husband gets up to pee again while I’m feeding baby and same thing happens of trying to feed baby with a toddler on my lap. Ending up with a crying baby and a toddler in one middle seat.


Back story, my husband pees a lot. I’ve worked with a pelvic floor therapist and told her how frequently he pees and she agrees it’s too much and he should work with PT to avoid issues down the road. He says he doesn’t need help and blames it on drinking lots of water.

After the flight, I told my husband how hard it was to balance both boys and asked if he can just hold his pee. So many times I have to pee when I’m watching the boys but hold it until timing is better. He said he can’t.

Next, I asked if he could ask me before he pees and go when baby isn’t nursing and I have two hands. He said no and he should be able to pee when he has to go. 

We have a full summer of flying ahead of us including a few international trips and I’m worried.

1dt7jgf,AITA for telling my husband he needs to quit his dream job?,"So I (32F) and my husband (29M) live in an area with an extremely high cost of living. I work a job that pays decently well, which is kind of necessary to live where we do. My husband worked a job for years that paid less than mine did, but was okay overall, though he absolutely hated working there.

Around October of last year, my husband managed to get a job in his dream career field. He had been working at it for years, and was really excited about finally getting there. However, it's come with 

The big issue is, the pay in his field is abysmal. He works as a freelancer (which is standard in his industry) so his job has zero benefits, and it's a pretty significant pay cut from his old job.

We don't have combined finances, and after he took the new job, we had to rearrange how we pay for things to account for his lower income. Previously, he had covered a slightly larger percentage of the expenses due to me having student loans to pay off while he didn't. As it is now, I have to be the breadwinner since his income was basically halved, paying for a larger portion of the expenses.

I sat him down recently and told him I felt he needed to quit his job and find a better-paying field because it just wasn't feasible. He got upset, since like I said, this is something he's dreamed of for years and worked really hard to get, which I understand. But I just feel this  isn't fair to me. We've had to cut back on a lot of things and there's not really any sign of a pay increase at this point. I feel like I'm carrying him.

He offered to get a part-time job on the side, but I know anything he could get that would be feasible for him while keeping his current job wouldn't provide much. He suggested we move somewhere less expensive, to which I said absolutely not, since we'd have to go quite  a ways to find something in that range and it'd mean ridiculously long commutes to my work and being further away from my family. He offered to have his parents help, which I don't want because it's not a long-term solution.

He's extremely upset, and I understand it, because I know he worked hard to get here. If he quit now, it'd basically kill his career and it would be extremely hard for him to get another shot at this job. It's not like we're struggling, which is true, we can pay rent and put food on the table, but I hate feeling like this. I work long days at a rather difficult job, while he works from home doing something he did before as a hobby and only makes half as much money now. My point is that it's not like he has to stop doing what he does altogether, since as I mentioned, he did it as a hobby beforehand, but he's upset because he said this is the only thing he's ever wanted to do career-wise and giving it up now would mean he likely never would be able to make it work.

AITA? I understand this is important to him but I'm starting to resent him because I feel like the burden of our finances are being placed on me and we've had to cut back on a lot of things.",Kitchen-Page-2111,3672,0.7799999713897705,3579,1719877025,2024-07-01 18:37:05,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dt7jgf/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_needs_to_quit_his/,7,2024

My son had been wanting to go on the boys trip for months and my Husband and I finally made the plans for it. Once they left, I told my daughter “let’s go to the mall.” She got all excited which made me excited and we hopped in the car. 

We went to Bath and Body Works and I got her a candle. And we went to American Eagle and she wanted a pair of jeans and earrings, so I got them for her. Then lastly, we got Starbucks after I took her to Ulta to get her a new mascara. 

I wanted to treat her since we couldn’t go on a vacation. She was super happy and grateful. I wanted to use my promotion for good.

Once the boys got home my daughter was so excited to show her brother what she got. And he got so upset that she got all these cool things and he got nothing. My husband also said that I shouldn’t get her all of these things and that it’s not fair to my son. They had went on a week long vacation. I don’t want my family to pick sides.

1dwb70t,AITA - I asked my fiancé to get me a drink in bed,"This is my first time posting on reddit. Slightly confused by our interaction tonight. As background, we have 4.5 month old twins that have only just started sleeping through the night, so having time to ourselves again in the evening is a novelty. He works.. I look after the twins 5 days a week 8-6. 

We were settled in bed watching tv. I had brought us up a drink each about an hour before this. I asked him if he would mind grabbing us another drink as I was warm in bed. He said no. I asked why, and he replied that he was also in bed.

I was a little annoyed. More so because every single morning I bring him a coffee in bed (even when I was pregnant and the smell made me gag). I bring him drinks if I’m in bed and he is thirsty in the bath. I’d get up to hoover the moths away if they make him uncomfortable. I think my love language is acts of service. If you read into that sort of stuff. I always thought that doing something like that isn’t a big deal if it’s for your partner.

I told him I was a bit put out - just to be honest with him. He told me he was not my personal slave and he didn’t realise that he had to ‘jump’ whenever I told him to. Please bear in mind, I have never asked him for a drink in bed before, or anything else unreasonable that I can think of. I told him I didn’t think of him that way at all.. I just told him that if it was the other way around I’d just do it because it was something nice to do for your partner. He disagreed and said I was being unreasonable and stupid for getting upset about it. 

This eventually turned into an argument. He told me to ask ‘anyone’ about it and I would realise that I am in the wrong. So I thought… maybe reddit? 

Is this issue arising just because we have different ways of expressing love and affection etc? Or is it a deeper issue? Am I being unreasonable - it’s something I’m willing to work on if so.

1dx2w79,AITA for kicking my step daughter out?,"My husband and I are happily married and have one child together. He has one daughter from a previous relationship. We get along great with his ex and her husband. They weren't together long as they were lifelong friends who briefly tried dating and realized they were better as friends, even after the birth of their daughter.

Everyone gets along with the exception of their daughter, who really doesn't get along with anyone. She stayed with her aunt and when she left a couple weeks later, her cousin had to start therapy. The aunt went low contact with all of us. Her grandmother stopped having her for more than a couple days because her blood pressure can't take it.  She's been in therapy, asked if something has happened to her, but she is just defiant. She has been diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder.

Her mother and step father have started therapy because of the constant stress of having her around. We told them that of course we would have her stay with us. 

It's been miserable. She goes out of her way to do the opposite of what anyone asks her to do. Refuses to do basic chores i.e. picking up her own trash and dirty clothes. We gave her the household chore of vacuuming once a day in the three rooms that have carpet. It takes maybe fifteen minutes. We found out she ""traded"" our son then complained when she was caught that it wasn't fair he got the easier job of watering two plants. We told her that not only is he only 8 yo but he is developmentally delayed and has muscular dystrophy and can barely push the vacuum. Not only that but he's nonverbal and couldn't tell her no. He just did as he was told.

The last straw was when I went into her room to put clothes away and noticed her pile of leftover food and wrappers. Id told her multiple times it needed thrown away. I decided to do it that time because it was starting to mold and she would lose food in her room privileges. I picked it up and there were a couple roaches. We called an exterminator and he said, they were only in her room and we were lucky to find it early and it most likely happened because instead of throwing her trash away, she just threw it out the window and left the window open. 

My husband says we shouldn't have kicked her out because now resents us and feels like we are giving up on her. I said I understood that as a parent but at what point does she have to stop making all of us miserable? Besides I think the best thing is to finally make her take some responsibility for herself and despite efforts with therapy, attempted quality time, punishments, encouragements, he is just enabling her at this point. Ultimately, I purchased the house prior to marriage and it's still in my name. I refuse to have my son live with someone who will take advantage of him and live in a house with roaches and mold. My husband and I are starting therapy soon for ourselves as well because of this and she is staying with the second friend because the first made her leave.

1dxsnxf,AITA for refusing to help my brother pay for his wedding after he hijacked my graduation party?,"So, I (23F) just graduated from university a few weeks ago. My family threw me a small party to celebrate, and I was really looking forward to it because I'm the first in our fam to get a degree. My older brother, Jake (28M), has always been the favorite, but I've tried not to let it get to me.

Anyway, Jake and his fiancée, Lisa (26F), show up to the party. Everything's going great until Jake decides to give a toast. At first, it's all nice and congratulatory, and then BOOM—he drops the bomb that he and Lisa are getting married in two months. The whole room goes nuts, and just like that, my graduation party turns into their engagement party.

I was totally blindsided and honestly pretty hurt. I mean, I get it, weddings are exciting, but couldn't he have waited for a different day to announce it? I sucked it up and put on a brave face for the rest of the night, but it definitely stung.

Fast forward to last week. Jake and Lisa come to me asking for help with their wedding expenses. They know I've been saving up from my part-time job and side hustles, and they just assumed I'd be down to chip in. I straight-up told them no. I said after what happened at my graduation, I didn't feel like helping out.

Jake and Lisa flipped out, calling me selfish and saying I'm holding a grudge. My mom thinks I should help because ""family helps family,"" but my dad actually backs me up, saying I have every right to feel the way I do.

Now Jake's been telling the whole extended family that I'm being petty, and some of them have been hitting me up, saying I should just get over it and help him out. Others are on my side, saying Jake was way out of line.

1dym5c5,AITA for Not Inviting My Sister to My Wedding After She Ruined My Proposal?,"I (29M) recently got engaged to my girlfriend (28F), and it was supposed to be one of the happiest moments of our lives. I had planned a romantic proposal at our favorite spot, a secluded beach where we had our first date. I had everything ready: flowers, a small picnic, and a photographer hiding nearby to capture the moment.

When the day came, my sister (32F) insisted on tagging along. She said she wanted to take a few ""candid"" photos of us before the proposal. I was hesitant but agreed, thinking it might make the moment more special. Big mistake.

As we reached the spot, my sister started acting weird, making snarky comments and trying to direct the whole scene like a movie. My girlfriend could sense something was off, and the mood was getting ruined. Then, out of nowhere, my sister grabbed the ring box from my pocket and yelled, ""Surprise! Look what he's going to do!"" My girlfriend was shocked, and I was furious.

I managed to salvage the proposal somewhat, but the moment was tainted. My girlfriend said yes, but we both felt the proposal was ruined. Later, I confronted my sister, and she just laughed it off, saying she was ""just trying to help"" and that I was overreacting.

Fast forward to our wedding planning, and my fiancée and I decided not to invite my sister. We wanted our day to be about us, without any unnecessary drama. When my family found out, they were furious. My parents called me heartless, and my sister is playing the victim, saying I'm tearing the family apart over a ""little joke.""

Now I'm feeling conflicted. AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding after she ruined my proposal?

Edit: Here are a few other, not so minor, instances in which my sister has done me wrong:

	1.	My sister has a long history of attention-seeking behavior. She’s the type to fake fainting at parties just to get everyone’s attention. She once “accidentally” set off the fire alarm at my fiancée’s birthday party, causing the whole place to evacuate and ruining the celebration.
	2.	This wasn’t the first time she’s crossed the line with me. When I got my first big promotion, she announced she was pregnant at the same party, only to later admit she was joking. At another family event, she spiked the punch with alcohol knowing I was on medication that strictly prohibited drinking.

1dzh963,AITA for objecting to my roommate having guests stay overnight for 5 days?,"I live in 3 bedroom house with three roommates, and we are all in the Navy.

 One of the guys has had his fiance living with us for the past week, and he also dropped on me today, saying that he is having his Mom and two sisters(19F & 7F) coming into town. I said, “Cool, where are they staying?” he replied that they were staying at our house on the pullout bed in the living room.

I obviously objected to this because our house isn't that big, the living room is connected to the kitchen, and because we are in the Navy, we are up and about at 6 AM, which means we would cause a stir. It also means I won't be able to wind down at the end of the day and watch TV in the living room.

I then suggested they stay at the Navy Lodge, which is FAR cheaper than places out in town, and he brushed off my idea and said, “Well, they are to see me.” 

It's frustrating how someone can be such a cheap ass (especially since he's an officer), stubborn, and inconsiderate. I told him I wasn't ok with this arrangement, and then we got into a fuss, and he thought I was the one being unreasonable.

What do you think?

1dzhg1z,AITA for not allowing my kids a snack after dinner ,"I (28f) and my husband (32m) have 3 beautiful boys together aged 8, 7, and 4. Almost every evening we sit together at the table as a family and enjoy dinner. We have a strict rule that if you don’t finish your plate, you don’t get a snack later or dessert. If our kids are full before their plate is gone, we let them leave the table but save their plate in case they ask for a snack later. This really hasn’t been an issue until recently and specifically tonight where my husband and I got into a fight in front of the kids disagreeing if they could have a snack or not after dinner. For background purposes, financially I would say we are equal when it comes to income. My husband makes twice as much as me and pays all of the bills except the mortgage. I pay the mortgage, our youngest’s daycare, and I buy our groceries and any household necessities. We don’t fight about finances. Recently my husband has been not allowing the kids to have a snack after dinner even if they finish their plate. I’ve been arguing back saying “they finished, they’re allowed a snack.” Tonight our 7 year old asked for a snack after dinner and my husband flipped saying “don’t ask again you’re not having any more food tonight.” I told him he was being unreasonable and snuck my 7 year old down to have a clementine and a banana. My husband thinks I’m the asshole for undermining his decision that the kids won’t have snacks but I think he’s being unreasonable and if we have the means to fed our kids dinner and snacks after why wouldn’t we? So am I the asshole?

Here's where it gets complicated. My parents divorced when I was 5, and my dad remarried when I was 10. He had two children (now 20F and 18M) with my stepmother. Growing up, I saw my dad every other weekend, but we weren't particularly close. He seemed more involved with his ""new"" family.

Now that the will has been read, my stepmother and half-siblings are furious. They claim my father promised them he'd ""take care of everyone"" and are demanding I split the inheritance equally among all three of us kids.

I don't want to. While I'm not close with my half-siblings, I don't dislike them. But I feel like this inheritance is making up for years of my dad being less present in my life. Plus, I have student loans to pay off and was hoping to use some of the money for a down payment on a house.

My stepmother is threatening legal action, though the lawyer says the will is solid. My mom thinks I should keep it all, but some friends say I'm being greedy and should share with my half-siblings.

1e2mcq3,"AITA For making a scene when my brothers girlfriend tried to ""protect her peace""?","I didn't know how to title the post. I apologise. 

My son is eleven months old and 97th percentile for height. He is a big ass baby (currently 36in tall - or about the size of your average 2.5yo) and in 3T clothing. 

However, despite him being so big, he is still just a baby and most of his nutrition ia still from breastmilk. 

For the 4th we had a big family cookout and my brother invited his girlfriend. I live out of state and I didn't want my flights to be too close together so I'm staying for a bit longer. My brother and his girlfriend are doing the same thing.

My family is aware that my son is a baby, obviously, but my brothers girlfriend was not and was initially very shocked when she saw him ""misbehaving"". We explained that he's still a baby, so he's still just exploring the world.

She remained uncomfortable but we mostly avoid each other. Because he's so big feeding him is a chore so I use an armchair as there isn't enough support elsewhere and so there isn't much I can do about covering up (he gets sweaty under blankets and won't eat).

It's been a tense couple of weeks. Last night I think we both kind of lost it. My son needed feeding and she was in the chair; I asked her to move which she whined about but did get up. Everything was fine for another hour or so until she demanded my brother pay for her to go to a hotel for the remaining nights because she can't cope with me and the baby.

He asked what she meant and she said that he's clearly big enough to be on real food and I enjoy making her uncomfortable by feeding him in front of her. 

I got embarrassingly upset and told her that she should keep her mouth shut because she clearly doesn't know the first thing about parenting and certainly doesn't know anything about me or my son.

We argued the same points for a little more until my son woke from his nap and I left to collect him. She then left after telling us all, loudly, that she needs to ""protect her peace"" (which is honestly not a phrase I thought real people said). 

My brother told me I was being immature and left with her. My dad is on ""my side"" but did tell me I should have removed myself from the situation as I'm a grown woman and she's still a teenager (I'm three years older than her so I think thats BS). My mom is neutral but is still trying to convince my brother to come home and ended up paying for their hotel. She thinks I could have been a lot more understanding.

1e3ggnn,AITA for not punishing my daughter for what she said ,"My husband and I are slightly more well off than my sisters family. Because of this my parents do more for them than they do us. When it comes to gifts my daughter (Maddie 7) get things from the dollar store while my nephews get whole Lego sets, iPads and even Disney trips. If my sister needs babysitting they will drop everything for her last minute. If I need it I have to give them a two week’s heads up as well as proper payment. 

Because of this clear favoritism my daughter doesn’t have a good relationship with them. If you as her about her grandparents her mind automatically goes to my husband’s parents because she forgets that she has two pairs. 

Earlier today we having a rare meet up with my parents. My daughter asked if she can go on the trampoline outside. My dad said no because it’s for my nephews. My daughter begged but dad still said no. Maddie then stomps away and said this is why I like other grandma and grandpa more. My parents looked at me expectantly but I didn’t do anything. I recently got off a call with my mom saying I should have told Maddie that was wrong to say. I told her what do you expect she thinks y’all hate her and y’all do nothing to dispel those thoughts. She just got quiet for a bit then said I still shouldn’t let her say something like that to family and hung up. 

My husband is on my side but he also isn’t a fan of my family so I need an outside opinion AITA?

1e47r5k,AITA for leaving the dry wedding wedding early to go to go out.,"So 2 weeks ago I 35f went to a wedding in our college town for a member of our college friend group.  My husband and I left the kids with my parents and we went.  We got a Vrbo with another couple I went to college with for a few days.  My husband and I don’t have a ton of time to ourselves away from the kids so we were excited to let loose.

 On the invitation it said the wedding went to 11 with an after party with the bride and groom at the venue.  The venue was a gorgeous mansion and the bride and groom had it for the night, they were leaving for the honeymoon the next morning.  

Cut to wedding day and it’s a dry wedding.  Apparently the groom is 2 years sober.  No one told us this and we were admittedly bummed.  When we found out there was no alcohol we told people we were going to some bars after and not going to the after party.  We left the wedding at 9:30 because we were itching to go out and the wedding was boring.  

Pretty much the whole college crew left around that time and went out.  Apparently, the bride's friend group did not stay for the party, the grooms did and the optics were very lopsided at the party.  We all heard from the bride about this and she called us assholes for leaving.  She said that she didn't feel supported and felt like we were spiteing her now husband for his sobriety.  I told her that she was reading too much into  it.  We just wanted to go out.  She is especially mad at me as i'm looked at as the ringleader of this outing.  I don't think i've done anything wrong AITA?

I ran some errands, and while out I spoke with my husband briefly about dinner. He asked if I would be home for dinner, to which I replied yes. When I got home, his first question was “what are we doing for dinner” and I told him I assumed he would have already figured that out, seeing as it’s getting close to bed time for the kids.  He said there was no food in the house and would go out to the store to grab groceries.. at this point it’s getting late, so I told him to just order food. He did (begrudgingly) and asked why I was so irritated and why I couldn’t just do it, he said he “helped all day with the kids” ….

1e4962n,AITA for banning my roommates girlfriend for touching my raw cookie dough?,"I rent a room to a lad called AJ. He’s 31. He is dating Nina (25f). I don’t mind if AJ has people over or anything but Nina has been here a lot. 
I am already annoyed because Nina always asks to borrow stuff from me. “Can I borrow a pair of pants for work I forgot mine? Do you have extra face masks or can I borrow lotion/tampons/socks?” 
I have always told her no. I don’t make a lot and I don’t loan things. She was furious I wouldn’t give her a pad but I use a diva cup and period underwear and I am NOT sharing those. 🤮 
She got mad I wouldn’t loan her a dress for their “surprise” date night. I told her if she asks again for ANYTHING of mine then she’s not allowed back in the apartment. 
I told her to stop acting like we are friends and don’t use my stuff. Short of like medical things (bandaids) she should go buy her own stuff. 
This led to AJ being mad at me for making her feel unwelcome. I said I don’t want her around at all and the next time it happens I’m gonna ban her. He said she is not that bad. 
I ended up letting him know one more step over the line and she’s gone. 
And if he breaks that ban, he can find a new place as he is month to month. 
Nina ended up being fine for a few days. I was making cookies from scratch. They come in from some date. She sees the cookies and asks the kind. I tell her chocolate chip and she comes over, sticks her finger in the dough, and takes a chunk. 
I got so mad I told her to get out.  She’s banned. I didn’t care. When AJ tried to argue with me I said I am not renewing his lease if she’s not gone in two minutes.

1e49bdy,AITA for refusing to drive my fiancée to the train station after he missed his bus,"My (24F) fiancée (25M) has ADHD and has a difficult keeping a schedule which often results in him sleeping past his alarm. Today he was supposed to catch the bus at 7:30am but missed it.

I work shiftwork and had just finished my third 12 hour night shift in a row. My commute home is about 45 mins, so I got home just before 8:00am, and woke up my fiancée upon entry. He was upset with himself right away as he usually is when he sleeps in. 

We’ve had this issue in the past and I’ve previously told him that if he really needed a ride to the train station, I would prefer to pick him up at the front door (we live in an apartment) because once I’m parked in the garage and make it upstairs I’m tired and prefer not to leave again at this point (which I’ve still done in the past for him). I would say I probably drive him at least once every 2 weeks when he’s late.

He asked me if I’d drive him to the train station today, which would save him a 30 minute walk for his already long 1.5hr commute, but I declined. I was hesitant at first, but decided that I deserve to put myself first. He seemed upset, and did make a comment saying “I better see you in bed in 2 minutes then”, but eventually went on his way. Approx 30 mins later, he texted me saying that he knows it wasn’t good timing but that he really could’ve used the drive today. 

Later today he called and I expressed to him how I was upset by this. He said he was also upset because I wasn’t there for him when he needed me and that he would’ve done it for me if the roles were reversed, and that he was scared there was a limit to how much he could lean on me. Also that he hopes I’m happy that I got what I wanted and for me to enjoy my extra 30 mins of sleep.

To be fair, I’m not working today, so I’m able to sleep in later and it would’ve only taken me about 30 mins in total. I feel a bit guilty as realistically it wouldn’t have been that much of a burden to drive him and it means it would help him out a lot. I know he’s been having a rough time lately and worked 7 days this week, and is already angry with himself as is.",steinmatron,1834,0.9399999976158142,992,1721085303,2024-07-15 18:15:03,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1e49bdy/aita_for_refusing_to_drive_my_fiancée_to_the/,7,2024
1e53bxy,AITA for not moving so a child to sit down on public transport? ,"There is public transport where I live (Subway) and like anywhere, it’s generally understood you give up your seat for someone who is elderly, disabled, or pregnant. I always try to do this.

I was sitting down on the Subway this week and who I assume were parents (mom, dad) with two kids got on. There was one available seat which one child sat on, and then the mom asked if I could give up my seat for the other child.

I politely refused and said something along the lines of ‘sorry I don’t want to give up my seat, I’m on this train for a long time’ (which is true, it’s a long journey for me).

Another part of the reason, even though it’s embarrassing and I didn’t say, is that I have bad blisters on my feet at the moment. 

The mom responded ‘wow, you wouldn’t give up your seat for a child?’ 

I said that I wouldn’t, and then someone else on the train gave up their seat. 

Even if I hadn’t had blisters on my feet, I still don’t think I would have given up my seat for a child. They don’t have problems standing, and probably have better balance than most adults. I know I have a bias here because I’m purposefully child free and my pet peeve is parents who feel they or their children are entitled to be the priority. 

While this was happening, everyone on the train was looking at me like I’m a massive ass. So Am I the Asshole? 

________

EDIT: thanks everyone for your thoughts, didn’t expect this to blow up! The consensus seems to be NTA but a few people have said it depends on the age of the child, or that I should’ve said I had blisters, which is fair. I’m not great at telling ages of children but maybe he was 7? He was definitely able to stand on his own well- I just googled 7 year old child and the images there seem about right. 

Also just to clarify, I do not hate children at all. I made a choice not to have kids and I don’t think people who made that choice should take priority over me, but I’m not a kid hater at all. I support everyone’s right to choose whether or not they have kids. 

Interestingly lots of people assumed I’m a man. I’m a 33 year old woman.

1e53cr5,AITA for Canceling my Daughter’s Date Last Minute?,"The number one rule in our (Me, 48M; my wife, 46F) house is no dating until you’re sixteen. Our son had to wait, our elder daughter had to wait, and we’ve made it clear to our youngest daughter that she has to wait too.

She’s only twelve right now (going into 7th grade this fall). She’s never really complained before about the no-dating rule, but a few nights ago she told me she was going to the movies with “a friend”. Yes, she *told me*, rather than asking if she could go. She said the friend’s sibling was dropping them off and picking them up, so I didn’t need to do anything.

I asked how long the movie was and which friend she was going with. Normally I wouldn’t have let her go (it was less than half an hour before she was supposed to leave, and I like to know plans at least a day in advance. But since it’s summer and she’s been pretty bored recently, I figured I’d let it slide).

She said the movie went past ten, and since we live pretty far from the theater she wouldn’t be home until around eleven. I asked again which friend it was (I would only trust her out this late with her best friend‘s sister, who babysat her for years). She was very vague and didn’t mention a specific name, so I told her she couldn’t go.

After complaining for a while, she caved and told me a boy she’d met had invited her and she was really looking forward to it. I reminded her of the no-dating rule (though she claimed “it’s not a date!”) and said she could go on a date with him in four years if he were still interested. I also allowed her to text him and cancel.

She cried and slammed the door to her room, saying stuff like she really likes him and was looking forward to it so much.

When my wife got home we talked about it, and she agreed that cancelling the date was the right decision.

However, a couple days later we got an angry call from the boy’s parents. (By the way, they got my number from the school listing, which is where I later found out my daughter met him). They said their son had bailed on a family event, and the least I could do was pay for another date for the two of them.

I said she couldn’t go and I was sorry, but had she told us about the date sooner I would’ve cancelled sooner. They angrily hung up.

Also, it seems like she and the boy had been texting all summer and were only planning a date now for god knows what reason. I should’ve guessed, considering she’s been pretty secritive about her phone recently and clicking out of her texts whenever I walk by.",ThrowAWjustbecause,1221,0.8799999952316284,364,1721172883,2024-07-16 18:34:43,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1e53cr5/aita_for_canceling_my_daughters_date_last_minute/,7,2024

1e6pq34,AITA For not taking the blame for unknowingly breaking a mom's rules for her kid?,"My (41f) daughter (15) had a sleepover a couple of days ago with four of her friends. From what I observed, the girls had a lot of fun together and were all very respectful of each other, my husband, and I. Most of the girls’ parents thanked me and my husband for hosting and said positive things, but one texted me a list of all the things I did wrong.

The first thing that upset this mom was the fact that my daughter and her friends went swimming in our backyard pool. When the sleepover invites were sent out via text message, I asked the moms if they were okay with their girls going swimming. All of them said “yes” or “that’s okay with me” except for the complaining mom, who simply liked my text. I assumed this meant yes. I would not have allowed this had the girls not been forced to pass a swimming safety unit (which included a swim test at the end) for their PE class. Additionally, my husband completed a lifeguarding course from the Red Cross and passed with flying colors. The mom’s second issue was the food the girls ate, which she deemed unhealthy. I however, did not see an issue with this because I think eating junk at sleepovers is okay. The next issue was the movie the girls watched after dinner. Since some of the girls are 14 and others are 15, we told them no R rated movies, but other than that it was up to them. They ended up choosing The Fault In Our Stars, which the complainer deemed inappropriate. The final thing she was mad about was the fact that the girls didn’t actually go to sleep until midnight. As a mom myself, I understand because I want my daughter to get enough sleep. However, both my husband and I do think that sleepovers are a time when it’s okay to stay up late, provided the kids let the parents sleep (which my daughter and her friends did). Additionally, the girls woke up at 8:30, meaning they got about 8 1/2 hours of sleep. 

I received the complaining mom’s text on the day after the sleepover. The text said “Thank you for having my daughter over. It was generous of you to open up your home and graciously host her. However, I feel that many of your decisions were questionable and inappropriate”. She then proceeded to list her objections with specific reasons for each one. I then replied, “Please tell your daughter thanks for coming! She was a pleasure to host. I understand your concerns, but considering that you never communicated your expectations or rules, I don’t think it’s fair to place the blame on me. If we ever do things like this in the future, please make sure to let me know of any restrictions ahead of time. Thank you and have a lovely weekend!” She then responded angrily that it was my fault, and when I texted her to say sorry, she didn’t respond. AITA for not taking the blame?

1e8xr9a,"AITA for refusing to wear a bracelet I wanted, but my husband paid for?","I (29F) wanted to buy a bracelet for myself because I finally had a job after searching for a long time and wanted to treat myself. My husband (35M) suggested I buy it from his parents because they run a jewellery store and they’d offer me a good deal. That had been my plan anyway, so when we visited them (they live in another State), I went by their store and had a look at what they had in stock. I decided on a piece but didn’t take it right away, as I needed to withdraw some cash.

A few days later I overheard my husband talking to his Mom about me but couldn’t hear what it was about (context info: there had been some negative talk in the past about my struggling to find a job & I wanted to know if that’s what it was about).  I asked my husband later what they were discussing about me and he said “nothing” but I got the feeling he felt caught out. Then he said they were talking about the bracelet I wanted and he was going to buy it. I said I was happy to buy it for myself but he insisted, and said he’d sort it out. I was thankful and said okay.

Then, after we returned home I asked about the bracelet and he said he was gonna give it to me later, maybe my birthday. I was annoyed because I wanted to buy the bracelet and wear it, like immediately, and that’s what I would’ve done if he hadn’t bought it. He said he paid for it, and that was a nice thing for him to do. I agreed, but said if he kept it, then it felt like he took it from me, and was making me wait to get something that I was prepared to pay for myself.We had a low-level fight about it, after which he said I can just have it right then, but I said I didn’t even really want it anymore because now every time I wear it, I will think about this argument and the whole gesture feels ruined. He accused me of being ungrateful. 

We recounted this story to his friends (I don’t have many friends as we moved here recently) and they all agreed that he paid for it, so I should just be happy, but I feel like if he wanted to pay for a gift that I had picked out and was about to purchase myself, then it’s not fair to make me wait months for it.

Am I the asshole for being upset about him keeping it / not wanting to wear the bracelet anymore?

1e8y584,AITA for exploding at my friend for not feeding my dog for a week because they believed a 'water fast' was healthy?,"**Dr. Alexandra Horowitz, Animal Behaviorist and Author**

**aita for exploding at my friend for not feeding my dog for a week because they believed a 'water fast' was healthy?**

Hi everyone,

I need to vent and get some perspective on something that has me absolutely livid. I recently went on a week-long business trip and asked my friend, who I'll call Jane, to pet sit my dog, Max. Jane has always seemed responsible and claims to love animals, so I trusted her without hesitation. I left detailed, explicit instructions on Max's feeding schedule, his favorite treats, and how to take care of him. I even stocked up on his favorite food and treats to ensure there would be no issues.

When I returned, I immediately noticed something was wrong. Max was unusually lethargic, his ribs were more pronounced, and he looked generally unwell. Alarm bells went off in my head, so I confronted Jane about what had happened. To my utter disbelief, she nonchalantly told me she hadn't fed Max ANY food the entire week. Why? Because she decided to put him on a ""water fast,"" claiming she read somewhere that it's supposedly healthy for dogs.

I was absolutely horrified. Jane, who has no veterinary training or knowledge, took it upon herself to ignore my clear instructions and subjected Max to what is essentially starvation. She calmly explained that she thought she was doing him a favor by letting his system ""detox."" I couldn't contain my anger and exploded at her, screaming that what she did was incredibly dangerous and irresponsible. Jane then had the audacity to get defensive, saying I was overreacting and that her intentions were good.

I rushed Max to the vet, and thankfully, he is on the mend, but the vet confirmed that the week-long lack of food could have caused severe health issues. I'm beyond angry and feel deeply betrayed by Jane. She has since apologized, but still insists that she thought she was doing the right thing.

AITA for trusting Jane to pet sit and for exploding at her for not feeding Max? Should I have been even more explicit about not doing anything out of the ordinary with Max's care, even though I thought my instructions were clear enough?

1ebeh6m,AITA for not allowing MIL and SIL into the third floor of my house?,"I(36F) have been married to my husband(37M) for 12 years. We have 2 kids (9F and 6F).

You should keep in mind that in Muslim marriages, his money is our money, but my money is my money. He can't ever tell me what to do with it, neither can he force me to share expenses. Also, there is no community property/money, if it doesn't have your name on it, you have no right to it.

Before we got married, my husband lived in a house that he co-owned with his mom and sister, and according to him, they would visit maybe 10 days a year (combined).

Suddenly, when we got married, they would come to ""their house"" every other weekend. I complained to my parents, and they advised me to not sink any money into the house. My dad helped me to buy a plot of land, and I spent my money (since my husband covered almost 90% of our expenses) to build my own house. It's a 4 story house (think NYC buidlings, with garages on the ground floor).

Fast foreward to last April, and suddenly his sister decided that she wants to move into ""her house"". They are a family of 5, and there was no way we would have been able to live in a 3 bedroom house. Let alone how they were disrespectful, and juat did not believe in privacy.
 
I told my husband that I will be moving with the kids to my house, and he is free to come with if he wants (he used to insist we stay in that house as a matter of principal, I was just waiting to finish building my house). He agreed.

Last weekend MIL, SIL and her kids came to ""visit"", we gave them a short tour, then we stayed on the first floor that didn't have bedrooms.

After lunch they wanted to nap, so I set the living room for them, they were upset, and wanted to use the kids bedrooms (like they used to do before), I refused. It escalated, and I told them this is my house, I make the rules, and the rules are the third floor is for my immediate family only.

They left, and went NC with us, so AITA?",Over-Fruit-3455,2550,0.959999978542328,269,1721859810,2024-07-24 17:23:30,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ebeh6m/aita_for_not_allowing_mil_and_sil_into_the_third/,7,2024
1ebfwkq,AITA For turning my teenage niece away at the door and telling my sister to wake up because of how my niece treats my own daughter?,"My sister Teresa has a sixteen year old daughter Quinn. “Quinn” and I used to be very close when she was younger, and loved having auntie-niece time together. However, since becoming a teenager, Quinn has become very snarky and sarcastic in a mean way.



I particularly don’t like the way she behaves towards my own daughter Bella (she is six.) Quinn crosses the line. A particular episode of verbal cruelty at a birthday party was when I’d had enough and told Quinn “I don’t want you to come over until you can start being nice to Bella.” Teresa was present when I said this.



We live a short walk away from each other. A few days ago, Quinn arrived and wanted dinner, and I turned her away at the door and told her “I don’t like how you treat my daughter. Unless it is an emergency, you are not welcome over.”



Teresa called me because she said I was a horrible person for turning Quinn away because she is sixteen and my niece was upset.



(Teresa has stopped trying to do anything serious about Quinn’s verbal attitude and has justified it in the past with statements along the lines of “That’s just how some teenagers are,” “It’s a teen thing. Teenagers shouldn’t be treated like young children,” or “Quinn’s almost an adult. It’s not your place to parent her like some child.”



I brought up Teresa’s past words and told her she is correct that Quinn is an adult who doesn’t need to be scolded by me. And I have a right to protect my child from an unkind adult. Quinn is already having issues with the school emailing home or friends making excuses for why they don’t want to see her. And it’s time to Teresa to wake up and do something about her daughter.



Teresa and I have both given our sides to mutual friends and acquaintances, and they are divided. Some are saying that Quinn’s attitude is not okay, but I was wrong to turn her away at the door because she’s still sixteen and my niece.



They said being a teenager and rapidly going from childhood to adulthood is already a rough transition. And according to Teresa, Quinn appears to be having issues at school, and I should try to have more patience with her and see what may be going on outside of home.



Regardless of the reason, I feel I had to set a hard boundary with Quinn’s behavior. It isn’t an easy time, but at sixteen, you still know right from wrong. And Bella doesn’t deserve to be subjected to that kind of treatment. But are my friends/acquaintances correct that I was too hard on my niece and sister and should apologize for how I responded to them?",TooHardOnMyFamily,8993,0.9700000286102296,1040,1721863540,2024-07-24 18:25:40,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ebfwkq/aita_for_turning_my_teenage_niece_away_at_the/,7,2024
1ebgfa3,AITA for excluding my girlfriend from my birthday celebration because of what she said?,"I (23M) just had my birthday this past Sunday. I celebrated in part by meeting up with my aunt (45F) for brunch. My aunt and I share our birthday and have always spent at least part of the day together. It’s a tradition that’s really important to both of us. 

A couple weeks ago, my girlfriend (23F) said she wanted to throw me a birthday party, especially since now we have enough fun money to spend on something like that. I said that would be great, but it probably couldn’t be on my birthday-day, since I was meeting my aunt for brunch and then had to go into work early the next day, so an evening party would have to end early too. 

We then had a long discussion that turned into an argument over having a celebration on the actual day or not. It became clear that she wanted me to reschedule brunch and that was my line. I told her that time with my aunt on our birthday is more important to me than spending it with anyone else (part of her reason for having it that day was that a few friends would be in town then but not the following weekend). 

I told her part of the reason why it matters, which is that my aunt was a twin and her twin died when they were teenagers. Their birthday was hard for her and then, when I was unexpectedly born on the same day (I was premature), it made the day easier for her to handle. She never put all that on me as a kid, but told me when I was an adult how grateful she was that we were “birthday buddies” and that it had felt like a blessing. My aunt is an amazing lady and I have always loved sharing our birthday. I was even more glad when she told me all of that. 

When I told this all to my girlfriend though, her first reaction was that it was “messed up that your aunt uses you as an emotional crutch and that you’re a grown man who can make his own plans”. I think my feelings must have shown on my face because she tried to backtrack or qualify her statement or whatever, but I wasn’t having it. I told her that there was no need to throw me a birthday party at all. 

What I ended up doing was having the brunch as planned with just me and my aunt, and then my parents had a cookout with a lot of our family there. I didn’t invite my girlfriend and when I explained why, my family was kind of split. They all agreed that what she said wasn’t nice or true, but some thought that it also wasn’t kind to exclude her from my birthday entirely when it had clearly mattered to her. 

She and I have hung out both before and after my birthday and there is a tension there. Part of me wants to address it but I also don’t feel bad about what I did, so I don’t know if bringing it up would do much good. 

AITA?

Editing to clarify some things:

- girlfriend and I started dating last December, so it’s been nearly 8 months

- I didn’t want to write out the very long conversation we had where we tried to make plans around the existing time constraints (the brunch was already planned and we knew what the out of town friends’ schedule would be - that sort of thing) but we did try to consider it from every angle before it became clear to me she wanted me to move the brunch 

- the cookout was planned after I told her that she didn’t need to plan any birthday party for me. Basically, my mom called asking if I had plans and offered to host a cookout that day. My family has cookouts/get togethers at least twice a month, so they’re very lowkey, even if there’s a birthday happening, and also my girlfriend had been to several of the cookouts before, so my family was a little surprised she didn’t come. 

- I appreciate that y’all think our birthday buddy tradition is sweet - it has always meant a lot to me. I do want to make it clear that I’m not just doing it to make her happy - it’s something I also look forward to every year. Growing up, my aunt was the cool aunt that all the cousins wanted to hang out with, and I loved this special thing we did (and don’t worry, she does fun/special things with all my cousins and her own kids now, one of our fun/special things just happens to be our birthday.) She has never treated me like a replacement for her twin and she is in no way the AH in this situation.

1ec7hm9,AITA for telling off my parents for giving my young kids a hard time about speaking a foreign language in front of them?,"Burner for privacy. I am American. My wife is from a foreign country, though she did her post-secondary studies in the US.  She comes from a small country, the language of which is not widely spoken elsewhere.  Once our relationship got serious, I decided to learn her language.  I’ve always had an interest in languages and a facility for learning them (I speak two others besides English and my wife’s).  With her and her family’s help, I’ve become near-fluent!   When we had kids (twin boys, 8), we decided to raise them to speak both languages, partly so they could communicate more easily with their relatives on my wife’s side and partly as a way to keep them connected to m wife’s culture.  A few years ago, we bought a small vacation property in my wife’ country, where we spend a couple of weeks each summer, which has both helped my and my kids’ facility with the language and has in turn been made more enjoyable *because* we all speak the language.

For reasons I can’t quite get to the bottom of, this has always seemed to irritate my parents.  They were sour about the fact that some of the toasts at our wedding were in my wife’s language (we translated).  My mother, a former teacher, claimed that attempting to raise the kids bilingual risked causing language delays generally.  I told them that I appreciated their concern, but that we had done our research and felt like it would be good for the kids, but they kept bringing it up for the first few years of the kids lives, until it was clear they were both highly precocious in verbal skills. 

These days, we speak a mix of both languages at home.  The kids will often speak to each other in wife’s language, often preferentially so when they are just sorting something between themselves.  The problem is that my parents get annoyed when they hear it.  They justify it on multiple grounds, all flimsy in my view: that if they are watching the kids, they need to know what they are talking about in order to properly supervise; that they could be using it as a “secret language” to say disrespectful things; that if we allow it with them, they’ll do it at school and anger teachers or peers.  It’s never proved a problem for anyone but my parents.

Parents were over recently and one kid spoke to the other in the foreign language. I was in the other room and heard my mom gently reprove them to the effect of “it’s rude to speak in a language we can’t understand; I need to tell you this because you’re parents won’t.”  At that point I had enuogh and I stormed in and told my parents that they need to drop it.  They can have lots of 95% English time with their grandkids, or they can insist on 100% English and have 95% less time.  My dad got upset and said that they were only looking out for the kids because we have a “blind spot” about this and that I should apologize to my mother.  I rolled my eyes and said “sorry” in my wife’s language, which got a laugh out of my kids, but caused my parents to up and leave.  AITA?",Intrepid-Skill6615,1368,0.949999988079071,540,1721945310,2024-07-25 17:08:30,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ec7hm9/aita_for_telling_off_my_parents_for_giving_my/,7,2024
1ec8er0,AITAH for kicking my friend out of my party when he hooked his ps5 up to my TV?,"Last weekend I (24m) threw a house warming party with 30ish of my friends. I supplied drinks and food and had games set up and what not. 

One friend came with a big backpack. Initially I said to him “oh man you didn’t have to bring anything” but then he slid a PlayStation 5 out of it. I’m not gonna lie, I was immediately ticked off… it wasn’t really a video gaming party… but I didn’t wanna control how people enjoyed themselves so I let him hook up his PlayStation and start playing. I didn’t tell him what kind of party it was besides saying house warming and approx 30 people, but I just thought he’d know I wouldn’t be on the couch with him playing ps5.

This is where I’m wondering if I’m the asshole. As the party progressed, I was getting increasingly annoyed by having him on the couch with Call of Duty blasting on the TV. Everyone else was close by to the TV talking and playing beer pong and it just kinda embarrassed me. I didn’t say anything to him though until he started to get visibly annoyed by people passing in front of the TV. I sat beside him and said “if you’d rather be home playing video games you have no obligation to be here”. He laughed it off and kept playing. A bit later I asked him to be my partner in beer pong, and he said he’d rather keep playing ps5. I kinda just turned my TV off at that point and told him to go home. He left quickly and in a bad mood, and people saw what happened. I immediately felt guilty and he hasn’t responded to me in days.

1ec9xtp,AITA for not helping my younger sister just because she has Cancer?,"Okay so before the story I want to give background. Our dad is pacific islander, and our mom (38F) is just white. My sister (14F) and I (17F) were both born in the US. Our parents divorced when I was six I think. However I continued to live my dad until I was 11, whereas my sister stayed with my mom. I live with my mom now because my dad wanted to move back to the islands, but I didn't want to leave my friends. However I know much of my family who still do live on the islands, and keep in touch with my 'roots' I guess. This is mostly thanks to my dad. My sister doesn't. Okay so onto the story. 

About four months ago my sister was diagnosed with Sarcoma which is like a kind of bone/tissue cancer. She's had to go through a lot of procedures and spend a lot of time at the hospital, and I've spent a lot of it with her and helping her, and while I don't mind helping her, when she did get diagnosed my Mom expected me to drop literally everything to be there to help her. Meaning if she's at the hospital, I'm at the hospital. If she's undergoing a surgery or 'stressful procedure' I have to stop everything I'm doing (including school) and sit in the waiting room as support. 

But all that I could handle and it was annoying but whatever. However recently the doctors finally decided they wanted to do Chemo, and my sisters hair has begun to fall out. She shaved it, but is extremely upset about it, because she really loved her hair. The other day my mom suggested that I shave my own hair so a wig can be made out of it for her. For reference my hair goes down to below my butt. However the thing is you're only supposed to cut your hair when a family member dies, and it's a tradition my entire family (dad's side) upholds. And to be frank, I like my hair and have no desire to shave it, as I have been growing it out since I was a kid. 

I explained this to both my sister and my mom, but both are instant that I should do it, and that a tradition like that is meaningless, especially since my sister might die anyways. I told them no. They've both asked several times more, and my sister even begging. I once again reiterated why I wouldn't, and that asking me too was insulting. 

Now my sister is upset and saying that I obviously don't actually care that she's struggling and aren't being understanding. However I've bent over backwards for her, so the fact she's going so far hurts. But she's also never asked me of anything like this before and is really upset, so I just don't know, AITA??",IamGojoTrust,6798,0.959999978542328,1194,1721951817,2024-07-25 18:56:57,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ec9xtp/aita_for_not_helping_my_younger_sister_just/,7,2024
1ed0y52,AITA for making my husband care for our baby while he has a headache?,"I (29F) and my partner (27M) have been together for seven years and have a child together, 1M. He’s about as challenging as you’d expect a one year old to be but he’s easy to play with, eats well, and sleeps well. We both work full time- him at home and me in a nonprofit. Our son goes to daycare. When we are all at home, I generally do the cooking/cleaning/childcare/waking up with baby. I occasionally ask for help with chores and childcare, with on and off success. Frequently, my partner is too busy or “doesn’t want to” (cooking, specifically), or is working out of town. Recently he even took a three week boys trip. 

I am in the final stages of applying for a job with the government. I’ve worked my butt off from freshman year in university to have this job and I am taking it extremely seriously. My next assignment is a written essay that I had less than 48 hours of notice for. I am not a quick writer and this is not my strong suit so I was hoping to get it done tonight, and that way if I needed more time I could work on it tomorrow, or the next day. 

I went to let my partner know I’d be leaving our son home while I went to the library to do the essay (I know if I stay home the baby is going to get sent into the room). He was in bed and said no, he had a headache, and needed to rest. He didn’t sleep well and had to work today. I let him know that this is extremely important to me and I don’t want to rush. He ignored me. I let him know, again, I’m leaving. He is upset with me that he is feeling awful and I am still putting the work on him. 

I’ve prepped dinner, baby literally just needs to be fed, supervised, and put to sleep. I don’t even care if they veg out and watch Bluey. But he is still sick. AITA to insist on going?

1edsnjz,AITA for decline my Step Dad's call when they couldn't find me at my Step Brother's wedding?,"I (27F) was at my stepbrother's (29M) wedding a couple of days ago. For some context, my mum (59F) and his dad (57M) have been together for 10+ years at this point. My stepbrother even included my mum in the family photos at the wedding and thanked her for looking after his dad in his speech. I could not be happier for her as this meant a lot to her. However, I was not included in family photos. This hurt me a little but it was his and his now wife's day so I'm not going to complain and I certainly would never bring it up to them or anyone else other than my partner. Especially not to my mum who was so shocked and happy that she was included. 

Anyways, this leads on to the matter at hand. My stepdad was talking to the brides mother later in the night whilst I was sat near them, half listening and bopping along to the music. The brides mum says to him that its lovely to have my stepbrother in the family and that now she has 4 children instead of two (both her daughters are now married). This is when my step dad turned around and said that he feels the same and he is very proud of his four. (My two stepbrother and both their wives). This instantly felt like a dagger to my gut (I should probably add that my mums previous partner said to my face as a 7 year old that he never wanted to be a father to me when I asked if I could get him a fathers day card, plus my own father left when i was two and was abusive for context as to why this hurt me so much) and my mum started questioning if I was okay. I said I was fine and to leave it but she kept badgering me and then asked me if I had been eavesdropping when I shouldn't have been. I barely nodded when she said she had heard it too and said that it hurt her too but that he hadn't been thinking. Her comforting me set me off with tears that I'd been trying hard to keep in so I got up and said I was going outside for some air. 

  
I went outside and walked a little bit away and had a cry to myself. I even sat on a swing at the small playpark near and in eyesight of the hotel. When I got myself together I was walking back when my Step dad rang me. I could see him and mum in front of the hotel, he then rang me and I waved and declined the call but they did not see me. My mum questioned me when I did walk back inside the hotel asking if I declined the call to which I replied yes. She then told me that was a stupid thing to do. I tried to explain that I could see them and waved at them but she said they could not see me. 

The next morning, my stepdad did apologise and say he messed up but I'm still a little upset. I've not said anything to my mum about how I'm feeling cause I know she will just tell me to move on and let it go. Am I the asshole? Should I have just answered the phone? Was I being petty?

1edt84o,AITA for refusing my parents' request to be trustee for my brother's inheritance?,"Throwaway account.  Context: I (45M) have one brother (40M).   My parents (71M,F) both had successful careers and have accumulated enough wealth that they need to do estate planning.  I got very lucky and have had a lucrative finance career that has left me quite a bit wealthier than they are (which they know, roughly).  My brother and his wife both work for non-profits, but have climbed their respective org charts and have a good middle-class income.  My parents have helped them from time to time, for example with a downpayment for a house when they got married and private school tuition for my young nephew.  He’s a little more into shopping and costly hobbies  than I am – but I live an unusually spartan life. Brother and I have a good relationship, though we live on opposite sides of the country, so we only get together a few times a year. 

When my parents last visited me, they pulled me aside to tell me about their estate plans.  They intend to leave everything to my brother and his family, because I’m already financially set and because they don’t want a giant disparity in wealth between their two sons.  I’m entirely fine with that.  It’s their money, obviously; I don’t need any; and I love my brother and his family and want them to be comfortable.  I told my parents as much – so far so good.

Here's where it got problematic.  Parents said, “it’s a lot of money and we don’t want it to just drop in \[Bro’s\] lap.  So we are setting up a trust to receive the money, to benefit \[Bro\] and then \[nephew\].  We want you to be the Trustee. ”  I told them that wasn’t going to be possible.  I don’t want to superintend my brother’s finances.  It seems like a recipe for strife and division. If I just let him do what he pleases and the money is dissipated, he could resent that I didn’t invest it better or exert more control; if I am conservative about disbursements, then he could resent my “heavy hand.”   I also told them that while my bro is not quite the penny-pincher I am, he is far from irresponsible with money (or generally).

My parents reacted poorly.  They claimed that it is not a big ask.  I said that, actually, it is kind of a big ask for me to serve as Trustee for who-knows-how-long , and that the one sliver lining of getting no inheritance should be that I don’t need to be involved in the estate.  I offered to refer them to a professional trust company. They accused me of refusing out of jealousy.  That was too much for me, so I pulled out my banking app and showed them that what was just sitting in my checking account was close to their estate (to be honest, had just received a large deferred comp wire from my firm, so it was unusually large –but, look, I was annoyed at their accusation and wanted to rebut it as quickly and convincingly as possible).  When we parted, it was a little tense and my mom said, “well, I guess we were wrong to think we could count on you.”

Now I am thinking maybe I should just suck it up and do it.  AITA?",Illustrious_Ball3004,1656,0.959999978542328,249,1722121537,2024-07-27 18:05:37,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1edt84o/aita_for_refusing_my_parents_request_to_be/,7,2024
1eeiyw4,AITA for asking my parents to stop telling people I am in hospital?,"Hi all. I (25f) am currently pregnant and have been admitted to hospital a few days ago for a suspected clot in my lung following severe chest pain. I am still in hospital right now.

A few weeks ago, my wonderful maternal grandfather passed from cancer and we are obviously as a family still upset.

2.5 years ago I was in a car accident. I broke my back in 3 places, my pelvis, and 3 ribs. It was during COVID so I was admitted to hospital and had loads of scans all through the day/night. Once they figured that I didn’t need corrective surgery they discharged me the following morning with morphine tablets and a wheelchair. I came out of hospital to  around 100 messages from people I barely knew wishing me well. My mum and stepdad had posted pictures of my wrecked car on Facebook and told everyone they knew about the accident and specifics about my injuries. At the time I asked them to take down the posts as I did not want people knowing all about my personal life. They never took the posts down.

Today my friend told me that my mum has been sending messages into group chats telling people that I am pregnant and in hospital. My stepdad told his family the same. I have told them that my husband and I want to share the news ourselves. I told them that I was so hurt and disappointed that they have told people and also lied to me about it. I pointed out the lie and told them that I had again, received messages from others proving that they lied. My mum then sent me a voice note of her crying saying “sorry I don’t know what I have done but I am sorry. I must be the worst mother in the world. I am just so upset about Pappa too.” It was hard to hear her so upset by I just reiterated that asking for privacy was not too much to ask.

My stepdad who I have been very close to also sent me a voice note telling me that “they don’t need this stress” and to stop being so hateful over something so “trivial”. He told me that I was clearly hormonal but that he’ll “let it slide this time” because I am pregnant. He told me that my mum has cried for over 30 mins and it’s all my fault and that it’s all over nothing. Also, that they told other people because they are worried about me. Hesaid they will never apologise as they haven’t done anything wrong. He also said that I am the daughter he never had and that he loves me but that he is so disappointed in my behaviour.

The original message that started this sent to my mum:

Sorry it’s just I’ve had messages from people today wishing me well in hospital so I know you lied about who you have told about me being here. I am just hurt and disappointed as I would have much preferred privacy. I don’t feel like sharing any more because I don’t know who you are both sharing it with and it has actually made me being in hospital much more stressful

I might be TA because we are all grieving and emotions are running high. I also don’t feel like they told other people in a malicious way, just thoughtless. So, AITA?

1eektaw,AITA for telling my SIL how I feel about her baby name after she asked?,"I 28F have a SIL Ana 35F. She is 8 months pregnant. She has had 3 miscarriages in the past and had to have an abortion after her last pregnancy was not viable. 

Her pregnancy is taking a huge toll on her, she had awful morning sickness and pre existing medicinal conditions that have worsened and she is on sick leave. 

I offered to plan her baby shower as she was unable to, and offered up our place for her and BIL as it was mainly family and a few friends that I know through her. 

The baby shower was a hit, Ana was really pleased with how everything turned out and at the shower told everyone that she is keeping the gender of her baby a surprise, but her and BIL picked out a name for the baby. They want to name the baby Five as the number is the amount of years they have tried to conceive and it took them 3 miscarriages and one termination.

Ana said it’s a reminder of her baby’s older siblings, and I expressed in private after she asked what I thought of the name that it might not be this symbolic for their baby when they grow up to understand the meaning, I did say the word burden which led to Ana getting really upset and left, and my BIL followed her out.

1efehhz,WIBTA if I didn’t let my sister wear her wedding dress to my wedding?,"Three years ago, my sister’s (36F) fiancé died in a work accident, 4 months before they were supposed to get married. They had been together for a long time and had a kid together, the only reason they didn’t marry earlier is money. This was obviously a horrible experience for her, and she’s understandably very upset about never having gotten to marry the love of her life. 

I (27M) recently got engaged. At first I was pretty hesitant to bring up the wedding around my sister, because I didn’t want to upset her or bring up any bad memories, but she was really excited about it and immediately started helping me to plan. She loves weddings, and pretty clearly was interested in my wedding being similar to her own idea of a perfect wedding. I didn’t mind this, because I’m not nearly as good at this type of thing and she took my vetoes with grace. 

A week ago she brought up the idea of her wearing the dress she bought for her own wedding to mine. My mother, who’s usually very strict on traditions like not wearing white to a wedding, thought it was a great idea. She argued that because I’m marrying another man, no one would mistake her for the bride, and it would let my sister have the wedding experience she always wanted. 

I think she’d stand out a lot like that. My sister will be my maid of honour (best woman?) and the plan was for her dress to match my financés best man.

I did do my best to be conscious of my sister’s loss. I don’t mind something to honour her fiancé, like an empty chair or a memorial table dedicated to him. I offered her some bride experiences that she missed out on like the father daughter dance. I just feel like a full wedding dress is a lot, and the idea makes me a bit uncomfortable. I feel bad for being bothered by it because a wedding isn’t nearly important to me as it is to her- I’d have been fine just getting legally married with no ceremony or anything, so I don’t know why the thought of my sister wearing what she wants upsets me. 

I know my sister would accept it if I said no, but she’s so excited about the idea and she’s pretty set on never remarrying so this is probably her only opportunity to wear this dress. I brought up to my mom that I was hesitant to say yes and she got really upset with me, and accused me of being jealous of her and needing all the attention. WIBTA?

1eg624k,AITA for not caring that I was uninvited to my older brother’s wedding,"
This whole thing is so weird. I, (27M), am gay. I came out at 16 and my parents told me they would always love me, but to not mention it to my older brother who I'll call Brick, (then 19M, 30M now). When I was confused and asked why, they said that Brick had expressed some awful opinions about gay people. I limited talking to Brick until I moved out at 18, which wasn't much of a problem because we were never close.

I went to uni, got good job, and an awesome boyfriend (28M), in my home city. Me and my boyfriend Angel live a peaceful life. Peaceful until a few days ago when I got a call from my brother. I was concerned that Brick was calling me, as we have never messaged before, just had each other's numbers for emergency purposes. I picked up because maybe there was some emergency happening.

He opened the call with an annoyed ""hey man"" and I knew something was up. He said he was getting married to his fiance Yen (24F) next year. I didn't even know he had a girlfriend! I was like ""that's great Brick!"" and asked some boring wedding things that he begrudgingly answered. He then told me invites were being sent out in a couple weeks, and that I could bring a plus one. Here's where I made the mistake that started this mess. Without thinking like an idiot, I said, ""cool, I'll bring my boyfriend."" Major. Mess up. Brick immediately started yelling insults down the line, screaming that he ""wouldn't have an [f slur] at his wedding."" I didn't say anything and just hung up. I was rattled by hearing those words from my own brother's mouth, even though I knew his feelings about people like me. I told Angel, and he comforted me, ordering in my favourite restaurant and watching movies with me, which was awesome. We went to bed later and I felt alright the next day.

I sent my parents a message that Brick invited me and uninvited me from his wedding pretty much in the same breath, and went on my way to work, not a clue of the crapstorm waiting for me when I got off. When I turned my phone on again after my shift, it was blowing UP. Messages and calls from my parents and relatives galore asking me what the f happened? I phoned my parents back when I got home and gave them the run down of what happened, and said I honestly didn't care because it's not like Brick would be coming to my wedding anyways. My parents immediately chastised me for my ""obvious disinterest and disregard of my brother's life"" and told me I should be apologizing to HIM for bringing my personal life into his wedding. WHAT? I basically told my parents to screw off and have been getting bombarded with messages from relatives to apologize to my brother and get my invite reinstated, and apologize to my parents for disrespecting them, but I really don't want to. Angel's reassuring me that I did nothing wrong, but it's still nagging me.

1eg7nk3,AITA for telling my husband's ex that I must have been the favorite girlfriend since he married me?,"Ok so my 40sF husband 40sM have been off and on since we were 12, broke up at 22, took a 17 year break and got together 3 years ago and have been married for a little over 2. He spent almost 3 years with an ex and they broke up about 10years ago.
  
The ex, who I will call Patty, and my husband Doug broke up on good terms and she will reach out here and there to say happy birthday, merry Christmas and she reached out when she heard we were getting married and gave us her congratulations. 

Saturday night we went to the local bar and she happened to be there and we all sat together drinking, talking and just hanging out. I was 3 jack and Cokes in and I can not remember how it got brought up but Patty at one point said ""Well at least I will always be your favorite girlfriend."" I laughed and said ""Wouldn't I be his favorite girlfriend since I'm the one he married?"" She stopped smiling and just looked at me. She finished her drink and let not long after that. 

Last night Doug got a long message from Patty saying she was really shocked at how jealous, immature,Petty and mean I am given my age and that I should be more secure in our marriage and in myself and that it's okay for Doug to care about others besides just me. She also told him how much him telling her she was his favorite girlfriend all those years ago had always meant to her and can't understand why I had to shit on it.

Doug told her he was sorry what I said upset her but that I was just saying a fact, I was the favorite girlfriend and that's a huge reason he married me. She sent back another long text saying I just think I'm better than her because Doug had a very firm stand that he would never marry, he didn't care if he had a gun to his head it wouldn't happen. When we reconnected this time he asked me to marry him after a month and we married after 8 and a half months. Doug told her that it wasn't true,I don't think I'm better than anyone and said again he was sorry she was hurt but that I said nothing wrong,told her the things she was saying about me aren't true and to be er speak about me like that again. 


I truly never in a million years would want to hurt anyone's feelings. I said I was his favorite because I feel like you marry your favorite person don't you? Why would you marry someone who isn't your favorite? So am I the asshole here? Doug told me it's not in anyway on me that she got hurt. My best friend said that I didn't say anything that wasn't true and thinks maybe Patty is going through some stuff or just went through a break up and is just taking it out on me.

1eiorrn,AITAH telling girlfriend that she gave me the 'ick' at a family dinner? ,"I'm 32m dating my girlfriend Jenny 27f for almost a year now, and we've meet each other's families. Jenny is an only child of an asian family while I'm half/half with one younger sister, Anna 21f. Anna and I are close despite our age gap, our parents both worked demanding jobs and I would babysit/chaperone for many of her bratty teen years.

In recent months I've noticed that whenever Anna comes up in conversation, Jenny would joke about how Anna is overly spoiled by my parents and I and how we've created a princess. Last week at a family dinner with my parents I felt like Jenny was overly grilling Anna on school/dating/life. At one point, Anna was telling a story about how a first date gave her ""the ick"" by not pull out his wallet after their meal and let her foot the full meal. Jenny laughed and said that not every man will treat her to dinner like her brother would and that ""you need to lower your standards."" I was not happy with this comment as it sounded like my sister didn't deserve to be treated with basic respect but also didn't want to embarrass Jenny.

Jennifer then went on talk about how that would've never happen to her as men see her as ""high value"". I don't know what about this comment that just pissed me off but I said that she was giving ME ""the ick"" and to stop talking to my sister like that.

The argument we had when we got home was massive, and Jenny told me that I was over-reacting to an innocuous comment and would make a terrible father because I would always favor my sister over everyone else.

1ejeqr1,AITA for refusing to take my girlfriend home from a party after she embarrassed herself? ,"A coworker invited me to a housewarming party, he bought a really nice house with a large yard, a pool and even a waterfall flowing into the pool. I wouldn't say I'm necesarrily friends with him but we're friendly and make small talk when we see each other, we don't really hang out  by ourselves. He's a nice guy but we don't have too many interests. He told me I can bring my girlfriend. At that party I knew about 3 out of the 40 people there. 

At the party my girlfriend began complaining to me about the food options saying they don't follow her diet, she can't eat them, the host should have gotten better food, the paintings on the wall are tacky, his furniture sucks, that the music is pretty lame and a bunch of other ridiculous complaints.  We live in São Paulo at the moment but we're from a region in Southern Brazil where most people speak Hunsrik, which is a type of German, though its a bit distinct from standard German, someone from Germany wouldn't understand everything I say.

 She complained in Hunsrik, assuming that everyone at the party only knew Portuguese but my coworker was near us and he said what I guess is standard German ""I'm sorry we don't have any food that fits your dietary restrictions, if you are hungry there is a store about 400 meters from here, it closes in an hour. I'm sorry you don't appreciate the music selection would you like to play something?"" 

My girlfriend looked shock, her jaw dropped and she just stuttered for a bit, a few people snicker in the back and another guy translates what happened and she responded back in Portuguese ""how do you all know German? I had no idea"" and my coworker explains he and 3 other people in this party used to work in Germany and that's how they know each other. My girlfriend pulled me aside and said she's so embarassed and wants to go home. I told her no, I'm having a good time here and she's begging me to bring her back saying she's so embarassed and she can't handle this and I told her she shouldn't talk shit about people and she's getting what she deserved, this broke out into a screaming match. She demanded i give her the car keys and I refused. 

We stayed at the party for another 2-3 hours, she talked to some other girls but was kind of quiet. On the ride home we got into another argument where she says I should have taken her side and I unleashed a lot of my frustration onto her saying she is actually the one causing embarassment by insulting my coworker. She blamed me for not telling her he speaks German I told her that wasn'r relevant and i never thought to bring it up. (I honestly didn't know he spoke it that well, he just briefly mentioned living in Germany once at a meeting). 

so yeah was I in the wrong here?

So I(22F), my partner and six other friends are vacationing around Europe right now. One of our friends, let's say Eren, is still a virgin (22M). I don't care about it, lol, but he is very frustrated regarding this matter. 

So two days ago we were in Budapest clubbing in our hostel when this girl approaches me and my boyfriend and two other friends. She introduces herself (solo traveler), and we invite her to stay with us. Eren is somewhere else. During the night she points at one of my friends, who's in q relationship, and asks whether he s taken or not. I tell her he is and she goes ""I'm not even going to bother, I only like having sex with inexperienced guys"". This girl is physically pretty and fun to be around so I point out Eren and tell her she should hit him up in those case.

We left this morning and two hours ago Eren came humming at me. Apparently he and this girl slept together and texted over the day and she said something along the lines ""glad x told me your a greenie;))""

He is very very mad at me for talking about his private life with strangers (which I swear I did not indent to do), and for making someone to ""pity him"" to have sex.

My boyfriend sides with me (not the most objective source), and so does another of my girl friends, but the rest of the group is being neutral/defensive and kind of ignore me.

AITAH? 

Edit: Thank you for your insight. I do understand where I was wrong and hopefully I will be able to fix this with Eren. That begin said, to bring some more clarification, he never said that he wants to save himself for someone important, wants a meaningfully connection etc. I obviously don't know what happened between them and what she said, but in the morning he stated that he ""finally kicked the ball inside the net"" (it sounds weird translated, lol, but it's a local saying) with a pretty girl. Didn't sound attach or anything, but I wouldn't really know, obviously 

Edit 2: The reason I did not go to Eren in the first place (I'm not saying it's a good reason, but that was what I thought atp) is that he is not peroxide social and has a hard time talking to both men and women. He is shy and I don't think he would have made the first move.

Sam sent my husband a text to say Rose felt excluded at the dinner and it was really awkward for her so they left earlier. He said we could have included her a bit more and the quiz and wedding video was awkward for her and she didn’t understand the quiz jokes and she didn’t come to the wedding.

No urine got on the seat, floor or anywhere near it, no smell remained in the bathroom, and I always left the lid down to flush anyway for hygiene.

I told her this, but she has refused to listen out and has told me multiple times she doesn’t want me peeing standing up and thinks its gross.

1elvs61,AITA for telling a woman she shouldn't be a mother,"So I (F29) was out walking my dog last night close to where my grandma lives - so not an area I'm really a local in but still in the same town. I turned onto a street and there was a little boy standing in the middle of the path in a t-shirt and nappy. He didn't have any shoes on, looked a little grubby but wasn't crying or anything. He lit up when he spotted my dog and just kept pointing at her and saying 'doggy'. She's small and friendly so I let him pet her for a while before I went to continue with my walk. He began following me, giggling and trying to keep pace with my dog. I obviously didn't want to let him stray too far away from his house but I had no idea where he lived. None of the houses had their doors open, no people in the gardens or windows. There wasn't even a house with toys in the front to indicate children. I crouched down and asked him which house was his but he either wasn't old enough to understand or was simply more interested in the dog. I was debating what to do - start going door to door or phone the police - when a woman came tearing out of one of the houses halfway down the street, shouting the little boys name. I stood up to tell her I'd found him at the end of the street when she turned on ME, demanding to know who I thought I was, what kind of person I was trying to lead her child away. I was floored. I genuinely laughed, thinking she must be joking but she grabbed him and told me to stay away from children that don't belong to me. I think I saw red because I remember telling her that if a child that young can get out of the house and down the street without her realising it, she doesn't deserve to be a mother. He could have walked in front of a car or met someone who actually intended harm! She started swearing and shouting and I had to walk away because it was genuinely just wild. All I can think about now is, what if something happens to that kid, or what if the next person to try and help him is a guy that gets accused of something he wasn't intending to do, all because she can't keep an eye on her kid? 

I don't really agree with shaming women on their parenting skills and I do feel a little bad for saying it but I felt like it was the least she deserved at the time.

1elx9uy,AITA for telling my husband we can get a new babysitter if he finds a better one for the same price ,"My husband and I have 3 kids (10, 8, 5). We’ve had the same babysitter, Amelia (20) for almost 5 years. Amelia has filled a few different roles for us. She was our date night sitter, then during the pandemic she was our nanny, went back to date nights, and now she gets to our house at 7:15 every morning, gets the kids out the door, drops them off at school or camp, then twice a week she babysits at night so we can run errands or get some time to ourselves. 

Amelia’s “sweet spot” was 2022-2023. She had her car and license, had games and activities planned for everyone, was always on time and prepared, and was generally more available and focused. She’s still good now but doesn’t always come with crafts and activities, can be 5-10 minutes late, and more often than not orders DoorDash for herself to our house. It’s all manageable and she still knows and loves our kids and she’s very affordable. 

The final straw for my husband was when Amelia told us that she had recently been diagnosed with autism and that she thinks our 8 year old should get an assessment, as they are exactly alike. I never would’ve known Amelia is autistic but I’m definitely willing to get an assessment. My husband saw it as rude and thinks she shouldn’t have brought it up unless we asked. 

He thinks it’s time to get a new sitter so I told him we can get a new sitter if he can find someone just as good as Amelia for the same rate as her. He says we can afford better than Amelia so we can spend more and get someone that will be focused on their work like Amelia used to be before she started college and got another job. 

I know we can afford more but I still want to stick with Amelia. AITA for telling my husband the only way we can replace Amelia is if we find someone as good as her for the same price?",babysitterreplace,5915,0.959999978542328,924,1722988635,2024-08-06 18:57:15,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1elx9uy/aita_for_telling_my_husband_we_can_get_a_new/,8,2024
1emr3xf,AITA for ‘blindsiding’ my roommates after moving out?,"I 23F share a flat with Sara 24F and Vera 24F. Rent in our city is very expensive and all of us can only affording living here by renting a 3bed flat as we couldn’t by ourselves or in a 2 bed flat. 

Me and Vera were single when we moved in last year and Sara had a boyfriend Jake 26M.  Jake is clean, quiet and pays part of our utilities as he comes over most nights. 

Vera has recently started dating Oli 23M who is a friend of Jake and Sara’s. Oli has made a few weird comments about me- he pestered me about my weight and told me he could bench me and also asked me some weird sexual questions. When I flagged this to Vera, (I’ve never met Oli) she said he’s just trying to be friends. Sara and Jake said it was just his sense of humour.

Last week, me and Vera had a big fight after I overheard Vera and Oli in the shower together. We have one bathroom in the house, and my bedroom shared a wall, so I heard them having sex. They also didn’t clean the shower afterwards, and Sara stayed at her parents that week, so I ended up cleaning the shower.

I brought up this issue to Sara, who isn’t confrontational and said now that I’ve brought it up to Vera she knows how I feel and won’t do it again- but she didn’t at all find it as weird as I did. Since then I have avoided Oli/Vera and kept to myself.

I am not really friends with Vera anymore, and Sara remains neutral which favours Vera so I was thinking of moving out. We had all signed on for the next year as our contract renews in September, before I met Oli, and my estate agency said I couldn’t get out unless the contract had been violated. 

I just live in that house now, I’m on awkward terms with the other two, so I read the contract and one of the clauses says only declared tenants can stay for extended periods of time, so I reported that Vera has her boyfriend over, and proved it as the utilities went up in the time I said.

This got me out the contract, however the landlord is evicting Sara and Vera because of this. They said I blindsided them and they will struggle to find a place by the end of this month. My parents live 1.5 hours away so I am moving in with them, but the other two are from a different city so can’t do the same. 

I didn’t intend for them to get evicted, but after the fight over the shower I realised I couldn’t live with them as any issue we have, Vera won’t listen and Sara will stay neutral.",Illustrious_Ice_621,4629,0.949999988079071,821,1723074193,2024-08-07 18:43:13,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1emr3xf/aita_for_blindsiding_my_roommates_after_moving_out/,8,2024
1enjb1v,"AITA for hosting a family friendly BBQ that didn't welcome certain ""family members""","My wife and I finally bought our first house after 10+ years in an apartment.  I hosted a housewarming BBQ for friends and family.  My wife is 5 months pregnant so we weren't about to have a rager. She wants to not be pregnant when we host one of those.  For this party though, we told everyone that this would be a family friendly party.  All ages were welcome.

  
The day of the BBQ, our guests started showing up. For a bit, I was running around with my head cut off and so it took me a while to actually greet everyone.  During this time, my wife came and got me and told me that my buddy Dave brought their dog.  My wife does not like dogs.

    
I go to Dave and his wife, greet them and then I ask why he brought his dog.  He cited the family friendly party and the dog is literally his family. I was told by my wife I just stared at him for a good 10 seconds.  I was processing what he said because I found it a bit crazy. 

  
 I told him what I meant by family, was to bring your human family. I told him it was incredibly rude to assume my house and yard was pet friendly.   So I told him to take the dog home and come back.  He got pissed at me and told me that I needed to specify that some family members were excluded.   I called him crazy for thinking that. He said it was a shame that I was being an asshole because my backyard is great for a dog.  He left and didn't come back. 

  
My friends told me it was unnecessary to kick him out.  I didn't kick him out, i kicked the dog out.  They said the dog is super friendly and well trained and wasn't bothering anyone.  I told everyone I don't care if its the best dog in the world, its not welcome.  AITA?",AmIWrong324956293,2198,0.949999988079071,552,1723156128,2024-08-08 17:28:48,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1enjb1v/aita_for_hosting_a_family_friendly_bbq_that_didnt/,8,2024
1eocq8l,AITA for buying locks and a mini fridge in my room?,"I (16f) am the oldest in my family. I have 8 younger siblings age 12, 10, 9, 9, 6, 4, 4, and 2. privacy is very hard to come by around here. Luckily, I only share a room with one person (12f), but I might as well share with everyone because my siblings come barging in every five minutes and snoop through my things, especially when I’m not home. 

I have some very expensive makeup and hair products that I keep stashed in my drawer. Last week, the 4yo twins came in and smashed or emptied half the items. I have special editions of books, and 10f came in and rumpled some pages a few days ago. And my friend made me some traditional food from her culture, which I put in the fridge (LABELED) up high, and somehow my siblings ignored it and ate it yesterday. Things like this happen all the time, and the only one who doesn’t do this kind of thing is 12. 

I’ve spoken to my parents about things like this, but they always say it’s part of having siblings and I need to put my things away better or learn to share, since they’re only little. The thing is, I do put my things away, and they still go through my entire room to find them. So I gave up and I bought a door lock and Childs locks for my drawers, as well as a mini fridge (I am going to share the fridge with 12 because I know she won’t eat the food I put in there). I put the lock on the door and locked my drawers and bookcases yesterday. 

My parents didn’t even notice, they apparently found out after a bunch of kids came crying to them about how ‘they can’t get in my room to use my cool things’. When I came home from work today, they confronted me about how I shouldn’t shut my siblings out. I told them if they knocked on the door and asked me to use my things, I would probably say yes. But since they don’t know how to do that and instead sneak in when I’m not home, I was going to keep the locks on to protect my stuff. 12 also told me she likes the door lock too. 

But my parents are angry because I never asked them, and again, I’m ‘shutting my siblings out’. They’re punishing me by not letting me leave the house except work/school for the next month, but they can’t take the locks off because I bought them with my own money. I thought I was in the right, but my mom and dad are furious and I don’t know who’s correct here, since they are the adults and know better, but I already notice an improvement to my mood (and the noise levels).

1eodjv2,"AITA for letting my daughter wear whatever she is comfortable in, in my house?","Okay, this requires some important details. First, I am a (37M). My ex wife, ""Deanna"" (36F) and I have 2 kids, our daughter ""Jane"" (12F) and our son ""Eddie"" (10M). We got married semi young at 23 and 24, we divorced amicably five years ago. 

Deanna recently married a man she has been seeing for a few years, who I will call ""A."" Something I need to bring up here is that I am half Mexican, Deanna is a white woman, and A is of Middle Eastern descent. While I wouldn't say A and I are friends, I do think he's a pretty nice guy, and seems like a really good match for Deanna. The kids also like him, so that's another bonus in my book.

Deanna and I split custody of the kids. HOWEVER.  Deanna and A got married two months ago. Since then, Deanna has chosen to wear a covering, which I am sorry but the name slips my mind. She converted to A's religion as well. Which, I'm very happy about if that's what she wants. But last week, when she dropped off the kids, I was surprised to see that Jane was wearing one as well. But, I assumed she must have wanted to wear it and was maybe deciding to convert her faith as well, so I didn't bring it up. I feel that she's old enough to decide for herself, and as an atheist myself, I'm all for my children choosing what they believe

A few days ago, I was going to go see a movie with my kids but told them I had to finish some paperwork in my office first, which took about half an hour. When I walked back into the living room, Jane was wearing one of Eddie's t shirts and a pair of shorts. We had a conversation which kind of went like this:


Me: what's going on? Jane, are you supposed to take off your covering? (I don't really know how any of it works, sorry if that offends anyone)

Eddie: she hates wearing that  stuff. So I let her borrow some of my clothes.

Jane: yeah dad, I hate it. Mom makes me wear it. She says I have to wear it all the time, even at your house.

Me: so, you aren't choosing to wear it?

Jane: no. I never want to wear it again.


I checked her bag, and sure enough, it contained tank tops underwear, and the coverings (which cover the hair and body, but not the face.) I took the kids on a quick target trip before the movie to get Jane some clothes of her liking. Two days ago, when Deanna came by to pick up the kids, she flipped out on Jane for not wearing the traditional clothing. Deanna and I got into a heated argument, and I told her that Jane shouldn't HAVE TO wear the covering if she doesn't want to, especially because it's very hot in our city. Deanna argued that she and the kids are now different amd follow a stricter religion,
  I might be the a-hole because I argued back that it is stupid that the religion would force young girls to cover up so much all the time and  be so strict about it. Deanna took offense, and left with the kids. I feel bad because I don't want to insult a while country or countries but I don't think my daughter should have to wear anything she doesn't want to.

1eoeahu,AITA for wearing a two piece to my kids’ swimming lessons?,"I (27f) am a mother to quadruplets aged 2. This is their first year taking swimming lessons, and, at their age, the lessons require one-one-one with the child/adult as well as an instructor to teach. So me, my husband, and two of my husbands friends came along. (Unfortunately all four of the kids got booked for the same time). They started the lessons on Monday and ended today (Friday). 

At the lessons, all the other kids had their mothers/female guardians with them, and all of them wore shorts/shirt swimsuits. My husband/his friends had trunks with no shirt, and I wore a two piece. Nothing bad, everything was well covered, but obviously my stomach and back showed. I didn’t think it was a big deal, and I honestly didn’t even notice what everyone wore until probably Wednesday. And it was fine because everybody (including me) was modest. 

However, they finished their lessons today. When everyone was getting changed to leave, a few mothers came up to me. They said they didn’t want to mention it earlier to make classes awkward, but they and a few other mothers were uncomfortable with how I was wearing a two piece to the lessons all week. The suggested if I do another class with my kids here, I cover up my stomach because nobody wants to see it Because of the stretch marks from my pregnancy. (Which is a lot more than average because I had quadruplets). I asked if they had an issue with how my husband/his friends didn’t wear a shirt at all, and they said the didn’t care because they didn’t have the “baby belly” like I did. 

Now I’m back home, and I can’t decide if they were being rude or just were honest. They made sure to tell me it wasn’t about the modesty, it was just my stomach. I never thought about it, so maybe it’s my fault for being careless and not thinking of everyone else. My husband says I was fine, but all the mothers there apparently don’t think so.

1eoeupa,AITA For Not Letting My Wife Have Some Of My Earnings From A Business Of Which She Wanted No Part?,"My wife and I had discussed my starting a business for a few years. I was under the impression we would be partners in the business. When the time came, I needed my wife's signatures on a few pieces of paperwork. She was adamant she wanted absolutely nothing to do with the business. In fact, those were her literal words: ""I want nothing to do with this business. It is entirely your project"" and she was quite angry about it. So, I took on other partners.

Well, the business has since become profitable and she has recently been making plans for the use of the money I make from the business as if it were her own. I told her (paraphrasing) ""This money is my money. It is not yours. It is in a separate account with only my name on it. You said you wanted nothing to do with the business and said it was entirely my project."" This pissed her off.

My wife also found out I altered my will to leave my share of the business and the money in the aforementioned account to my business partners and not her. She is now livid because it means, if I die before her, she will end up with only the assets we had from before I started running the business full-time and the money she made while working.

1ep6q7v,AITA for not allowing my adopted son to choose the movie on family movie night?,"I (45M) have four sons: three biological (17M, 15M, 12M) and one adopted (13M). We adopted Jake, our youngest, when he was 3 years old. He came from a really difficult background, and we’ve always tried to give him as much love and support as possible. But if I’m being honest, it hasn’t been easy.

Jake has always been more of a challenge compared to my other boys. He’s extremely sensitive and gets upset over the smallest things. Due to the trauma he experienced early on, Jake is mentally and emotionally more like an 8- or 9-year-old, even though he’s 13. This isn’t because of any special needs; it’s just the result of what he’s been through. When he was younger, he struggled a lot in school, to the point where he was eventually expelled from his primary school for behavioural issues. It was a really tough time for our family. We ended up enrolling him in a SEMH (Social, Emotional, and Mental Health) school, which costs around £70k per year. While the school has helped him somewhat, Jake still causes a lot of problems. The school often calls us because Jake’s had a meltdown or couldn’t handle something, and it’s clear he needs a lot more attention than our other kids.

At home, Jake’s neediness can be overwhelming. He’s constantly seeking reassurance and gets upset if things don’t go exactly his way. My wife has always been very patient with him, maybe too patient, in my opinion. She tends to cater to his needs a lot more than the other boys, and I can see it’s starting to wear on them. I can tell they’re starting to feel like Jake gets special treatment.

Earlier today, during our usual Saturday family movie night, this issue came to a head. We always vote on the movie to keep things fair. The older boys and I wanted to watch the first Avengers movie. When we voted, Jake was the only one who wanted to watch Spider-Verse instead. Jake loves Spider-Verse, and we’ve watched it several times before.

Seeing how upset Jake was getting, my wife suggested that we just watch Spider-Verse to avoid a meltdown. She felt it wasn’t worth the fight and wanted to keep the peace, especially considering how sensitive Jake is. But I felt like it wasn’t fair to the other boys who had won the vote fairly. I said no, we’re sticking to the movie that won the vote. Jake, predictably, got really upset, stormed off to his room, and refused to come back downstairs.

After the movie, my wife and I had a huge argument. She said I was being too ""harsh"" and that I don’t understand how difficult things are for Jake because of his past. She thinks I should have just let him have his way to avoid the conflict, but I’m tired of walking on eggshells and constantly giving in to Jake at the expense of the other boys.  I don’t think it’s right to let Jake dictate everything just because he’s more sensitive.

1epxmtk,AITAH for not babysitting for my cousin last minute?,"I am 20f and my cousins wife, “Nora,” is 38f. I received a text from her yesterday asking if I could babysit her 1yo baby today because she was to be having fibroid removal surgery. My cousin “Jack,” 36m was to be driving her and was staying at the hospital. The surgery was supposed to be this fall, but they told her last minute that they had an opening for her today. In the message she told me that money is currently very tight between her and my cousin, so they would not be able to pay me. This would have been fine and I would have accepted, had I not been scheduled to work. She would have needed me there at 7am and my shift was 6am-noon. 

So I politely told her I could not babysit. She never responded. I went downstairs after this exchange and my mom asked “so what time are you babysitting?” I told her I was not, I have work. She told me I was so rude to not call off for Nora and that she was disappointed in my behavior. I asked her why she didn’t call off work to watch Nora’s baby if it was so important to her. She basically told me I was a brat and that I know her job is a “real job.” I work in food service. She knows I work and that I take my job seriously. I’m working to pay for school and both me and my boyfriend are saving every penny to hopefully move in together within the next year. She called me a few other rude names and is now not speaking to me. 

She also must have told some of my other family members about the situation. I’ve now received 2 texts, including one from my grandma, about how I should be willing to do anything for my family and that I need to “make exceptions for family.” I’m annoyed at the whole situation. 

As for Nora, I do feel bad that she was stressed looking for a last minute babysitter on top of having surgery and I don’t know what she ended up doing. But I also know that I didn’t want to get written up for calling out without giving 24 hours notice, especially since I’ve been at this job only 3 months.

He cheated on her multiple times, has no sense of fatherhood hasn’t been there or contributed at all in the twins’ lives.

1esdw0m,AITA for telling my siblings I don’t want to split the bill equally since they have kids and I don’t?,"I have two older sisters (both over 30 years old), while I’m still in my 20s. The thing is, they suggested to invite my mom to lunch for Mother’s Day and they were talking about splitting the expenses in 3 parts. Both of them have 2 kids each while I don’t. Given past (bad) experiences where the kids were not contemplated in the bill but still would eat I told them I did not like the idea of splitting in 3 since their kids should be taken into account, mind you, the kids are not babies, one of them will soon turn 18. At the mention of that they did not like it and called me confrontational and my mom even found out and took their side, as per usual.  

To give you some more context as to why it bothers me: A similar experience happened before during a trip where I had to pay a third out of all the expenses, my mom another and my sister another (husband and kids included). She thought my mom and I were oblivious about the whole thing but my mom begged me to not say anything to not start a fight but now I think I’ve held my silence for long.

So, the question is, AITA for wanting the bill to be split differently considering I don’t have kids and I’m only paying for my share and my mom’s?

1et9pki,AITA For Not Buying My Fiance A Second Wedding Dress That's More than 50% The Total Budget?,"Throwaway Account  
  
My (F49) fiancé (F32) wants me to buy her a new wedding dress that’s over 50% the total wedding budget after I already bought her a $8,600 dress.

I’m marrying the love of my life who is a member of a Native American tribe and lives on a reservation in my city.

I was involved with this tribe before I met her, buying an older woman a mobile home to put on her land when her daughter went to prison leaving her three grandkids to raise when she was living in a 15’ travel trailer. She managed to get the kids out of foster care due to this.

This greased the wheels to get the council to approve us having our wedding on the reservation. I’m paying for everything and have a $60,000 budget. There will be traditional dancers, drummers, and a traditional feast all catered by women on the reservation.  We have an 80 person guestlist—the only people coming on my side is my mother and my adult nephew.

Yes, I’m spreading my money around on the reservation, trying not to be obnoxious about it. Like I said, I’ve seen the poverty many of them go through and I love that my wedding is bringing money there.

My fiancé said she dreamed of her wedding since she was a little girl. I could care less about weddings, tbh, so I’ve let her be the only ‘bride’.  I’m going to wear a black gown with tuxedo elements on top to kind of stand in as a ‘groom’. This way all the attention will be on her. My only rule was that the budget was $60,000 FIRM, not a penny more, and I hired a wedding planner she had to work with to get everything within that budget.

She went out with her girlfriends and decided on a beautiful $8,600 dress. She loved it. It was purchased and fitted. Great.

It’s three months until the wedding (we’re doing November because it’s way too hot to have a summer wedding out here).  She was continuing to get things ready with the tribe and the planner.  One of the tribal elders brought up her dress.  He said she should wear a traditional tribal gown made by one of their artisans.

She sat me down to tell me something ‘serious’ and explained that she couldn’t wear the gown she bought. She needed a traditional tribal gown. I said to get a quote from the artisan and maybe we could get a partial return and/or sell the other gown to cover it.

The artisan’s price? $33,000!! It’s going to be covered with beadwork and she needs to get started NOW.

I said, well it’s a good thing we already have a gown. She said she would not humiliate herself and dishonor her tribe by wearing the wrong gown. I said I can’t approve this cost. It would throw the budget out the window. She says I have millions of dollars, and this is our wedding and I’m being ridiculous.

Yes, I have money. I live off 4% as someone semi-retired. I have this money because I KEEP TO THE BUDGETS I SET.

Now she’s not talking to me except to remind me every day that if the artisan doesn’t start now, she won’t have a dress.

I don’t know what to do. Am I being the asshole here?

1eu0vfs,"AITA for going off on my parents after they make me pay for my portion of a family dinner (when they payed for everybody else), despite them taking half my paycheck?","I’m 17F right now, and the middle child of my family. I’m at an age where I’m able to care for myself, but my parents take it to an absurd degree. So, just so I can pay for what I need, I have a job. However, they take half my earnings and say it’s because “they’re my parents, they deserve it”. That, plus me having to pay for my phone bill, leaves me with a rather small amount of money for me to have.

The other night, my family took me and my sisters out for dinner, since my older sister could come down from her college. We all eat, and have a generally good time until the check comes. My parents decided to pay for everybody **but** me. I had to pay for myself. So, naturally, I ask my parents about it. From there, the conversation escalates into a full-blown argument, which ends in them saying that I’m kicked out of the house. I say fine, and go to stay at a friend’s house for the night, hoping they didn’t mean it and will cool off by the next day.

The next day, I received a text from them saying that I needed to pick my things up from the house. I go to the house, and find all my stuff sitting on the front porch packed up. They were serious about their threat. My friend, being very nice, decided to let me stay at their house for the time being, until either I’m allowed back home, or I find someplace else.

It was also the day that I received my paycheck (it was resent since the first one bounced). When I go to get it, I find that my parents have cashed the WHOLE paycheck, not just the usual half they do. This obviously gets me more pissed off, and I go off on my parents again. They say that they’re going to disown me, which considering what they just did, makes me believe they actually will.

So AITA?

Edit for clarification: When I was young, my family was under financial stress, so me and my sister had to work to help out. They’d take cuts of our pay to help with our debts. once we were out of the situation, they continued taking cuts of my pay, but not my sister’s.",Astrasjournaling,4458,0.9700000286102296,1005,1723844672,2024-08-16 16:44:32,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1eu0vfs/aita_for_going_off_on_my_parents_after_they_make/,8,2024

She had been wanting me to read her fxvourste book of all time Swan song by Robert Mccammon. She wanted me to read it and I thought it sounded pretty good and I love post apocalyptic stuff, so I agreed and she was really excited. 

Well I read the book and though I didn't think it was bad by any means, a lot of it just wasn't for me, and I thought it was pretty flawed In a lotta ways. I thought the romance in the book was terribly written, there were missed opportunities for things that could've been really fun, and I hated the ending!

I told all this to her and she was shocked! She accused me of not actually reading the book, to wich I mentioned several scenes from the book ones I enjoyed snd ines I didn't to show her I did in fact read it. 

She was very upset and asked how I could possibly not love the book and even asked if maybe I was mad at her and telling her I hated the book to be mean. I of course told her that I wasn't mad at her I just didn't like the book that much.

She was still very upset and left saying she needed to be alone for s but. 

This was a couple nights ago, I've tried calling her but she won't answe or return my calls and now I'm thinking maybe I did something wrong if it really upset her that much.

1eu2nsl,AITA for being picky and not eating the food my husband bought for me?,"I’m really frustrated with how my husband handles my food preferences. He constantly says that I don’t like anything and gets upset when I can’t eat certain things. It’s not that complicatedI generally can’t stand spicy, ""sweet and sour"" (like in Chinese food, i dont like sweetness in my main dish) or acidic foods.I also hate raw tomatoes and calamari. I always cook and at restaurants there is always something I can enjoy.  That’s basically all he needs to remember. I dont think I am too picky. He says it’s difficult because of the exceptions, like I only like pineapple and oranges when they’re sweet. I can discern if they will be sweet or acidic, so I can choose when to buy them. But what’s so hard about that? If they’re not sweet, they’re acidic, and I don’t like acidic food.

His bosses recently offered to buy something for me when they were out, and my husband chose sweet and sour chicken that usually I dont like. But one time I mentioned that there was an exception for a certain restaurant. This time, the dish was both spicy and sour. I tried to eat it because he had already bought it, but I just couldn’t. He got mad and told me to throw it out then.

To clarify: I don't like sweetness in my main dish. So, no sugar, lime or too much spicy in my dishes. And I have told him this literally many times.

When my husband found out, he was fucking livid because ""I didn't get permission to do that."" Which is weird asf, because I'm not a child.

1evlsno,AITA for standing my ground and not letting my suite-mate take my dorm room?,"For context: Our college randomly assigns suites and rooms to students that apply for dorming. It is not chosen by the students, only the buildings and who they wish to room with. I (19y/o male) am moving to college in the fall. I am in the process of getting to know my suite-mates and roommate since I chose to do random assignment because I had applied late to college and everyone already chose roommates I had to go with first bed open. After I had been assigned a room my actual roommate added me and we began talking. However, he soon blocked me and I could no longer contact him. A week after this happened my suite-mates got in contact with me. They added me and we talked. They then asked me if I happened to know my roommate since he was the only one they hadn’t talked with yet. I said yes but after we talked a bit he blocked me. We then all had the assumption that he would no longer be dorming with us hence the need to block me on instagram. So after much discussion thats the best answer we could come up with as to why he did so. I thought that was the end of that discussion but it seems I would be wrong. One of my suite-mates, lets name him Phineas, would later tell us that we should vote on who got the room. I being confused asked him why since I got the room fair and square by it being assigned to me. He said that he wasn’t aware that the rooms were assigned and that even if they were, we should vote on who gets it anyways since he wanted it. I told him no for a second time and wanted to be over with it. He then told me that he had a girlfriend and that I could understand right? No. I get that shes going to visit every now and then and that it would be nice to have some privacy, especially if they were going to do spicy things, but I already told him that I wanted the room since it was assigned to me and that if he wanted a single he should’ve booked a single. He keeps pushing the matter when I shut him down every time. I told him that if he continues to talk about it, I would go to RA and get in contact with the school about the whole situation and how Phineas wanted to violate explicit rules and guidelines of living in the dorms. For more context: our college does not allow the opposite sex to enter the bedrooms of the student and may only stay in the common area with the suite door open to the hallway. This was a strict rule that even adheres to parents and family. The guy called me a dick and said that I don’t even need it since I am single and would never understand it. My other suite-mate, gonna name him Ferb for the memes, thinks we should see who needs the room more and give it to them. I think that it rightfully belongs to me since I was assigned the room and bed and that if I got so lucky that I didn’t have a roommate anymore than that was my luck and not theirs.

As I did so, I made a video of the process and pointed out the expiration dates on all of the medications and pointed out the repeats.

I then sent the video to my wife so that she could see what I did. I was surprised when she called me back, very upset, asking why I hated her so much. She accused me of trying to shame her and said she couldn't understand why I was being so hateful. She told me that if I had been so concerned about our medication cabinet that I should have been monitoring it on a daily or weekly basis and that if I was that concerned about cleaning out the medicine cabinet, I would have just done it without making a shame video.

1eyxx5k,AITAH for quitting a game after my husband interrupted me?,"So long story short, my husband has been trying to convince me to play Ghosts of Tsushima for a while (pretty much since it came out) and I finally agreed to play it.

However, while playing the game tonight, he interrupted me during a standoff and I missed a game guide tip that came on screen. To be clear, I was in the middle of a stand off while he was watching me play, and as I'm fighting he asked me a question (not related to the game) and I got distracted answering him while trying not to die at the same time. I'm not great at processing multiple sources of sensory input at the same time, which is why I don't normally play games like this, since they require the player to keep track of lots of different moving pieces simultaneously. That's very stressful for me, and I typically game to reduce stress, so I just don't gravitate towards games that I find difficult to play.

Well, while I was fighting the enemy and trying to answer my husband's question at the same time, I missed a tutorial tip that came on screen and wasn't able to read it before it vanished. I honestly didn't even know I missed it at first, until my husband asked me if I had seen what it said.

I told him no, and asked what it was I missed, but he refused to tell me. I got a little frustrated, but it's not the first time I've gotten distracted from something right in front of my face while trying to process other sensory input, so I asked him if it was something important I needed to know to play the game, to which he said, ""Yes.""

So then I explained to him that I had missed that the tip even came on screen because I was talking to him, and asked again what the guide said. He smirked and said no again with this smug, teasing expression. 

""Are you really not gonna tell me even though I missed it because I was talking to you? Can you at least tell me what it was about so I can try to Google it?"" I asked.

""Nope."" He answered. 

So I closed the game, put the controller down, and left to watch tv in our room. Now he's texting me that I'm overreacting by quitting and telling me to just play the game and I'll be eventually figure it out. Thing is, what little interest I had in playing the game is completely gone now. I didn't really want to play it in the first place, but I knew my husband wanted me too, and at least the gameplay was beautiful and the story sounded interesting. But again, I play games to relieve stress, so now that I've missed important information I need to play the game, and I don't even know how to find what I missed, I'm just over it. I don't think I can go back since the game auto saves and doesn't keep a backup, and even though I'm super far in, I still don't want to start over and redo everything from square one.

1ezotps,AITA for refusing to switch to another stylist during my haircut?,"

So this happened recently, and I’m still wondering if I was in the wrong.

I had an appointment with my usual hairstylist and was already in the chair with my haircut underway. While I was getting my hair cut, some guy walked in without an appointment and started talking to my hairstylist. The stylist explained that he was busy cutting my hair and mentioned that I was also getting my beard done afterward.

Despite this, the guy kept pleading with the stylist to squeeze him in. Eventually, my stylist asked me if I would be willing to move to another stylist so he could help this walk-in guy out. I didn’t feel comfortable switching stylists mid-cut, so I politely said no.

The guy got upset and called me an @sshole saying I was being unreasonable and selfish. I didn’t think I was in the wrong but he made a huge deal about it.

1f0h4cs,AITA for refusing to give back the laptop my mother gave me to punish younger sister,"I (23f) am starting grad school this year. My laptop recently broke and I couldn't afford a good one, my mother said my little sister (16f) has been ""acting up"" recently and not listening and she'd like to give me her laptop since ""she's been horrible lately.""

Now my mother tends to spoil her so it is her fault my sister turned out this way (ofcourse she'll hear none of it), she has a bad habit of not following through on punishments and ""canceling"" them when my sister pitches enough of a fit. 

I asked my mom ""are you absolutely sure you aren't going to call me later and ask for it back when she pitches a fit? Because if I'm gifted this I'm not giving it back unless you buy me one of equal or greater value."" She said ""yes I'm sure I've had enough of her antics"" so I went over and picked up the laptop when sister wasn't home and that was that or so I thought. 

It only took about a day before my mother called me begging for the laptop back because my sister has become unbearable and I said ""are you going to buy me one of equal or greater value?"" And she just kept begging for me to bring it back she couldn't stand it anymore, I told her no she never follows through on disciplining sister and its her fault the way she turned out its about time she followed through on a consequence and I'm not giving it back we had this discussion, and it's her fault for dragging me into this in the first place. She then screams at me and hung up and now won't speak to me. 

Dad always gives into whatever mom wants ""happy wife happy life"" and is telling me to ""be the bigger person"" and give it back, and I said I'm sticking to my guns and he's sent me several nasty texts and emails because now mom is on his case and he can't stand it and he's saying it's all my fault and this had just hugely blown up.

1f0hhvj,AITA for refusing to buy a bridesmaid's dress until I get closer to my goal weight?,"My (28F) sister “Bri” 29F is getting married a year from now. Recently, she reached out to ask me to be a bridesmaid. I was surprised because Bri and I aren’t super close, but I was happy to be a part of her special day.

I used to be extremely overweight, and last year I decided to take control of my health and lost 75 pounds. I’m much happier and healthier than I was, but I’d still like to lose another 60. This became complicated when Bri sent us a link to the dress she wanted us to buy. I’ve never been a bridesmaid, but apparently it is common for brides to ask their bridesmaids to buy their own dress. Still, the dress she requested costed $300, which seemed pricey to me. Bri has asked us to order the dress within a couple of weeks, as it’s popular and she’s worried it will sell out.

I called Bri and told her I am on a weightloss journey and am not buying clothes, until I get closer to my goal weight unless they’re from Goodwill or Walmart or something. Bri seemed really upset by this–she asked if I could just purchase the size I am now and have it be loose at the wedding. I told her I plan on being almost 60 pounds lighter by the wedding, so the dress won’t be loose–it will literally fall off. Bri asked then if I could slow down my weight loss until after the wedding so the dress would fit. I told her absolutely not. I feel amazing and I’m already losing at a slow and steady pace.

I presented Bri with three solutions: 1–I can wait to buy the dress until closer to the wedding, as I requested, 2–she can buy me the dress now with her money, or 3–I drop out of the bridal party, since she probably has people she’s closer with than me anyway. Bri did not seem keen on any of these options–even removing me from the bridal party. She told me I was ruining her big day and that it’s about her, not me, so why does it matter if I wear a dress that’s a little loose?

I hung up after that to give Bri some time to cool off, but then I got a call from my mother telling me what a horrible sister I was and how selfish I was for not just ordering the bridesmaid’s dress. She reiterated how it’s Bri’s day, not mine, and when I have my own wedding I can do things exactly how I want.

To be truthful, I am finally starting to feel confident and to like how I look. Before I started losing weight, I wouldn’t have cared if I wore a too-loose dress because I was “fat and ugly” anyway. Now, even though I only buy dirt-cheap clothes, I make sure to buy clothes that flatter me and accentuate my curves. I put a lot more effort into hair, makeup, and overall presentation. So yes, even though it is not my wedding, this will probably be the first formal event I go to after having lost weight, and I know lots of pictures will be taken. I want to look my best for these photos because I know I will look back on them and remember how hard I worked to get there.

1f0iu8e,AITA for telling my sister I won’t babysit her kids anymore because she doesn’t pay me or even say thank you?,"I (31M) have been helping my sister (34F) with babysitting her two kids (6F and 3M) for the past two years. It started during the pandemic when she and her husband needed help balancing work-from-home and childcare, and I was happy to step in. I didn’t expect any payment at first because, well, family.

But now things are back to normal. She’s back at work full-time, and I’m also busy with my job and personal life. Despite this, she’s still asking me to babysit at least once a week, sometimes more. The issue is, she never offers to pay me or even says a simple “thank you.” It’s just expected that I’ll do it.

Last week, I finally told her I can’t keep doing this for free, and if she wants me to babysit, she either needs to pay me or at least express some gratitude. She got really upset, saying I was being selfish and that family should help each other out without expecting anything in return.

I get that family helps family, but I feel taken advantage of. I’m not asking for much, just a token of appreciation or even an occasional break. Now she’s not speaking to me, and our parents are saying I should apologize to keep the peace.

1f188ve,AITA For asking my husband not to poop in the main bathroom? ,"We have three bathrooms in our house. One is right outside the main living space, the other is in our bedroom and then we have a half bath in the utility hall. My husband almost always poops after dinner when the house is active and without fail, he does it in the ""main"" bathroom. Not only can I sometimes hear him pooping, but it's the only bathroom with an actual bathtub and we give the kids baths after dinner. I don't want to listen to my husband poop and then do baths in a stinky poop smelling bathroom when there are literally two other bathrooms he can use. 

When we moved in together into the house we put the poop stool from his house in the utility bathroom and dubbed it the poop bathroom. Now he just uses the kids foot stool. I have asked him COUNTLESS times to quit pooping in the main bathroom. 

He thinks I am being ridiculous and that he should be able to use whatever bathroom he wants and said it's not that big of a deal. I think pooping in the bathroom in the main living area is rude, especially right before bath/bed time. (Like who wants to brush their teeth in a poopy smelly bathroom?)

1f206bz,AITA for making my son (16) pay for his own room?,"I'm a single mom of 5 (16M, 14M, 10M, 9F, 7M) renting a 3-bedroom house.

Up until 2 months ago the 2 eldest boys shared a room, the 3 youngest shared, and I had the smallest room. 

For the last few years my eldest complained non-stop about having to share a room with his little brother. Most of his friends’ parents are wealthy so he's constantly comparing our situation to theirs. 

He started working when he was 14 (a few hours a week) for a little extra money, now at 16 he works a lot (more than I would like) and this summer he has been working basically fill-time. He's not too bad with his money and actually saves some of it, but the rest goes to video games, clothes/shoes, and junk food. 

2 months ago, my son and I were discussing his distaste for sharing a room with his brother and he said he'd drop out of school now if it meant he could move out into his own space. I told him I had looked at 4-bedroom rentals in our area, but they were just too expensive. He asked if he could pay the difference if we did move. I told him no because during the school year all his money would be going to rent not his savings and his spending money. That obviously wouldn't sit right with me.

However, we did come up with a compromise. For $50 a month he could have my bedroom and my 10-year-old could move in with 14-year-old and I would sleep in our living room (our couch is already a pull-out). This was 2 months ago, and we already made the switch, and everybody is happy with the new set up. 

All the money my son is paying me is going straight into my Christmas savings and then after Christmas will go into a summer trip savings. 

I recently told some of my friends what I was doing and they're against it. They think I'm wrong for taking any amount of money from my kids and a couple of them said I should have just given him the room without making him pay for it. They make some good points, and I don't totally disagree, and it makes me feel like an asshole.

My 14-year-old son is also unhappy about the arrangement, he thinks its unfair older brother is getting his own room and that middle brother should have stayed in his old room. I can see how he feels it's unfair that older brother has the chance to pay for his own room when he (or the other kids) don’t have the same opportunity.

It seems bad to renege with my oldest now, but I'm not sure if I made a mistake agreeing to this.

My husband is mad at me because we had a repair man come to look at our couches and I was wearing a tshirt (which wasn't in the least bit see through btw) with no bra but I had on pants. He says that even if the shirt wasn't see through that you can still see them (my breasts) sitting in the shirt. I'm a large chested women and hiding them is literally impossible. He says that through the shirt you can still see them jiggling and the nipple. I said that's insane that I'm supposed to wear a bra just because someone is coming into the house that's a stranger especially because I was fully covered by my shirt there was 0 cleavage showing.

1f3nt3w,AITA for refusing my birthday gift because it was a weight watchers subscription?,"
Hi Reddit, I turned 18 (female) yesterday but it seems to caused a bit of drama in my family so im asking for honest, objective opinions on whether im wrong. I’m using a throwaway account because this situation is obviously very humiliating for me

For reference, my weight has always been made fun of in my family. My aunt specifically has always been very unkind and fat shamed me, even when I was younger and struggling with my body image. She used to tell me that my clothes looked so small on me, and that even her clothes are probably small for me. She used to remind me to go on diets constantly. Im currently 320lbs if it adds contexts too 

I hadn’t seen my aunt in a while and for the most part I was really glad to see her for my birthday. I was slightly dreading if she would say anything to me because im aware I have gained a lot of weight since I last saw her, but she just made a few comments so I thought it was the end of it. 

I was opening a birthday card she gave me a few hours later and it had money in it, with a note that said “money for weight watchers, make some real change for once”. This was humiliating and I asked her about it and she said that she could tell I was miserable and that I probably look really good underneath the fat. She said this in front of my parents, and it was very embarrassing. I told her im not accepting the gift and she’s making me look stupid, but she said that she was just worried for me and my health. I don’t believe this, she’s made fun of my weight for years even before I was a teenager. But my parents think I was overreacting and I should’ve just accepted it. My aunt has a notoriously big mouth and my parents think she’s going to tell our whole family so they’re getting kind of worried about what I’ve done.

1f3ob84,AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding because she didn’t invite me to hers?,"
So, some background: My sister and I have always had a complicated relationship. We’re not super close, but we’ve always managed to stay cordial, mainly because of family gatherings and events. A few years ago, she got married, and I wasn’t invited. She claimed it was a small ceremony with only her husband’s family and a few close friends. I was hurt, but I didn’t make a big deal out of it and let it go.

Fast forward to now—I’m getting married. My fiancé and I are planning a slightly larger wedding with close family and friends. When it came time to send out invitations, I decided not to invite my sister. I felt like if she didn’t want me at her wedding, I shouldn’t feel obligated to invite her to mine. 

My parents are furious and say I’m being petty and that I should be the bigger person. They insist that I invite her because “family is family.” But to me, it’s more about reciprocation and not wanting someone at my wedding who didn’t think I was important enough to be at theirs. My fiancé supports my decision but thinks it might cause unnecessary drama. 

Now, my sister found out she wasn’t invited and called me, upset. She said she didn’t invite me to her wedding because she was under a lot of stress at the time and regrets it now. She accused me of holding a grudge and ruining our relationship even further. 

I feel like I’m justified in my decision, but now I’m second-guessing myself. AITA for not inviting her?

1f4g33i,AITA for Calling an Ambulance for My Drunk Wife Who Passed Out in a Club Bathroom?,"Last Saturday night, my wife (30F) and I (30M) went to a concert with a friend who recently moved to our city. My wife had been recovering from a cold and was excited to go out, as it had been a while since we had a night out together. I drove, so I only had one beer, but my wife and our friend kept drinking throughout the night.

As the gig went on, I noticed my wife having more drinks and getting quite drunk, but she was having so much fun that I didn’t want to ruin it. Toward the end of the concert, my wife went to the bathroom. When the gig finished, our friend and I waited for her outside, but after 20 minutes with no sign of her and unanswered calls, we started to worry. 

We showed a picture of my wife to someone leaving the bathroom, and a woman told us she had seen my wife passed out in a toilet cubicle, covered in her own vomit and unresponsive. My heart sank. I had never seen her like this before, and I was genuinely scared for her safety. The staff came to help and strongly suggested calling an ambulance. I agreed immediately, fearing alcohol poisoning or a spiked drink.

The paramedics arrived and took my wife to the emergency department. I drove there and arrived shortly after the ambulance. Thankfully, she came around a few hours later, and the doctor said she was fine, just extremely drunk. The next day, my wife was able to laugh at the whole thing but felt that I overreacted by calling the ambulance. She said it was unnecessary and that the whole experience was traumatizing and embarrassing.

I explained to her that I was following the advice of the venue staff and was genuinely worried something more serious could have happened, like choking on her vomit. It’s been a few days, and she still insists I shouldn't have called an ambulance. We have private healthcare that covers ambulance costs, so that wasn’t an issue, but I’m starting to question if I did overreact.

1f59eht,AITA for leaving a family gathering after Mother & Father-in-law allowed their neighbour to make a racist comment?,"I (M 31) am mixed race (Black dad/white Mum) and am currently visiting my mum (60s) and her partner of 10 years (60s white) who we will call 'John'

My mum and John live in a small village in Wales, all white but something I'm fairly used to growing up in predominantly white areas of the UK.

Today I was de-weeding the front garden to help out while visiting, when John bumped into one of the neighbours (Karl 60s) and called me over to introduce myself/say hi. In the very first conversation, I mentioned I'm here for a week from London. Karl immediately led into a story of how when he was last in London he accidentally bumped into a man who proceeded to be extremely hostile and ignored all pleas that it was an accident, becoming more and more belligerent, before adding ""and he was coloured"" in a tone that lowkey screamed ""he was a dangerous n----r"", which both Karl & John chuckled at.

Caught off guard by the comment I immediately said I'm going to finish up on the garden, doing another 30 seconds of work, before putting the tools away and heading to my room. Shortly after John came to my room saying ""Sorry about Karl, he just says it how it is"" which led to me exploding saying ""You don't care about what he said because it doesn't matter to you but it matters to me, and you should care about that"" before leaving to go on a long hike.

Returning a couple of hours later, my mum came to my room in an attempt to resolve the situation.

It didn't go well. Mother began by telling me I'm blowing it out of proportion, that Karl is a weirdo and I should ignore his comments. I made it clear I don't care about Karl, I care that John allowed their neighbour to make a racist remark in front of me with zero pushback.

Mum told me I should have spoken up, I should have stood up for myself. I replied this is your friend, it's not my responsibility to correct them, and as a person of colour it is not my responsibility to educate every racist white person.

My Mum told me I'm overreacting, to which I told her she's white, she has no idea the experience of being a person of colour, & has no business telling me what is or isn't racist, or how I should feel. I've been forced to turn a blind eye to racism in my social life, in the workplace, in education & while working abroad, I am not going to accept racism in a place I call home, and that I'm packing my bag and going home tomorrow morning.

My mum is furious I'll be missing seeing the rest of the family, and believes I'm immature for not continuing to discuss the matter as a family and at least find a place to agree to disagree. I don't know what more there is to discuss, I don't know what compromise or level of racism I'm expected to tolerate, or how I'm supposed to be comfortable in the knowledge that my direct family are comfortable ignoring racism and minimalise my feeling towards it.

1f5yrxy,AITA for making my neighbours think I’m in a cult ,"

Hi throw away account cause I don’t want my friends to find this. I (24M) am a huge fan of board games, particularly Dungeons & Dragons. I host weekly D&D sessions at my apartment with a group of friends, and it's been our tradition for the last five years. We get into it—we dress up, light candles, chant dramatic incantations, we play some ambient music.I know it’s more that the regular player but we like it and find it funny 

Recently, my neighbors (an older couple in their 60s) moved in next door. They’re nice enough, but pretty old-school. Anyway, they’ve been giving me these weird looks lately and avoiding me in the hallway, which I thought was odd. But I figured maybe they just weren’t into socializing.

Well, last Saturday, during one of our sessions, we got *really* into it. My friend Dave (23M) was doing an epic monologue as the evil sorcerer we were about to defeat, and I may have been waving around a fake sword while wearing a hooded cloak, I was cosplaying my rouge character. We were deep in the moment when I heard a knock on the door. 

I opened it, still in costume, and was greeted by my very concerned-looking neighbors. Before I could say anything, the wife blurted out, “We’ve seen the people coming and going, the chanting, the cloaks, the swords—we just want to make sure everything is...okay?”

I was caught off guard and, without thinking, I blurted out, “Oh, we’re just summoning demons. Nothing to worry about!” And then I laughed because, obviously, I was joking.

They did not laugh. In fact, they looked even more horrified. They just mumbled something about being good Christians and backed away slowly.

Fast forward to the next morning, and I find a pamphlet slipped under my door for a “cult deprogramming service.” They even included a handwritten note offering to introduce me to their pastor “to save my soul.”

Now, my friends think this is hilarious and keep suggesting we lean into it, like start wearing robes to take out the trash or chant in the hallways. I’m honestly tempted to mess with them a bit, but I’m also kind of worried I’ve legitimately freaked them out.

1f7jdth,AITA for asking a woman to teach her autistic son boundaries? ,"My grandmother became friends with a family who a few years ago moved to her same neighborhood, they have a son with autism, he is 16 years old.

I lived my entire childhood with my grandmother and a few months ago I returned to live with her because someone must take care of her because of some problems that happened.

My grandmother has always been really friendly and the boy's mother always goes to her house with her son and his babysitter. I've been doing a few dialogues with them and the guy has started to get more trusting with me. 

He is non-verbal, his way of communicating is touching people and he gets too close for my liking. I don't like physical contact and it bothers me that people don't respect personal space but I try to be respectful. 

When the guy comes up close to rubbing his nose against my cheek (that's how close he gets, it's his way of Communicate) I walk away but he continues following me, his family finds him adorable and they are happy that he is comfortable with me but I am not. 

They even started making jokes that he's in love with me. I'm an adult, there's nothing funny or cute on saying those kind of things. 

I have asked the boy to please keep his distance from me but he does not listen to me, I have tried to make him respect my limits but it does not happen and he even follows me to my room sometimes. 
Anyway, a few days ago I approached the mother alone and told her that I feel uncomfortable when someone gets so close to me, that she should teach him to have limits with some people because in the future that could bring him problems. 

She just said to me ""Sisi, thank you for the advice"" but now I have found out that she complained about me to my grandmother and did not come to visit her because she says she felt uncomfortable that I discriminated her son.

So for a bit of backstory I have 4 kids, 2 from myself, 2 from my partner (both female) and my two older children made a friend with a kid down the street, he's been coming over for about a week, and he'll spend hours at my house at a time. I don't have a problem with this, he's a very nice kid, and I don't mind taking another kid to the park. (I'm also a stay at home mom) well, yesterday, I finally met his mother. And I knew the kid was Mormon, but I personally don't raise my children in religion even though I identify as a theistic Satanist. Well his mom saw my baphomet necklace (which honestly my best friend gave me when we were kids, and I just still wear it regularly) well she practically blew up on me, telling me I'm sending my own kids and her child to hell, and that I was obviously planning this because I didn't tell her. And then I dropped the fact that I am also in a homosexual relationship, and maybe she should check where her kids are, instead of having random people from the neighborhood watch her children while she's at work... 

Anyways. Am I the asshole? Because personally I don't feel like she's entitled to my information if she doesn't want to have a relationship with me?

Also I feel bad, because he was a good kid, and I'm worried he's not eating when he's not over at my house..and I feel bad that I'm the person that ruined the relationship between our children..",demon13775,2148,0.8799999952316284,621,1725315403,2024-09-02 17:16:43,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1f7jmum/aita_for_not_telling_my_neighbors_my_religion/,9,2024

1f8cc4t,AITA for how I told my family that I have cancer?,"I (24F) discovered a couple weeks ago that I have breast cancer. It came as a real shock to me because I had practically no symptoms. I was at the hospital for a different reason and from there referred internally to the mammography suite. (That's not really important to the story but just a little context on how I was diagnosed). But the good news is that doctors were able to catch it early and the outlook is good.

My problem, aside from the obvious, is that I had no idea how to tell my family. I knew they would panic regardless, which is understandable as I lost two great aunts to breast cancer and my dad also has stomach cancer. So I just kind of avoided telling them because there's a lot going on in my family at the minute. I didn't want to put any more on their plate. But then I did my first round of chemo and it floored me. I knew then that I had to tell them because I genuinely couldn't go through that alone again. 

This is where I'm possibly the AH. My family are really bad with emotional stuff. We're not good at expressing ourselves. We can laugh and make jokes and that but when it comes to serious matters we're all quite awkward. And I knew that this was going to be awkward and I didn't really want to face that. My mum, I could deal with, she's a lot better with stuff like this but I really didn't want to tell my dad. He's the suffer in silence type and I knew it would break him to learn about this, especially since he's going through the same thing.

So, to tell them, I bought a cake and a card to give my dad. They said, ""Congratulations! It's twins!"" with the diagnosis/outreach letter from my GP.

Reactions were mixed. My dad, while really upset, did find it funny. My mum is distraught and did not. Siblings are split, some found it funny, some found it insensitive to my parents. Personally, I thought it was funny but they did raise some good points. In the end though, it's mostly forgotten as they're all still in shock and focused on the diagnosis itself. It's been a couple days and I'm starting to think that maybe it was wrong of me to do it like that. I could've have just gotten over my awkwardness and had a mature conversation with my parents about it but it's too late for that now. AITA?

1f8d5z1,AITA for not being sympathetic that my dad’s affair baby was stillborn?,"I (16F) do not have a good relationship with my dad.  It used to be better when I was younger, but I just don’t expect a lot from him anymore before all this and he has totally messed up things for everyone. He cheated on my mom and they separated back in the spring. My mom found out because he got the woman he was cheating with pregnant and had to come clean.  I stayed with mom and told him to kick rocks because how dare he?  My mom is the nicest and most supportive person in the world. If a hug were a person, that would be my mom. He’s been trying to get me to meet up with him and talk and I told him that as long as he’s still with the affair woman he’s never going to see me. He said that since they’re going to have a baby he has to be there for the baby. I told him looks like he made his choice then.

Last week my oma called to let me know that they were on the way to the hospital because the baby was going to be born and they said they would pick me up if I wanted to come meet my little sister later.  I said no and basically ignored my phone the rest of the day because I don’t want to hear about it. My dad tried to call me that night and I didn’t answer.  This weekend he just showed up at my mom’s house in tears.  My mom let him in and he said that the baby died. I went upstairs and left them alone.  He came up to my room later and asked if we can talk and I said no.  He said that he really misses me and he wants to find a way to make things ok between us. I told him I don’t care and to leave me alone. Then he said that he’s just lost a daughter and can’t I just cut him some slack right now because he’s been punished enough?  That pissed me off pretty bad because he caused this whole problem in the first place, so I told him that he already picked the people that he cares about more and he can’t just do a takesies-backsies now that the kid died. So now he’s 0-2, hope it was worth it. He left.

My mom came up later and said that while she understands why I’m angry at him, he’s really hurting right now and throwing it back at him was wrong. I’m not sure because I think he just brought that up to guilt me into forgiving him. I don’t think he’s really sorry for any of this he just wants to not be the bad guy anymore.",CriticalProof3414,2313,0.949999988079071,611,1725402117,2024-09-03 17:21:57,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1f8d5z1/aita_for_not_being_sympathetic_that_my_dads/,9,2024

1f9yvjp,AITA for refusing to interview my cousin for a position at my company?,"I (27M) finished my Bachelor's 6 years ago. Right after graduating I worked as a software engineer at Facebook for a year, got a job at a hedge fund and worked there for three years, got burned out, took a few months off, and founded a company around 1.5 years ago.

My little cousin Meera (22F), bless her bleeding heart, has always been my biggest supporter. When I was at Facebook she'd frequently remind me that my employer is a cancer and I'm working to make the world worse. When I was at the hedge fund she'd always remind me that I'm paid a boatload to contribute nothing to society. When I started my own company, she said that she hoped my hedge fund would take me back when the AI hype wave died off and my company went under. 

Anyways, we're currently interviewing for a lead designer. I guess the new grad job market must be tough because earlier this week we found Meera's profile in our applicant portal. My uncle messaged me later letting me know that she had applied and it would be great if we could interview her. I replied that I'm flattered by her application but unfortunately we're hiring for a lead with more experience. He said we could still hire her to work under the design lead. I said we're not looking to hire junior designers at the moment but we'll keep her in mind as we grow.

My uncle then sent a link to an article about my company's funding and said I certainly have budget to hire her. I got fed up and basically told him I won't hire someone who takes every chance to shit on my career and who I can't trust to be respectful in the workplace. And also it's unprofessional that her father is messaging me on her behalf when she could be asking me herself.

He didn't message me after that but Meera sent me a snarky text saying she didn't realize I was so sensitive and she's sorry she offended me. The thing is, I don't think she's entirely wrong about Facebook/hedge funds, but still she hasn't said a single nice thing about my career or even my company and I don't think I can trust her.

It’s been a really tough journey for my husband (36M) and me, and we’ve gone through rounds of IVF, countless doctor appointments, and a lot of emotional highs and lows.

This was a topic I had confided in her many times, and it felt like she was mocking something that caused me a lot of pain.I stayed seated for another few minutes, but I couldn’t take it. I quietly got up, left the table, and ended up leaving the wedding entirely. My husband came with me, and on the way home, I started getting texts from family members asking why I left.

1fattyk,AITA for telling my uncle I would take him to court if he didn’t pay me?,"I (16f) have an uncle (44m) who we’ll call David, last month I was talking to David about how I was looking for a job and I was complaining and how no one would hire me because of my age,

he suggested I work for him, David is self employed as a house hold cleaner, he makes a well living and I thought it was a nice offer and it would look good on a resume (considering all I’d have on there without it would be babysitting), 

well anyways I asked him what the pay would be and he said he’d pay me 15$ an hour and i happily excepted, I worked 25 hours a week for a month so I made 1,500$ but when I asked him when I’d be payed he asked me what I ment so I clarified and said “when will you be paying me for the 100 hours I worked” he looked at me like I was crazy 

I thought I got the hours wrong so I checked again and it was definitely 100 hours so I showed him the hours I worked and said “yeah one hundred see” and then he said “no I got what you mean but why would I be paying you?” 

And I froze for a moment before before I got mad and asked him why would he not be paying me and he told me that I was just helping him and being a good niece well his wrist heals (he sprained his wrist 3 months prior and it was fully healed)

I said that I wasn’t doing that work for free and if he wasn’t going to pay me like he said he would I would take him to small claims court, after that he got really quite and said he thought I was a better person and that family should help family.

1fbibcr,AITA for signing my kids up for public school behind my wife's back?,"So, I (36M) am a dad to 6-year-old twins, and my wife (28F) is a stay-at-home mom who has recently gone full crunchy mom mode. She's all about essential oils, no processed foods, cloth diapers when they were babies, and she's absolutely against anything mainstream. For the longest time I didn’t mind because a lot of it is about healthy living and I want the best for our kids. But things are starting to get way out of control.

The latest issue is that my wife is dead set on homeschooling the twins. She’s convinced that public school is “toxic” and that our kids won’t thrive in a system that’s “designed to make them little robots.” She even has a few friends in her crunchy mom group who homeschool their kids and she’s been talking nonstop about joining their co-op. I’ve expressed my concerns about this from the beginning. I work full-time and I don’t think she realizes how hard it’s going to be to manage homeschooling two kids at the same time while giving them a proper education.

But she won’t hear it. Anytime I bring up public school she shuts it down immediately, saying she doesn't want the twins to get bullied or that we’ll lose control of what they’re learning. I just don’t think homeschooling is realistic and I can’t see how she’ll keep them on any sort of consistent schedule.

I gave her time to prove me wrong over the summer, thinking maybe she’d ease into it and have a plan. Instead, she’s spent most of the time bouncing between different unschooling philosophies and signing them up for random activities with her crunchy mom friends. The kids are constantly bored, and I’ve seen them starting to fall behind.

I'm not proud to admit it but I went behind her back and enrolled the twins in public school for the fall. I told her a few weeks before school started and she absolutely lost it. She accused me of betraying her and said I was undermining her role as a mother. She keeps saying I don’t trust her to raise our kids which isn’t true. I just don’t think she’s prepared to handle homeschooling and I don’t want the twins to suffer because of it.

She spent the whole first week of school trying to make me feel guilty by saying the twins are miserable and that I’ve ruined their childhoods by forcing them into the system. The thing is as far as I can tell the twins actually loved their first week school. They’ve made friends and like their teacher. But my wife keeps insisting they’re just pretending to like it to make me happy.

Now, she’s talking about pulling them out mid-year and starting over with her homeschooling plan but I’m putting my foot down. I want the best for my kids, and I honestly think public school is the right choice for them right now. My wife is making me feel like I’m the bad guy for going behind her back and forcing them into something she was so against.

AITA for enrolling the twins in public school without her consent? Should I have handled it differently? I'm starting to feel really guilty about what this is doing to my wife.

**EDITING TO ADD:**

* Yes the twins are vaccinated. My wife wasn't so far in the crunchy pipeline back then. Her friends do sometimes make her feel bad about that.

* I looked into homeschooling and unschooling and did my research. I had hoped my wife had a plan which was why I gave her the summer to figure that out.",atmylimitsnow,10265,0.949999988079071,2920,1725746282,2024-09-07 16:58:02,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fbibcr/aita_for_signing_my_kids_up_for_public_school/,9,2024
1fbjj26,AITA for hiding my boyfriend’s anime body pillow while my parents were visiting?,"My boyfriend (M/32) and I (F/27) have been together for a year. He’s only met my parents once over the holidays last year because they live pretty far away. They've been visiting this past week and since he and I just moved in together they were excited to see our new place, and get to know my BF a little more.

We have an extra bedroom, and this has become my boyfriend’s gaming room for the most part but we agreed when guests come over it would be a second bedroom. He really likes video games and anime in particular so he has a lot of toys and artwork that he’s collected over the years from different games and such. 

One thing he has is this anime body pillow that features a sexy anime girl on it. He also has a mousepad for his gaming computer that resembles a busty anime girl. Before my parents came over I asked him to take down his toys and stuff so they could be comfortable. I was upset to see that he left the body pillow and the mousepad in place.

I don’t really feel comfortable with either item but he’s really into anime so I’ve always kind of left it alone. But I absolutely didn’t think it was appropriate to leave it in there when my parents would be staying over. I took the cover off the body pillow and put the pillow in the closet and I put the mousepad in a drawer in our room.

When my parents arrived and we showed them to their room, my BF noticed the missing pillow and mousepad. Later, when we were in bed, he brought it up to me and asked why I hid them. I told him I didn’t think my parents would feel comfortable with those things in the bedroom and when they leave we can put them back.

My BF got really upset. He told me that he feels like I’m ashamed of his interest in anime. He said he’s spent his whole life feeling like people think he’s weird for being into anime and he didn’t expect his own GF to be “just like everyone else”. 

The next day, I noticed him taking some of his manga books off our bookshelf and putting them into a box. I asked him why and he said something like “I’m putting them away so you don’t have to look at them anymore”.

I feel really bad, I feel like I hurt him but I just really didn’t think my parents would feel comfortable sleeping in a room with those items. But now he’s just acting so distant and cold and he’s not really engaging with my parents at all. They keep asking me what’s wrong and I don’t know what to say.

1fd0m2c,AITA for refusing to move out even though my roommate is 7 months pregnant?,"Hi guys, last week my roommate Becca found out she is not only pregnant but seven months along. 

She texted me that we had to talk today and  I had assumed she would be moving out soon for more space when the baby comes. Instead she told me I have to move out to make space for the nursery and her baby daddy to move in. 

I’m on a terrible salary and cannot afford anywhere else to live, plus like she wants me to move out right now so she can prepare for the baby. Even if I wanted to move out now, the apartment rentals in my area are either too expensive or well below living standards so I don’t want to move. 

She went absolutely crazy the moment I told her I wouldn’t move out, because I’m ruining her motherhood experience by not letting her family live together. I pay rent here and my names on the lease until at least the end of the year. I’m not gonna pull out of the lease and I told her that if she wants her little family together that she should move and I’ll find someone to half the cheap rent with. 

That made her start crying and saying how I just want to ruin her life to the point her baby daddy had to console her and tell me to get out of their way already. I’ve not heard her stop crying since but I think I’m totally valid that I don’t want to leave.

1fd0y3b,AITA for telling my boyfriend his family are leeches after meeting them for the first time?,"We’ve been dating for about 4 months and last night was the first time I met his family. They were nice at first but I couldn’t stand the sight of them at the end of the night.

Dinner conversation was normal as they asked about me and my family. Then the table divided into smaller conversation groups and I overheard his older brothers talking to his sister about investing. I’m not an expert so I’ll give you the gist of what I heard.

She’s been out of school for a couple of years and have saved up about $75,000 and wants to start investing. They said property is the best and that section 8 is the way to go. They said that the rent is always paid on time and the people won’t mess up the property because they’re afraid of getting kicked out of the program. They said the best part is that they’ll still own the properties and the value will always go up. They said they’re developing a small neighborhood with about 10 houses specifically for section 8. All of those houses under 2000 sqft and have 4 bedrooms as section 8 pays higher rates for more bedrooms and smaller houses are cheaper to maintain. They said that it’ll cost them about $100/sqft to build these houses and the rent will be about $4000 per month. They said that she could buy in on her first rental house next year when they start another development. They’re in the process of closing on a piece of land that will accommodate about 20 houses.

I cringed then couldn’t keep quiet anymore. I told them that instead of renting out and keeping those houses off the market, they should sell them to those people. They looked at me quietly and I knew they never considered helping people out by selling the houses they were building. His dad told me I was out of line and I answered that his family was out of line for preying on people in need while feeding off of the taxes people pay. I said that most people can’t afford to buy a single house yet his sons are building 10-20 at a time which makes them leeches. 

We argued for a bit then we left. This morning my boyfriend told me I need to apologize to his family but I refused to. We just met after my last class and told me we’re no longer invited to any of his family function including the Christmas trip back to their old country. Since we're still in school, his family was going to pay for us so he really wants me to apologize and smooth things over.

I know I’m right but maybe I shouldn’t have been so harsh on the first meeting.

What do you think?

1fdvmtw,AITA for Not Letting My Son See His grandparents After They Said He Should Be Ashamed of His Black Features? ,"I (M28) Am half Black and half Mexican, and I have a 5-year-old son with my ex-girlfriend, who’s Korean. Our relationship ended a while ago, but we’ve always tried to co-parent and keep things civil for the sake of our son. Lately, though, something has been bothering me. My son has started acting more self-conscious, especially about his appearance. He’s got my curly hair and darker skin, and it seemed like he was starting to feel uncomfortable with the way he looks.

A few weeks ago, I figured out why. During a visit to his mother’s parents—his Korean grandparents—I overheard them telling him he should be ashamed of his Black features. They told him he’d be ""more handsome"" if he looked more Korean and suggested that when he’s older, he should straighten his hair and stay out of the sun so his skin doesn’t get darker.

I was furious. My son is only 5, and for him to hear that from his own family is unacceptable. I confronted his grandparents immediately, and they tried to excuse it, saying they were ""helping"" him because life would be easier if he looked ""less Black."" I told them that’s racist and harmful, especially for a young kid who’s still figuring out who he is.

When I got home, I called my ex and told her what happened. I said that her parents were no longer allowed to see our son until they changed their attitude. She wasn’t happy about it. She agrees that what they said was wrong, but she doesn’t think cutting them off is the solution. She says our son should still know his Korean family and culture, and that her parents might change if given a chance.

Now, my son keeps asking why he can’t see his grandparents, and my ex is mad at me. She says I’m being too extreme and that I’m making things harder for our son by keeping him away from part of his family. But I don’t want him around people who will make him feel ashamed of his Black heritage, even if they are family.

Am I the asshole for not letting my son see his grandparents after what they said?

1fffwe4,AITA for not sticking up for my boyfriend when his friends made fun of his weight?,"My 24F boyfriend “Steve” 28M has always been on the chubbier side. He still is somewhat active and is not fat by any means but definitely not thin. I used to be thin when Steve and I got together 18 months ago, but have since gained about 20 lbs. I’m still a healthy weight for my height, but not thin anymore.

A couple nights ago, Steve and I were out for dinner. He told me I should watch what I eat because I’m gaining weight. I rolled my eyes and ordered a burger and fries (same thing as Steve) because I thought it was just a poorly thought out joke. But on the car ride home he told me he was concerned because I was gaining weight and becoming unhealthy and less attractive. He put it gently, but I was still upset and pointed out that he wasn’t the poster child of thinness himself, but he said it’s different because he’s the same size he was when we got together.

I told him to give it a rest and slept in the guest room that night. When I woke up the next morning, he apologized profusely and begged me to forgive him. Since he’d never messed up that bad throughout our year and a half of dating, I told him we could just move past it.

I thought we had forgotten about it until last night when we were out with Steve and his friends. They were joking as male friends normally do, which means they were throwing around insults. One of Steve’s friends made a silly comment about Steve’s weight and suddenly they were all piling on. “Yeah Steve, you ARE fat, hahaha.” Steve laughed along, but it was obvious to me that he was hurt by the comments. I thought about telling the friends to cut it out, but then remembered what Steve said to me just a few nights prior and decided he could handle a bit of playful teasing.

When we got home, Steve asked me why I didn’t stick up for him when I knew he was uncomfortable. I told him I thought he could handle it, given what he so comfortably said to me the other night. Steve said it was different because he didn’t make fun of my weight in front of my friends and he was coming from a place of concern. He said he thought we had agreed to move past the comment he made and that what I did was petty and holding a grudge. I told him we weren’t going to get anywhere with this conversation and we should take time to cool off and think.

Steve booked a hotel last night and should be getting home any minute now. I’m still not sure if what I did was wrong. I talked to my sister and she said I should have joined in with Steve’s friends and I wasn’t mean enough, but my sister’s also a lot bolder than me. If I am the AH, I should apologize when Steve gets back. Any thoughts are appreciated.

1fgx5ai,AITA for refusing to give my roommate a tampon?,"My roommate (23f) and I (22f) have been living together for about a year now. I have been renting on my own since I was 17 and this is her first apartment. Her lack of experience shows. 

I’ve had to remind her to pay me for utilities and rent a few times, and she is often a couple days late. She also doesn’t really pick up after herself and leaves dishes in the sink for over a week sometimes. I’ve had to ask her to contribute to buying necessities of daily living, such as toilet paper, dish soap, paper towels, laundry detergent, etc. because she always just waits for me to buy them. 

A few months ago I started my period and when I went to the bathroom to take care of it I saw she had used all of my tampons and didn’t ever buy more to replace them. Needless to say, I was very annoyed. She could have at least texted me to give me a heads up or something. I asked her why she used mine and didn’t buy her own. She told me she was broke and I didn’t really know how to argue with that so I just asked her to at least tell me next time.

And then it happened again! A couple weeks ago I started my period and when I went to the bathroom, my box of tampons was completely empty. Now I was livid. When I purchased more I started keeping them in my room and hiding a few in a clever spot in the bathroom so she wouldn’t find them. 

Yesterday she knocked on my bedroom door and asked if I had a tampon from the other side. I told her I bought a box a little while ago (the one she emptied) and there should still be some left because I haven’t used them. She said she would check but I didn’t hear from her again that night after she went to the bathroom. 

I did have tampons. They were in my room. 

Now I feel like an asshole, like I’ve betrayed the sisterhood. I could have given her at least one and told her to purchase more herself. But I was admittedly still bitter because of how she is as a roommate in general.

I have a brother-in-law and sister-in-law that has owed my wife and me $1,200 for over three years now.

Now, more than three years later, we have not received a dime and they avoid the subject. 

The other day, our four-year old dryer quit working and instead of dealing with the hassle of getting it repaired, we went out and bought a new washer and dryer set. We posted the old ones for free on FB marketplace. 

Almost immediately, my sister-in-law messaged that they wanted it, to which I replied that I would sell it to them for $1,200. She called my wife about the exchange and my wife was somewhat upset.

1fkxh65,AITA for turning down an offer I made two years ago? ,"I do jewelry and metal smithing as a hobby. 

Two years ago, a “friend” lost her grandmother. The grandma had left a pretty big estate behind. Her will hadn’t been updated, so “Amber” inherited a pair of cufflinks instead of earrings like the rest of the women. 

At the time, I offered to recast the cuff links into earrings. They wouldn’t be as nice as the rest of her grandma’s jewelry but it was better than nothing. 

Amber said she would have to think about it.

Fast forward to now. I cut contact with Amber a while back. I don’t appreciate some comments she said about my ethnic background, let’s just leave it at that. I unfollowed her on social media and blocked her number.

Amber reached out via an Instagram page I made for my jewelry casting. She wanted me to reforge her cuff links.

I wrote this DM declining her request. I wasn’t comfortable working with her anymore given what she said about my ethnic background.  Instead, I referred her to someone I know who can help. 

She got upset and reminded me of the offer. I know I offered it, but that was before our fallout. 

I still said no. Some of our mutual friends think I’m an asshole who should have just made the earrings. After all, an offer is an offer and I should be a better person.

I think I did what was right by me.

I've long, thin wavy voluminous hair and that's the only thing I'm vain about: no makeup, fancy clothes, nothing.

First, it was my therapist, as l've previously stated I had already trimmed my hair last month, (and I barely wanted it tbh) I said I didn't have the courage many times but she kept saying that it was only 10cm. She said that as the coordinator of the clinic herself, she was going to bring a hairdresser or she'd go with me to a salon.

Then at school, the social pressure from teachers, staff, classmates, everyone... Next week a hairdresser is coming to the school, I'm ugly and insecure, and the only thing I get compliments for is my hair, I'm not going to cut it despite the noble cause, I can help them in other ways. They're begging me and saying that l'm obligated to donate since it's not that much, but I don't want to. That I should donate in the name of everyone since it is so long.

A few days ago I saw his computer unlocked and he was on reddit and in the process of posting to a sub a fake story that came across as very sexist. I memorized the username and it was a throwaway with no posts until later posted it.

Later when he wasn't there and left his laptop unlocked I basically went and checked his browser history and it was full of links to the create post link on reddit and posts made by throwaway accounts which I assumed were his. A lot of them were on this sub but also others and basically they were either outrageous opinions or stories with sexism and racism. Stuff about women drivers, women in tech, immigrants etc. I exported the history to a flash drive.

I confronted him and he initially denied it and then realized he was caught and got mad at me for snooping.

I took away his laptop, iPhone and iPad and will be getting him an apple watch with a plan for emergencies.

1fmg8kx,"AITA for locking the pantry to stop my roommate from eating all my food?

","So, I (26F) live with two roommates, and one of them, “Jess” (28F), has a bad habit of eating other people's food. At first, it was small things like a handful of chips or a piece of fruit, and I didn’t really care. But lately, she’s been eating entire meals I’ve prepped for the week, snacks, basically everything. I’ve confronted her multiple times, and she always apologizes, saying she’ll replace it, but she never does.

I’ve asked her to just respect what’s mine, and she’ll agree, but the next day, something else goes missing. It’s driving me insane because groceries are expensive, and I don’t want to budget extra just to feed her.

I finally got fed up and bought a small lock for the pantry I use and started keeping my dry goods and snacks in there. I also cleared out a section of the fridge for my food and labeled everything that’s mine. Since I installed the lock, Jess has been super passive-aggressive, saying I’m “treating her like a child” and making the house feel uncomfortable. She even made a sarcastic comment in front of friends about me “putting everything under lock and key.”

Now, the other roommate, “Sara,” says she understands why I’m frustrated, but she thinks I took it too far by locking up my food and creating tension in the house. I honestly don’t think I’m in the wrong here, but now I’m second-guessing myself.

1fn56zw,AITA for continuing to change in front of my window even after my neighbor complained?,"I (early 30s F) bought a house last year with my fiancé, but we only just moved in a few months ago because it needed some work. Our neighbors are a woman, her husband, and their college-aged son. Everything was fine until a few weeks ago when the neighbor woman came over, visibly upset, and told me she saw me changing through my window and would appreciate if I didn’t do that there.

I was surprised because the angle of the window makes it so that someone would really have to go out of their way to see anything. I checked it out myself, and unless you’re standing in a very specific spot in their yard, you can’t see much at all.

To be clear, no one in her family (husband or son) has ever mentioned seeing me; she was just “worried” that they might. I didn’t feel like I should have to change my habits for her, especially since they’d have to be actively trying to look in. So I kept changing there, as I had been.

Well, she came over again last week, this time freaking out at my fiancé, calling me a “whore” and accusing me of being disrespectful. I honestly think it’s ridiculous because I’m in my own home and I’m not flaunting myself. her husband came over and apologized and said he asked her specifically not to do that, and clarified he hadn’t ever mentioned seeing me nor had his son.

1fnvdia,AITA for allowing my wife to pick my son's names and not letting my family call him a 'Westernised' nickname? ,"We live in England, wife is South Asian and I am white British (late 20S F and M). We have young boy twins, just under 2 years old. Names are important and we don't mind who sees this so we're using exact first names but not surname. 

I had no name preferences, am uninventive and have a boring 'British' name myself, think John James Jacob Smith (not really, but basically). With our kids, they both have my surname, 'Smith', and from day 1 I said I wanted her pick on first names and she chose lovely names from her culture that I fell in love with. 

So our boys are Ramin Navroz Smith and Rustom Parvez Smith, which means 'joyous new year' and 'victorious hero' in its Parsi origins. We liked that they were similar ish without being the same.

The boys will live in the UK so obviously we have no problem with either shortening their name or going by a nickname at school as long as its their choice. Plus it's not likely theyll do it for racialised reasons: we live in very diverse London. 

Problem: boys are not identical, and like many mixed race siblings, they look a bit different. They have similar features but Ramin has dark hair and eyes like his mum and Rustom has light hair and eyes like me. They're both ethnically ambiguous and very young if you're thinking in terms of ""white passing"" you would say Rustom will find it easier to ""pass"" while Ramin a bit harder. We don't micromanage our toddlers racial traits so haven't given much thought to it. 

Unfortunately, my family (except my parents) seem to have given this too much thought. 

SIL started it by repeatedly commenting that Ramin looked like a Ramin but Rustom didn't look like a Rustom and we were just ??? but let it go. Then she and my brother start calling him 'Russell' as a nickname, get extended fam to do it to the point he starts answering to it and people use the nickname in captions or texts. We said no multiple times! 

We put our foot DOWN and said only my parents could see either boy till they knock the Russell shit off. Cue flood of tears from SIL and blame from others, telling us it was just well meaning nicknaming, that her 3 yo daughter came up w it and that we're oversensitive.

I feel we're going insane as other than my parents, everyone seems on their side and saying we're draconian? We don't care if the boys want a nickname at any point but they're babies, and I just can't buy ""it has nothing to do with race"" when they're doing it to the blonde kid and not the ""darker"" one. I also can't buy that their child gave the name because of the above + WHAT 3 y/o comes up with ""Russell""??? 

Our line = we do not want this weird difference to exist between the boys before they even comprehend race. We think it's damaging longterm to give one boy a ""white name"" just because he's blonde, especially as the two do actually look different. 

But maybe we are too close to it and SO many people keep telling us it's harmless/we're overthinking? Help!

I have not hade a relationship with my father in 2 decades and have only seen or talked to him a handful of times in those 2 decades. The man is just an asshole and always has been. My brother doesn't talk to him or like him either.

1fnvo9o,AITA for calling out my stepsister for acting like a brat in public?,"(Obligatory throwaway I've been using because I don't want it to be tied back to my personal life.)

Here's some backstory: 

My dad(52M) met my now stepmom, Janet(47F) when I(17F) was 10. She also brought in my two younger stepsiblings, Mike(13M), and Lindsey(17F). If I'm being honest, I actually really like Janet and Mike. The only person who I never took a liking to was Lindsey, mainly because she's a brat and it's gotten to the point where I don't like being seen with her at all, especially in public. She will start throwing actual childlike tantrums and will start pouting and being extremely rude to my parents if:

- We don't go to a restaurant she wants to go to when the rest of us agree on another place. 

- We want to see a movie that she apparently hates, even if it literally JUST came out.

- We use the bathroom (there's two, she just prefers the SLIGHTLY bigger one) when she needs it, even though we ask her if she needs to go beforehand. 

My parents say to just let her ride it out and ignore it, but it's so EMBARRASSING to be seen with this 17-year-old girl who is crying and yelling just because we can't afford to go to Starbucks, or whatever it is she wants in that current moment. 

The situation: 

We went to Applebee's the other day because my parents took us to a local fair and they didn't want to spend a bunch of money on fair food (and anyone who has ever been to a fair knows how ridiculously expensive it is). We were already teetering on the edge to a meltdown with her, because of course she didn't want to go to Applebee's, but Janet calmed her down and told her she could get whatever she wanted, within reason. 

So, we sit down, everything is going well and then the waitress comes over and obviously, asks what we wanted. I asked for a cheeseburger with fries, because it was on the cheaper side, but Lindsey wanted this BIG steak and a bunch of sides. Janet tells her to get one side and a smaller steak, and I guess that sent her over the edge. 

She started being so incredibly rude to Janet, saying how her dad would let her have it, that she was told she could have whatever she wanted by Janet, even though Janet said to keep it cheaper. Lindsey just kept talking about how she WANTS a bigger steak, she WANTS more sides, all the while this poor waitress is standing there looking nervous. So, I cut her off and said, ""You're lucky you're getting anything at this point, because you're acting like a giant ungrateful brat and it's so fucking embarrassing.""

She just stopped and went quiet, and the first five minutes after were a little awkward, but the rest of the dinner was fine. When we got home, Lindsey just went straight to her room and slammed the door (as usual when she doesn't get her way) but my dad stopped me before I went to my room and told me that while he sees where I was coming from, it was a bit of an asshole move to embarrass her like that in front of the other customers and the waitress.

1fnyawx,AITA for crying when my entire family started to speak a language I barely know?,"So I'm a 14 year old guy and my parents are from Taiwan their native language is Mandarin. My older sister(19F) and older brother(17M) both speak it pretty much fluently. Well by the time I came around and was like old enough to actually learn stuff my family rarely spoke our native language. Due to that I barely speak it, my mom said I barely compare to a toddler in the language so she signed me up for online Mandarin lessons that I'm starting this week.


Today when I came home from school my sister was the only one home and greeted me in Mandarin and started speaking to me in it, I asked her why in English and she told me in English that our parents want everyone to speak more Mandarin around the house. I just started to have a lot of anxiety because of it and tonight at dinner everyone was speaking Mandarin and I can't really pick up on most of it, I understand enough to like kind of understand what's happening in the conversation but barely and sometimes I get lost. Then my brother turns to me and asked me a question in Mandarin and I just didn't understand a single word of it and I started to cry. I told my mom that she is bullying me for not knowing how to speak our native language and she even agreed that it's her fault and I don't get why she's doing this to me. My sister then said in English ""see i told you something like this would happen"" to my mom. My mom then got mad and said that learning this is important and she isn't going to let me crying about it stop her from making me learn it.",O0OwE3E,5759,0.8799999952316284,1250,1727133318,2024-09-23 18:15:18,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fnyawx/aita_for_crying_when_my_entire_family_started_to/,9,2024
1fnz6v1,AITA for not cleaning up after my bf messed up?,"Context: my bf of 2 years decided he wanted to cook tonight. As I had just been to the dentist and had a procedure done I told him that if he chose to cook it, he needed to know that I had no interest in participating and if that wasn’t ok we could take a meal from the freezer. 

He really wanted to and made Mac n cheese. This needed to go in the oven and he wanted to use a form that is very difficult to clean so I told him to use a backing sheet of some sort to make sure it didn’t stick too much. He chose not to. 

After he was finished and the form was burnt and lots of pieces stuck to it. He put it to soak and asked me before bed if I could clean it for him the morning after. 

I told him no. He then proceed to say “oh then I guess I’ll be doing it at 8am in the morning before work” I asked what he meant and he said that he found it ridiculous that I wouldn’t do it as I go to work later than him. I explained that I had previously tried to warn him about this issue and that I was trying to prevent it for him and that I didn’t find it fair that he was trying to make me feel bad for not fixing it for him now that it could’ve been avoided. 

He thinks I should feel bad, but I really don’t. I’m I the asshole? ",NeighborhoodShot4168,9124,0.9700000286102296,423,1727135898,2024-09-23 18:58:18,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fnz6v1/aita_for_not_cleaning_up_after_my_bf_messed_up/,9,2024
1fpfdyy,AITA for not making my fiance a “list” of things to do for our daughter? ,"I’ll try to keep this as short as possible I 24F and my fiance 25M had a rather large disagreement this morning. While I was brushing my teeth and using the bathroom my fiance placed our daughter to watch her show in her high chair and then just proceeded to watch tik toks for the next approx 10-15 minutes straight while my daughter waited. I finally came out and saw this and asked why he hadn’t made any breakfast for her yet… he proceeds to say “I was waiting to ask you what to make for her” (note: she is one and eats scrambled eggs on daycare days like today) I said that’s a lie you know what she eats by now. Anyways this comment sparked a disagreement between us because I vented about his lack of assistance in helping to get her or any of her belongings ready to go in the morning. His solution after getting frustrated with me was to tell me I need to “make him a list of what I would like him to do for her” and I refused as I said I don’t want to mother him as well and as her parent he should know what needs to be done (diaper changes, outfit, teeth brushing, daycare bottles cleaned and filled up, etc.) I tried explaining that as her mom no one ever gives me a “list” I simply look around or think about what needs to be done.

1fph3xl,AITA for playing a role that my girlfriend doesn’t approve? ,"I (30m) have been with my girifriend (29) for almost four years. From since before we started dating I've been a part of an acting group mainly performing small venue comedy theatre once a year.
We have practice every Tuesday and after every practice I call my girlfriend to tell her about what we practiced. 
Why do I do that? Well, that's because she says she doesn’t trust them and that she’s afraid to lose me. 
I’ve agreed to steer away from taking parts that had a kissing scene or anything physical. I even told our director that I won't take any parts that include kissing, even if it's just a peck.

For our upcoming show I'm playing an older gentleman who’s married, father of the bride (the play takes part at a
wedding). He’s a whimsical dude with an eye for someone other than his wife. I let my girifriend read the script, because I don't want her to be upset or sad when she comes to watch. In a scene my character meets a girl that he used to be in love with in his teens. He declares his love and tries to win her over, but she completely brushes him off. He says the words ""I love you""
as she storms away. 
That scene made my girlfriend fall apart crying, saying that she can't stand ""watching her own
boyfriend saying he loves another woman"". Even if it's in a non-romantic, comedic setting.

I get it when it comes to kissing, and I have no problem turning down parts that has kissing scenes in them.. But saying ""I love you"" to a woman 25-30 years older than me in a comedy play act can't be that bad can it?

I told her I don’t know what to do other than quitting, but I really don’t want to do that. 

Am I the asshole for not quitting so she can be happy?",Radiant-Race8475,943,0.9399999976158142,574,1727303128,2024-09-25 17:25:28,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fph3xl/aita_for_playing_a_role_that_my_girlfriend_doesnt/,9,2024

1fq97jt,AITA for leaving my brother passed out in a luxury hotel and going back to sleep?,"Last month, I (21M) went on a family trip with my parents and my brother (26M) to a pretty high-end all-inclusive hotel.

Before I dive into the story, you should know that while my brother and I get along really well, we have our moments of friction. The main issue is that he’s the kind of person who lives life to the absolute fullest – which sounds great, but he tends to overdo it. Think of Barney from *How I Met Your Mother*, but in real life. There have even been a few times where he’s called me at 4 a.m. because he has no way of getting home after changing the plans and drinking too much (there’s no Uber in our city, FYI). He usually apologizes later and repays me in some way, but honestly, I’ve started avoiding going out with him too often because of this.

Now, in a fancy hotel with unlimited drinks, it was almost impossible not to go out at night, so I went with him. Before we left our hotel room, I told him, “Hey, I’m just having a few drinks and heading back early.” He agreed. We enjoyed some live music, had a few drinks, and by midnight, when the music ended, I reminded him that the bars closed at 2 a.m. and suggested we grab one more drink before heading back. He said sure. But after that last drink, he decided he wanted to stay out longer. I reminded him that we had family plans the next day and it wouldn’t be fun being hungover, but he pretty much ignored me. So, I left him and went back to the room to sleep.

Fast forward to 4 a.m., and the hotel room phone rings. I wake up, notice his bed is empty, and answer. It’s the lobby telling me my brother is wasted, passed out, laying down in a hallway, and had thrown up all over himself. They asked if someone could come help him. Still half-asleep and pretty pissed, I just hung up the phone, disconnected it, and went back to bed.

When I woke up around 9 a.m., his bed was still empty, and I had a bunch of missed calls from my parents. I called my mom, and she started yelling at me, asking why I hadn’t helped my brother. Turns out, my brother eventually made it to my parents’ room around 6 a.m., helped by two hotel staff members. Apparently, he had also broken a glass door, and they were charging my parents’ card for it. To make matters worse, the staff had told my parents they’d called our room first, and someone (me) had answered, only to hang up.

When I went to my parents' room, they tore into me for not helping my brother. What surprised me the most wasn’t their anger – they didn’t know the full context – but the fact that they didn’t seem upset with my brother at all, even though he was the one who caused all the chaos. My parents and my brother ignored me for most of the day, and we never really talked about the incident again. Eventually, the tension faded, but I’m left wondering…

1fq9egy,AITA for disagreeing with my wife’s idea of her never learning how to cook? ,"My wife (24) and I (26 yr old female) are struggling in our marriage as she believes she does not need to help cook or prepare food or even help clean up after, besides dishes. 

She was raised in a family with no chores and they had a maid come clean the house. She has never learned to cook and can not boil water despite me walking her through it, she just loses patience. I love my wife and have taken time out of our evenings to show her how to cook and measure spices, for example. She lasts about 2 minutes before either walking away or throwing a tantrum that she doesn’t want to learn and I should be the only who in this house who has to know how to cook. 

The other night, I got home from work and was exhausted since it has been a busy week in healthcare. She complained she has not spent enough time with me these past few days, so I offered to have her cook with me so she can learn while also spending time together. I thought it would be cute to make a recipe together that we never ate before. She threw a fit and said she just wanted to just TV but eventually agreed to sit in the kitchen with me. About 10 minutes in, I asked her to wash a grill rack since she usually does the dishes when I cook. Surprise, she threw a tantrum. Eventually she did it because she was hungry and I was busy cooking 3 different parts of the dinner. A few minutes later I had to go outside to and grill some chicken and I asked if she could start putting some spices away so I would have less clean up. I think you know what happened next… 

She eventually stopped yelling and complaining and put some stuff away. I gave her her plate of food first to enjoy since I still had some cleaning up to do. I talked to some friends about it and they said if it was their significant other who never cooked they would eventually said they had to prepare their own meals if they would not help. 

I have mentioned in the past she should learn to cook on her own for numerous reasons but one being that she is a very picky eater so anything I do cook, I have to prepare differently and seperately. 

I am also the one who does the “handyman” duties as well as take care of all the bills and yardwork. I do have to give credit where credit is due and mention that she does the dishes and puts the laundry away. Am I the asshole for wanting her to learn how to cook and/or at least help in preparing the kitchen?

1fqa3lh,AITA for taking my girlfriend home from the hospital?,"I (19M), have been house-sitting for the week and one of my rules was not to have my girlfriend (21F) over to the house. She currently lives in a shelter. Last night, she was feeling very ill and ended up blacking out on the floor of the shelter. She was rushed to the emergency room via ambulance, and I'm the only contact for her since she has no family or friends. I showed up last night around 11pm, and she was discharged from the hospital around 5am after concluding she didn't need an overnight stay at the hospital. Her shelter doesn't allow anyone to enter under any circumstances after 7pm nor allow anyone to enter before 8am, so I opted to take her to the house where I could make sure she was getting proper care and treatment after a long night of sitting in a busy emergency room.

1fqalv2,WIBTA if I returned a handmade gift to the person who made it?,"I (32F)’m an indigenous artist in a tiny cabin with limited storage. I’ve spent years purging stuff and told my friends/family I won’t accept gifts other than food or plants bc of lack of space, and they understand.

6 months ago, I met a guy (42M) who hired me to teach him leather craft and local medicinal plants. I was excited to connect, but things felt off. One day, he said he was “wildly attracted” to me and questioned if our 10-yr age difference would affect our connection. I’m on the spectrum and struggle with social cues, especially romance. I was blindsided and told him I wasn’t interested in dating.

He later said he’s never felt this way about anyone before. I reiterated I had no romantic interest, but he kept pushing the idea of a connection. I denied his advances and avoided 1-on-1 activities that could be seen as romantic.

During one visit, he noticed a knife displayed on the wall. It’s a special piece made of damascus steel with a white-tail deer bone handle; a collaboration piece w/ another indigenous artist. The bone’s sentimental to me; I’ve rehabbed/raised (permitted) many white-tails here and cherish this connection. I told him I don’t collect knives, gave away others that weren’t family heirlooms, and kept this one bc of its significance.

Later, he asked what I wanted for my bday. I pleaded with him not to get me anything and reminded him of my food or plants rule. I specifically said, “I don’t want a knife.”

On my bday, he texted that he had something for me and would drop it off at the gate. I didn’t hear from him, and over a week later, I saw a knife in a leather sheath by the gate. It was clearly from him; I checked the cameras and confirmed he’d left it there.

He hasn’t mentioned it. I feel bad it sat out in the rain, but I’m also frustrated my boundaries were dismissed. The knife serves as a constant reminder of this disregard, and I have no safe place to store it.

1fr0uus,AITA for not babysitting my sister’s kids pretty much every day?,"
So, I (21M) am childfree and have been very clear about that my whole life. My sister (33F) has three kids (8M, 5F, and 2M), and while I love them, I don’t want to be responsible for taking care of them.

Recently, my sister has been asking me more and more to babysit so she and her husband can ""have some time to themselves."" At first, I said yes occasionally because I felt bad for her. But then she started asking all the time, like every weekend. I finally told her I’m not comfortable with how often she’s asking and I can’t keep saying yes.

Well, she blew up at me, saying things like “family helps family,” and that I’m selfish for not wanting to help out when she really needs it. I suggested she hire a sitter, but she said she can’t afford one and that since I don’t have kids, I should be more available to help her out.

Now my parents are involved, and they're saying I should just help her because I’m not doing anything important with my time (I work full time but apparently, it’s “different” (because I don’t have kids). I’m feeling a lot of pressure to cave in, but I really value my free time and feel like I shouldn't be guilted into taking care of kids I didn’t choose to have.

1frra6r,AITAH for giving gluten to my gluten free mother without telling her,"So my mother and I don't have a great relationship. I recently moved to a new place in a really nice area because I just got a really nice new  job. Suddenly my mom really wants to come and visit and see me. I do my best to make up excuses, but she pushes so hard that eventually I cave.
  
  
I've been cooking a lot since I got here because I have a nice big kitchen all to myself. Recently I started making latiao. I love it.
  
  
Well, my mom and dad got here yesterday afternoon/evening and settle in and we start talking about dinner. As usual, mom has to pick after looking at online menus for a couple hours to make sure they fit with her dietary requirements. She ends up picking a vegan restaurant that's accross town, but she's just *so tired* from the drive up she can't fathom getting back in the car. So dad and I agree to go pick it up while she rests.

Driving accross my new city is a long process (which I told her ahead of time), and it's a little over an hour later when we get home with the vegan/gluten free food she wanted (she's not vegan, but she is adamantly gluten free and has been for a few years now). We get inside and as I am opening the food in the kitchen I notice the pyrex snapware container of Latiao that was in my fridge is now empty in my sink. She even dumped out the sauce that I'd been soaking them in.
  
  
I asked her if she'd eaten something out of my fridge while we were gone and she said that yes she had eaten some chicken because she was getting light headed from hunger, but it was terrible and she was so ready for some 'real food'. Now this is where I might have been the asshole; instead of telling her what she had actually eaten, I just rolled my eyes and dished up the food for everyone and we ate. She continued to remark about how bad and oily the ""chicken"" was all night. 
  
  
I finally snapped when she brought it up again first thing this morning when I was picking them up from their hotel. My mom made a joke about not wanting me to cook them breakfast because she didn't want more oily chicken or something to that effect.
  
  
I finally said ""mom, that was homemade latiao, and I don't understand why you ate ALL of it if you hated it so much."" She asked me what latiao is and I explained that it's essentially 100% gluten. I watched as her face dropped, and sure enough within 30 minutes her stomach was ""killing her"" and she was having difficulty breathing and needed to go to the emergency room.
  
  
The whole time we were there she went on and on to the nurses and doctors about how I'd fed her gluten and not told her until it was too late for her to take her medicine and crying because now the whole trip was ruined. Mind you, this is the hospital WHERE I WORK. My dad essentially told me to go home and think about my actions and give my mother some space, and now I'm just sitting here alone in my cool new place feeling like a dick and super anxious about what work is going to be like next week.
  
  
So, AITA?

Now I called him out on maybe being to young for him to have really served but I also don't really know anything about it. But it just seems to unreal to me. He supposedly only was in combat training but didn't finish due to injuries. This is where his stories seem so un real, with him saving multiple fellow recruits from hurting themselves, to having canons shot off near his head which caused him a hearing injury, to a bomb exploding near him to the point it messed up his back, and stories of how they had to climb mountains carrying hundreds of pounds and sleep almost naked in -5 climate. Like I said I don't know much of what goes on in the army training but that seem so wild. I told my friend that it all just sounds like bull to me and she got extremely mad calling me a horrible person for looking down on a military man and how I was an AH. So I'm I just dumb and an AH?

For a bit more info we are in America and he just turned 21, he has seis he didn't finish combat training and was in the med cor.

And I suffer from depression and it came up in a conversation and he started talking about how he saved a fellow soldier who tried to hurt himself in training and how he still remembers all the blood. Also I've cought him in certain small lies trying to impress my friend, like being into the same sport teams yet not knowing the team colors, or how we love riding horses and he said he's rides all the time but couldn't get on the horse at my ranch. Or how he loves the same bands but can't name a song with out looking it up.

We want our big day to be a more formal, adult affair without the interruptions that can come with having kids around. I sent out the invitations, clearly stating that it’s a child-free event, and most people seemed fine with it—except for one of my closest friends (21F), who recently had a baby.

She called me and said she couldn’t attend if she couldn’t bring her baby, as she’s still breastfeeding and doesn’t have anyone she trusts to leave the baby with. I told her I understood her situation but that we’re sticking to our no-kids policy. She got really upset and said that I’m being unreasonable and putting her in a difficult position, especially since she’s made so much effort to support me throughout my relationship and wedding planning.

Now, some of our mutual friends are siding with her, saying I should make an exception for her since it’s such a unique situation. I feel bad, but I also feel like if I make an exception for her, others might expect the same, and it could turn into a chaotic situation on my wedding day.

1fu07e9,AITA for telling my sister that her ex was watching her while she was naked?,"My sister is temporarily living with my brother and his wife Alice. Alice's brother is my sister's ex and my brother's 'best' friend, we'll call him Lucifer for the sake of the post. Since Lucifer and my sister *technically* broke up 2 years ago my brother feels like it's okay to constantly invite him over for dinner. It makes my sister feel uncomfortable and hurt but because she's living with them she feels like she doesn't have a leg to stand on so she hasn't said anything to my brother or to Alice.

Yesterday I caught him watching my very naked sister like a complete perv. He was outside 'smoking' and Alice asked me to call him inside as dinner was about to be served when I caught him watching my sister who had no idea he could see her. I immediately called him out and told my brother but Lucifer just denied it and my brother believed his blatant lie. My brother asked me not to tell my sister as he thought it was just a misunderstanding but there was no way in hell I wasn't going to let her know her ex was perving on her.

I probably could've waited until after dinner but I told her as soon as she came downstairs. My sister started yelling at Lucifer and my brother kept defending him by making it seem like it was  my sister's fault for not closing the curtains. The thing that really pissed me and my sister off is that Lucifer mostly didn't say a thing but he looked so fucking smug. One thing he did say is that he had seen it all already so he didn't need to try to sneak a peak. My brother did tell him to shut up but he also didn't stop defending him to my sister.

My sister is going to leave my brother's house now even though she really can't afford to. My brother doesn't want her to go because she's 'fragile' so he even convinced Lucifer to apologise to her today somehow but my sister still doesn't want to stay with them anymore. My brother is blaming me for the entire situation because I supposedly twisted the situation to make Lucifer look worse than he is because I don't like him but I think his best friend should stop being a perv and my brother should have more sibling loyalty.

1fu2lm5,AITA for not paying for private school tuition for GF's special needs child?,"This is throwaway because everyone knows my main.

The conflict is between me (44M) and my girlfriend (34F). My GF and I have been together for 5 years, living together for 2 years. She has a son (12M) from a previous relationship. Her son has ASD. In my early 20s, I started a business with my best friend. It has done very well and I am comfortable financially. I was previously married, and when I got divorced, ex took more than her pound of flesh financially. So, when I got with my GF, I told her, her expenses where her expenses, my expenses were my expenses. And we would never get married. She agreed and understood.

My GF's son previously went to a local private school. This school provided lots of resources for kids with special needs. He thrived there. My best friend's kids go to the same school. They are not special needs, but the school is good overall regardless of that. My GF's son's tuition was paid for by his bio dad and GF's dad. 

Here is where I might be the AH. My best friend, a couple of years ago, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. He unfortunately died this past spring. I promised him I would look after his wife and kids. About a year ago, GF's ex (the bio dad) lost his job and can no longer contribute to tuition. GF's dad cannot cover it (bio dad paid like 85%). So, GF's son is in public school right now and struggling. Meanwhile, I am paying the tuition for best friend's kids based on my promise to him. GF approached me and asked if I would contribute something so her son could go back to the school. I refused. She called me an AH because I am helping a woman who I am not in a relationship with while refusing to give her the exact same help. I see her point, but we had an agreement when we got together.

1furzzy,AITA for refusing to cook a vegetarian Thanksgiving dinner?,"I feel like I’ve slipped into the twilight zone with this whole argument, so tell me what’s up, internet folks.

Background: I (31F) and my brother Mark (35M) do not get along. When he was a teen he saw a documentary on factory farming and decided to become a vegetarian. He got very, very annoying about it quickly, but my dad shut him down when he started trying to get the rest of us to be vegetarian with him.  Then he went to college, made a bunch of very strange friends, and went militantly vegan. It’s his entire personality. I stopped talking to him after he threw a fit about one of my birthday dinners being at a steakhouse and spammed my messages and SM with pictures of abused cows.

My parents have been trying to repair the situation and for a while, it did seem like Mark was getting better so I’ve been letting him back into contact gradually. Then he started dating Pam, who is some kind of vegan influencer. She is apparently moderately popular online, but I have no idea what she does exactly. I don’t know if Mark was trying to impress her or what, but last Thanksgiving he insisted that mom cook at least a vegetarian meal or they wouldn’t come on “ethical grounds”. My mom just wanted everyone to get along on her favorite holiday, so she agreed. It was not a fun meal.

This year, my parents have downsized for retirement and my mom is having health problems. I bought their house when they moved, so my mom asked me to host Thanksgiving so it would be like usual. I told everyone in the group chat so Mark and Pam could make travel arrangements and Pam immediately started gushing about all the vegan replacement recipes she could give me to replace the traditional ones.  I said to send me a main dish recipe they like and I would give it a shot, but I’m making the traditional meal otherwise and there should still be plenty of things they can eat.  Mark and Pam have been arguing about this with me for days and then Mark said that if I wouldn’t make a meat-free meal they wouldn’t come.  This upset my mom, who asked me to just make what she made last year to keep the peace, but I told her that Mark needs to get over himself and I’m not coddling him.  I’m having turkey on Thanksgiving.

My dad privately agrees with me, but Mark threatening to not come is upsetting my mom so much that he’s worried it will impact her health. There’s a not big, but also not zero chance that these might be some of the last family holidays we have with her. My mom thinks I’m putting turkey over my own family and I’m not so sure anymore.

AITA?

Edit: Whoa, this blew up.  So the answers to some common questions:

As I said, I’ve already offered to make sure there is a main dish and sides they can eat. Mark and Pam will not show up if anyone else eats meat at this meal. If any meat is served to anyone, they won’t come.

Doing multiple meals that day or across multiple days is a no go. I’m a newly minted critical care physician at an understaffed hospital during a major holiday week and I will have a limited window of time between shifts. I have time for one gathering and I would rather not waste it on a miserable one like last year.

Mark and Pam can’t host because they live in a van at present. I’m also not willing to have them in my kitchen for hours bitching about the meat in my fridge, the cookware and utensils, and whatever else they can find to complain about. The time it would take for them to come eat, socialize for a couple of hours, and leave is the maximum amount I’m willing to let them be in my home. Although it would admittedly be interesting to watch them try to host a family Thanksgiving out of a van.

It is very unlikely that my mom is going to die anytime soon.  It’s just a non-zero chance, she’s understandably worried about it, and is in the pessimism stage of grieving her health. She has a good prognosis and most people with her condition pull through and live for a long time afterward. If it is by some chance the last Thanksgiving, I don’t think a repeat of last year’s Thanksgiving would do her any good either as everyone left that table unsatisfied and unhappy.",Suspicious-Basil7882,6761,0.9399999976158142,2572,1727905530,2024-10-02 16:45:30,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1furzzy/aita_for_refusing_to_cook_a_vegetarian/,10,2024
1fut4w6,AITA for telling my friend it’s her fault she chose a deadbeat BD?,"Aita? I've been friends with ""Anna"" for over ten years, we're both 24. Last year she started dating this guy and immediately I could tell he was a bum. Hes 28 and lives in his parents basement, drinks and smokes everyday (literally), hasn't had a job since he was 19, plays video games and watches streams all day, has told her he only bathes every two to three weeks, and is very rude. I've been around him a few times and this is all very evident, he doesn't hide this information. I was shocked that my friend would even look his direction. She has her life together, has a stable job and lives alone. I questioned her on why she was settling for his bum ass and she said she loves him and sees his ""potential"" and that she supports his streamer dreams...


My sister has a deadbeat ex and they  are so similar. I know it's not my place, but before she was even pregnant I warned my friend to get on birth control and use condoms everytime she sleeps with him because he has every sign of being a deadbeat. He doesn't even take care of himself, there's not a single paternal bone in his body. Anyone who brags about not changing their clothes for weeks, pees in bottles, and does substances every day is not good dad material. And in my opinion if you're sleeping with someone especially in a red state like ours, you're consenting to them being the potential parent of your child. She told me I was insane and who thinks that way, and that she has no intentions of getting pregnant.


Well... she did. Just like I expected when she told him he told her to travel to get a termination and she refused. Then he blocked her everywhere. She was devastated during the pregancy saying she can't believe she's doing it alone and I bit my tongue considering her vulnerable state. Well the baby is nine months now and she still complains about how hard being a single mom is, that it's not okay for him to be a deadbeat and that she wishes she could have known he was a deadbeat before having a baby. Again I bite my tongue because I know she's struggling.


Recently she found out that he has a girlfriend and has been going OFF. She's messaging her on social media saying she's disgusting for being with a deadbeat. She asked me recently if I would be willing to confront this girl at her job as a barista with her. I said no. She got upset and said if I was a true friend I would. That's when I reached my boiling point. I told her that I WARNED her before she was even pregnant how big of a loser he is and that she has no place to judge anyone for dating him when she procreated with him and dated him too. She started crying and saying I'm an asshole because it's not her fault she has a deadbeat BD. I just rolled my eyes and said it kind of is.

1fwcqhh,AITA for telling my husband that I think his brother and wife are bad parents for trying to make us watch his kid 24/7 when we visit?,"
Whenever I’m visiting the in laws (~3-4 times per year), we stay at my brother in laws house because they have an extra bedroom (and also insist we stay with them). My brother in law and his wife expect near 24/7 babysitting because I’m not working during these trips. They leave my niece with me and start asking and telling me to do things like can I feed her, why doesn’t she read a book with me, and not to let her watch tv. They basically just disappear into their own worlds the whole day (one goes to work and the other works at home). 

I don’t mind helping out for a few hours here and there but being expected to just watch her the whole day during the whole vacation (if I don’t have plans outside of the house) seems excessive to me and I find myself growing very resentful. I honestly don’t understand what they do when I’m not around as they don’t have a babysitter normally. Whenever I express that I’m tired or try to get away for some rest, they end up commenting later on in a “joking” way how me and my husband should reconsider having kids in the future since we get tired so easily. Or that we should watch my niece for a longer period of time (I.e. weeks) before seriously considering a child. These comments rub me the wrong way and seem so inappropriate to me because obviously having a child is a lot of work, but just because I don’t want to watch their child 24/7 doesn’t mean they can say such rude things to me. 

I’ve complained to my husband a few times but he seems to think that this is all normal and that this level of expectation for babysitting is also totally normal and “part of the culture” (they are south Asian). However I’m not really sure if this is the case because the tried to have their other sibling (sister) who lives in the same city agree to scheduling babysitting their kid one to two weekends every month and they obviously refused leading to a small fight. 

Recently I got so annoyed at their behavior over the past few trips (especially leaving their child with me and my husband when we have been feeling unwell and sick), that I told my husband that I don’t like his brother and think that him and his wife are extremely self centered and demanding people who are bad parents because they are always trying to pawn their kid off on other people. This obviously started a big fight as my husband feels close to his brother.

Here’s where things get complicated. My older brother, “Jake” (31M), has always had a bit of a chaotic life. He’s a good guy, but he and his wife don’t really manage their money well. They’ve always been living paycheck to paycheck, and with the rising rent costs, they recently got evicted from their apartment. They have two kids, ages 4 and 6.

Jake asked me if they could stay with me temporarily until they figure things out. Now, I’m not heartless, but my apartment is a one-bedroom. I barely have enough space for myself, let alone for four other people, two of whom are little kids. Plus, I’ve never had kids around, so I don’t know the first thing about taking care of them or childproofing my place.

I offered to help them financially — I could contribute to a short-term rental for them or even let them stay in a hotel for a while. But Jake and his wife insist that staying with family would be easier and less stressful, especially for the kids.

The thing is, I’m not comfortable with the idea of having my peaceful space completely turned upside down. I don’t think it’s my responsibility to accommodate their poor planning, and it honestly feels unfair to me. But now my parents and other family members are calling me selfish and saying I’m putting my “fancy apartment” above family. They’ve been guilt-tripping me, saying things like, “Family helps family in times of need,” and “Think of your nieces!”

1fxtzjf,AITA for telling my friend I won't be inviting her out anymore?,"So my bf tells me im not the asshole but I feel like I may be. So I F23 have a friend I'll call Mary who's 22. She and I work together and became friends. Well this past Saturday, I invited her out with my friend group to go to a local amusement park that goes all out for Halloween 

Mary asks if she can bring her kids a 5 year old boy and an 18 month old girl. Everyone involved tells her it's really not a good idea as this park and it's haunted attractions are not geared towards children and we're planning on being there until it closes which is midnight.

She seems to accept this but asks repeatedly throughout the week leading up to Saturday and she is again told no. Well Saturday arrived and as you can guess, she brought her kids. Other people in our group asks her why and she just shrugged saying she thought the kids would have fun.

They didn't, her son got scared with in about 10 minutes of us getting into the park and began to cry begging to go home to which Mary tells him to calm down and he'll have fun eventually. We get in line for the first haunted house and her son again starts to cry saying he doesn't want to go into the house. Mary then asks myself if I'll stay and watch her son and daughter so she can go into the haunted house. 

I tell her no and that this is why we told her not to bring her kids. She gets upset and drags her very scared child through the haunted house. He had a melt down and had to be carried out. This repeats through every single haunted house we attempted to go through.

Around 11:30, my boyfriend pulls me aside and tells me that he can't take anymore of the screaming/crying and we try to break off to find a place to calm down, Mary sees this and leaves her son and daughter with us while she runs off to go on a ride. Her son gets scared by an actor chasing people with a chainsaw and has an epic melt down. I'm doing the best I can to console him but I am rapidly running out of patients. Finally his mom comes back and I all but shove her son back into her arms 

I tell Mary that my bf and I were leaving along with the rest of our group. She gets huffy but agreed. We leave the park and go to waffle House for dinner. At this point it's midnight and both kids are extremely tired and upset. They cry all through dinner and Mary did nothing to calm them down. Finally at the end of my rope, once we get out of the restaurant I lose my temper. I tell Mary that this is why she was told not to bring her kids to this event and that I will not be inviting her back out again if she can't follow the rules of the group. Mary got upset and has since blocked me and the other people who agreeded with me. No one in the group agreed with Mary but they all did say that I didn't need to say anything about it to her and I didn't need to tell her I wasn't inviting her out again.

1fxu5wr,AITA For Ruining A Child's Life?,"Today, I started talking to an American mother while in A&E; her child was interested in the artwork I have on my leather jacket as it's pretty colourful. The mother mentioned that her daughters name was ""Grain"" so I assumed for a while that she was another mother who wanted something ""special"" to call her child. I remarked that it was a unique name and that I'd never met anyone called Grain before.
She told me that she's named after her great-grandmother and that it's an Irish name. At this point, the alarm bells are ringing in my head because I've realised that the kid is called Gráinne (generally pronounced as Gro-nyuh, or there abouts.) 
I tried to be very tactful, and I was like, ""Irish has such an interesting alphabet. How is her name spelled? Irish names can be tricky."" 
The kid is called Gráinne. Not Grain. 
My partner, who has studied Ireland's political history as part of their dissertation and also the Irish diaspora and it's culture around their university city,  is stuck somewhere between stifling a laugh and dying of embarrassment on her behalf so I come up with, what I thought was a very positive reply.
I said ""an old-school name and a more modern pronunciation. I think that's a great way to pick names."" I would like to point out that I do not like the name Grain for a child, nor do I like the way the pronunciation was butchered, but I was trying to be tactful and positive. She asked what I meant, and I said ""well in Ireland, they typically pronounce it like ""gro-nyuh"".""
Her face went red and said that I shouldn't have said that the pronunciation was wrong in front of the kid because now she's going to grow up knowing that her name is wrong and feel bad about it. I apologised for causing offence and restated that it's a lovely name in both ways and a fantastic nod to her heritage. I said that I'm sure her great-grandmother would be thrilled to be honoured by her name being used. I was throwing out just about every positive reinforcement that I could think of, but, to be frank, she was pissed off. 
She told me that I ""ruined her daughter's self-esteem"" and that her ""life [was] ruined"" by me saying that ""her existence is wrong."" I didn't say that, by the way. I said that her name was pronounced atypically. Gráinne, for context, was around 2 years old and completely unbothered by the conversation until her mother got angry at me. She was just looking at the pictures on my jacket. The conversation was maybe five minutes long, but I managed to ruin this kid's life. 
Hindsight says I should have kept my mouth shut and waited for somebody else in this city to say something. 

So, AITA?

1fylhno,AITA for replacing my friend’s throw pillow with a thrifted identical version? ,"So my (24F) friend “Wendy” (23F) just got a new apartment. She’s the first of our friend group to get an apartment, so everyone is really excited and Wendy wants it to be the main place we all go to hang out. Wendy threw a party this past Friday, just a small get together with our friend group and some of Wendy’s cousins. 

After a few hours, we were all pretty drunk, including me. I accidentally spilled my wine on one of her throw pillows. I tried to wash it out, but no luck. Of course, I offered to replace the pillow and Wendy sent me the link to where she bought it. It was SEVENTY DOLLARS for a tiny little carrot pillow. I told her I would definitely replace it, but I would probably have to wait for a few weeks for my next check because that eats into my gas money. She seemed a little pissy and I felt bad.

Yesterday, my other friends wanted to go thrifting for their Halloween costumes. I already got mine, but wanted to tag along. I thought it was my lucky day because at one of the thrift stores was the exact pillow! Like the very same one with the tag from the store and everything. The thrift store was selling it for twelve dollars, so I got it because it was cheaper and now Wendy would be able to have her complete living room quicker than we thought.

Fast forward a couple hours and we all go over to Wendy’s to show her the Halloween haul and I present her with the pillow. First she was happy, but then she was like “How are you gonna get to work?” I explained that I found it at a thrift store and she threw it at me and acted all grossed out.

Now I’m confused because we all go thrifting all the time, including Wendy. But Wendy was like, “I don’t buy soft furnishings at the thrift store.” I offered to wash it and bring it back, but she said no and still demanded that I buy the one from the actual store. I said no, I would wash the thrifted pillow for her, but I’m not buying a pillow for seventy dollars. She said it was my fault for spilling wine in the first place and said I was “too clumsy to live.” Then I said for someone who wants to host parties, you’re being a big brat about a little spill. 

We left it at that, but I left a few minutes later because I could tell Wendy was really annoyed at me. Now the friend group is taking sides and one of my friend’s girlfriend told me that now there’s a group chat that doesn’t have me or Wendy in it called “The Pillow Crisis of 2024” where everyone is arguing who is in the right. 

I did wash the pillow and gave it to my friend to give it to Wendy, but apparently she refused to put it on her couch and it now resides in the floor pillow pile. So, AITA?

(tl;dr: I spilled wine on my friend’s very expensive throw pillow. I replaced it with the identical pillow from the thrift store at a lower price. My friend wasn’t happy and demanded that I buy it from the actual store. I refused and insults were thrown back and forth. AITA?)

1fzce77,AITA for refusing to apologize for something I never did?,"Using a throwaway account.

I graduated high school 15 years ago. We recently had our 15 year school reunion.

Anyway, during high school, there was this kid named Ivan. I didn't interact much with him, but he hated me. For the life of my I didn't understand why as I hardly ever talked with him. Until one day during our senior I learned that he hated me because he thought I was telling people he was gay. I never did and I asked why he thought I was telling people that.

He refused to elaborate and said someone told him I was telling people he was gay (he wasn't to the best of my knowledge). I told him I""m sorry he thinks that, but I never said that to anyone.

Come our high school reunion and he again confronts me for calling him gay. I once more say I never did. He accuses me of lying and demands I apologize. I refuse and he goes off saying I'm a bullying AH and that he's tired of people assuming he's gay because of me.

I again said I never said that, and to be honest, I don't care if someone is gay or not because I don't have a problem with it. He storms off saying it was a waste of time coming and he wishes he would have known ahead of time that I was there.

Maybe I should have apologized just to give him closure or something. It was probably a little childish, but I've had to apologize before for things I never did and I hated it but I don't know. Should have I apologized? And I don't want to give the impression I think there is anything worng with someone being gay or thinking someone might be gay because there isn't.

1fze66q,AITA for taking my dad’s socks out of the dryer?,"I, (17F) needed to do laundry today because I was almost out of clean clothes. In my family, everyone does their own laundry whenever they need; we don’t have a schedule or anything. 

I was home alone because my dad (48M) was at work, and would be for a couple more hours. Before I moved my clothes to the dryer, I noticed my dad’s socks were in the dryer still. They were clean and dry, he just always leaves them in there for days on end before putting them away or moving them. I needed to use the dryer obviously, so I moved the socks to his laundry basket approximately three inches away. My dad is VERY particular about his socks, so I made sure they all were out of the dryer before putting my clothes in. (Our dryer isn’t some vast abyss, so it wasn’t hard to verify they were all out)

When my dad got home, I found him frantic in the laundry room sorting through his socks. He starts yelling at me that he’s told me not to touch his socks, and now one’s missing, and they cost $25 a pair (They aren’t special medical socks or anything, he just really likes high quality socks. To each their own.) and this is all my fault. 

I calmly explained to him that I checked the dryer and I made sure they were all out before I put my clothes in. Then he says that I should have left my wet clothes in the washer until he got home and could move his socks himself. This sounded slightly insane to me. I ask if there’s a chance he forgot to put one in the machine, but no, of course he couldn’t have made a mistake, it had to be me. The sock is currently still missing, and he’s very angry at me.

I know his socks are really important to him, and it’s his house, and he’s told me before not to touch them, but I feel like it might be a little selfish to leave your clean, dry, socks in the dryer other people use for days and days after they’re done, but then get upset when other people need to move them to use the dryer.

I was back at my workplace, it's been just a couple of days, and grief is still quite fresh. I told one of my colleagues, and she has proceeded to tell other colleagues of mine, without my knowledge, so some of them have come in and talked to me, without me being able to approach each situation.

1g1nodm,AITA for pouring my boyfriend's raw milk down the drain because I found out it's dangerous?,"So I recently found out that my boyfriend has been buying and drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk. He grew up on a farm and apparently his family always drank it straight from the cow, and he's been doing the same ever since we moved in together.

At first I didn’t think much of it (being a vegan I never drank it myself) but I started doing some research after I saw the label on it literally says ""not for human consumption"". Apparently raw milk can carry harmful bacteria like salmonella, E. coli, and listeria. I freaked out when I read that, I don't want him to get sick or expose me to something dangerous.

So, when I saw a fresh bottle of raw milk in our fridge yesterday I panicked and poured the entire bottle down the drain. I thought it was the safest thing to do.

When my boyfriend got home he immediately noticed and was pissed. He said he spent a lot of money on that milk and that he’s been drinking it for years without a problem. He accused me of not trusting him and said I had no right to throw away something he enjoys just because I disagree with it. I tried explaining that I was just concerned for his health and ours, but he said I was being a ""control freak"". Now he's barely talking to me and I feel like there’s this huge distance between us.

1g30yhm,AITA for shaming my sister for being pregnant and refusing to help her at all with any expenses ?,"AITA? I (24F) have a twin sister ""Ashley"" and we've always been close. She started dating this guy a year ago ""Jared"" (32M). I never really liked him but my sister was head over heels in love with him and said she wanted to marry him. This summer I was at the grocery store when a woman with three kids came up to me in the aisle and asked if I was Ashley. I said no and was about to say we're twins when she cut me off and said ""Yes you are. You're dating my deadbeat baby daddy and want to stalk my pages leaving hate messages saying he chose you over us and to move on. How heartless are you""? I was like WTF I am NOT Ashley,I'm her twin sister ""Blaire"" and asked if she was talking about Jared.


She said yes, and showed me the screenshots of my sister DMing her saying Jared is now hers, he doesn't claim those kids, blah blah. I was very uncomfortable but I knew in my gut he was a weirdo. I was so shocked my sister would date a deadbeat and proudly knowing how our father being a deadbeat sent us both to therapy. I just walked away. A few days later I asked my sister and she denied it at first then admitted it saying she didn't tell me he has kids since I personally don't date men with kids and she didn't want me to judge her. I told her I was judging the fact that he's a DEADBEAT, not a father. We argued about it a lot and I've looked at her differently since. 


Anyways this week she invites me over and her and Jared tell me she's pregnant and are both so happy. I just sit there silently and kept eating. She asked why I was acting like a bitch and why aren't I happy to be an aunt and I said because of and gestures towards Jared. He got mad and said ""What's your problem with me"" and I said because you're a deadbeat. They both got quiet and he said ""That doesn't mean I'll be one for this kid""...  at that point I laughed and got up to leave. I'm in the hallway on the way to the elevator when my sister comes running behind me and keeps asking why I'm being so rude while she's sobbing. I told her thatshe should be ashamed to be pregnant by a guy that abandoned his other kids knowing that happened to us and that she's disgusting and a loser and he's gonna leave her like he did did his ex. 


She said I don't know the full story and she can't believe I would be not supportive in this time of her life and the baby has half my DNA too. I felt bad and said I would try to be there for her but she'll realize what a mistake she made then I left.

1g31bx3,AITA for refusing to pay double my own meal bill at a family event?,"We had a family meal out for my Nan's birthday yesterday. Family included:

Nan
Family A: Two parents with three adult children, ages 18,23,25.
Family B: Two parents with disabled, adult son.
Adult C
Family D: Two parents with two, school-aged children.
Me (30F)
This was arranged by my Family A 25F cousin, with meals pre-ordered from a fixed price menu. I chose a two-course meal plus soft drink. Everybody else (minus young children) had a three-course meal, two alcoholic drinks & a hot drink each.

(For the sake of maths, I've removed the service charge/tips from the bill)

The bill arrived, & I expected to pay for my meal & drink, plus ~£2.00 towards Nan's meal (each of us contributed, so Nan ate for free). My meal was £18.95, plus £2.50 drink, so I was expecting a bill ~£25.00. The three-course meal everybody else had was £22.95, & each person spent a similar figure on alcoholic & hot drinks, plus their own contribution to Nan's meal. My adult (18-25) cousins in Families A & B would be paid for by their parents.

My Family A 25F cousin said each adult owed £50.00, including division of school-aged children's meals amongst everybody. I checked my sums again - my bill was definitely £25.00 - but nobody mentioned that I'd consumed half of what everybody else had because they either wanted a cheaper bill or wanted to go home, so I reminded my cousin of my smaller meal & lack of alcoholic & hot drinks.

I left the room for five minutes, & chaos ensued. Everybody was shouting at everybody, & my Family D brother-in-law started yelling at me whilst my Family A aunt shouted at him 'She's not MY granddaughter, so why do I have to pay for her?!'. People then glared at me or avoided my eyes, & Family B aunt said 'You! Why can't you just muck in like everybody else?!' & when I said I can't afford to pay double what my actual bill was, she said 'Then why didn't you say that at the start? What do we do, not invite you to future events?!' My Family A 23M cousin paid the bill, & later messaged each person with what they owed him.

For reference, we have never split bills 'down the middle'. With different, individual family sizes involved including children with an age range of twenty years, it's not been fair to do so, so historically bills have been paid with each family paying their own way. Now, with the aforementioned children now being adults, this rule has shifted a couple of times to splitting a bill equally amongst all of the adults, with no thought towards anyone (usually me) who consumed less food & no alcohol. I challenged this once before, & my Family A aunt announced 'SHE (me) is paying [£10.00 for jacket potato & Coke], & EVERYBODY ELSE is paying [£35.00 for a two-course meal & two G&Ts]!', making everybody roll their eyes at me for being difficult/different/a tight arse, etc.

1g3sfh5,WIBTA if I told my best friend her wedding sounds like a nightmare?,"So my (27/f) best friend ""Claire"" (27/f) is getting married in February. I'm the maid of honor, which is making me feel like I'd be a super asshole for saying anything.

They're having a small wedding, about 50 people and they're having it at a family members property near a lake. Which is all great, no problems with that.

The nightmare part is the fact that this 50 person wedding is an ALL DAY event. They're having a rehearsal brunch at 10am instead of a rehearsal dinner. And then their ceremony is at 12:30pm. And then they have ""group activities"" scheduled from 2pm-7pm (they've listed cornhole as an example) finally, at 7pm, we eat dinner and the reception is supposed to last till 10:30pm. 

And finally, it's a completely dry wedding. And I had zero objection to the dry wedding until they sent me this agenda. I don't think I need alcohol to have fun. But to spend 12 hours in a nice dress and heels, running around with 50 people I either don't know or barely know (it's mainly family, I'm the only friend from our high school group invited, so I really only know her parents, I've met her fiancee twice), I think I'm going to need at least 2 glasses of wine. 

I feel like an asshole, because it is her day and I love her, but I really think this sounds like a disaster. If I'm just sounding snooty and stuck up, please tell me.

1g3twpx,AITA for declining to be a bridesmaid because of couple’s cultural? ,"I’m (27F) a mixed girl so I don’t understand the whole thing about Indian dowries. My friend from college was getting engaged and told me when she thought it was happening. She said she thought it was happening soon. They had been together for 3 years which was a long time for an engagement and she said relatives were starting to talk and making her feel like her bf was just screwing around with her and not serious about it.

Then she called me several times in a week which was a lot more often and seemed out of it. I asked her what was wrong and she cried on the phone and admitted the reason he had not proposed was because his parents back in India wanted a large dowry and her family in the US was refusing to pay it. She said her family has been in the US for 2 generations and no one has paid a dowry in that time but his parents are old fashioned and think if they don’t receive a dowry it will show there is something wrong with their family. I don’t understand their reasoning but I told her to break up if he won’t fight for them to be together. She said he won’t because he sees it as something to be discussed between their parents. I’m kind of shocked she still wants to marry this guy. His parents are in India, he is a grown ass man and he won’t marry his gf just because they want money. 

At the end of last year her parents agreed to pay a dowry because she begged them. She says it’s much lower than they asked and they are not happy but agreed. 

I got an invite for their wedding for Jan 2025 in California. I called her and told her I couldn’t attend and apologized. She was shocked and said I was one of the few friends she could invite and I said I couldn’t because I don’t think I should go to a wedding if I don’t think she is marrying a good person. She said she disagrees with the dowry practices but it wasn’t for me to judge if demanding it meant someone was a good person. I just said I disagree with the wedding happening because her parents had to effectively bribe someone to have it happen. She got mad and said I should RSVP no and hung up. I feel guilty because she clearly wanted me there but the whole thing is really gross to me. But AITA for judging cultural practices from a culture I’m not a part of?

My wife and i agreed to help my wife's sister with her two young kids. She moved into a big house, is a single mother. is a president of a company. before she moved, we would help out a lot anyways with the kids, over nights, take to sporting events, take to school, pick up from school, help with her dogs etc.

We rented out our home, and moved in to her house with our senior dogs start of the year, with the promise of her renovating the basement to a full functional house with everything we need. That never happened. We decided to tell her in July its best we move back home after a year as she was not able to fullfill her promise, and we need our own space and that was not going to happen clearly. She was silent and never said anything. refused to listen more to my wife who wanted to help with coordinating scheduled so she could still help with the kids after school.

Aug. 1st she just sent via text to move out that weekend, and would tell the kids we were just on vacation but she wanted us out of the house ASAP. It was devestating and a surprise. Especially how close we are to the kids. My wife made quick arrangements to stay at our close friends. IT was decided i would move 2 hours away with our dogs as i work from home and staying with my wife's mother was the best option while she stayed with our friends in town as it was down the street from her work.

I want nothing to do with her ever for what she did. She continues to gasslight us and say we never did anything in the house. we took care of everything, she only saw us in the evenings when she came home late when we were on the couch before we went to bed . we took care of the kids, the house (she is filthy person to cleain up after ) and said we didtn do anything at home, and doesnt know why we invited ourselves to live at her house!

We went back and forth a bit. She then went on this rant about how she never asked for help when her house flooded... as if that's at all comparable to my husband starting cancer treatment. I shouldn't have kept responding to her and should have just blocked her immediately, but I didn't, and at some point I asked her if she was still a therapist, which she claimed was a ""personal attack"". 

I told her to consider a different career path and to remove herself from our lives. She said I was an AH for responding that way to her ""sharing her concerns.""

1g61v0o,"AITA for refusing to let my neighbor cut down my tree because it ""blocks her view""?","I (34M) live in a quiet suburban neighborhood, and my house has a large oak tree in the front yard. It’s been there for decades, long before I moved in, and honestly, it’s one of the things I love about the property. It gives shade, keeps the yard cool in the summer, and just generally looks great.

Recently, my new neighbor (40sF) moved into the house across the street. She seems nice enough, but we don’t really talk much, just the occasional wave. A couple of weeks ago, she knocked on my door and asked if I’d consider cutting down my tree. I was confused and asked why, and she said it “blocks her view of the sunset.”

Now, I’ve lived here for years, and I’ve never had any complaints about the tree, from neighbors or otherwise. It’s perfectly healthy, and it’s not hanging over anyone’s property. Plus, I enjoy the view with the tree, and it’s part of the charm of my yard.

I politely told her that I wasn’t interested in removing the tree, especially for something like that. She got annoyed and said it’s a “reasonable request” because the tree “ruins” her evening view from her porch. I didn’t want to escalate things, so I just said I’d think about it and ended the conversation.

A few days later, she came back with pamphlets from a tree removal service and tried again, this time offering to pay for the removal. I declined again, saying that the tree’s important to me and I don’t want to get rid of it. She got visibly upset and said something like, “It’s just a tree, why are you being so difficult?”

Since then, she’s been giving me the cold shoulder, and I’ve heard from a couple of neighbors that she’s been telling people I’m being unreasonable. I honestly don’t think I am, but now I’m wondering if I’m missing something.

1g63rjm,AITA for “not following through” on the rent to own agreement I had with my brother?,"My (F33) brother (M39) is an outgoing, likable guy. 

But, sticking to things (whether it’s a job or a relationship) long-term isn’t his thing.

Last spring, my husband and I purchased acreage where we wanted to build our new home. The question came up as to what we would do with our current home. We decided to rent instead of immediately sell. My brother and his new, third wife made the pitch to move in and “rent to own.” The conversation started over dinner with my parents and, admittedly, we let my parents’ advocacy for my brother sway our decision. They realized this was the only chance my brother had to own something so they pushed.

At the time, my brother had a full-time job at a phone carrier and had also been given an AMAZING deal by his old boss to purchase the DJ company he worked nights for - the guy was moving, offered to sell the business for just the cost of the equipment financed out of his own pocket. Bro’s cell phone job had benefits, and the DJ company was a multimillion dollar business, so my husband and I made the mistake of hoping that this time my brother would take advantage of his perfect storm of opportunity.

We agreed to let him rent the house for the cost of our current mortgage (easily a thousand less per month than we could rent it for) and give him 18 months to build up his business and credit and purchase from us then. We agreed to take the total of his “rent“ as his down payment. We agreed any improvements/maintenance would come out of his budget, just as if he already owned the house, but we would give him credit toward the purchase price for anything he put into the place.

Starting at the second month he lived there, rent was late. Then he decided to scrap his full-time job because the DJ company made enough money - problem is, he quit paying his former boss the monthly payments, didn’t bother following up on existing accounts or generating new accounts, just showed up to the already booked gigs like he did when he was just an employee. A bunch of the equipment got ”stolen“ and he couldn’t replace it because he canceled the insurance to save money.  Bro and his wife did nothing to maintain the house, we were constantly getting calls for lawn care, tiny stuff broken, complaints that we took the mower and snow blower with us, on and on. His response to repeated requests for rent payment was to say we could just add it to what he would buy the house for later.

It’s been 18 months and bro has less income, worse credit, and has treated our house like crap. We told him we’re just going to forget about the missed payments, but he needs to move out and the purchase of the house is off the table. He’s pissed that we ”went back on our deal,” and my family is mad (although I suspect it’s just because they’re seeing his last opportunity go down the drain).

This has caused a major rift in the family so AITA for not giving this longer?

I have a good job and wanted a space where I could finally have peace and privacy. I’ve been enjoying having a place that’s just mine, and I turned the second bedroom into a home office.



Last week, one of my coworkers (32F), who I’m friendly with but not super close to, was evicted from her apartment. She came to me in a panic asking if she could move into my spare room “just for a couple of months” while she gets back on her feet. I felt for her situation, but I’ve been really enjoying my space and value my privacy. I explained that I’m not comfortable with someone else living with me and suggested she check out some short-term rentals or ask her family.



She got really upset and accused me of being selfish, especially since she knows I live alone with a whole empty room. She told some of our coworkers, and now a few of them are giving me side-eye and making comments about how I could “easily help” but just don’t want to.

1g6vjst,AITA for asking my parents to start paying rent if they want to keep living with me?,"I’m (19F) in kind of a weird situation. I recently inherited my late grandmother’s house. It’s not a mansion, but it’s a comfortable home in a decent neighborhood. Here’s the thing: my parents (50s) moved in with me shortly after, saying it was temporary because they were struggling financially after some bad investments.



At first, I was fine with it. I mean, they’re my parents, right? But it’s been over six months now, and they seem really comfortable here—too comfortable. They don’t seem to be looking for new jobs or places to live. I’ve been paying for all the utilities, groceries, and maintenance out of my own money, which I saved up while working part-time and from the small inheritance I received.



They keep making these small comments about how it’s “their home too” since I wouldn’t have the house without them and my grandmother. They even redecorated part of it without asking me! I tried bringing up the issue, suggesting they could contribute financially at least by paying rent or utilities, but they got upset. My mom said, “We’re family, we don’t charge each other,” and my dad said it’s selfish to ask them to pay when they’re struggling. But I’m also struggling with balancing work and school, and it’s not like they’re making an effort to move out or even lighten the financial burden.



I love them, but I feel like they’re taking advantage of the situation. I don’t want to evict my own parents, but this is my space and I feel like I have no control over my own home anymore.

1g7ki0p,AITA for not letting my sister move in with me when she and her kids were facing homelessness?,"
Here’s a little bit of back story

In 2022, my sister (22F) had asked if she, her boyfriend (23M) and her newborn (6mo F) could stay with us for 1-3 months (which turned into 11 months) until they had gotten their taxes so they could save up and move to another place.

my partner and I agreed (21F & 20M) because it was only going to be a few months and I didn’t want them to be potentially homeless, with an infant. I had only 3 actual rules. A.) Take care of the wood floors B.) Help out with rent when they can C.) No births. 

My sister stayed home with the baby mostly, while us 3 worked through the day. But soon, so we’re consistently piles of dishes, dirty diapers, food trash, and just things left around.  And they had also spent all their tax money and asked if they could stay longer. 

After a while, my sister was getting really comfortable with asking me to watch my niece. I would end up watching my niece almost every night/off day for 1-5 hours. It got to the point where my partner and I couldn’t really hang out. Them living with us was starting to have an affect on mine and my partners relationship at that point. 

She had gotten prescribed birth control. Shortly after, I started to notice a bunch of ovulation tests in our bathroom. 

Not long after that appointment She happily came up to me and showed me a positive pregnancy test. She tried to lie and say that she was too fertile for birth control to work.m and said that it was accident. But it was so hard to believe. So then I told them both, they had to leave before that baby was born. 

When they moved out, Her boyfriend literally said to me before they left “wow your house looks TRASHED!” And then left. Their bedroom floors were super sticky, random substance on the walls, and a shit ton of dirty dishes were left For me to clean up. 

Now, it’s been about a year and a half since they left. And currently, my partner is having some heart issues causing him to be out of work and will need surgery. So I’m riding solo to keep a roof over our head, bills paid, and food in the fridge. 

My sister called me in a panic. Saying that her and her two babies that are now toddlers are going to be homeless because she was  on a waitlist for a rental assistance apartment And that she had done everything she could, and her boyfriend had been having issues keeping a job because he has a felony. And she had asked if she and my niece and nephew could stay with me for a few weeks. 

But I told her, no. I couldn’t take on anymore responsibilities than what I already have. That I’m having difficulty keeping up with my own shit. I suggested if they could reach out to her boyfriends parents, and see if they could help in any way. They agreed to let them stay. I called to check up on them, no response (which is very very unusual for her) and I feel like she may be upset with me, I just frankly have so much going on that I couldn’t go through that again.

1g7lrzp,AITA for refusing to take down my IG photos of my ex and lie? ,My bf and I have been dating for about a year. We had already bought flight and organized everything with his parents but he said his parents are hesitating. He is suppose to bring me home to his parents for thanksgiving weekend but last weekend told me I should delete the photos of my ex. I asked which ex and he said “the black one”. The “black ex” and I dated in college and he was a Tanzanian who did his masters here. We broke up after a year because he decided to go back home but before that we climbed Kilimanjaro together. I have photos of us studying together and climbing Kilimanjaro together. That was years and my bf knows about it. I questioned why it was such a big deal and he admitted one of his mom’s friend’s daughters was snooping and saw it and told their mom who told their friend (his mom). I was shocked people actually do that and told him it was insane to do. He agreed but said now his parents are asking him if he is dating a girl who dated a black guy. he admitted his parents are pretty racist and wouldn’t like me if I admitted I dated a black guy. I have Asian parents too and I know that racism is common but to judge a girl for DATING a guy from a race they didn’t like is over the top even for traditional Asian parents. He wants me to take down the photos and if his parents asks to tell them that my ex and I were just friends. I pissed and told him I’m not hiding my ex like a dirty secret and I’m not bowing to them like that. He got mad and said I just have to do those things so they will approve of the relationship and not cause us trouble in the future. I know lying doesn’t cost me anything but it makes me so uncomfortable when they are so bigoted they would hate their son’s gf because she dated a black guy is crazy!

1g7lx26,AITA for moving across the country and splitting the five of us up (Quints)?,"I’m 1 (28 M) of 5 in a set of quintuplets.  In order it goes Aiden, Beth, Charlotte, Deanna and me Eric. It wasn’t horrible and our parents did in all honesty a great job with all us.  I think really the only problem we had was Aiden who was the first out and knew he was the first out had a pretty big ego and felt he was superior over the other four of us and tried to push us around. Our parents did what they could to keep him inline and for the most part the rest of us would ignore him

Three years ago my brother decided to marry his then girlfriend. Our family for the most part are pretty laid back. This is good because out of the five of us, I’m the gay one. Up to a certain point it was never really an issue.  Or so I thought.   His wife’s family complete opposite. Highly political (Conservative) and devote Catholic. Again to each their own and it wasn’t anything for us to talk to him about.  If she makes him happy then there isn’t anything we can do about it.  When they got married I wasn’t included in any part of it.  Her parents were paying for it and they had the final say and said they couldn’t allow a gay person in the wedding party or in the church. My brothers, sisters and parents say they fought to get me invited, but were shot down each time.  My sisters were part of the wedding party but none declined.  My dad offered to stay with me for the day and we would do something.  I told him it was okay and both parents needed to be at the wedding.  The day of the wedding a couple of friends took a day trip.  We had a great time but it still would have been nice to see Aiden get married.

Not long after the wedding I was on vacation and met someone.  Long distance as it maybe three years later we have been making it work.  We have been talking about one of moving and I told him I loved Seattle and that if anyone was going to move it was going to be me.

Last night mom and dad asked for all of us to come for dinner.  I didn’t say much at all and everyone was talking and I was just listening and on occasion say a yes or no or answer an easy question. My dad finally noticed and looked over and asked if I was okay.  I just told him I have a lot on my mind and he asked what’s going on “I’m moving to Seattle  The room went crazy.  I can’t say I was being attacked but it still felt like it with the way everyone was firing off all their questions and calling me an asshole for breaking the five of us up. Dinner ended shortly after and Dad and I went out to his barn and talked for a long time.  Weather he gave it to me or not I am going to move.  But he gave me his blessing and told me he would help however he could.

Today Deanna and Beth came over and started in right away.  They started blaming Will for splitting the five of us up and calling me an asshole for not taking the rest of us into consideration. I told them it’s not a big deal and at least one of us has the ambition to move on with their life.

In the middle of everything, there was a woman sitting on a bench with her dog. Whenever any dog or person got near she would yell at them to get away and she would yank her dog back. The dog kept trying to make friends and would stare longingly at the other dogs who were playing with each other and she would keep aggressively tugging him and scolding people. After a while I said ""You know there's kind of a big dog party going on. If you don't want your dog around people or dogs, perhaps this is not the right place for you."" She said ""I don't know what you want from me. I have a right to be here."" I wasn't questioning her rights, just her judgment. AITA?

Edit: It was an official park sponsored party. She would get angry when people and dogs were simply in the vicinity of her dog, not necessarily even interacting. Most of the time she wasn’t even paying attention, just scrolling on her phone.

Edit 2: A lot of people are saying “the dog might be aggressive” to justify her behavior. If that’s the case….why would you bring your dog to a dog party?!

My girlfriend and I have been together for about three years, and things have generally been great. However, a few weeks ago, her brother got arrested for a DUI. This isn't his first run-in with the law, and he's been in and out of trouble for years.

My girlfriend called me in a panic, asking if I could help bail him out. The bail amount was pretty steep, and she didn't have enough money to cover it. While I do have the funds, I have serious reservations about using my savings to bail out someone who clearly hasn't learned from their past mistakes. Plus, I work hard for my money and have my own financial goals and responsibilities.

I told her that I couldn't help this time, and she was really upset. She argued that family should always come first and that I was being selfish. I tried to explain my reasoning, but she wasn't having it. She ended up borrowing money from her parents to get him out, but now things are tense between us.

1galk15,AITA for canceling Thanksgiving dinner without telling my family first? ,"So I, (30s F) am a single mom and I currently live with my kids and my mom, who is also single. I always cook Holiday dinners, as my Mother can’t cook. This would have been our 3rd thanksgiving dinner. The issue isn’t her lack of cooking. The issue is that she invites guests without telling me until the last minute. And she doesn’t actually ask, because she will have already invited them and will tell me by posing it as a question. “Oh by the way, I invited your (insert random family member) to come for dinner. Is it ok?” Like lady, you already told them to, so of course if i say no it starts drama. She knows I dislike her family because they are all drama, including her since she entertains it. 

So this year I have decided to not cook Thanksgiving dinner. She asked me the other day what was on the menu for this year and I told her nothing and my reason why. She loudly says wow and then tried to guilt trip me by reminding me this would be our last year living together. She is retiring and bought a house back in her home country. I told her she will live 30 mins away driving distance. So she chill on the dramatics, and also my kids and I will not be made to feel uncomfortable in our own house.

1gamuu9,AITA for preventing my ex from getting 50/50 custody or our daughter?,"Ex and I separated a few months ago and in the beginning, we were in agreement that 50/50 was the best thing for our daughter. Then we went to the first mediation and I learned he expected me to be fully responsible for finding and paying for childcare on his weeks as well as my own. And if I couldn’t find childcare he expected me to pick her up in the morning before he went to work and bring her back to him when he got back to his apartment. I was not okay with that and said as much. We didn't get anywhere because he insisted all childcare-related tasks were my responsibility since I had always done them. 

After of mediation, he continued to argue with me and I told him that 50/50 custody means he is 100% responsible during his time with her and I am 100% responsible during my time. His counter-off was still 50/50 custody but she could stay with me most of the summer and he would see her everyother weekend but we still switch weeks during the school year. 

I again refused and told him “50/50 custody means 50/50 all year long not just when it's convenient for you.” That apparently got through to him and he's told me I can have primary physical custody and he will take her every other weekend and we split holidays during the school year when he can take vacation to stay with her instead of working. 

But now he’s told his family about our disagreement and they are texting and calling me because I'm stealing his child from him. They think I should continue to be responsible for all childcare all year long since he works so hard and needs the help. His mother was being particularly vocal about it and I asked her why doesn't she volunteer to pay for childcare for him. Her response was that it's too expensive and not her responsibility. Again I disagreed because im not her son's nanny. I told the rest of his family the same thing.

I was sure I was right until his sister who I've always thought of as level-headed also told me I was being unfair. Ex hasn't ever had to do any of those tasks and he shouldn't be expected to start doing them now after so many years. Am I the asshole for telling him he's reasonable for our daughter during his time with her which is now preventing him from having 50/50 custody?

Editing because I forgot to add: I have been exceptionally careful to keep our daughter out of earshot of any verbal conversations around this and I don't let her play with my phone she won't stumble across any of the text exchanges. She loves us both and I dont want to be one of those parents that involves the child in adult matters. 

Second edit because it was brought to my attention I didn't say why us both scheduling and paying for the childcare time we need is possible. Childcare is through her school all year long. We can each have an account and the days needed are selected and paid for a month in advance. It's not a set schedule until then days are paid for.

My girlfriend thinks it's weird to give the same perfume to both your sister and your girlfriend. I think that I got a gift that I knew each of them would like and enjoy, and that my thought process was that if they happened to be the same perfume, oh well.

1gaoypm,AITA for telling my husband I won’t be going to his birthday dinner since he asked if I would leave early anyway?,"For context, I will be 38 weeks pregnant on my husband’s birthday this year. 

The previous week, I reluctantly allowed his sister to pick my daughter up from school so she could spend the day with her and his parents (she does half days still). I say reluctantly because they have continuously crossed parental boundaries in the past, but that’s a different story. It had been a while, and she loves them and I truly want them to have a relationship, so I gave it another go. 

Anyway, my husband and I went to pick her up at his parents and while there, his sister asked what he was doing for his birthday coming up. I had asked him a number of times already what he wanted to do, had thrown out some ideas for us to do as a family as well, but he never decided on anything. So, he says he doesn’t have plans. She asked if he wanted her to make him dinner at her apartment then and he said yeah, that sounds good. It would be a family dinner: his parents, her partner, and our family. All good. 

Tonight, he said that we could drive separately because he doesn’t want to leave early. He asked me at dinner if I would leave early with our daughter so I could put her to bed. He wants to stay and drink and smoke and be up late. 

This majorly upset me because this whole pregnancy has not felt like a partnership what so ever. He only made one of my several ultrasounds (I’m over 35, so get a good amount of them), works almost every weekend voluntarily vs. making plans with my daughter and I, put off doing things I physically cannot do for the nursery until the third trimester I’ve been asking him to do since the first. I’ve also asked him to look into ways he can support me during birth and not a single google search has been made to that effect. 

I’m not sure if I’m being the crazy pregnant lady, but it certainly feels like he just wants to do whatever he wants without any regard to me carrying this child he told me desperately wanted (I was fine with one). Our birthdays are close, the baby’s due date is only two days after mine (so I’ll be 40 weeks for my birthday if  she doesn’t decide to arrive before then). 

So for my birthday, I don’t get to do anything but be pregnant and wait for baby. It would be nice to feel like he wants to spend these special occasions with me/my daughter and I. He clearly is not empathetic to the fact that I can’t go out and do these things for this period of time, so to be told to go home he can is hurtful. 

I told him that in that case, I don’t even want to be there and she (my daughter) and I aren’t going to dinner. Honestly, I would not be in a mood to celebrate and just get upset anyway. But it does constantly feel like as much as he claims to be a family guy, spending quality time with us doesn’t matter to him.

1gbge2n,AITA for getting up from the table when my mom said I had to share dinner with my sister? ,"For some context: my sister is eight years younger than me. I'm nineteen and she's eleven.

We have alwayd had quarries over personal space and items, specially food (bc little kids always want what you have even if they have their own) so I've always been kinda greedy regarding my stuff, as I don't ask anyone for anything and I don't like being asked for anything

So, last weekend my mom bought some sushi for dinner, and I got home late from work, hoping to have some leftovers of that for dinner. To my surprise, she said they didn't leave any for me cause ealier in the day, she had bought me some lunch, so I shouldn't be hungry by the time I arrived home. (I ate at 1pm. And left work at about 11pm. At night)

So today, she bought sushi again, cause I asked her to, since I felt annoyed they left me out last weekend

Long story short, she said I'd have to share it with my sister (even if she had some last time and didn't leave any for me) and got annoyed when I asked her if I really had to.

I got upset and said I wasn't hungry anymore.

So, am I the a-hole for that? It made me feel crappy either way, dude. ",ProofStuff6903,2562,0.9399999976158142,212,1729812206,2024-10-24 18:23:26,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gbge2n/aita_for_getting_up_from_the_table_when_my_mom/,10,2024
1gcvqwf,AITA because i refuse to drive my coworkers home without compensation?,"I (25M) have been offering/accepting requests from coworkers to give them a lift home whenever possible. I never asked for any compensation since it is only about a 15-20-minute detour.   
But, about a month ago, I finally had the opportunity to buy a new car. Beforehand, I had a 1999 Ford Fiesta; it was my first car, and I barely spent any money on gas.   
I don't have many financial responsibilities, so I chose to enjoy being a young man with a decent salary and bought a supercar. I LOVE my new car, and so do my coworkers, which means a lot more requests started coming my way for lifts home.   
I've worked at my current job for about 6 months, and I've probably done over 100 detours to make my coworkers happy.   
Here's the problem; not ONCE have I been offered any form of compensation from any of them, even though they would've had to pay for public transport, if I didn't offer them a lift.   
Now, my new car is quite a bit more expensive than my old one, which means it does not drive that far km/l (approx 12-13 km/l). 

Apparently, this is completely otherworldly for my coworkers. Today, I said no for the first time. I got asked if I could give them a lift, and I said: (sure, if you pay me the fee you would have to for public transport, I'll drive you home), and this did not sit well with them.   
I think I'm being as fair as possible, since I don't want to keep losing money by giving them a free service, that they don't seem to appreciate.   


So, AITA because I won't give free lifts to my coworkers anymore, since it's becoming a financial burden on me?

1gcwl1t,AITA for Telling My Wife Her Parents Will Die,"I (39 M) and my wife (36 F) have been together for 14 years and have what I consider a great marriage. We very rarely have arguments and in general have a pretty good life. 

My wife had a pretty good, middle class childhood, no major issues other than the typical stuff you experience as you grow up. Her parents were loving and did the best they could for her and her brother. There are no buried secrets or hidden abuses, I don't believe either my wife or her brother ever even got spanked.  Her parents are divorced but still on great terms with one another and with the family at large. They live about 1,200 miles away from us so we don't see them as often as I would like. Her parents have always been there for us and on more than a few occasions have helped us financially when we needed it. Honestly they are a somewhat boring Hallmark channel family and I cherish it. 

Shortly after getting married my father passed away and my mother passed about a year later. I was very close to both of them and the loss was terrible. I often think about every time I didn't pick up the phone to call them or would put off a visit because I'd ""do it next time"". 

My wife is really terrible about being in contact with her family, but especially her parents. She just... doesn't make an effort. I will often ask her if she has spoken to anyone and she just says ""I will later"" and then never does. Sometimes weeks go by and she won't reach out to them at all. Her mother made a comment once that she knows everyone is busy but she wished her children would reach out a little more. It drives me crazy that she just doesn't try- there is no reason. I could understand if they had been bad parents or had done something to her but that isn't the case. When I ask her why she won't do it she says she doesn't need to. 

I told her a few weeks ago that I encourage her to speak to her parents because I miss mine terribly and I really regret every missed opportunity. I just don't want her to have the same regrets. She said just doesn't feel that way and kinda moved on without saying much more. 

Her parents sent us some money to cover an unexpected medical bill and I thanked them but told my wife she really should reach out and at least say thank you. She said she would ""later"". I am embarrassed to say that I got angry and I said "" You know, they'll be dead some day and there won't be a later!"" She began crying and told me that I was cruel and should never have said something like that. I apologized to her profusely and again told her I just have my own baggage from my parents and it gets to me sometimes. I told her I just want her to use the chances she has now. She told me she will never be able to forgive me and that she will always ""think about how cruel"" I was to her. I know I messed up but I still don't understand why she can't just speak to her parents. AITA?

1gdospc,AITA For snapping at my dad that family therapy is a waste of time because my stepmom and her kids just point fingers and I’m already 18 and on my way out anyways?,"(Throwaway for obvious reasons)



My stepmom Sarah’s kids do not like me or my dad. But they’re moreso angry at Sarah because her and their dad aren’t together anymore. The issues are here because Sarah lied about the kind of person their dad actually was for most of their lives, so Sarah’s kids worship him and blame Sarah for the marriage not working.



We all go to family therapy. But the whole thing is a waste of time because Sarah and her kids just point fingers the whole time and aren’t receptive to anything the therapist says. My dad forces me to come too, saying I’m also part of the family. But I didn’t willing marry into this mess and I don’t want anything to do with it.



This week, I said I wanted to stay home because I had a lot of homework, including a huge presentation I had to rehearse for. My dad gave me the usual spiel about two hours of therapy a week not getting in the way of anything and it’s to make our family better.



I was stressed about the presentation and snapped at my dad that family therapy is a waste of time, Sarah and her kids just want to point fingers, and I don’t get why I have to be there because I’m 18 and on my way out anyway. I didn’t marry into this family and don’t want any part in their mess.



My dad originally grounded me and took away my electronics. Luckily, he gave me my electronics back the same night, but then lectured me about how he was disappointed, I could make time to help Sarah and the kids are struggling (you get the whole jazz.) I still think there’s no reason for me to be there, and me snapping at him was deserved.

1gf6i1t,AITA for refusing to invite my brother’s fiancée to my wedding because of her Instagram account?,"So, here’s the situation. My (28F) wedding is coming up in a few months, and I’ve been planning it for over a year with my fiancé, Jake (29M). Everything’s been going smoothly—except for one major issue with my brother’s (30M) fiancée, *Amber* (27F).

Amber has a large following on Instagram, where she posts very revealing photos of herself. She’s been into “fitness modeling” for a few years now, and while I have no issue with her career, I feel uncomfortable with some of the attention it brings. For example, at my engagement party, she showed up in a tight mini-dress and spent half the night live-streaming the event to her followers, some of whom were commenting… let’s just say *inappropriately*. I didn’t say anything then, but it made me feel awkward.

Jake and I have been envisioning a fairly private and family-oriented wedding. We don’t want anything about it going on social media, and we also don’t want Amber’s followers gawking at our wedding photos or seeing our special day as just another “shoot” for her profile. I spoke to her privately and asked if she’d agree to keep her phone away during the ceremony and reception. She brushed me off, saying, “It’s my brand. It’s who I am,” and she made no promises.

This has been weighing on me a lot, so I told my brother that if she can’t respect my request, I’d prefer she not attend. He exploded and accused me of judging her lifestyle and her career. He also said that if she can’t come, he might not come either, and now my whole family is furious with me. Jake supports me, but he’s worried it’ll cause permanent damage with my brother.

When I got home around 5:30pm, my older daughter had already made herself one box of Mac & Cheese. The plan for dinner was Mac & Cheese and hotdogs anyway, so I cooked a package of hotdogs and waited to see if I needed to cook more Mac & Cheese.

All of us ate, and there was half a hotdog and a couple of bites of Mac & Cheese left when we were done.

Before I could clean up my wife called to say she was on her way home. I told her that we just finished eating, and that the food was gone, and asked what she wanted to eat. She said she would cook something for herself when she got home. I asked if she was sure, and she said yes.

When she got home she was very upset with me because I didn't cook enough for everyone. I offered to cook more Mac & cheese and hotdogs, but she said no, and continued telling me that I was socially inept and that I didn't understand and I should have made more food. AITA?

1gg08k9,"AITA for not being friendly with my partners daughters now that they've ""warmed up"" to me","I'm (42) dating Tim (59), a widower. He's in banking, I'm a bartender. I know what it looks like. His 2 daughters thought the same thing, but he's broke as a joke and I've got a trust fund, so actually no.  
  
He's broke because his late wife got cancer. 3 times. He ran up 6 credit cards, 2^(nd) mortgage on the house, cashed out his retirement, everything and anything to get her the treatment she needed and then to get treatment enough to see both daughters married.  
  
His daughters live 6hrs drive away.  
  
We drove to them for Xmas last year and the year before. They ignored me, dragged Tim away when he tried to include me and prevented their husbands from making even small talk with me by talking over me.  
  
Year 1 Tim chastised them, they apologized (to him, not me) They blamed the pain of seeing their Dad with a woman who wasn't their Mum.  
Year 2, they did it again.  
  
This year I told Tim not again.  
He could go, I would never ask him not to see his daughters for Xmas but I'll stay here.  
  
Tim didn't love the idea because me going with him means we can share the responsibility of driving when his back starts to bother him. (He hates to fly)  
His 2010 deathtrap is starting to go anyway, so I leased him a comfy luxury ride (my brother has a dealership)  
  
He called the girls, super excited that he'd be able to see them more often without having to worry about his back,, who then blew up and accused him of spending their Mothers money on a “bull\*\*\*\* house and car to impress some bimbo bartender and didn't offer them a dime for their weddings”  
  
In the ensuing argument it came out that they assumed there had been a life insurance policy, nor did they have any idea about the credit card debt or the 2^(nd) mortgage that the house was underwater on or that Tim was looking at foreclosure and bankruptcy until he moved in with me.  
  
They did not realize it was my house, that he pays no bills save the water bill (man takes excessive showers) and shared groceries.  
  
Now the girls want my number. They are sorry I “felt lonely” at Xmas.

They want to come visit and stay with us next year! Conveniently in summer, I live near a beach.  
  
I've told Tim absolutely not about giving out my number. I'm happy to be polite if they come to visit Tim but, we're not going to be friends. If they had talked to me for even 2 seconds they'd have understood. I am not shy about admitting the only thing I have ever contributed to my blessed financial state is “not developing a crippling coke addiction” like my cousin Danny did.

  
Tim thinks I'm being too unforgiving. They would have warmed up to me eventually but knowing how generous I am being with their Father has made them warm up quicker.

1ggrg1s,AITA for buying my own dinner because I don't like what the in-laws order? ,"I'd like to preface by saying that I am not a picky person. I don't just...turn down food. I'm always willing to try new things, even if they're weird or unconventional. One of my favorite things to do is to pick out something I've never tried in the grocery store.   
  
But my in-laws are hooked on this one take 'n bake pizza joint that I just cannot stand. I've tried to like it. I've ordered so many different things off of their menu. I just. Don't. Like it. They order it for every single family event. Every get together. Every holiday. Every birthday. 

I started ordering my own meals to bring to the parties. They got upset when they realized what I was doing. I explained that I LIKE ordering my own food, because it's a chance to get a treat for myself that I don't normally order. Still, they're always trying to convince my partner to get me to change my mind and just eat the same pizza as everyone else. 

This Halloween, we'd all planned to get together for a Halloween party. My partner and I had actually planned out a fun homemade meal (pasta bar) for everyone, but MIL became VERY upset that we weren't getting pizza. She put her foot down so hard that we thought there'd be an actual honest to God fight about it, so we told her she could order the take 'n bake she wanted. 

And of course, I was going to run to the store and get my own favorite pizza. She became SO angry. She insisted that I eat what she ordered, what everyone else was eating, and even offered to buy me ANYTHING that sounded good off the menu. I told her again that I don't like anything on the menu and that I'm perfectly willing to go and buy something that I do enjoy instead. 

She's still angry with me. FIL is angry with me. They tried again and again to convince me (they always do) to get something off the take 'n bake menu.

1gjquni,AITA for telling a wheelchair bound lady her service dogs should not be at the playground.  ,"Throwaway, People are making me feel like i'm nuts here, and I can't believe this is real.  

Last friday my Wife and I took our 2 kids under 3 to the playground in our neighborhood park.  This was a rare Friday where there were no commitments as we usually take them first thing in the morning.    

As we approached we noticed there were probably a dozen kids there and 2 large labs running in the grassy area unleashed.  My wife and I are like the dogs shouldn't be there unleashed but our little guy was excited to be at the playground.  So we continued.  We let our boy run around and the younger one we put in the swing.  Some parents that were there started talking to us.  They are essentially one big neighborhood parent group and meet up weekly.  I didn't know anyone in this group.  

My son climbed a structure and went down a slide.  Once he was off the slide there were no kids on that structure.  A lady that had the 2 dogs there (I still don't know if she was a parent), let the dogs onto the playground structure and let them go down the slide. 

I spoke up to this lady and told her to keep her dogs off the equipment.  She told me they were her service dogs.  I said, i don't think service dogs play on playground equipment.  She snaps back to me service dogs are allowed to take breaks. She continues saying that we are here every week and no one has ever complained.  I say that not everyone is comfortable around dogs and tell her I think its selfish to let your dogs on the equipment especially when children are around.   

Some parents support her and said as much to my wife and I.    She told me that I should make sure my kids are comfortable around dogs before bringing them around dogs.   I told this lady that she was insane and completely missed my point.  My wife and I left after this.  We noticed a facebook post about us (that we have not engaged) and it seems its 50/50 on if we are the assholes.  ",Elegant-Climate-6953,2974,0.8799999952316284,1232,1730758292,2024-11-04 16:11:32,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gjquni/aita_for_telling_a_wheelchair_bound_lady_her/,11,2024

1gkkfvc,AITA for my girlfriend not getting into the school she wanted?,"My girlfriend is a non-traditional college student. She completed her associate's last spring with a very high GPA and meant to apply to some prestigious schools. Whenever she started working on her applications, though, she would panic and shut down. She ended up missing all of her deadlines; she did complete her application for one Ivy League school, but didn't submit it at the last moment, saying it was embarrassing and that she had no place there.

I didn't know what to do in these moments, to be honest, but I am sure what I did wasn't right. She would really shut down and pull into herself, going into a thousand yard stare or breaking down in tears. I tried consoling her, but I can't remember a time it worked. I read over her application essays and made suggestions, but she would get defensive and reject them. I'm a pretty bad writer and she's a very good one, so that was likely the right call.

Now she's at a local public university and in tears every day because she finds it isn't the right fit. She blames me and tells me I didn't help enough, that she never felt supported through the process. I asked how I could have helped, and she called me an asshole, saying she didn't know ""how to explain how to help people."" She says she doesn't know if she can forgive me for this.

I am willing to accept I'm the asshole and I'm what's holding her back, but I legitimately don't know what I should have done. How does one help an adult shutting down? What was I supposed to do in this situation?

1gl98v5,AITA For Telling My BIL that If His Wife Will Not Want to Have a Relationship With Me then I Will not Have My Children to Have a Relationship with Her.,"Background where everybody is coming from.

I am married to my BIL’s brother. My BIL’s wife went NC with the family a couple years ago. We did not realize it until my other SIL found out that she had her blocked on social media. That’s when everything unfolded that she had done it to all of us. She also blocked our phone numbers. When we asked my BIL about it, my BIL said there were too many dramas going on in the family that SIL does not want to be part of or involved with and that we are toxic, we are too much for her and that SIL is too busy to spend her free time being around our “energy”. 

SIL also did not appreciate the family jokes, BIL did not give an example but what stuck with me was my MIL told my BIL at their housewarming party when his friend arrived “why my BIL did not marry his best friend instead of his wife?” in front of my SIL, which she was only joking because the friend arrived in a nice car. I also did not like the joke, but my SIL did not say anything.

I admit that some members of our family would stir up drama here and there but at the end of the day we are still family. We do not see eye to eye, but we are still family.

So, this happened last weekend. One of my husband’s cousins got married where my BIL and his wife were in attendance. My BIL sent a group text that his wife will be there in support of their cousin and his wife (SIL is a good friend of the bride). BIL said that SIL would not want to discuss the issues, that it was not our day, and asked to give SIL the space.

The entire wedding she talked and laughed with the extended family and friend, she played with my children and my other SIL’s children but ignored us. She did not even look at us nor acknowledged us. She even turned her back on my husband when he tried to approach her. We are all hurt from her actions because to this date we do not know what we did that was so bad that we deserve the treatment.

So, I finally had it and told my BIL that if his wife would not want to have a relationship with us, then she is not allowed to have a relationship with my children.

I heard on the background her saying, “that’s low and manipulative but she is the parent so, okay. Don’t worry “name of their child” can still have a relationship with them if they want to. Your family is exhausting, please deal with it”

My BIL told me I am manipulative for pulling this BS but respect my decision then hang up. I tried texting him my reasons, but he was not responding.

1glbyny,AITA for disinviintg my daughter to Thanksgiving when she won't host Thanksgiving?,"Throwaway 

In our family, holidays are rotated, so one person hosts the Fourth of July, another hosts Christmas, and another hosts Thanksgiving etc.. This way, no one is constantly hosting, and it makes it fair for everyone. This post is about my middle daughter, Clara. Clara has always been skipping her host duties, when it gets to her she has an excuse why she can't host. It ranges but usually goes along the lines of stress or she is too busy. 

This results in other family members to pick up her holiday. It is frustrating and multiple people have talked to her about this. She bailed on hosting Easter but promised me that she would do Thanksgiving we swapped holidays. At the time I made it very clear she needed to stay true to her word and if she dumped it on someone else she wouldn't be going to Thanksgiving. It usually gets dumped on me.

Anyway, I called her asking if she wanted me to bring a dessert board for Thanksgiving. She told me that she could not host because she had just moved into her home (she moved in July), and it was too messy to host. I told her she could clean since it was a few weeks away. She told me she can't. 

I know the other kids can't host it, (well one could but she is doing Christmas and its not fair at all for her). I informed everyone it would beat my place this year. I also informed everyone that Clara is not invited this year to Thanksgiving.

Clara was pissed when I told her that and we got into a huge argument. She thinks I am a big jerk. My other kids are split, two of them are happy since they are tired of picking up her slack when this happens while others things this is too far.

1glcer9,AITA for not waking up my roommate on the day of his final med school exam?,"
I (23M) and my roommate Justin (23M) are med students. We've been living together as roommates for two years, and  we live in a hostel. 

Last week were our final year exams, and it was absolute hell. We were surviving on 2-3 hours of sleep daily, fueled by coffee and energy drinks (I know it’s not healthy but there’s no other way to pass lol). 

On the last day of exams, Justin was unusually exhausted. Around 1 am, he decided to sleep and told me to wake him up at 3 am. I agreed.

However, by 2:30 am, I was dead. My brain was shutting down, my notes were getting blurry and I knew if I stayed up any longer, I'd pass out. I decided to wake Justin up early.

I woke Justin up at 2:30 am and told him the time and suggested he set an alarm so he wouldn't oversleep. Justin sat upright, rubbed his eyes, and nodded and said ‘alright’. 

I was like ‘don’t forget to set the alarm’ and then almost instantly fell asleep.

We both woke up at 8 AM. (I had set my alarm for 6 but I kept hitting snooze). Justin freaked out, accusing me of not waking him up as promised. 

I reminded him that I did wake him up at 2:30 AM and suggested he set an alarm. Justin said that he was too sleepy to comprehend what’s happening and insisted that I should have stayed awake to wake him at 3 AM or at least made sure he was fully awake before sleeping. 

Justin's exam didn't go well, and now he's blaming me.

I understand his frustration, but I think he's being unfair.

1gm15c5,AITA for not explaining to my ex-wife for the umpteenth time that the property taxes are paid out of escrow?,"Throwaway- 

My ex-wife and I have been divorced for three years, and the split has been far from amicable. Per our court agreement, she lives in a house I own (in my name) but is responsible for paying the mortgage, property taxes, and insurance. Importantly, property taxes and insurance are paid out of escrow, something we established during our marriage and have discussed several times since the divorce, plus a decade of similarly related items and context that can’t be conveyed in a single post.

Despite this, she recently emailed me asking if she could open mail addressed to me regarding the property taxes so she could figure out how to pay them. Historically, whenever I’ve gone out of my way to help her with issues related to the agreement, she tends to lean on me more instead of taking responsibility. But when I’ve needed help or clarification, her typical response is to simply refer to the court order.

I drafted the following response to her email:

“Thank you for the email regarding the property tax bill. 

Since this responsibility falls under your obligations, I trust the property taxes will be handled as stipulated in the agreement. If you need further assistance or clarification, please refer to the Agreement or your attorney. 

If you are dissatisfied with the agreement’s language and/or terms, I’m open to negotiating modifications via mediation.

I do not authorize the opening of any mail addressed to me.”

I don’t want to play the same broken record and feel it’s important to hold firm boundaries so she takes full responsibility for what’s been agreed.

But AITA for not reiterating, yet again, that the property taxes are paid out of escrow?",EffectiveReal5134,1644,0.959999978542328,188,1731013614,2024-11-07 15:06:54,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gm15c5/aita_for_not_explaining_to_my_exwife_for_the/,11,2024
1gm4dav,AITA for calling my mom “unreliable”.,"I’m 16 years old and I needed a foam mat for a science project. The only problem is these are not near or house and at a store 30 minutes away. I don’t got a license so I told my mom before I went to school to buy it for me. Just to make sure she did, I even sent her messages during school to get it which she agreed to. When I got home (Tuesday), I discovered that she completely forgot about it and said that she was too tired to drive to the store right now. I was slightly nervous because the project is due Friday but it wasn’t too big of a deal because I was sure I could do it in that time. So, I told her to buy it tomorrow (Wednesday) and sent her a message during school again to buy it. When I got home, she was chatting with friends she invited over. So I reminded her if she got it and her reply was no, so I asked if we could go right now but she said no because her friends are here. At this point, I was irritated but didn’t push it and just made her promise she’d get it tomorrow. Eventually, her friends did leave around 7 but i was already deep into my homework by then and didn’t get to bed until 11. So today rolls around, and I told her she must absolutely get it now as the project is due tomorrow. She confirms and says she got it but when I got home, she didn’t have the dang thing. I was irritated at this point and just remarked that even with all my reminders that she still proves to be unreliable. She got mad and started screaming at me calling me ungrateful and critical of her mistakes. So now I’m in the car with my friend going to that store because my mom refused to take me after I said that to her.

1gmu6xo,"AITA for not reacting properly to my friend group's ""Suprise AirBnB"" booking?","**\[Context\]** every year our friend group hosts a Secret Santa event. A major part of this tradition involves booking an Airbnb where most of us (around 12 people) plan to stay, though not everyone ends up sleeping there. Typically, we spend a few hours on Discord searching for Airbnbs that meet our criteria—location, capacity, budget, etc.—and bookmarking options for further review.

This year, our entire friend group followed the usual process, spending hours searching through listings and bookmarking potential choices to revisit later. Then, about two weeks ago, half of the group (let’s call them Group B) suddenly stopped communicating with us (Group A) and went completely silent on Discord for an entire week. This abrupt change left Group A confused, prompting us to ask questions about what was going on and why Group B had stopped communicating with us.

Suddenly, a few days later, Group B’s main planner—the person who typically leads our event coordination—announced that he had booked a “surprise” Airbnb that was within budget and located in a great area. While Group A appreciated the effort, we requested more details, wanting at least some basic information about the place. However, the planner refused to provide any specifics, repeatedly responding with ""trust me"" and informing us that each participant would need to contribute $60 (more details on that later).

As days passed, Group A grew increasingly confused and uneasy about this Airbnb, which we were expected to help pay for, without any assurance or photos of what we were actually funding. Then, a friend close to some members of Group B (we’ll call him “J”) let us know that the planner had recently purchased a house where everyone in Group B would be moving in. While we recognized this as an impressive feat for Group B, we were still confused by their continued insistence on presenting it as an Airbnb that we needed to contribute 60$/person toward.

With this information, Group A tried to get confirmation from Group B, but they wouldn't budge, even as the Secret Santa event came closer. J also told us that part of the so-called “surprise” was that we wouldn’t actually need to pay anything, since the planner owned the house.

Finally, last night, Group B revealed the truth: they had moved into a newly acquired house, and it would be the location for our Secret Santa event. Group A wasn’t thrilled about the week of lies and secrecy over something we had initially believed was an Airbnb we were expected to fund.

Group B is not happy with us, claiming that we acted essentially like babies for not being more supportive of their actions in getting this house for our event.

I currently rent from my sister a studio apartment. My sister (F 26) has been talking about wanting to move w her boyfriend once his lease is done by next year. Her boyfriend lives an hour away. She offered to take me with her and let me rent again, but I’d be an hour from work if I went, and the traffic is bad there so it would be even longer. We applied for the application, got the lease last night, so we told my sister last night. She gets mad at us and says we lied to her about looking to move. I never lied to her and informed her that if there was a house that had the space I want, I’d pick that over moving with her and told her I was looking at houses in the area with my friend. She’s claiming we screwed her over and are leaving her with the responsibility of taking care of bills she can’t afford. 

She makes a lot more than me which is why this house with more room makes more sense. I’d be paying less for more then I have now. She is now is being passive aggressive and giving us silent treatment because she feels we did her wrong.

3 of my kids live with me ages 22,26, and 32. My grandson(2yo) also lives with me. My oldest son (30) and his wife(28) visited last weekend and my DIL pulled me aside and made a comment that she’s “worried” about my kids and I because “things don’t seem to be changing” as far as my other kids moving out, or getting a higher education/careers. Also when i asked why they’ve been lessening visits, she answered “where will we sleep? the couch?” 
My DIL has been around for 8 years and we’ve always had a good relationship, but her question and comment came off very judgmental. I get it, she’s a nurse. She also encouraged my son to go to IT school, while the rest of my kids and I all live at home working normal jobs staying a float. I guess the fact that my adult kids have never moved out “concerns” her and my son mentioned she’s been feeling these things ever since they’ve started trying for a baby. I don’t understand that. 

To her comment, I told her “maybe you married into the wrong family then” and continued my night. My son told me I really hurt her feelings, but she also really hurt mine.

1gnl02d,AITA For Telling My Mum I Won't Be Giving My Son Her Last Name,"Hi reddit, I'm a 21F who's expecting my first child with my partner of almost 8 years (20M). Our son is due in less than 2 months. For this story to make sense, it requires some backstory.

My father isn't in the picture, so my immediate family is me, my mother and my twin. About 3 years ago my maternal grandmother died. I didn't have a relationship with her and neither did my mum due to them always fighting. My grandma was quite wealthy and when she passed away she left me and my twin half a million total in a trust that we couldn't access until we were 25. She left my mother nothing.

My mother got a lawyer and got money released early from that trust  with the condition that me and my twin gave her half of our inheritance each. If we hadn't agreed to give her anything, she would of gotten NOTHING. Our mum then convinced us to put all the money into a trust of her own for our family exclusively for education and housing, saying it would build stability for future generations. I used this money to get a house that me and my partner currently live in.

Since my mum found out I was pregnant, she's been very pushy that we use her last name (which is currently my last name). It's a traditional Scottish name with a capital letter in the middle and a lot of use of the letters 'M' and 'N'. I dont like this last name, its hard to pronounce from just reading. I also fully intend to take my partners last name in the future. 

Three months ago I told her we wouldn't be using her last name and would be using just my partners last name. This set her off, calling me petty and ungrateful. I apologised for upsetting her and asked if we could have a conversation about it so I could understand why it upset her. I expressed that I love her and I don't want her to be upset. She refused, saying it was my child and I could do what I wanted. I assumed she had come to terms with it and moved on.

Fast forward to last week. I got a text from my mum saying the following:
""By the way, I've made changes to the trust. [Her last name] needs to be your child's surname if you want him to benefit from the trust. I haven't worked this hard for the future to support a [partners last name]. Thats just the way it is. My last name or bust. I'd rather take the lot and spend it.""

This upset me. I asked her to give me some time and space to think about what she's done. She then went off at me about how her hard work wouldn't be wasted (even though she herself said it would be set up for future generations like my kids). She wouldn't even have any money to blackmail me with if I hadn't agreed to give her half of my inheritance after her own mother screwed her over.

I have gone no contact. But I'm starting to wonder if I'm the asshole for not just using her name to keep her happy in order to make sure my son gets access to that money. I dont want him to miss out just because his grandmother is an entitled piece of work.

1gobtc8,AITA for offending my in-laws by deciding my daughters won’t have a Quinceanera and the reasons?,"Context: My husband (m 35) and I (f 34) have two daughters. The oldest Lexie (14) is not my husband's biological child but he has been nothing short of a father to her. Our second daughter Rosie (husbands bio) is just a baby.

Last weekend we got together with hubby’s family at his parent’s house. MIL started talking about how we need to prepare for Lexie’s Quinceanera next year. Hub’s family has joked multiple times about Lexie getting to have a Quince now that she’s an honorary Mexican thru my husband. My husband's family is from Mexico. I am not of Latino origin. They grew up in the Catholic faith. I did not. 

While I love that hubby’s family considers Lexie their own and includes her in other Mexican traditions, Quinceaneras are the one exception. I have told my husband before I don’t agree with what it historically represents and we aren’t Catholic. My husband has also said he understand this.

I tell my MIL that Lexie won’t be having a Quince and has told me she just wants to go do something with her friends. My MIL snapped at my husband in Spanish and left the room. I was then bombarded with both of my SILs, one their husbands, and my MIL from the other room demanding to know why Lexie couldn’t have a Quince. My husband told them to stand down but for the next 20 minutes they kept making passive aggressive comments like “poor Lexie won’t have a Quince like her little sister will.”


I finally said in a stern but calm tone ""I understand it's a tradition. But I do not agree with the original meaning of Quinces in that now a 15 year old is a woman and ready for marriage. I know it's modernized now and means they're just entering womanhood but I still don't agree with the symbolism. They’re kids. Besides *Husband* and I don’t practice Catholic faith. Lexie is not having a quince and I don't want Rosie to have one either.""

From all directions shouts of ""WHAT? Rosie HAS to have one!"" and ""Rosie is Mexican! You can decide for Lexie but not for Rosie!"" came from all my in-laws. All last week my husband was getting texts about how much I offended them and that a Quince (more so for Rosie as his bio kid) is a right of passage and marks a milestone into womanhood. I told my husband that if Rosie really wants one in the future I would be open to hearing her reasonings. But I won’t encourage or force her to. My husband hates confrontation and told me this morning that I'm the jerk for not just giving in because disagreeing with how they feel about Quinces is offensive to them.",Sad-Cell2569,3351,0.8799999952316284,1897,1731275079,2024-11-10 15:44:39,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gobtc8/aita_for_offending_my_inlaws_by_deciding_my/,11,2024
1goe8uc,WIBTA if I told my wife she can’t take our 3 month old daughter to Australia on holiday without me? ,"So my wife and I just welcomed our first born to the world - the last 6 weeks with her have been absolutely incredible! We both love her to bits, it’s been an intense learning curve but every day there’s something new to marvel at with her. 

There is something hanging over us both right now though…she mentioned to me in passing about 6 months ago that she’d like to travel to Australia with the baby to visit her family for a couple of weeks during maternity leave. We never really discussed it in depth at the time, I think I said something along the lines of ‘Okay cool let’s maybe wait until the babies here safely’ type thing. My wife didn’t really push the point and I didn’t really think much of it. 

Fast forward to a week ago and we’re sat at a dinner table with my wife’s family (and our month old daughter :) ) and they start talking about specific flights and plans they’re making. Australia hasn’t been mentioned to me for 6 months. I had no idea that it was going ahead and it turns out the trip is only a matter of weeks away (9). All I could feel was sheer panic and I realised I really don’t want to spend that long not seeing my amazing new little baby (and my wife too!). 

After dinner I told my wife how I felt. I knew that she’d mentioned it before but hearing the detailed plans had me panicking as it was becoming a reality. I really don’t want her to go to the other side of the world (we live in London) with our newborn without me. I don’t think she’s fully considered how difficult and stressful flying solo long haul with a baby and 3 weeks worth of luggage would be. But, from my perspective I don’t want my daughter to be that far away from me for that long at such an early age. I’m just getting used to being a Dad and all I want to do with every moment of my spare time right now is spend it with my new family. During three weeks I could miss some amazing first moments, but also should anything happen I’d be absolutely helpless 10,000 miles away. 

Me travelling for 3 weeks on this short notice is out of the question, I can’t get that time off work. Does it make me an asshole for not wanting them to go? 

We’ve still not had a proper conversation about it yet and she wants to fly out first week of Jan. It’s tough because I know she wants her family to meet our daughter and she wants to go while she has time off on Maternity - but it just seems way too soon.

1gpyy2x,AITA for shaming a male coworker about menstruation?,"I (34M) got into a heated argument at work with my coworker (31M). For background, he's the ""I tell it like it is"" type who uses that as an excuse to be insensitive, and frankly, bully others into getting what he wants. Dude has anger issues, and has often talked about possibly fighting people. My own toxic trait is that I'm a people pleaser, so I almost never challenge things he says.

Yesterday another coworker (27F) called out because she's having a particularly difficult menstrual period with severe cramps. When I visited her before work to take supplies, she was really pale and could barely stand up. Our boss was understanding, and national law provides menstrual leave in our country.

At work, the male coworker said having a period isn't being sick and not an excuse to miss work. Perhaps it's because I'm close to the other coworker, and perhaps it's because I'm sick of his attitude, but I told him calmly he doesn't have a uterus, so don't talk about whether having a period is being sick. He said, ""Don't fucking tell me not to talk!"" and I matched his energy and said, ""I'll tell anyone not to say misogynistic shit around me!"" and then he backed down quietly saying it wasn't misogyny. Didn't talk to me or even look in my direction for the rest of the day.

I do feel like I could've worded things better in the moment, but I stand by what I said in general: if you don't have a uterus or menstruate, you don't have any grounds to talk about it (myself included). Also while I don't think he's a full blown misogynist, I do think it's a textbook microaggression to ignore what billions of women throughout history have been saying, thinking you know better.

1gqpm8f,AITA for choosing to not spend my day off with my family?,"I (43M) and my wife (40F), have two sons (10 and 14 yo). We both work from 9 am to 5/6pm, even later sometimes. The boys have after school activities almost every day, so after work, we usually drive them to or from somewhere.
Then there's the helping with homework, cooking, house chores, etc...
The weekends, though less busy, are also filled with chores, driving, visiting family, and such.
In sum, we have litle time for ourselves as a couple,  and almost no time alone individually. 

This year, my company is giving everybody the birthday off. Mine is a Monday a couple of weeks from now. 

When I told my family this, they were exited: my wife said that I should swing by her workplace in order for us to have lunch together. The kids said that I should pick them up from school to have lunch.

I said, sorry, but I was planning on having the day to myself.

They were a bit desapointed, and I felt a bit guilty.

I love my family, but I was planning on going near the beach, walk a bit, and have a nice meal enjoying the ocean view, earing no other sound, but the waves and the seagulls.  Besides, I'll be spending my actual birthday with them, we're going away for the weekend.

1gqr1oh,AITA for not letting my 19-year-old sister live with me and my husband anymore? ,"I (24F) and my husband (23M) live in his parents’ basement suite as we save up for our own home. My parents and younger siblings live abroad, but I’ve been here with my two older brothers for years. Sadly, my mom was diagnosed with cancer, and my family came here for better healthcare. Unfortunately, she passed away three months ago, and now the rest of my family has decided to stay.

My dad and younger brother live with my eldest brother Mike (32M), his wife, and their baby. Their home isn’t big enough for my 19-year-old sister, so they asked if she could stay with us. We agreed, feeling bad for her.

However, it’s been a nightmare. She sleeps in the basement living room, which she keeps messy. She wakes up around 5 p.m., doesn’t help with housework, doesn’t cook, and spends all her time playing video games. She can’t work here due to visa issues, so my husband and I pay for everything—food, utilities, etc. She never thanks us and expects everything handed to her.

I’ve been on stress leave from work for two months and have taken on most of the cooking and cleaning. Everyone else works, so I’ve been doing my part. I’ve tried to get my sister to pitch in, like serving herself when I cook, but she complains. Recently, she asked for something, and I snapped, saying no. She got upset and said she “hopes she follows Mom” because she’s “being abused” here. My husband and I were furious. We’re doing everything for her, and she says that?

She started posting on Instagram about how she’s a “victim” here, all while still living in our space. She even told Mike that she doesn’t want to stay with us because “no one is taking care of her.” Mike told her, “You’re 19; figure it out.”

We stopped talking, but she’s still living here. After two weeks of silence, I finally told her to pack her bags and find somewhere else to stay. Even my in-laws, who have been angels and incredibly helpful to my family, subtly hinted they don’t want her here anymore. For them to say that is a big deal.

My other brother Josh (26M) has a studio apartment and agreed to let her stay with him for a while. But now, a week later, Josh’s landlord says she can’t stay anymore. Josh is now telling me she’ll have to come back to us. He didn’t ask—he just told me she’d be back on Thursday.

My husband is furious. He thinks it’s ridiculous that Josh is dictating what we should do in our own space, especially when we’ve been driving him around because he doesn’t have a car. I told Josh that just because he’s older doesn’t mean he gets to boss us around when we’re already doing more than our share.

We talked as a family, and Mike said our sister is now me and Josh's problem. My dad can’t take her due to visa issues and health problems, and we don’t want to stress him out. I know she’s grieving, but that doesn’t excuse her behavior.

So, AITA for not wanting my sister to stay with us anymore?",Emotional-Complex734,2757,0.9700000286102296,341,1731541068,2024-11-13 17:37:48,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqr1oh/aita_for_not_letting_my_19yearold_sister_live/,11,2024

Anyway, a few days ago, my son saw me scrolling through my camera roll and yelled at me because I was tearing up at his baby pictures, where he was still dressed extremely femininely and was obviously a girl. I wasn’t crying at it because he isn’t a girl anymore, I was crying because time flies! He told me that by me keeping those photos as memories, I am totally disregarding the fact that he is no longer a girl and I am transgender phobic.

My heart was saddened by this because that is the last thing I will ever be. I have open arms to anyone and everyone.

1gsyytu,AITA for refusing to force my daughter to shave for a wedding? And backing out of paying for it when we were uninvited?,"I honestly can’t believe this situation has come to this, and I really need some outsider perspective. 
I’m a 35yr old man, and I was two beautiful daughters, Lucy (7) and Molly (16). I adopted them both and have raised them by myself for their entire lives. I also have a sister, Julie (33F) who is getting married in two months to Paul (35M). 
Both Julie and Paul are lower middle class and have been saving for years for their very expensive dream wedding. Even with all the prep, they’re about $14,000 short.
I own a law firm and am doing quite well, so I offered to help cover the remaining cost. 
The trouble arose last week when Julie and I took Molly and Lucy dress shopping. She picked out a short sleeved, just above the knee dress for Molly. It looked beautiful on her, and everything was fine until Julie said that Molly would have to shave. 
Molly is autistic and generally has Low Support Needs, but sensory issues are a big one for her. She doesn’t shave any body hair at all because the of the feeling (which is 100% okay in my book, her body her choice). So when Julie said this, I told her no, that Molly would not do that and she could either pick a longer dress or let her be. Julie got heated and we left without purchasing anything. 
The next day, Julie asked if I had thought about how foolish I was being and Molly needed to learn to suck it up, that nobody wanted to see that blah blah blah. Things escalated again, and she ended up uninviting us. I told her that was fine, it was her wedding.
I hadn’t heard from her until today, when she called to ask me when they could discuss what I would be paying for and when. I asked if she was joking, and told her because she uninvited us, I wouldn’t be paying a cent. She  started to freak out, first getting angry and then began to cry over the phone. I hung up on her. 
She apparently called our mom, aunts, and grandparents and told them I was ruining her wedding. Now I’m getting calls about how cruel and heartless I am, and that I’m not entitled to have my kids at the wedding. Especially from my mom, who reminded me that this Julie’s big day and she’s been dreaming about it since she was little. Some people think I should just pay even if we can’t go, while others say that Molly needs to grow up and get over it. I think someone who can’t accept my daughter doesn’t deserve my money.

1gtp5c4,AITA for refusing to let my brother bring his girlfriend to Thanksgiving after she disrespected my wife?,"I (31M) am married to Lily (30F). My brother Josh (29M) recently started dating Lindsey (27F), and while she’s been polite at family events, Lily feels Lindsey has made some passive-aggressive comments. For example, at a recent BBQ, Lindsey said it was “selfish” that Lily and I weren’t planning to have kids anytime soon. Lily felt uncomfortable, but I didn’t say anything at the time. Another incident happened at a family dinner when Lindsey remarked, “I’m surprised you two are so happy without kids. You must be really good at being selfish.” Lily was hurt by that comment, and it made her feel like Lindsey was judging our life choices. Most recently, at a birthday party, Lindsey made a comment about Lily’s career, saying, “It’s cute that you’re working part-time with no kids while Josh and I are really focusing on our careers.” Lily was annoyed, but didn’t say anything because she didn’t want to start drama. Thanksgiving is at our house this year, and when Josh asked if he could bring Lindsey, I told him I’d prefer if she didn’t come. I explained that some of her comments had made Lily feel disrespected, and I didn’t want that to ruin the holiday. Josh got upset and said I was being petty. He argued that I was overreacting and that Lindsey was “just being honest,” but I stood my ground. Now Josh says he won’t come if Lindsey isn’t invited, and my parents are caught in the middle.

1gvaubn,AITA for not canceling a non-refundable trip for Thanksgiving,"My in-laws always do Thanksgiving the Saturday after. My husband (28M) and I (26F) bought tickets to a dinner theater over a year ago that are non-refundable (almost $200) When we purchased them, we didn’t realize it was the Saturday after until about 2 weeks later. I immediately texted my MIL letting her know that if they did it the Saturday after this year (2024) we wouldn’t be able to make it. (Texted her 11/10/2023) We invited them to our house for actual Thanksgiving day as my husband and I (and kids) stay home on actual holidays. They of course complained and my FIL told my husband that he knew they did Thanksgiving the Saturday after and that it seems we are just waiting for a funeral. (We have a medically complex son, they live an hour away and it’s hard to travel with him) AITA for not eating the cost of those tickets because they decided to still stay on the weekend after even after we told them over a year ago that we wouldn’t be able to go? 

Update: I am not at all upset that they DIDN’T change the day, ultimately it is up to them on when they want to host it. Personally I just think it’s not exactly fair for them to expect us to change our plans that we made over a year ago and informed them of the date. 

2nd update: please see some of my comments there is a character limit on this portion. I should have checked the date and I admit that, we haven’t had a date in almost three years and just got excited and I didn’t think to check when Thanksgiving was. They also don’t care to see or talk to us the rest of the year, it only becomes a problem on holidays. 

3rd edit : Funeral comment was made because we aren’t able to see them that often due to our sons needs and the travel with our son, that we are basically just waiting for one of them to die. (He was drunk when he sent it… so that’s was our interpretation of it) 

4th edit : gotta make this one short, they were reminded multiple times throughout the year that we wouldn’t be able to make this year if it was on the 30th. No issues came up until 3 days ago. And we never wanted them to change the date if they didn’t want to it’s up to them and I don’t expect them to change their schedule because of us.

1gw0he1,AITA for being ungrateful and not eating the brownies my gf made for me? ,"
Yesterday my gf surprised me with some homemade brownies. She baked them specifically for me, she was so thoughtful and used all vegan ingredients. It made me feel both so valued and cared for but also stressed because I knew I wouldn't like them, because I can not handle the chewy texture of them. But she didn't know that. I love the chocolate flavor so she must have thought i would ike brownies too. 

I thanked and then told her I'm really not good with chewy textures. She insisted that I take a bike so I did. I could barely swallow it. smiled and hid my disgust the best I could because I knew she would be offended. 

I must suck at faking my reaction because she immediately asked me does it really taste that horrible? I said it no it's not about that, I just can't handle the chewy textures. I told her it has nothing to with the taste or her baking and not to take it personal. 

Unfortunately she did. She told me I'm ungrateful and I could just take few bites and tell her I will save the rest for the later like a normal person. 

I apologized and said I don't think I will be able to take more bites. That really upset her. She said fine I will fucking throw them away then and throw them into garbage. She was so upset the whole time and decided to not stay over so I gave a ride . She was upset during the ride too and slammed the door when she was leaving.

1gw0pcq,AITA for Kicking My Boyfriend Out because he Didn’t Take Me to My Oral Surgery?,"
I recently had oral surgery to get my wisdom teeth removed, and I needed a designated driver. I asked my boyfriend if he could take me, and he said he’d find out if he could. Over the past few days, he seemed excited about the idea, even joking about wanting to see how I’d act under anesthesia.

Fast forward to this morning, the day of my surgery. I asked him if he was still going to take me, and he said no. He told me he needed to get a haircut for a presentation he has tomorrow, as the rubric says he should be “well-groomed.” For context, I think his hair already looks fine, but he said he doesn’t like it.

Luckily, I had a backup plan and asked another friend to take me, but I was still really upset. I told him that I wanted him there and was hurt that he backed out at the last minute. He told me it wasn’t his obligation to take me and pointed out that I had other people who could step in, so I shouldn’t be mad.

I feel conflicted. I get that it’s not technically his “obligation,” but I also feel like, as my boyfriend, he should want to prioritize something as important as a medical procedure over a haircut. At the same time, I understand his perspective that he needs to feel confident and professional for his presentation.

1gw1stq,AITA for expecting not to have to pay for Thanksgiving groceries?,"I have never posted here before, so my apologies if I make any mistakes. 

I (54f) have been invited by a friend (50f) who I will call Ann, to come to her house for Thanksgiving.  

We all live in Italy, but spent many years in the USA, and have several American friends in the area.  

Ann heard that I make a traditional Thanksgiving dinner at my house every year for my family and a couple friends (6 people total).  

It is quite difficult to get all of the supplies here (no buying canned pumpkin, or cranberry sauce!), so I make every single thing from scratch.  Over the years, I’ve also acquired all the dishes and tools and spices - know suppliers for the more exotic things, and am an all around good cook. 

So Ann, who was born in China but lived in the USA for 20+ years, asked if I would come to her beautiful (and much bigger) home, and “teach her” how to make the whole dinner.  

For a group of 12 people instead of the usual 6.  

I was hesitant at first, because we live a very modest lifestyle, and Ann and her (British) husband are very well off, but I figured it would still be fun, and I would enjoy putting on the feast for new people and in a beautiful kitchen. 

After I agreed, the problems began.  First, Ann wanted to have the dinner on a day that isn’t Thanksgiving, to make it more convenient.  I decided it wasn’t all that important, since we live in Italy.  So it is scheduled for the Sunday prior to the actual day. 

Then when we were planning to meet to go shopping for all the ingredients, she asked if I could do all the shopping and she would “reimburse me for her half”. 

I asked what she meant, and she said that I’d be paying for half of everything. 

So not only would I be doing all the shopping, all the planning, all the cooking and teaching her as well, but now I’m expected to pay for the food? 

I told her I could not do this (we really don’t have the budget!) so now she’s trying to alter the menu she agreed to (turkey & fixings, candied yams, roasted veggies, an appetizer, and pie).  Really a modest dinner by American standards. 

She then made a comment that “her” friends don’t “eat like pigs”.

She then went to another guest *with my recipes* and asked her to prepare my pumpkin pie so she didn’t have to buy the ingredients. 

Bear in mind, Ann and her husband are very wealthy.  I’d estimate the whole dinner for 12 might cost €200 for the ingredients, and my labor Ann gets for free. 

She thinks I’m being “stubborn and ungenerous” (ie an AH) 

My family thinks Ann is  taking advantage of my kindness and her miserly ways are ridiculous, since she’d spend double that amount for lunch out on a whim. 

So AITA for refusing to “contribute” to the meal or be bullied into this nonsense?  My family wants me to just bow out and tell her I’m not comfortable with her attitude.  I’m tempted, because this feels toxic and manipulative.

1gwqvh6,AITA - For admitting to my husband that I'm uncomfortable with certain children in our home?,"Hello, 31f married to my husband, 35m. Together 10.5 years. We have no kids and live in our house with our elderly dog. We are both from a small city, and a few years ago decided to move to a bigger city nearby.

In recent years, close friends and family have started families and ask to come stay with us when in big city, with their small kids.

Our house isn't really kid-friendly, I child-proof best I can to make it safe for guests. I prepare toys, snacks, Disney+, make it a friendly place. I generally enjoy spending time with the kids in my life. 

My husband's sister's youngest son (5) has severe behavioral issues. He's been kicked out of 3 daycares and has diagnosed with ODD and ADHD. My SIL comes over for days-long visits with her 3 kids, and he is a huge challenge. He knocks furniture over, throw things around, he's broken several of my items. He snoops in every single room, constantly. Opens every drawer and cupboard to pull things out. SIL ignores it, I'm the one chasing him around trying to stop him. I am so uncomfortable having my personal spaces invaded.

I once found him snooping in our bedroom. He grabbed something very inappropriate from a drawer and was about to run into the main room with it when I grabbed it.

I'm the only adult trying to stop him. Husband and SIL do and say nothing. I tried setting boundaries of rooms that are off limits with my most personal items, but they were ignored. 

As well, my husband's best friends have a 4 year old boy who is very disrespectful in our house. He insults us, screams at my dog, snoops around, wipes his nose on couch pillows and his parents don't do a thing. I don't expect perfect behavior, I just want decent manners and respect in my home.

Now, whenever these specific people ask to come stay with us, I'm filled with anxiety and dread.

During SIL's most recent visit, my husband allowed nephew into an off-limits room and he broke a little Lego item my friends' kid made me. Afterwards I told him how I felt about it and that I was struggling with my discomfort.

He was offended. ""Every time kids come over, you have a complaint/ kids will be kids / you need to lighten up."" Said I'm overreacting about the Lego and it wasn't a big deal. I said the point is that a boundary of mine had been ignored and an item was broken, again.

I explained I have no problems with kids if they can behave. I mentioned the incident of nephew handling a bedroom item. My husband said that I shouldn't let it bother me, and to try to find it funny instead.

I know a big part of his defensive reaction is because SIL's family is the only real family he has. I understand that he's trying to just have a good time with them in his home without negativity.

I want to mention I've always conveyed my concerns to him in a respectful and mature way. I still wonder, if I'm actually TA here and maybe I'm being too negative when my husband is just trying to enjoy time with what little family he has left.",thunderstormthursday,3358,0.9800000190734864,565,1732224576,2024-11-21 15:29:36,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gwqvh6/aita_for_admitting_to_my_husband_that_im/,11,2024

My wife is now saying that her friend will be staying permanently and would like to pay us rent. I said absolutely not and the whole thing has blown up between us. This is the first time my wife and I have fought like this in ten years. For additional background we have two bedrooms in our house. I used to sleep in the guest bedroom 2 - 3 times a week as I am an extremely light sleeper and don’t feel rested often after sleeping in the same room as my wife. This room has been used by her best friend now for over a month and I never feel rested anymore. Additionally, her friend keeps having HER friends stay overnight in our guest room. I don’t even know these people and I wake up to them in my house. My wife and I have also fought a ton over this. I’m at the point I’m about to say they need to just go get an apartment together because my health is being affected. Am I crazy? I’m so tired I feel like I can’t process this correctly but I just don’t feel comfortable in my own home anymore and I’m so tired of it.

1gxlf4r,WIBTA if I tell my husbands ex she has to move out?,"I (35F) have been married to my husband (37M) for 1 year but we've been together for 3. He has 2 children (6F) (8M) from his previous relationship. (We do not have any kids together.) Their mom Anne (34F) has one other child (4F). They have a good co-parenting relationship and Anne and I get along. The Last week when Anne picked up the kids (we have week on week off) she told us that the kids might need to spend a few weeks with us because her and her current husband are getting a divorce. The house is in his name (he had it when they got together) and she's been a stay at home mom for their whole relationship. She said she was going to stay with her sister but they don't have enough room for all 3 kids.

I jumped in before my husband could say anything and offered her the guest room and told her the girls can share a room here just like they do at her house. That way she didn't have to miss her time with the kids and we could help with her daughter while she gets a job and gets things figured out. She thanked us and said she'd let us know when she would be moving out as soon as she could.

My husband asked me if was 100% okay with it, and that it would be fair to get her in here and then have an issue later. I told him I was okay and we'd work through anything that comes up.

That was 3 months ago, she's lived with us for 2 months now and everything is great. It's actually better than great if I'm being honest. Having her here means I don't have to take both kids to the store if I need something for dinner. Housework is divided between 3 people. She's gotten a job and isn't having to pay for childcare (which is about $700 a week in our area) Even though I told her she didn't have to she is giving us $500 a month for bills.

I was talking to my sister and cousin at our early thanksgiving and my sister said I'm crazy for letting her stay with us. That I'm ""devaluing myself as a partner"" and ""being an asshole to myself"" for allowing this to continue. My cousin agrees with her. She said the only reason his ex would agree to stay is if she still wanted to sleep with him and him agreeing means he wants it too.

I don't see them behaving any differently than before, and I truly trust my husband. But now I'm starting to doubt my decision. WIBTA if I tell her she needs to find somewhere else to live? AITA to myself if I don't listen to them and let her stay?

Update:

Thank you all for your comments. You're right, this isn't the first time I've let my older sister's comments get into my head. I sent her a text and told her that my household isn't her concern and if she doesn't trust the man in her life she should focus on her own. Thanks for the reality check. Anne is dying over the number of sister wives comments.

1gxm1qt,AITAH for stepping up when my little sister got her period.,"So I 14F and my little sister 12D have never been close. Classic sibling relationship. My mom and dad recently divorced and now my mom works A LOT. Sice then me and my sister (let's call her Ally) grew closer. We started talking more and hanging out and have a real relationship. So last night around 8pm Ally comes into my room in tears. I could instantly tell something was off so I asked and she said ""I think I startedy period"". I comforted and told her it was going to be alright and all that jazz. I show here how to use a pad and after that I got us some hot coco and sat on the couch to explain all of my big sister knowledge about periods and stuff. I didn't go into full detail because I wanted to respect my mom but I didn't want Ally to feel clueless l. After that I doordashed us some Taco Bell and we watched cheesy Hallmark movies. My mom got home around 10 and I told her what happened and she went crazy. She said I was overstepping and I should've called her and not have told Ally anything but just gave her a pad. She said I was ignoring her feelings and being ignorant. And that it was her job as a mother to explain everything to Ally. I tried to tell her I only said the basics but she just sent me to my room.

1gz47nj,"AITA for ""ruining"" the Holidays due to placing our mom in LTC?","So, I(28m) have two siblings Theo(35M) and Abby(38F). Our mother had a stroke back in 2019 and our father passed away in early 2021. I have been taking care of her since. I dropped out of my graduate program to take care of our mom. 

Since January things with our mom became more stressful, increased memory issues, lack of sleep, and I was generally burnt out. During this time my siblings did not offer any assistance. They have families and lives. It fell on me because at the time I was staying with our parents in their apartment in NY since  I was going to school in NY. 

Each year I would fly or drive to VA so our mom can see my siblings and her grandkids. I found a place for our mom back in February and I informed my siblings they had no objection at the time. Now that major Holidays are coming around they have been asking me if I am going to bring mom. I told them no I was not but if they wanted to take her they were 100% free to take her. I told them she is not in a prison and I did put them on the list for approved people to take her out. 

They told me they could not do that it would be far too complicated. I told them that is unfortunate but I am going on vacation so I would not be available. Now all of a sudden I have everyone and their mother reaching out to me telling me how selfish and heartless I am being towards our mother. 

I pretty much lashed out at Theo who is hosting this year and told him off. I told him he has no right to call me selfish. I was the one that stepped up to care for mom after her stroke and our dad passed. I handled the sleepless nights, the wandering, the outbursts, the doctors appointments. I handled getting her Medicaid, I handled everything and put my life on hold to do so. 

They got to see the pleasant side of our mom and if she had an outburst I was the one that had to deal with it. Them he said I should have asked for help. He claimed he figured I had it all handled and did not need help. 

I told him I should not have had to ask I was 23 when mom had her stroke and 25 when dad passed. You knew I was stressed and was handling everything. I told him he did not even offer to help me setup the arrangements for our dad's funeral. Neither did Abby. 

He said he cannot read minds, I should have asked. So in that moment I said fine and asked him can you come pick up mom so she can go over for Thanksgiving. I will cover the travel fare. He came up with excuses like it was short notice. I said fine what about Christmas and again came up with an excuse.

After that I told him this is why I did not ask because you fucks will always come up with an excuse to get out of it. I told him that is how you two have always been. 

Apologize for the borderline rant, I am just pissed atm.

1gzwdpg,"AITA for ruining my brother’s childhood memory by admitting I photoshopped it 14 years ago?
","When my younger brother (20 now) was 6, he went through a huge Harry Potter phase. He loved the wizarding world and believed he might meet ‘Harry Potter’ (Daniel Radcliffe) or the other characters on a family trip to Scotland since Hogwarts was ‘there.’ No one promised him this, but he convinced himself it could happen. Sadly, the trip was canceled after our grandpa passed away, and my brother was devastated for both reasons.

To cheer him up, I decided to craft a 'souvenir'. I was 16 and had just discovered photoshop, so I edited a picture of my brother with Daniel Radcliffe to make it look like they'd met. I printed it, framed it, and gave it to him without telling him it was fake. He loved it and fully believed he’d met Daniel. Soon, he had an entire story about the meeting; what they talked about, how Daniel hugged him, etc. It was so sweet, and none of us (my family and I) had the heart to tell him the truth.

Fast forward 14 years, and my brother still didn’t know that the old, low quality picture of him meeting Daniel Radcliffe is fake. I never told him because his memory of the fake meeting felt so real to him that it became one of his proudest stories. Over time the memory became less important and the framed picture had been packed away in some box, and my brother has long outgrown his Harry Potter obsession. Yesterday, however, we were at our parents' home and we were bringing up old memories, you know how it goes. The story of meeting Daniel Radcliffe came up, and thinking it was harmless, I told him the truth. I thought he’d laugh but instead he got visibly upset. He didn’t want to believe me at first, thinking I was messing with him. I told him the real story of how and why I did it. He told me that it feels like I robbed him of a real childhood memory that he really cherished, and he feels embarrassed thinking about all the times he's told people about meeting Daniel Radcliffe in person, even recently. We ended our conversation on a semi-good note, though. I apologised for not telling him sooner, because I do feel bad that it meant so much to him even now. But I don’t regret it. Back then, it made him so happy during a rough time, and I don’t regret giving him that joy. I just didn't realize how much it still meant to him. So I'm just wondering, am (or was) I the a-hole?

1h0p9qy,AITA for not keeping up the family tradition? ,"My (25M) wife (24F) gave birth to our son two weeks ago. My family has had the tradition of naming the child months of the year for 5 generations on my mum's side. My name is December (I’ve shortened it to Dec hoping people will think it’s short for Declan or something normal), my brothers are called August (not so common in the UK) and July (poor guy, nothing you can do about that one) and my sisters are called April, June and May (not so bad). 

My wife and I called our son Tobias. We kept the name a secret until after he was born and we had signed the birth certificate so it couldn’t be changed. When we told my parents a week ago, they were most certainly not happy. Even though my dad has the nice normal name of Alex, he liked the tradition. My sister, June, named her daughter March to keep with the tradition so my parents expected me to do the same. My mum continually said that we should call the baby September for a girl and October for a boy throughout the pregnancy. I never outright said I wasn’t going to because I know what lengths they would go to to make sure my baby would have a month as a name. My brothers were on board when we told them, understanding growing up with the teasing. My parents left after saying we were disrespecting my heritage by not following the tradition. I told them I wasn’t going to name my child a ridiculous name because some old, long dead, crazy man decided months of the year would be good names and just because my mum was stupid enough to join him and his madness, didn’t mean I had to. They stormed out and haven’t spoken to me since. 

My sisters have said I should have just named him a month to keep the peace and I’m an asshole for insulting my mum and her family. I feel as though I’m just looking out for what’s best for my son. My family seems to think my wife has “brainwashed” me into calling him something normal even though I have never made it a secret that I hate my name.

1h1hofm,AITA for allowing my mother to bring Thanksgiving food to my house this year? Married with 3 kids and a pregnant wife,"1 week ago, my mother asked to spend Thanksgiving at our house this year and my brother and niece planned on tagging along. For context, my grandmother passed earlier this year and my family usually got together at her house for Thanksgiving. I told her we initially planned on visiting my in laws because they live closer to us and my wife wasnt enthusiastic about cooking this year, but I'd ask my wife to see if they had any concrete plans locked in. We then decided on staying here and hosting my family. I offered to cook to help out but my wife insisted that she wanted to cook. This was about a week ago.

Fast forward to today. My mother calls me and tells me she planned on bringing stuffing with turkey legs, fresh sweet potatoes, and a cake. My wife goes absolutely ballistic, saying it's extremely rude to bring food to someone's house for Thanksgiving. We get into an argument because I'm trying to say that shes just trying to be nice and help out, but my wife fully believes she is either trying to be rude or disrespectful and how as her husband I shouldnt have allowed it. She begins to talk to her family about how rude my mom is and just overall being angry towards me. To remedy this, I basically had to tell her not to bring any food and only the cake because it's acceptable. I personally didn't think it was such a problem given the situation, but apparently it is.

1h1i4x2,AITA for telling my Parter I will no longer help her watch the kids while she works from home. (stay at home dad),"I (M30s) have been a stay-at-home dad for three and a half years. We have two young children—18 months and 3.5 years old. This all started when I moved across the country for a job that simply didn't exist at her uncle's snack company, despite her and her mother swearing up and down it did (and her actually getting her job there). To take this ""fake"" job, I had to quit my job in Minnesota, which meant that when COVID hit shortly after, I didn't qualify for any unemployment benefits or assistance. I burned through my savings. Since she still had a job, we decided I'd stay home with the kids to avoid expensive CA childcare costs.

Here's the problem: she works from home in our 1300 sq ft house with paper-thin walls. She takes meetings all day in the next room, which means I have to keep the kids quiet for most of the day. It's incredibly stressful and makes it almost impossible to do anything with them.

When we made this arrangement, she promised to find a separate workspace outside the house—a she-shed, a converted garage, anything!—but four years later, that still hasn't happened. To make matters worse, she controls all the finances, refuses to fix up the house (even issues that affect the kids!), and has never included me in financial decisions or given me any kind of allowance. She makes a good salary, but she's a terrible spender. Every year, she blows through our savings, and we end up having to ""catch up"" financially, which means there's never any money for family activities, home improvements, or anything else. I feel like I have no say in how our money is spent, even though I'm the one sacrificing my career and income for our family.

I need surgery on my ankle so I can walk properly again, but it requires a 3-6 month recovery period. My wife refuses to even discuss having a family member come help with the kids so I can get this done. I've applied for disability twice, and even though all the doctors agree (even the ones they hired) say I need it, I've been denied.

I love my kids more than anything, but I'm starting to feel like I have no control over my own life or them. I've tried to find a non-standing work-from-home job, but they're all 9-5, which defeats the purpose of me being home with the kids.

1h1in89,AITA for not letting my dad's friend inside the house?,"I (F24) am a daughter to a divorced couple. They separated when I was 3 and since then I have always lived with my mom. I had a good relationship with my dad until I turned 14, when he started a family of his own and we rarely got to see each other. The frequent catching up became sporadic on both sides very quickly. 
The house where I live is my mom's house, but before the divorce it was the house where we lived as a family. My dad is really familiar with the house and the entirety of the apartment complex. One of the other person living in our complex is my dad's best friend, let's call him Paul. They know each for 30+ years and my dad always describe him as a ""family friend"". Both me and my mom never quite liked him. After my parents divorced, when my mom and I meet Paul in the communal spaces we do some polite small talks but nothing more since we simply don't enjoy his company but it has happened a couple of times that for complex related things he came up into our house uninvited. He is someone that doesn't understand boundaries and that makes us really uncomfortable. Last time, using a maintenance excuse, he stayed for two hours and a half, actively asking for coffee more than once and when he wanted something more to drink he just went straight to the fridge without asking. Trust me, I am a really welcoming person, but the way he acts and his soft entitlement really rubs me the wrong way.
Back to my dad. He just got a new job that makes him drive by my house, so it became a spontaneous habit for him to come by once every week. I was really excited at first but it became pretty apparent from the start that it was not going to be what I expected. Three times out of the average four monthly visits he hangs out with Paul in my living room. Most of the time when I call to check when he will arrive, he is at Paul’s and they just come at my door and stay both for a couple of hours, take a coffee or two before vanishing. Last week when I asked my dad to come watch a movie it was no different. He called me, told me that he was at Paul's and simply added ""We're coming in a minute"". I just snapped. I told him that I wanted only him to come by and that I didn't want Paul in the house. He asked me why and I explained that I just didn't want Paul there. He exploded. He told me that I was extremely rude for not inviting him. He kept saying ""Since when Paul cannot come to OUR house?"". I just responded that technically that was not his house and that if he really wanted to spend some time with Paul they could have went elsewhere. He hung up on me and never showed up. I wasn't expecting that reaction from him and I felt extremely betrayed because I thought our hanging time was more important than Paul. When later I told my mom what happened she said that I did the right thing and that my dad is known to be dismissive and extremely angry when he doesn't get what he wants.
I still feel bad. Maybe I could have overlooked Paul's presence but idk.

1h26mk2,AITA for kicking my niece out of my apartment when she needed my help?,"My wife (26F) and I (27M) live a relatively quiet life. My sister has two kids, one of which being my niece (15F), whom we'll call J. As her younger brother, I know very well that living with my sister sucks, so I have sympathy for my niece, who gets into arguments with her mom. Now J isn't exactly an angel either, the whole family knows that. Well this year, J asked me personally if she could stay with me in my apartment for the summer break, because she and her mom got into a particularly nasty argument, and she wanted ""help and guidance"". I hesitantly agreed, and said she could stay for two months.

Unfortunately, there are a lot issues with J.
1. She is a pathological liar. 50% of everything she says is untrue, and she will lie to your face even if you know the truth. 
2. I have a cabinet full of alcohol that we save for family gatherings and date nights. We don't drink otherwise. I hid the alcohol from J. She found it, and within 3 days, drank EVERYTHING. When I looked into the hiding place all the bottles were empty. 
3. I placed security cameras in the house because of her, and caught her on tape stealing money from my wallet
4. She broke a few of our things out of anger, and when we asked her about it, she said it was an ""accident"" (it was on camera).
5. I tried multiple times to spend time with her and connect with her but she never showed me any respect or seriousness. Everything is a joke.
6. The straw that broke the camel's back is when I confronted her about the alcohol and money she stole, she not only didn't apologize, but lied saying that my wife did all those things and is trying to frame her because she hates her. Even after telling her I have footage of her doing it, she still kept saying she didn't do it and ""I'm conspiring against her"".

I lost my marbles. It has only been five weeks, but I was done. I called my sister and told her J is coming in the morning. J begged me not to send her back. I asked her ""why not stay with your aunt or your father?"", to which she said neither will let her stay with them because they are ""conspiring against her too"". Surprise, she had stolen from them and lied to them too, so no one wants anything to do with her. I didn't care, and drove her back home to her mom, and informed my sister of what J has done. She was furious with J, so I left immediately.

I will never allow them into my house again. I feel a bit bad, because again, her mom is always angry, and her family wants nothing to do with her. It also probably didn't help I told her mom. But still, these are the consequences of her own actions. What do you think? Am I the asshole?

1h2ygbv,AITA for no longer welcoming my mother in law in my home?,"I’ve watched my in laws (mother in law, sister in law, sister in law husband, etc) talk trash about their family for years (including her autistic grandson who is now an adult).  I usually say it’s not appropriate or walk away or don’t engage in the conversation.  
I’ve told my husband many times if she ever speaks that way about our family, she will not be welcome around us anymore.

She’s at our house for Thanksgiving. She lives multiple states away and we only see her once or twice a year although she’s been discussing purchasing a house near us.

My son is a teenager and autistic. She is well aware he is on the spectrum. My son was in the basement running on the treadmill talking to himself loud enough for us to hear (which isn’t super loud because the stairwell from basement to where we are is open space).  Mother in law said “what is he doing?”  I replied “talking to himself.”  She said “why?”  I said “because it makes him feel good.”  She says “he’s weird.”  No joking, no jest.  Very straight forward.  I told her she’s weird and walked off.

I went upstairs shaking and told my husband what happened and that she is no longer welcome in my son’s home.  This is his safe space. He masks and keeps it together outside of these four walls all day every day. If he wants to talk to himself in his own home, he should not be subjected to judgment.  Also, if she feels comfortable enough saying this to my face, what is she saying behind his back?

My husband said he would talk to her. I told him to ask her to leave tomorrow (it is dark and she doesn’t drive in the dark so she can’t leave today).  He went and talked to her and came back up and said she realized what she’s done is wrong by and is sorry and won’t do it again. He said that no one has ever called her on it before and she didn’t know it was a problem before and we shouldn’t just cut her off and give her another chance (this is false, every time she’s said inappropriate things about other family members I have told her it isn’t ok). The fact that an adult has to be told it’s not ok to call an autistic child weird is pretty wild.  I want to protect my children from her. 

My husband is now insisting we discuss this right now and that I be willing to work through this and not just cut her off (which I am not - I am saying she’s not do welcome in my home).  Teaching her manners is not my responsibility.  My son’s well being is my responsibility.   If she wants to work on herself, come back later to apologize, and demonstrate she won’t say things like that again, I will be happy to welcome her back.  But until then, she is not welcome in my house.

AITA for no longer welcoming her in my home?

1h2yif9,AITA for yelling at a lady on her phone before Wicked?,"Just left the movie and I'm curious. 

The first video saying turn off your phone goes and she's scrolling on Facebook with her brightness up. The second video saying to get off your phone goes and she's still on it, so I yell down (it's stadium seating) like 3 rows for her to turn it off. She did the rest of the show too! 

After the movie, a lady says I have an ugly voice and I joke that I love compliments on my voice. And I loudly say to my friend if I wonder if that's the lady I yelled at after she wouldn't listen to Jeff Goldblum to turn off her phone. And I say stay mad when she and her husband were shaking their heads in disgust. 

So AITAH?

Edit: The lady stayed off her phone. My friend joked I scared everyone straight, lol.

Edit 2: Wow, this blew up! Here are some answers to a few questions that are popping up 

1. This was well past when the trailers were done and was obviously right before the movie started. Literally, the movie started almost immediately after.

2. No, I wasn't singing or doing anything that made me a bad audience member. My voice is just Miley Cyrus level loud and raspy, and the lady recognized my voice while walking out.

1h3p8ij,AITA for confronting my mom after being left out of family vacation?,"Today I sent my mom a text message to tell her I’m pissed about being left out of family vacation.

So, this story really begins around September.
My family was going to go on vacation to Tampa for Thanksgiving as opposed to cooking. However, Helene ravaged Florida, so my family decided to cancel the trip. I live in western North Carolina, which also destroyed by Helene, so I was receptive and understanding of the situation. I was under the assumption that Thanksgiving would occur as usual.

Around a week ago, I was texting my aunt about something unrelated and she mentioned that the family was going on a 5-day cruise to Mexico. I was taken aback by that, and asked her if it was to compensate for the fact they had to cancel the trip to Tampa. She said yes. 

Apparently this trip was scheduled immediately after the family received news about the state of Florida after Helene. My mom decided she wanted to withhold that information from me as to “not hurt my feelings”, but really I know it’s because she didn’t want to pay for me, which would have been fine if she just told me.
My mom has issues with communication, so we have a rocky relationship. She has a history of abuse, and we overall don’t get along very well. I expected this kind of thing from her, but it really hits hard lately since I’ve been struggling with mental health.

When I texted her about how I felt, she told me I was being dramatic and it made no sense that I was so wound up about it. Really, it isn’t the fact they went, it’s the fact they hid it from me. I tried to tell her that I would’ve been fine about not going if she had told me instead of hiding it for months. 

AITA? I don’t really know if I’m being dramatic. ",Human_Response_8628,1959,0.959999978542328,134,1733008824,2024-11-30 17:20:24,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h3p8ij/aita_for_confronting_my_mom_after_being_left_out/,11,2024
1h4el0n,AITA for not moving out of the way while getting off the plane for a tantrum throwing child (not mine)?,"Everyone knows the joy of deplaning after a long Thanksgiving weekend.  This flight was four hours long and understandably when we reached the gate everyone was ready to deplane.  I was in an aisle seat so I stood up to get my bag from above, as did the gentleman across from me and those in front of me.  A mother with two kids (maybe 3 & 4?) behind me let both of them crawl over their seats and join both her and her husband in the aisle as well, which made things very crowded. The youngest crammed himself between me and his sister and started throwing an absolute tantrum- pushing his sister, yelling at his dad who was trying to pick him up (saying “let me go! I hate you dad!” To which his mom replied in a sing song voice “we don’t talk to daddy that way [insert kid’s name].” 

The people in the aisles behind this mess moved back to their seats to make room for the little girl he was pushing back and the mom - in a much sterner voice than what she used with her tantrum throwing child, asked me “can you please move your body out of his way?” At first I assumed she was talking to her husband because he was crammed in the aisle too.  But when she said it again and tapped on my shoulder I realized she was talking to me.  

I couldn’t move forward because there were people in the row ahead of me grabbing their bags, and I still needed to get my bag down as well. 

Meanwhile the kid is still screaming.  So I simply said- “I’m sorry- I need to get my bag” to which she responded - “well your butt is in his face!”

At that point I wasn’t going to sit back down in my seat to accommodate her family of four crowding into the aisle. So I stayed, grabbed my bag, and deplaned.

1h4g4rp,AITA for drama over pink wedding dress,"Throwaway account

Me (26f) and my fiance (26m) are getting married this coming May. Last week, me and my parents were discussing plans for the wedding. For the longest time (since teens perhaps), I have had my heart set on a pink wedding gown. That color makes me feel the prettiest and (I believe) suits me more than white. My mom has known about this interest, but always thought it was one of those fancies which would ""go away"" once I grew up and actually decided to get married.

Well, here we are. When I brought up the pink wedding dress again during our discussion, my mom and I got into a serious argument about it. She said that it would be childish and embarrassing of me to get married in a gown that color and she doesn't want me to regret in the future looking back at my photos. I argued that there was nothing embarrasing about wearing a color I like on MY special day, and even James didn't mind what color of the dress I wore. I also said that regret could go either way and I could end up regretting NOT wearing pink in the future so I'd rather go with the decision that makes me happy right now. Although my dad hasn't been as vocally against the pink dress, he is starting to side with mom seeing how upset she is getting over this.

Over the whole week, there has been no end in sight to this argument, with my mom bringing up multiple times how they won't pay their half for the wedding dress if I go with pink (the initial agreement was to split the bill 50-50). My brother (30m) thinks the whole argument over this color is ridiculous and told mom that he'd be happy to split the bill with me instead, and *they* might end up being the ones regretting this whole drama more than me regretting the color in the future.

I honestly feel so torn over this. I am not sure anymore if I want the pink dress that badly just because I feel hurt the way my parents reacted to it and made such a big deal out of it. On the other hand, this is what I have always wanted but I do feel like this small of a decision is causing a hige drama for no reason.

1h59slu,AITA for yelling at my sister for putting her phone on DND and leaving her 1st grader at school without picking him up?,"Today at 4 PM, my nephew’s elementary school called me. He’s 7 years old and in 1st grade. He had been left at school for about 40 minutes after dismissal, and the office said they couldn’t reach anyone on his emergency contact list. They asked if I could get in touch with his parents—my sister and her husband.

I tried calling both of them, but their phones were on ""Do Not Disturb."" The calls would ring once and go straight to voicemail, which was odd because their phones should usually ring a few times before going to voicemail. Since neither of them was reachable, I got concerned and decided to go pick up my nephew myself.

While I was on my way, I kept trying to call my sister. She finally called me back about 90 minutes later, saying she and her husband had just been napping. I was furious. It felt incredibly irresponsible for them to leave their child stranded at school and silence their phones, especially as parents of a young child and a toddler.

Her excuse was that her husband had asked his grandparents to pick up my nephew, but there was a ""miscommunication."" I told her that even if that was the plan, she shouldn’t have put her phone on ""Do Not Disturb,"" because emergencies like this can happen. Her response shocked me—she said she likes putting her phone on ""Do Not Disturb"" during naps and, if I was going to react this way, she would remove me from my nephew’s emergency contact list. She also added that I was the last contact on the list anyway because her in-laws (the grandparents) were listed first.

She then accused me of overreacting, saying that ""normal people"" wouldn’t get angry about something like this. She even mentioned that she’s made a lot of new friends this year and now understands how ""normal"" people act. I found this insulting because I was the only one responsible enough to answer the school’s call and make sure her child was safe.

She continued justifying herself, saying it’s normal for people not to answer their phones if they’re busy, at work, or in meetings. She insisted that having her phone on ""Do Not Disturb"" was necessary because she naps with her toddler and needs complete silence. By the end of the conversation, she tried to make me feel like I was in the wrong for being upset. She said I had a right to be concerned but no right to be angry or yell at her.

She then added that she doesn’t like spending time with family because “there’s always an argument” when she talks to us. This left me completely baffled. Instead of showing any gratitude for my help, she threw backhanded insults at me, even though I was the one who ensured her child’s safety. Her reaction made me question whether I was wrong to be upset, but I still feel her behavior was irresponsible and ungrateful.",flippingnoob,14245,0.9700000286102296,2281,1733183813,2024-12-02 17:56:53,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h59slu/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sister_for_putting_her/,12,2024
1h6sdc5,AITA for not letting my sister-in-law live with us indefinitely?,"My (36F) husband's (38M) sister (28F) recently went through a tough breakup and asked if she could stay with us temporarily. She has a history of being irresponsible, often quitting jobs and relying on family to bail her out. My husband convinced me to let her stay for **two months** max, with the understanding that she would get a job and start saving for her own place.

At first, things were okay. She mostly stayed in the guest room, but she quickly started pushing boundaries. She began ""borrowing"" my clothes and makeup without asking, cooking elaborate meals and leaving a mess, and inviting friends over late at night without letting us know.

I confronted her about these things, and she apologized but didn’t change. The real issue started when she made **zero effort** to find a job. She spent her days watching TV, ordering takeout, and complaining about her ex. My husband and I both work full-time, so we’d come home to a messy house and her lounging around.

Last week, I sat her down and told her that since it’s been **three months**, she needed to leave in two weeks. She broke down crying, saying I was being heartless and she had nowhere else to go. My husband sided with her, saying I was being ""too rigid"" and that she just needed ""a little more time.""

I told him that if he wanted her to stay longer, he needed to take responsibility for her—meaning he’d need to handle her meals, clean up after her, and manage her behavior. He got defensive and said I was ""making this into a power struggle.""

Now, my sister-in-law is telling the whole family that I’m kicking her out while she’s ""struggling,"" and they’re calling me selfish. I think I’ve been more than fair, but my husband is still upset with me, and I’m wondering if I’m being too harsh.

1h7n5af,AITA for refusing to sleep in pajamas when sharing a hotel room with my BIL,"This past weekend I (25m) was invited to my wife's cousin's bachelor party. We split off into hotel rooms of two and since I didn't know a ton of people there I roomed with my wife's brother. He's a couple years older than me, and we've gone to the gym together and whatnot but have never been amazing friends. 

The first night there was a decent amount of drinking. I noticed when he got into bed that he wore a sweatshirt and sweatpants. I ended up wearing one of those tank top undershirts and my underwear. I don't think he noticed until the next morning when I took off the covers, and he asked if I had anything else to sleep in. I told him I really only brought jeans but I'd be happy to keep them by the bed and not sit around and talk to him like that tomorrow. 

We had some free time during the day and then had a chiller dinner the second night. When it came time to get to bed he pulled out some pajama pants and a cheap long sleeve shirt and said he brought them for me. I told him I'd wear the pajama pants if it was important to him but I wouldn't wear the shirt. He said it was awkward and admittedly my shirt is one of those tight undershirts. But idk why that matters to him. I ended up getting annoyed and not even wearing the pants to sleep and he said that I wasn't being a good temporary roommate, arguing he was doing a good deed by rooming with me and not one of the people he's closer to.

I went to the ladies' bathroom to wash my hands about 15 mins before boarding (so I could have waited). There was a line of about half a dozen women, and I made eye contact with the one at the front of line and told her I was just going to wash my hands. She had no issue with it. There were 2 sections of sinks, and I went to the one closest to the entrance. The next 5 sinks to the left of me were all unused in the time I was washing my hands. 

As I walked out barely a minute later, a woman towards the end of the line cupped her hands around her mouth as if to broadcast to everyone and said in a very condescending tone ""there's a lineeeee"" and laughed at herself.

They were all his high school buddies. I(27F) get along well with all of them, although we’re not friends outside of my husband. Occasionally the gfs/wives will do something together without the husbands but it’s rare. All of us have kids. 

Today my husband heard that Couple 1 has until tomorrow to be completely moved out of their house so he showed up to their house to help them move out. We have a 1 year old who doesn’t sit still and a few months ago we helped Couple 2 move but I was absolutely useless and in the way because I had to watch our kid and couldn’t be moving furniture or anything because of everything around to get into. 

Needless to say, I did not go help them move today. I’m also 18 weeks pregnant. Well today all of our other friends showed up. All of them! Which is great and I’m glad they had the help, until Couple 3’s wife sent me a snarky text about how everyone showed up except for me and it says a lot. I told her I’m not very helpful when watching our kid and she replied that they all had kids there and it wasn’t an issue for anyone else but good excuse. 

Everyone else’s kids are years older except for one who is only a month old so all he does is sleep. I feel like I’m being judged unfairly and Couple 1’s husband just tweeted about knowing who your friends are because of who shows up for you on your time of need. 
I tried to defend myself further to Couple 3’s wife because also pregnant so I’m not lifting stuff, but she had the excuse that couple 4’s gf was there and is also pregnant. Like that’s great but she’s 5 weeks along and just found out two minutes ago and also doesn’t have a toddler to watch on top of it. 

Now I feel like they all hate me and Couple 3’s wife never responded. I texted Couple 1’s wife apologizing that I couldn’t be there hours ago but she hasn’t replied either.

1hbc5pn,AITA for Refusing to Let My Brother and His Wife Name Their Baby After Me?,"(Throwaway because my family uses Reddit. Names are fake, but the situation is very real.)  


Hi Reddit, I (32F) am currently in a weird situation with my brother, Jake (29M), and his wife, Rachel (28F). They’re expecting their first child, and everyone is super excited. I was too — until they told me about their name choice.


Last weekend, Jake and Rachel made a big announcement. They said they had ""finally picked the perfect name"" for their baby girl. **It’s my exact first and middle name.** Let’s say, for the sake of this post, my name is Emily Rose. They want to name their daughter **Emily Rose [Last Name]** — identical spelling, too.  


At first, I thought it was kind of sweet, but then Rachel said, “we just love how it sounds, and it’s such a strong, classic name.” I asked if they were naming her after me, and Rachel laughed awkwardly and said, “not really, we just love the vibe of it.” So, they’re not even honoring me — they just like my name and want to copy it.  


I told them I was uncomfortable with this. I said it felt weird to have a niece with my exact name and that it might cause confusion in the family. My mom agreed that it was odd, but Jake brushed it off, saying, ""you don’t own the name, it’s not that deep.” Rachel added that I should feel ""flattered,"" not ""territorial.""  


I tried to suggest some similar alternatives, like Emma or Emilia, but they shot down every suggestion. Jake said “we’re set on this name, and it’s happening whether you’re on board or not.” I told them if they go through with it, I’m setting a boundary: I won’t answer to my name at family events if someone calls it, because I’m not playing the ""which Emily are you talking to?"" game.  


Now, Jake and Rachel are calling me petty and immature. My mom says I’m being dramatic, but my dad actually agrees that it’s weird. My friends are split — some think I’m making it a bigger deal than it is, while others say it’s bizarre and creepy.  


To be clear, I know I don’t own my name, but I just think it’s strange to name your kid after a living relative and not even acknowledge that connection. They’re acting like it’s some random, once-in-a-lifetime idea they came up with on their own.

1hbg0jb,AITA for refusing to share my “special” recipe with my cousin who wants to use it for her business?,"
So here’s the deal. I (18F) have this amazing dessert recipe that I came up with after months of experimenting in the kitchen. It's a unique twist on a classic treat, and everyone who tries it says it’s incredible. My family always asks me to make it for gatherings, and honestly, I take a lot of pride in how much people love it.

Recently, my cousin ""Jess"" (24F) started a small baking business from home. She’s been doing pretty well, and I’m happy for her! Last week, at a family dinner, Jess pulled me aside and asked if I’d give her my dessert recipe so she could add it to her menu.

I was flattered at first, but then I told her I wasn’t comfortable sharing it because it’s really personal to me—it’s my “thing,” you know? Jess didn’t take that well. She said I was being selfish and that it’s not like I’m starting a business or anything, so why would I hoard the recipe?

She even got my aunt (her mom) involved, who called me later and said I should “support family” and not be so “stingy.” I explained that I wasn’t trying to be mean, but I worked really hard to create that recipe, and it’s something I’m proud of.

Now half my family is calling me petty, and the other half is staying out of it. Jess posted a vague rant on Facebook about people “gatekeeping creativity” and how it’s “impossible to get ahead with unsupportive people.” My mom says I should just give her the recipe to keep the peace, but I don’t think I’m in the wrong here.

One day, Madison pmed me saying she didn't like how I talked to her in the flat group chat. I'm a very jokey person so though I might of gone too far with my sarcasm, so I apologised straight away. She then didn't reply to my message and didn't come back to the flat for weeks. I got worried as her life 360 was off too.

Simon messaged the group chat:

Simon: ""Yo guys, whose cooker is that? 😅"" (picture of a mini rice cooker).

Madison: ""Mine, lol.""

Simon: ""Inside is only just mould hahah okay.""

Liam: ""Crazy stuff.""

Madison: ""Oh what.""

I gagged when I saw the picture as I remember sitting in the kitchen with her as she cooked that rice. Last month 💀. I took another picture of the rice to send to chat - adding that her avocadoes also went mould and that I few them out. She didn't reply. The next day I reminded her to throw the rice away, it was making the kitchen stink. She responded: ""Has anyone seen my pot?"" 🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️. I pmed her twice reminding her - no reply. I finally caught her at 4 am in the kitchen with her friends. I apologised again to her in person and reminded her to throw away her rice. She told me it was ok and said she would. (she didn't - it was there for another few days) I triple-bagged the rice cooker and left it by the bin, sharing a picture in the chat: ""Madison, please throw your rice away 💀.""

Madison: ""I’m not even there y’all, and I lost my pan."" (she left to go back home for Christmas break in Thailand)

Me: ""Madison, I told you multiple times to please throw that away. It’s a health hazard.""

Madison: ""Bruh, just put it where the vacuum is.""

Me: ""No—it’ll heat up and grow more mould.""

Madison: ""Nah, there’s a lid.""

Me: ""It’ll attract bugs and rats.""

Liam: ""I threw that shit in the bin fr. Was nasty.""

When she left for Christmas, she didn’t clean her fridge section. I threw away food that was going to expire over the holiday, open sauce packets leaking on the shelf, curdled milk, cookies, eggs, and vegetables pooling water. My flatmates said her side of the SHARED fridge was filthy for weeks. I messaged the chat with what I’d done.

Madison: ""K.""

I sent her a video of me clean-up. She complained I was disrespecting her space, claiming the sauces were still fine to eat and expensive. She accused me of nagging and said I shouldn’t touch her side of the fridge area since I don’t use it (I share a mini fridge with Robert). She also said the sauces were expensive. I kinda feel bad for clearing her stuff out, especially as she was having personal problems in her life and was trying to heal. And I did call her a bad word on the group chat  after her ""K"" responses💀. But it was going to expire over the holidays, and as I'm staying in the flat during Christmas, I don't really want to smell that... So, am I the a\*\*hole?",animalcrossinglofi,2952,0.9399999976158142,319,1733956268,2024-12-11 16:31:08,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hc61sr/aita_for_throwing_out_my_flatmates_rice_cooker/,12,2024
1hc7izk,AITAH: My kid wants me to drive 3 hours a day taking them to/from work. I said no. ,"My 20 year old child was offered a job 45 minutes from our house. They have no drivers license yet, and a car that was given to them, but they do not drive due to having no license.

They were just offered a job at a location 45 minutes from our house. Taking them to/from work every day would take me 3 hours. I work from home, and I have responsibilities. Also I just do not want to drive for 3 hours every day. I wouldn’t do that for ANY job. My kid says I should be supportive and drive them, but I am just not going to do it. I told them that this was an unreasonable request, and I’d be willing to do one trip (1.5 hours) only. There isn’t run public transportation here either. AITAH?

Edit: I use the words “child” and “kid” because they are non binary, not because I am implying that they are not an adult.

Edit 2 for more info: They did have a learners permit at one time and allowed it to expire. They did not want to learn to drive with our cars because we have two stick shift vehicles. They have had a car for 4 months that is not a stick shift. A long standing anxiety disorder/therapy is ongoing. We moved to the country(not near public transportation) one year ago from a more urban suburb with public transportation. My adult child does currently have a job 20 minutes away and I spend 1 hour and 20 minutes each day going to/from there. This is due to driving there, going back home (I wfh), then going back later to pick them back up.

Edit 3: For everyone telling me that I need to “check my math” or something of that nature: dropping someone off at work (then going home), then picking them up later in the day (I work from home, so this means driving back to get them) is FOUR 45 minute trips, not two. This is a very basic word problem, and the solution is that all of these 45 minute trips equal 3 hours. 45 x4=180 minutes.

1hc7ofx,AITA for telling my daughter’s father that I will not be doing a Quincenera for her?,"Background: I’m 35(F) and have a 13(F) daughter who wants a Quincenera and I’m not comfortable spending that much money on one event. I’m a Hispanic woman who was born in the US so I’m not a traditional Mexican and my kids are Americanized.

Here’s where the issue comes. My daughter’s father (36) who lives with his mom, pays nothing in child support because he’s in debt(owes IRS/credit card debt). I pay everything for my daughter (school activities/sports/hobbies/clothes/trips) you name it, I pay. I don’t ask her dad because he’s already paying child support for another son he has with an ex. I am fortunate that my fiancé and I make a good income and can afford to be debt free by choosing to make wise money decisions. I have a full-time job, do contract work on the side, and part-time Masters student at my local University (debt-free).

My ex approached me when I dropped off my daughter and said that our daughter wants a Quince and she wants a party where all her family is in one place. I told him I wasn’t doing a Quince but I’d throw a party in our backyard and he was invited. Our house is nice and our backyard was done a few years ago and is big. The other day he said that his cousin had a baby shower at a ranch style and that its $3K for the venue for 250 people. On the phone I freaked because I have a lot on my plate and know how much work it takes to plan an event with a lot of people. He said his family is easily 100 people. I have a lot of family too but I was only planning on only inviting close family and friends. When I tell him ""No this is not a Quincenera but a party with food and DJ with tops 100 people"" he tell me that ""I'm starting to really disappoint him"" and I tell him that I have a lot going on and that I can’t plan something that big with all the stuff I already do and that I don’t want to spend a lot of money. Quinceneras are a lot when you think of the dress/dolls/walce/damas/band and etc. they are time consuming and a lot of money goes into them. He gave me $200 the other day and was planning to give me $100 each pay day. He’s never given me that much money for her since we separated when she was 1.

I have final exams this week and I haven’t been able to sleep for 2 nights thinking of all the stress this is causing me. Should I give him his money back and tell him that we should each do what we can for her on our own? He causes me stress and I swear talking to him is pointless because he makes me feel like I’m the bad person.",Kooky_Excuse_1557,2138,0.949999988079071,631,1733960754,2024-12-11 17:45:54,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hc7ofx/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_father_that_i_will/,12,2024
1hcx4hb,AITA for giving my niece a piece of nicorette?,"Hi Reddit, I need help figuring out if this was just a miscommunication or if I'm in the wrong.

Over thanksgiving I was visiting my fiance's family. We had a great meal, and afterwards I was really wanting a cigarette, but I'm trying to quit so I pulled out a piece of nicorette to kill the craving. My soon-to-be niece (19) Hannah saw me chewing and asked if she could have a piece, and I said no because it was nicotine gum. She got an attitude and went to her mom Cathy and said I wasn't giving her any gum. Cathy told me to giver her some gum, and when I was trying to explain why I didn't she interrupted me and said it's fine, just give her a piece. I figured Hannah used nicotine too and I gave her some.

Cut to 30 minutes later, Hannah is on the couch turning absolutely green. She's complaining about being dizzy and eventually runs to the bathroom to throw up. Everyone feels sorry for her and assumes she ate too much, so she spends the rest of the evening on the couch while we play games and hang out until it's time to go. On the drive home my fiance said it really sucks that Hannah got sick, and I brought up that it seemed like she got nic sick from the nicorette I gave her. My fiance looked at me and asked why I gave her a piece and I said because Cathy said it's OK and I assumed Hannah smoked or vaped or something.

Apparently Hannah has never has as much as one drag from a cigarette, so the 12mg she got from the gum rocked her world. My fiance called Cathy to tell her what happened and now her whole family is saying I'm an asshole, I'm a bad influence, and calling me all kinds of bad names. I tried to defend myself by saying I told Hannah it was nicotine gum and that Cathy interrupted me when I tried to tell her, but everyone is still saying it was my fault for giving it to her.

I think Hannah lied to her mom to get me to give her some gum so she would seem cool or because she wanted to try it, and she's definitely old enough to know better but everyone thinks I'm in the wrong. So reddit, am I the asshole?",toddlerdust,899,0.8999999761581421,159,1734042125,2024-12-12 16:22:05,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hcx4hb/aita_for_giving_my_niece_a_piece_of_nicorette/,12,2024
1hcxi0a,"AITA for refusing to give up my seat at a family gathering because my cousin is ""too old to sit on the floor""?","So, a bit of context: I (19F) am really close with my extended family. We often have big gatherings, and everyone typically sits in a large living room for dinner and hangouts. The seating arrangement usually consists of couches, a few chairs, and a couple of bean bags. There’s also a large rug where people sit on the floor.

Yesterday, we had a family dinner, and I ended up on the comfy couch by the window. It’s the prime spot in the room – near the food, great view, just perfect. My cousin, Myra (38F), was sitting on the floor near me with a few other people. Myra has always been a bit dramatic about things, and she started complaining that she was too old to sit on the floor anymore. She made a whole big scene about how her knees hurt and how no one had the decency to offer her a chair.

I don’t want to sound mean, but I was really comfortable and didn’t want to give up my spot. I jokingly said, ""I’m also not getting any younger and my back hurts, but this is where I’ve been sitting all night."" Myra kept insisting that I should give her my seat because she ""deserves it"" and ""it’s the least I can do."" At this point, I was getting pretty frustrated because, honestly, she wasn’t the only one sitting on the floor—there were at least 4 other people down there, younger and older, who were managing just fine.

I told her I wasn’t moving, and that she could either join the others on the floor or figure something out. This led to an awkward silence for a while, and eventually, my aunt (Myra’s mom) pulled me aside and scolded me for being rude. She said it’s family, and I should be more accommodating.

Now, I feel like maybe I was being too harsh. On one hand, Myra’s being dramatic about her age (she’s not *that* old), but on the other hand, I can see how it might’ve come off as inconsiderate. My cousin still won’t let it go, and I’m wondering if I was out of line.

1hdm9b8,AITA for keeping food from my wife?,"My wife loves fruit. She eats a lot of it and I, as the person who buys most of the groceries, try to keep the place constantly stocked. Apples, peaches, figs, plums, whatever is in season, it's on our counter. Right now it's persimmon season. We both like very different types. She likes fuyu and she likes them firm. I like any kind, but mostly hachiya and like them the texture of pudding. So I leave mine to ripen which can take days to weeks sometimes. Neither of us likes the other's style much. 

This week we got a bunch of each at the farmer's market. I left mine be in a basket in the corner of the kitchen. She ate all of hers by mid week and I got her more at the market and she ate those too. I just stared eating mine today and offered her a bite. She said, no, I'll get my own. And I said, no way, those are mine. I've been saving them and you know how much effort it takes to get them the way I like it, and you don't even like them that way.

She got upset at this and said this has been my thing our whole marriage. I designate food as mine. All food should be anyone's to eat if that person wants it at that moment, she says. I, personally, disagree with this. And I live my life leaving her what is hers, whether it's half of the leftovers or half a piece of cake or whatever. I don't just eat things. I consider her. And I do my best to make sure she has what she likes around. And if I do accidentally eat the entirety of something she wanted I hear it, believe me.

1hdotbc,UPDATE: AITA for leaving in the middle of dinner because of pumkin pie? ,"Hello, 

Since I always wonder what happened to the people who post on here, I thought I'd give a brief update. 

When I wrote that post, I was mentally in a pretty dark place. I think I needed someone, even if it was a stranger on the internet, to validate my feelings and listen. And commenters on here did listen and took the time to write advice that made me think, so thank you.  

Most of you were right, my post was not really about pumpkin pie or cheesecake. The underlying tension between me and my mother has always expressed itself through fights over trivialities and long silences. Many of you have asked me why I, as a thirty year old woman, still go to these events. I’ve asked myself the same question and realise that there is no reason for me to be there. My brother and I do not get along (we never have) and my mother has brought this onto herself. I will be spending Christmas elsewhere. 

However, I feel like my post might have portrayed my mother in an unfair light. I know it does not matter, since you are here to judge a conflict and not a person, but some of the comments seem to assume my mum to be a nasty and mean bully. She is not. She can be very kind and very generous and has done a lot of good for people through her work. She is also terrible at expressing emotion, frustrated by retirement and herself had a very difficult childhood. Our relationship has not always been this bad, and I too have been cruel to her in the past. 

In regards to the actual quarrel: I have sent only a short response to my brother since thanksgiving, ignoring mum's texts. She called yesterday and seems to be hellbend on buying me new shoes. She rarely apologises. I am not strong enough to keep hoping she changes. 

I will address the topic of my childhood with my therapist. 

Happy Holidays everyone.",throwaway3747434,1090,0.9300000071525574,84,1734130864,2024-12-13 17:01:04,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hdotbc/update_aita_for_leaving_in_the_middle_of_dinner/,12,2024
1hedkxt,AITA for Refusing to allow a Recent Widower to have his Annual Christmas Party in my house?,"So we recently bought our house from a man with 2 kids who lost his wife a few months back and had to downsize. We didn’t speak to him much throughout the moving process but recently he sent me an email telling me that he and his kids are really struggling with the move and the loss of his wife. He said that his wife loved Christmas and used to throw a big holiday party every year for the neighborhood and his current house is too small. He said he wanted the holidays to be normal for his kids since it’s his first Christmas without his wife. He asked if he could throw it at our house in 2 weeks and he said he’d pay for and deal with everything and that he could probably use things we already have to decorate.

I feel really bad for the guy but there’s a few reasons I need to say no. The first 3 are not that important but the last one I would say is. Firstly, 2 weeks is very short notice. Second, we’re Jewish and have absolutely zero Christmasy decorations, third the day he said is my husbands birthday and I’d like to celebrate with him that day. All that stuff is kinda petty and can be worked around. 

But we recently got relicensed as foster parents in our new house and a little over a week ago took in two young kids who recently went through a very traumatic life event. I’ve taken off work the next month to stay home and support them. I don’t know how they’ll be in two weeks but I don’t want to confirm that they’ll be ready to have a lot of people over and interact with them. I’ve only left the house with them twice for a little over an hour each time and both were not pleasant experiences. I don’t know if they’ll be able to be out of the house for hours during the party in public or in someone else’s house.

Right now my family is my top priority and I understand his is too which is why it hurts that I have to say no to him. I’m not asking if I should or shouldn’t, I’m not going to say yes. I’m just asking if it makes me an AH. I feel like if I talk about my foster kids he will suggest ways around it and I don’t want to give him the full sob story with everything he’s going through.

1hedo87,AITA for not gaining weight for my sisters wedding so she would feel thinner?,"So to provide context, about a few months ago, my sister, (23F) and I (19F) were both slightly overweight. Not exactly fat but we both would have handled losing 20ish lbs. So eventually I started working out and eventually lost 25 lbs, and I was very happy with myself and actually started to feel confident again. However, my sister had a busier schedule and she never found time to consistently workout. I knew she felt insecure about that because I was noticeably skinnier than her, but we both were able to move past that for a while, until she got engaged. Once she got engaged she really tried losing weight but was never able to lose more than a few lbs, and she was really stressing about that to the point where she would have meltdowns about it. Eventually our mom, 43F came to me and started telling me about how much my sister struggles with her body image, and said to me that she thought I should gain back the 25 lbs for the wedding, because if me and her were together for pictures she would look fatter than me, and she was really worried about that. I refused to do that because I worked really hard to lose weight and I wasn't going to lose all my work. However my mom was very mad at me saying stuff like if I loved her I needed to do what would help her, even if it is hard. I still said no, and my mom then told my sister and she has been ignoring me and my mom said that I could no longer be the maid of honour if I didn't gain the weight.

1hefc4l,AITA for refusing to help my sister with childcare after her son bullied mine?,"Throwaway because some of our mutual friends have my main.

So I (28 F) have a four year old son, Max, with my husband, Tom (29M).  Max was born with cerebral palsy and needs some accommodations.  The main two are his crutches for walking and his AAC. An AAC is an IPad/tablet like device that lets him tap pictures/icons to communicate. Just because he can't physically form the words doesn't mean that he doesn't have meaningful thoughts. He operates and communicates just like any other four year old, and likes to talk about typical things. 

  
My sister Jane (30 F) has two kids, James (10M) and Lucy (6F). Jane is a single parent and works longer hours than both me and Tom. To help her out, James and Lucy take the bus to our house every day. We feed them dinner, and make sure they do their homework stuff like that. Jane comes to collect them between 7-8 every night. Well, Wednesday night, the kids were playing as usual when we noticed James start pretending to walk weird, and make strange sounds. It was exactly the way that Max walks and talks. Tom immediately told him to cut it out. 

He kept doing it though, with Lucy laughing. Max started to get upset. Tom called them both out of the family room and scolded them quite severely. He didn't yell or anything, but was firm. James got very quiet and sat at the table until Jane came. 

Thursday, he did it again. When I asked him why he said that ""His mom told him it was okay."" My blood boiled. I told him he could sit at the table for the rest of the night. When Jane got there, Tom and I took her into the other room. She said that she ""didnt see the big deal"" and that he was ""just joking"". I told her that ableism was never funny and if her kid couldn't act right, he wasn't welcome anymore. She said I was being overprotective, and that people were bound to be mean to Max, and he should learn to deal with it early. I told her my four year old should feel safe in his own house and that I wouldn't help her anymore. 

She said I wouldn't dare, took her kids and left. Friday morning I called the school and told them not to send James and Lucy on the bus to my house. They offer an after-school program that you have to pay for that goes until 7 pm. When Jane arrived to pick them up, I told her that her kids were at the school. She flew into a panic and left to get them. This morning, I started getting texts. How dare I? What was I thinking? I reminded her she would have to pay the bill and her tone shifted dramatically. Suddenly she was so sorry and that she would talk to James. I told her that the damage had been done, and they were no longer welcome. She told me she couldn't afford it. I said it wasn't my problem. Now she's really upset, and might have to find another job.

1hefulh,WIBTA if I don’t call out of work on Christmas Eve to go to family dinner?,"So 3 weeks ago, I (20F) started working at Target and on my 2nd day of work, I had to call out because I woke up throwing up. A team lead talked to me about my call out the next day I came to work. I’m scheduled to work from 2-9:30pm on Christmas Eve and my mom isn’t happy about that because we are supposed to go to my Grandparents house for dinner like we usually do every year. She told me that I’m going to have to call out but I don’t want to risk getting in trouble since I recently already had a call out. I was also hired as a seasonal worker since that’s what they had available and I’m trying to have them keep me permanently and if I call out again, especially on a holiday, that will affect my chances of them keeping me. 

My mom got mad because I said I didn’t want to call out and she started guilt tripping me and saying “it’s messed up that you won’t be at family dinner” “I can’t believe your going to go to work on Christmas Eve” “I don’t understand why you can’t just call out so you can have dinner with the family”. This would only be my first time not going to dinner and a few of my older cousins won’t even be there because they are busy with stuff. WIBTA if I don’t call out of work?

1hf3hjd,AITA for accepting cake at my friend's birthday party?,"So this is a bit of a weird one. I (41M) was at a friend's birthday party on the weekend just past. There were 9 of us at the party including the birthday boy (which is surprisingly relevant). All fake names from here on out.

Amy (30ish F), one of the guests, baked a cake for the birthday boy. After the relevant party traditions of singing the birthday song, and the hip-hip-hooraying that happens after the birthday song here in Australia, I went back to talking to one of my friends when Amy came up to me and the other friend with 2 plates of cake and offered them to my friend and I. We both said yes, thanked her, and then she made a really odd face and walked away. My friend and I both said it was weird, and went back to chatting. I ate some of the cake and it had desiccated coconut inside it, which I don't particularly like, so after a couple of bites, I ignored it and then chucked it out when the party ended about an hour or so later.

About 45 minutes ago, Steven (30ish M), Amy's partner, sent me a series of angry texts (8am on a Monday morning is really not the best time to receive angry texts) saying how Amy spent last night crying about how she didn't get to eat any of her cake and that I took a slice of it only to throw it away and deprive her of her own cake, and that she only cut 8 slices since she knows I don't like coconut, but I took her slice and threw it away to spite her. I replied, ""Why did she even offer me any cake if she knew there was coconut inside?"" Steven said that she did it to be polite and not leave me out, and that I was an asshole for taking her slice and throwing it away.

1hf5o9t,AITA for telling a child no?,"Recently at a school event, the teacher asked if the parent group I'm a part of could provide cookies and cocoa.  I thought it might be nice to also provide things to add to the cocoa,  in this case marshmallows, whipped cream, and sprinkles. 

I had a child tell me that she doesn't drink cocoa and asked for just a cup of whipped cream. (Note she and her friends were the first in line. ) As she ate the chocolate chip cookies, I'm fairly certain it wasn't an allergy to chocolate, just a preference to not drink cocoa.  As soon as she asked, the five other kids wanted to have just a cup of the whipped cream too. So I could see where this would end up.  So I told her no,  that I was sorry,  I only had a limited supply of the whipped cream and if I told her yes I'd have to let everyone do it too and the people behind her in line wouldn't have the cream to add to their cocoa.  I offered her a cup to grab some water, but she stomped away mad.  Five minutes later, her mom came up and asked for a cup of whipped cream, and there was another immediate chorus of people wanting cups of whipped cream too. So I explained again about the whipping cream and the people in line, and mom stomped away mad.  A teacher who was attending the event with her child and not connected to the class or parent group (only add a child in the class) came up and asked,  with the predictable round of ""me too"". I again explained as there is still a line out the door and down the hall,  and only having a certain amount of whipped cream available, if I say yes to this child, I'll have to let everyone get cups of cream too, so I was sorry,  but the answer is no.  When this unconnected teacher caught me with my back turned, she took the whipped cream anyway and gave it to the child.  Which started an avalanche of folks wanting the same thing.  So I kept having to say no,  sorry,  no for the next 45 minutes until everyone had made it through the line.  I will say that we didn't end up running out,  but the last person to use it got the very last bit outof the last can. 

So AITA for saying no,  and for being mad at that person doing it anyway? ",Express-District-317,9364,0.9700000286102296,804,1734306019,2024-12-15 17:40:19,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hf5o9t/aita_for_telling_a_child_no/,12,2024
1hfw5cz,AITAH for skipping Thanksgiving to avoid my cousin’s fiancé? ,"I (27F) am very close with one of my cousins (30F) but I’m not a big fan of her fiancé. They’ve been together for 5 years and at family events he’s either a total grump, he’s drunk or both. 

On Thanksgiving night my family always has the Charlie Brown Christmas movie on in the background after dinner to kick off the holiday season. The volume is almost 0 and it’s just on in the background, we don’t sit around and actively watch.  2 years ago he complained about it being on even though it’s not loud and the football games had already ended when we put it on. 

Last year, he showed up drunk (pretty much belligerent and was slurring words) and he immediately started being rude to my cousin when she tried to give him water instead of beer and he complained about the movie so much that we changed it even though he was in the kitchen and  it was playing in another room. After an hour, I went and put Charlie Brown back on because I love watching it and he wasn’t paying attention so I thought he wouldn’t notice. 

I moved the tv controller under a pillow so he couldn’t change it again and when he realized it was back on he freaked out and started yelling for someone to change it. No one said anything but some of my family members were looking in my direction. Then he full on yells at the table I’m at and told me to “turn the fucking movie off!” One of my brothers got up and told them to leave and he and my cousin left right away. 

He apologized after but my cousin acts like it didn’t happen. It was really jarring to have someone yell and curse at me. 

This year, I skipped thanksgiving because I didn’t want to deal with him and I’m still not comfortable being around him. My aunt and uncle were upset that I didn’t come and tried to guilt trip me. I’ve seen him and my cousin at other events this year and we were cordial. I kinda feel like the AH because I hid the remote but I think I was justified in skipping in thanksgiving. My 2 brothers have been on my side since it happened and so have my other cousins.

1hgo1et,AITA for announcing my pregnancy to my family? ,"My sister in law (37f) has been trying to get pregnant for almost three years now and have had a very rough and tough time trying to conceive. It has always been a sensitive subject around the family and my husband (29m) and I (29f) have held back from having our second child due to this reason. 

We wanted to give her the chance to have a child before we tried for another one. We always wanted to have our first child to be closer in age with their next sibling. Our little one is turning 4 next year and we said now is the time. We tried and had a miscarriage. A month after that we are all happy after knowing we are pregnant again!

Overjoyed by news I shared the news to the family. SIL was upset on how I shared the news and family was pretty in the middle.. ultimately I can’t share my pregnancy to anyone until after my first trimester so I don’t hurt SIL feelings. 

A week after that happened, I shared a story on my social media of a funny skit of a pregnant woman wanting to eat healthy but her pregnancy cravings is telling her to eat chocolate instead. SIL was so upset and told everyone she won’t be attending Christmas with the family. And that I wasn’t understanding her and how hard it has been for her. 

 At this point, I just don’t even want to be pregnant… so people could stop making me feel bad for even expressing any small thing about pregnancy. 

Edit: I shared my good news through our family group chat that we use to communicate with each other. And I also shared it with my over seas friends on my social media when the baby was due.

1hgo739,AITA for stealing a present from a child?,"Last week was my office holiday party with a White Elephant gift exchange. The party invite was for employees and their significant others, so children were not specifically discouraged but through conversations in the office it was clear that people were not bringing kids. One of my coworkers ended up bringing his 10-year old daughter to the party. She is a regular around the office and he often brings her to work events, but at this party she was the only child.

White Elephant is a game where everyone brings a wrapped gift and the first person chooses a present. The next person can either choose a new gift to open or steal a present that someone else has opened. If your gift is stolen you can choose a new present or steal. 

During the gift exchange, which was light hearted and had a mix of real/silly gifts, someone opened a small hand carved and painted wooden dragon. My husband has played DND his whole life, loves dragons, and this was right up his alley. We had both already taken our turns, but agreed that if either of our gifts were stolen we would go straight for that. 

Along comes the kid’s turn. There were other kid friendly gifts available, but she decided to steal the dragon. Several rounds went by and we debated whether it would be alright to steal the dragon if the opportunity came up. It would be fine according to the rules of the game, but since the kid had it would that make it wrong? We ended up undecided, but leaning toward that it was all a game especially since the kid had stolen the item from someone else. 

Eventually my husband’s gift was stolen so he had the chance to pick a new gift or steal. He made a joke about being the Grinch, and chose the dragon. The kid seemed disappointed, but picked another gift and the game went on. She ended up with a remote control Harry Potter wand that was actually pretty cool.

After the exchange was over, she asked my husband if he would trade items. He said kindly but firmly that he was happy with his item and wanted to keep it. Later, I went to the bathroom and found her crying. I told my husband and we went to her father offering to give her the dragon since we didn’t realize she was so upset. He said that it was a good lesson for her and she had actually talked enthusiastically about stealing gifts from people before the whole thing started. 

My husband has the dragon and is happy with it, but it is now a little tainted by guilt. The office seems to be split on the issue. Many people said that he should never have even considered stealing the item from her because she’s a kid and might not have fully understood the game. We don’t have children so may be out of touch on this issue, but the more I think about it the more I feel like she shouldn’t really have been at the party in the first place, and her father shouldn’t have allowed her to participate in the game if she couldn’t understand the possibility of an item getting stolen.

So I genuinely want to know, are we the assholes?",lauradecker1,3825,0.959999978542328,423,1734478702,2024-12-17 17:38:22,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hgo739/aita_for_stealing_a_present_from_a_child/,12,2024
1hgo8f4,AITA for telling my mom’s boyfriend his kids will never be family,"Roughly more than a year ago my mother introduced me to her boyfriend. Since then me and my 3 siblings have been introduced to his three kids and our families have been ‘merged’. Though we still live in separate homes, his family is over our house all the time, but it’s very obvious he is purposely leaving me and my other older sibling out of the ‘family plans’. Last year during thanksgiving, I was informed 3 days before that ALL of his kids (including his adult child) and my 2 younger siblings along with my mother were going to meet our grandparents 6 states over. Me and my older sibling were whiplashed as we didn’t have enough time to pull together funds or time off to join them, we brought this up to our mom and she simply said she guesses we can join them next time and she thought we knew. That left me and my sibling alone for a week during thanksgiving, in which we each just ended up going to a family members house who we don’t see often. We were both very hurt by this incident, and brought to each others attention how many ‘family trips’ they have had (whether it’s a weekend thing or not) without inviting us or telling us until the day of. We’ve kept our mouths shut until now, but since Christmas is coming around, we were getting nervous they were going to do the same thing, thankfully they didn’t but we were told to be sure to get his kids gifts as they are now ‘our siblings’. Having to get gifts for 3 people who we aren’t even close to really sucked, but my sibling and I begrudgingly did so. I don’t remember how it got brought up today, but I found out his kids weren’t getting ANY of my siblings gifts, not even the adult despite them all having jobs. This really pissed me off and I ended up lashing out on both of them, specifically my mother’s boyfriend. I told him that I don’t care about him or his kids, but if he wants to play family he’s not playing the ‘father’ act well at all. He retorted with he doesn’t need to share his life with adult kids and to him we’re just our moms past. I’ll admit I got nasty after this, telling him his kids are baggage enough and my mother doesn’t need anymore kids, and I’ll never look at his spoiled rotten brats as family. This seemed to really hurt my mom and she started crying, her boyfriend screamed at me to leave so I did, I’m staying at a friends right now but I’m wondering if I went to far. I don’t give a fuck if I was the asshole to the boyfriend, I already know that part. But was I an asshole to my mom in this way too? I just don’t want her to forget that she has 2 kids who still see her as their mother and she can’t just forget they exist because her boyfriend won’t acknowledge us. 

Edit: I am 20 and the “older sibling” is 17, I only said older because they are older than my two younger siblings who are under the ages of 10. I pay half the rent and half the household expenses in the house with my mother and without me we wouldn’t be housed (I think everyone knows how expensive it is to live on your own right now, let alone with 3 kids excluding myself). I will be going back home and understand he can’t kick me out of a place my names on the lease on, but I am trying to cool myself down. Did this update to clear some things up for people. 

Update: I came home pretty early this morning to have a talk with her mom when her boyfriend left. I took a lot of your advice and told her how leaving me and my sibling out is not blending the family in any manner, and how I feel like my own home is being invaded despite my contributing significantly. According to my mom her boyfriend didn’t end up spending the night due to them having their own fight. My mother made it very clear that she was pretty ignorant to everything we felt, whether it was on purpose or not, but she started crying last night not only from what I said, but everything her boyfriend had said as well. A big part of their talk after I left was discussing me and my sibling, she didn’t tell me everything they said but they will be taking time away from each other for a little while as my mom agreed that at some point he can’t just leave me and my siblings out, but she also feels I was rejecting him and his kids early on along with my siblings and it’s why she didn’t ‘invite’ us to a lot of things because she didn’t want to put us in uncomfortable situations. This led to me bringing up the fact that I pay half the rent and I would prefer from now on they go over his house in the future, and how I need to see respect from him and his kids and not treat me like a ghost in a house I contribute towards. She understood and said that she herself won’t be seeing him for a while. This then ended with her sobbing again that at some point I will be getting married and the kids need a father. Our dad died roughly 6 years ago due to terminal illness, at this point my parents were already separated but since then my mom has really only had flings, nothing serious. And the older I get the more she fears I’ll leave her in the dust and she will have no one to help her with my siblings or the future. (I know a lot of people said this but I thought maybe you guys were just assuming but I guess she was feeling like she needed to secure herself). Similarly, his kids mom has been dead a little less than 4 years for a similar reason though I don’t know all the details. My mother said multiple times that she can’t expect me to live with her forever and take care of her at the drop of the dime, and how she has been wanting a full time companion for a long time for stability but also for companionship. By this point she had to leave for work and we decided to put a pin in the conversation. I don’t think I’ll be updating much further than this. I thank everyone for the advice and the consideration they gave to my post. I still feel like an AH but I do feel a little less shitty setting the boundaries I did considering over half of you said I should have done it sooner.

1hhdasf,AITA for screaming at my aunt to get the hell out after she called my little sister “Miss Trunchbull”?,"Using throwaway account because I know some of my family are on here. Sorry for any grammar issues English is not my first language.

My (17f) aunt (40f) and nieces (10f and 6f) came over to our house for a visit.

My nieces and my little sister (8f) were playing around the house. They were chasing each other around, I think they were playing tag.

Me, my dad, and my aunt (who is his sister) were sitting at the kitchen table drinking coffee when my sister and oldest niece ran past us. My sister was chasing after her. My aunt suddenly yelled out laughing, ""Don't fall on her and squish her, Miss Trunchbull!""

My sister and I had just rewatched the movie Matilda a couple weeks ago, but I didn't really get the connection until my sister suddenly got very quiet before going to her room in tears.

I looked up the character again on my phone and it clicked. I jumped up and started yelling at my aunt, that led to a screaming match between the both us until she grabbed her kids and left.

My aunt has always been almond mom to her daughters, always saying weird stuff that she ""has to keep them skinny"" and that she'll make sure they're models one day. She has made remarks before to my sister that she eats too much.

My little sister is chubby, not obese, but still chubbier than most of the kids in her class. She has gotten bullied for this before and is insecure of her weight. My aunt knew this since my sister genuinely loves her and talked to her about it before.

I couldn't wrap my head around why she would say something so hurtful. I went to my sister's room and she was crying. She asked me why she can't be beautiful and it broke my heart.

My parents said I overreacted, but I heard them talking in their room about how disrespectful it was that my aunt said that. I'm still grounded regardless.

It's been a week since then but my aunt called last night and basically said she won't see us until I apologize. Now, my parents are urging me to say sorry.

I feel like I was right to have stood up for my sister, but at the same time so I don't want to lose connection with my nieces. I'm really confused if I should apologize or not because maybe I did overreact. I just don’t know.

1hhelb4,AITA backing out of all social events because 1 person I don't like is there,"Throwaway for privacy. I need a truly impartial judgement because everyone I've asked has some skin in the game and is mixed on view.

I (25F) don't like this girl Ellie (28F). I also work with her, at one of my two jobs (important for later). I think she's annoying, wayyyy too performative and I've also caught her telling random lies to our coworkers. I don't like being around her and only interact with her at work if I have to. 

Me and my group of friends were out at a bar a few months ago and Ellie coincidentally was there. She walked over to me to say hi and is now part of my friendship group. All of my friends know how I feel about her, have heard her crazy behaviour at work and why I don't like to be around her. However, the majority of them like her (we're a group of 9) and she's been embraced.

Ellie is a part of our group chat. Most of the time when we make plans, she comes too. I brushed it off the first couple of times but now I've decided not to go to anything where she's also coming. Because I work two jobs, I only have 1 day off a week/fortnight it varies depending on shift patterns. I really value that time and decided I don't want to waste it being around someone I don't like. I've never tried to play the hand of me being in the group first or issuing an ultimatum to pick one of us, I just decline and sit at home. 

As a result, I see my friends about once a month instead of a few times a week (after work when I have energy or on my day off) because I don't want to see Ellie for 8 hours where I can't stand her and then proceed to be in her presence for the rest of my evening. Everyone in the friend group has picked up on it and constantly invite me to plans where Ellie is also attendinng but I keep my stance firm and decline. 

My two friends who like her the most, Grace and Jess, are calling me childish and say I'm forcing them to choose between us but I insist I'm not and I'm happy staying at home (I really am, I can't stand Ellie). They keep calling me to change my mind, even created a separate chat to talk about it but I don't budge and they think I'm being an asshole about it and I should just be a bigger person and go anyway.

1hhex71,AITA for not attending Christmas dinner with my family because it’s at 1 o’clock in the afternoon? ,"For context, I buy the Turkey at £130, dry brine it for 2 days, cook it, take it to my mums house and then cook all of the trimmings while I’m there. This involves many hours of work from me as you can imagine and I have to wake up at 7AM to get all of the timings right. 

The problem with this is that my partner and I barely get any time together on Christmas Day, we’d like to wake up, have a coffee, spend time together, open presents, maybe have a light breakfast and then get to cooking dinner at midday. 

We don’t usually eat breakfast or lunch as we intermittent fast and we’re never hungry for a giant plate of roasted food at 1 o’clock in the afternoon, effectively ruining the Christmas meal for us anyway. 

When children were involved and everyone had to get home early I compromised, even though I still didn’t really understand the whole eating at midday thing, but this year now the youngest child in attendance is 12 I tried to meet them in the middle and say could we maybe have it at 3? 

I’ve been told that I’m selfish and that I don’t compromise and that this is ridiculous. Thus I’ve decided that my partner and I will go round to see the family in the afternoon but not eat dinner with them. We’ll have our own meal at home in the evening, saving me money and allowing us to have the Christmas morning we’ve not had since we first lived together in 2018. 

Additionally, I’ll be able to experiment with flavour for once, sous vide a turkey crown, use the giblets for the gravy etc. 

I also feel it necessary to add that everyone rushes off as soon as they’ve finished eating anyway, there would usually be 8 people in attendance including us and except my mum and brother everyone else leaves, I think it wouldn’t be so bad if we spent the day together after the meal?

1hhfj72,AITA for asking my cousin not to eat my food?,"My (25m) cousin (24f), let’s call her Amanda, has a mental impairment, so she acts about 6-8 years old. She is also a very picky eater, which makes holidays hard for her, and she usually just eats the rolls, and maybe a few bites of whatever the meat is. Her mom, my Aunt Wanda, never brings anything for her to eat despite knowing what food will be there (we have a family group chat so people don’t bring the same or similar foods) and what my cousin won’t eat.

Another cousin (23f), Elizabeth, has a severe dairy allergy, and her sister (28f), Cameron, doesn’t eat gluten. They always make and bring their own food. I am vegetarian and avoid dairy as much as possible, I always make and bring my own food, and eat what I can from what the rest of the family brings. Our family is respectful of our allergies and dietary needs, and does not eat what we bring for ourselves, so we don’t cook a lot since it’s just the three of us. 

At Thanksgiving, Elizabeth brought DF/GF mashed potatoes and gravy, Camille brought salad and a veggie tray with DF dip, and I made a box of DF/GF mac & cheese. I didn’t think Amanda would want to eat the macaroni because it’s not what she’s used to (Kraft or Valveeta), and it does obviously taste different from standard macaroni. She’s very sensitive to small flavor changes like that. 

We had our allergen-free food on a separate table, so people didn’t accidentally take our food when there were larger portions of the same food but with the allergens in them. The only thing that we had that the rest of the family didn’t was the mac & cheese. When all the food was out, Amanda saw the mac & cheese and went straight to our food table. I let her know that it was DF/GF and was for just me, Elizabeth, and Camille, but if she wanted to try some and have some after we get our servings, she could. 

Instead, she ignored me and scooped up HALF of it onto her plate. I asked her to put some back because it wasn’t fair to take all that when I made it for the three of us. She started screaming and crying saying that it wasn’t fair that we have our special food that she can’t eat, when there’s hardly any food for her to eat, and no one makes food just for her. 

I knew with her being in that state that reasoning with her wasn’t going to work, so I didn’t say anything. Her mom came over and took her to sit and calm down. She took one bite of the macaroni, didn’t like it, and threw the plate on the floor. Her mom took her into the kitchen and they made a box of Kraft macaroni for her to eat. Later, my Aunt Wanda told me it was inconsiderate of me to make food Amanda would think she likes, and that I “forced” my aunt to make her food while everyone was eating. 

AITA for asking her to wait until we got our food before taking some for herself?

1hi3tz1,"AITA for ""Booping"" my MIL's nose when she kept touching my baby bump","Hubs and I are 31 weeks pregnant with our first.  We announced our pregnancy at 13 weeks and everyone was SUPER excited since they will be the first grandchild on either side.  I started showing at about 4.5 months and initially tried to be patient with my mom/MIL/Grand Parents/Aunts/Random old-lady-at-the-store when they wanted to touch my belly.  I wasn't crazy about people constantly rubbing my belly like I was some Buddha statue but let it go since everyone was excited.  After a few weeks I got touched out and politely asked people to stop or would nicely say no when they asked, which most people respected.

MIL tends to be overbearing and pushy.  Very much has main character syndrome.  Gets pouty and grumpy when she doesn't get her way. She was the only one that continued to constantly touch my belly even when I tried to say no. She'd always say she's just so excited she can't help herself. The bigger I got, the more it happened.

A couple weeks ago we were visiting DH's relatives for an event and and as soon as we walked in MIL made a beeline over to us.  That day I was just feeling icky - big, tired, uncomfortable, you know what I mean.  I put one hand up to stop her and tried to cover my belly with the my other hand.  She brushed my hand aside and and started rubbing my belly.

So that's when I got super annoyed and gently ""booped"" her on the nose.  I even said ""Boop"".  She just looked really confused and we ended up walking away to go talk to other relatives.  As we were leaving that night, she put her hands on my belly again and as soon as she did, I booped her again.  

We saw her again some days later with one of her friends.  Her friend asked if she could touch my belly and I nicely told her my stomach was all touched out and she was fine.  No drama.  While that was happening, MIL snuck up on my and started rubbing my belly again.  And I booped her on the nose again.

She looked really annoyed and said how irritating that was and asked why I kept doing it.  And I told her that if she was going to keep rubbing my belly after asked her not to, I was going to boop her on the nose. She got mad and said I was being childish and dramatic.  That night she called my husband crying and said I was being mean and embarrassed her in front of her friend.  DH got annoyed with me and said she was just showing how excited she was and that she's from an older generation so it wasn't nice of me to do that to her.  Instead he said I should have talked to her (again) and explained why I didn't want people rubbing my belly anymore.

Tonight after work I stopped by my local grocery store to grab a handful of items to make dinner. 5 items in total. I maneuvered my cart behind an older woman who was slowly navigating putting her groceries on the belt to be checked out. She was the only person I noticed in front of me.

A few minutes later another woman tries to edge her way in line in front of my cart. I gave her a quizzical look and she said ""Oh, I was here before, but I went to go and see if the other line over there was moving faster.""

I said, ""Okay, but you weren't here when I arrived soooo (shrug).""

The woman proceeded to inform me, she was here first and that she should be let back in because she only stepped away to see if the other line was faster. I replied that I did not see her here before I joined the line, so, she could get behind me or go back to the other line.

At this point she showed me that she only had a few things and was shocked that I wasn't going to let her back in (she had 4 packs of jello). I pointed out that I too only had a few things and I wasn't going to move because I did not see her in the line in front of me when I joined.

Now this is where I may be the Asshole. At this point we're both getting frustrated in this grocery store pissing match for pole position. She says ""So you're not going to let me back in? Where's your Christmas spirit?"". I'd had enough of her entitlement at this point and I shot back ""Don't pull that shit.""

Honestly, if I had been behind her in line, I would have happily held her place if she has asked. But she wasn't there when I arrived and she just assumed she could cut back in line after a few minutes. Using Christmas Spirit as a means to get what she wanted was the last straw for me.

In the end she, glared at me and said ""I hope you have a Merry Christmas"" her voice dripping with sarcasm. And she left to go back over to another cashier.

The irony is, we both left the store with our items at the same time.

So Reddit, am I the Asshole for not letting this woman cut in front of me and calling her out when she tried to use ""Christmas Spirit"" to get her way",Fit_Track3827,8888,0.9700000286102296,1319,1734649406,2024-12-19 17:03:26,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hi5pmy/aita_for_not_letting_a_woman_cut_the_line_at_the/,12,2024
1hi6kk3,AITA for leaving my Mom's place after seeing how messy it was?,"Growing up, our house was always messy, as my mom has a hoarding problem. There were always cardboard boxes in the living room, junk everywhere, and dishes in the sink. Over time as I grew up, I realized this isn't normal, especially as I inherited these ha its which lead to roommate conflict (me being messy) when I went to college, habits I'm actively trying to correct. 

That being said, my mom just moved from a 3 bed down to a 1 bed apartment, now that my sister and I have moved to college. I was thinking this would be a great idea, a chance for her to start fresh. I wasn't going to fly home for Thanksgiving originally, but she told me that she needed help moving, so I came. That week was hell. My room had became a storage unit for the past few years since I left, filled to the brim with random boxes of junk. The garage was even worse as we had to rent a uhaul and drive it to the dumpster four times to throw away boxes of papers from 20 years ago, broken furniture, and random junk. It was a constant fight of me convincing her she doesn't need all this and we have to throw it away. We ended up running out of time to finish it all before I had to leave, but made enough progress that I figured she would be alright. We got everything she was going to keep all ready in the new place, set up the furniture, but left a few boxes left she needed to unpack. The main thing left to do was clean out the old garage and throw all that into the dump. She promised that when I got back, the apartment is gonna look great as we spent so much time talking about where furniture would be, decorating the walls, and all.

Fast forward, I come home for Christmas, she picks me up from the airport with my bag and get home. Holy. Shit. It was just like the old house. Filled with shit from the garage to the brim. There are pathways that go from the door to each room, everywhere else is filled. Kitchen is nasty. Smells like dog pee. I couldn't handle it, and walked out immediatly without saying anything. Had a drink at a bar down the street, called my gf, and went back just to grab my bag after she fell asleep, and drove to my Dad's to stay there. Haven't spoken to her since and I'm not sure when I'm planning on it.

My whole childhood I rarely had friends over. We rarely held family events. Living in that mess really messed with my mental state more than I realized at the time. Because of this, I tend to be messier than average, but am doing every possible thing in my power to not be like her. Whenever I visit home for the past few years since I moved away, I never spent the night there because of this.

1hiujuq,AITA for asking a kid to please get off my porch and trying to find out where they came from?,"Reposting since I think it got deleted? Not sure how this works since this is my first one of these.
  So for reference, I (41 F) have generally had a cordial relationship with my neighbors, we don’t talk too much but we talk when we see each other or we need to discuss property stuff. 
  This afternoon I was out Christmas shopping and my security camera notifications start going off like crazy. I looked and it was someone’s kid (roughly 3?) on my porch, pulling on some of my decorations, then I saw them open my mailbox, and pull on the door handle. I saw no adults in sight through the camera. I immediately call my neighbor to see if it’s one of their relatives, no response. 
  I call through the camera speaker and ask the kid to please not play with things on my porch, they didn’t listen. I asked them to please go back to their parents. They stayed on the porch for like 10 minutes and I gave up. Finally I get angry texts from the neighbor, I guess it was a relative. They simply responded with “they’re just a baby”. I said, “look, all I saw was some kid I didn’t know on my porch opening my mailbox and playing with things while I wasn’t there, and it was stressing me and my cat inside out.” They got angry and said “ok cool, hey never ask us for anything in the future. He’s a baby and was just admiring your decorations” clearly pissed at me. 
  Was I in the wrong to be upset that there was a random child on my porch and trying to figure out who they were? I get the kid was young and curious but I personally would never let my kid go up and play on someone’s porch when they weren’t home or without permission?

1hk8gy4,AITA For telling my mom to stop letting my brother get away with stuff just because he’s autistic?,"
I (18F) am the youngest out of three siblings. My oldest brother (22M) has autism. He doesn’t understand like everyone else does and is extremely smart in certain categories. Feelings are not one of them. He doesn’t understand when he does something wrong, and when he doesn’t get his way, things get out of hand.

My father has been on my side for most of this. My brother, who we’ll call Leo, always got his way. He has one cell iPhone, three iPads, a computer, a laptop, a playstation, xbox, wii, etc. I on the other hand have one iPhone and that’s it. When he gets angry, he smashes and breaks his stuff. We have had to replace electronics more than I can count. I tell my mom not to give in, but she tells me off.

She always has the same excuse. “Your brother is autistic, he doesn’t understand!” or “When you grow up you can get a job and start a family, he can’t.” And yes, the family thing is true. But she shouldn’t give in all the time. I tell her he’s not going to learn or that he doesn’t deserve it. I asked her for a monitor for my birthday, and instead I got books. She made up the excuse that we didn’t have the money, but the same day she gets him a new iPad. Which was over $1500. I realized that thats the reason she said no, was so she could get him that on my birthday.

Recently, my family has yelled at me for being “inconsiderate” and “selfish” for expressing how I feel. I don’t know if I should stop trying to speak out and try to stop them from giving into his behavior.

1hkb4ij,AITA for getting my sister chocolate for Christmas after she hasn't put any effort into my gifts?,"Throwaway because my siblings follow my main account. I (18NB) am getting my sister (15F) a chocolate box for Christmas this year because for years now she has not bothered with my gifts at all, Christmas or birthday. Usually she gives me stuff she's been gifted in the past like bathbombs or makeup which I can't use due to skin irritation and also feeling gender dysphoria when I wear makeup. She is well aware of this as I politely tell her when I open the presents. She doesn't have a job and therefore no income which she uses as an excuse despite the fact our parents give her quite a bit of money to buy people gifts for Christmas and birthdays. Last Christmas, she got our stepsister the dress and book she had asked for whereas I got an eyeshadow palette that I had seen her using the week prior and I notebook I had given her for school which she hadn't used. I thanked her for it but later reminded her that I couldn't use the makeup. She shrugged and said ""well at least I got you something"".

What upsets me the most is our dad has a whole thing about us getting gifts for relatives that have a lot of thought and meaning. I say us but it seems this rule only applies to me. I get her the things she asks for every birthday and Christmas. I pay attention when she mentions wanting something in passing and make sure to get it for her when her birthday and Christmas come up. She doesn't.

A few weeks ago, I did my Christmas shopping and I knew she wanted two specific posters for her room but decided because she has made little to no effort for me, I would get her a box of chocolates from Hotel Chocolat. I got a type of box she has said she likes in the past though just because I didn't want to be an utter jerk.

This evening (the 22nd of December) we were having dinner and my sister mentioned she was going out tomorrow to do last minute Christmas shopping. I said ""are you actually going to get me something you've never owned this year?"" as a joke which I realise I shouldn't have. She said ""what's that supposed to mean?"" and I mentioned how she never puts effort into any of my gifts where I always do. Then I said ""well, as I always did"" which was a bit of a dick move on my part. She asked me what I meant and kept demanding to know what I got her for Christmas despite me telling her it would ruin the surprise. Our dad chimed in and demanded to know what I got her so I said ""a chocolate box from Hotel Chocolat"". She went off at me saying that she didn't want a chocolate box, she wanted posters and I responded ""you never bother with my gifts, why should I do the same?"". My dad is saying I need to go out tomorrow and my sister is calling me selfish and ungrateful. I feel quite childish and have apologised to her but she doesn't care.

1hkz735,AITA for not allowing my daughter to quit piano?,"Over the summer, my daughter Annie (14) asked for piano lessons. My wife and I were surprised since Annie had never shown any interest in music. But Annie assured us that she was serious. Since she’s a straight A student, we didn’t doubt her.

It's also important to note that my wife and I have a rule that our kids can participate in any (reasonable) extracurricular activity, but they have to stick with it for a year/season before they can quit.

Annie started lessons in right as the school year started. She practices for at least an hour every day, and her teacher has spoken positively to us about her dedication and rapid progress.

Earlier this month, my wife and I went to the end-of-semester recital that Annie’s teacher requires his students to perform in. We thought that she played beautifully, but during the car ride home Annie told us that she wanted to quit piano. I asked why, and she said that she was embarrassed because a. She played the same piece as a 6 year old and b. Emily played a well-known Chopin piece. 

Emily is Annie’s former best friend. Since both girls are very competitive and were always at the top of the class, they went from friends to frenemies. AFAIK, they still hang out in larger group settings but not one-on-one.  

I reminded Annie of the ""no quitting before a year"" rule and suggested switching piano teachers if she wanted to avoid playing during the same recital as Emily. But Annie said that it didn't matter if she switched teachers because Emily already knew how ""bad"" she was at piano.

Thankfully, my wife is 100% on my side here, but several family members who are w/ us for Christmas have said that I should let Annie quit piano.",CarefulSalt5503,1171,0.9200000166893004,448,1734993087,2024-12-23 16:31:27,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hkz735/aita_for_not_allowing_my_daughter_to_quit_piano/,12,2024
1hlrwqq,AITAH-My 17 YO sister has ruined my christmas break ,"UPDATE: The car is returned, but I have not talked to my sister since. 

So, I am a first year college student. I’m a pre-nursing student who finished with good grades. If me saying i’m a first generation student helps then there it is. I have been home for about 2 weeks and have absolutely hated it. I’m back here with my fiancée but other than that i’ve had no real reason to feel happy being here. My family is very poor, I am fortunate enough to have a car because I am in college and live hours away. I have earned this car by respecting my parents and keeping up great grades while doing nearly every extracurricular activity offered in highschool. My sister on the other hand has had two cars. The first one wasn’t very nice so it has some mechanical issues, the second one she crashed and it is now totaled. Since then, she has not stopped talking about getting a new car. I worked my entire highschool career and believe it helped me in many ways. She has yet to get a single job and i can see how different me and her are. After she talked about the brand new expensive ass car she wanted for “college”, I told her it was unrealistic. I told her our family is poor, and we can’t afford brand new cars. I told her you will need to get a job and earn a car, and also get your license. This made her go ballistic. She called me many names such as narcissistic, spoiled, and unworthy of life. My heart actually shattered. I have never done anything in my life to make her say these things to me. I have drove hours and spent so much money on my sister to only get this back. I have tried so hard to love her. I just began crying after she told me these things outside of my grandparents house. Later in the day, she has my car. I begin to panic because i do not trust her with my car. It’s a 2017 Ford Escape and it is my only source of transportation to college. If she wrecked my car, I’d have to buy a new one myself. I text her and ask her to come home please, very politely. She then tells me she is busy and will not return my car. I continue to text her and politely tell her to return my car. The only thing she says next is “i really wish you were dead.” This happened around 30 minutes ago and I still feel like I got shot in the heart. I’ve never felt so much internal pain in my life. It’s also christmas eve, and my parents have done nothing to calm the situation. She talks to me, and my parents this same way and i can’t do it anymore. I left the house to go spend the night at my MIL’s house because i can’t stand to see her after this. How am I going to open presents and give presents in the morning knowing that my sister thinks of me this way. I just wish i lived a different life at this moment and don’t know what to do. She has not tried in school, she has done nearly nothing to respect my parents and has done nothing to prepare for her future. I just don’t know what to do.

1hls0os,AITA for parking next to a car that parked on the line?,"I’m blown away by this opinion and need to crowdsource validation. 

Tonight, I drove CVS to pick up popcorn for a Christmas movie with my kids. I parked in the closet open parking spot to the door. 

When I get out, I notice the car next to mine was very close. I had to squeeze through a cracked door just to get out (Note: I made sure I did not touch their car with my door at all). 

I double-checked to see if I parked poorly and I was right in the middle of the spot. However, the car next to me was on the line. Not over the line, but the wheels were touching the line.

For context, I have a Chevy Bolt, a small EV car. The other car was a midsize suv, like a Toyota RAV4.

I didn’t think much of it. My kids were waiting and I wanted to get in and get out.

When I come back, the owner of the other car is checking for possible dings (presumably from my car door opening). They were about to get in when they saw me walk up to. Then, we had this interaction.

Them: Is this your car? 
Me: Yes, it is.
Them: Why did you park next to me when there are so many other spots? *there were other open spots in the row behind our cars*
Me: I just parked in the closest spot to the store.
Them: You’re so close to my car when you could have parked anywhere else. 
Me: I’m parked in the middle of the spot and you’re on the line.
Them: If I ding your car with my door, “it’s more your fault than mine”.
Me: You’re car is on the line.
Them: “That’s not really relevant.” *says as they gets in her car*

Am I the asshole here? I never would have thought to check if the cars on the other side of me had parked well before I pulled in.

TL;DR: I parked next to someone whose car was on the line, making our cars very close. They said it’s my fault if their door dings mine since I could have parked elsewhere.

1hlsetw,AITA for telling people I'm not having fun when they ask and I'm genuinely not?,"This one is general. I am a guy who, when I don't enjoy something, I'll tell you I don't, but if I commit to something, I'll see it through to the end without complaining.

This comes to a head where I was on vacation with my older brother in Arizona, who wanted to do a lot of nature hikes. Nature hikes are fine. I don't *mind* them, but I do dislike walking up large hills. Walking downhill is the easiest thing ever, it's like being nature's passenger princess. You just put your foot forward and let gravity do all the work. Walking uphill conversely is very draining and leaves me sweaty.

I don't make a point to complain about something when I do it, so when I was walking uphill, despite not liking it much, I held basic conversation with my brother. 

As we were heading back down, he asked me if I was having fun and I said no. Not because of any fault of my brother, I just didn't find the activity fun. Not even bad, just satisfactory. Later when he was driving me to the airport for my flight home he told me ""If I ask you if you're having fun, don't say 'no.'""

I understand that it can be demoralizing to hear someone's not having fun, but I don't like it when people ask for my opinion and get upset when I give my honest answer.

1hlsety,WIBTAH for not going to my husband’s family’s Christmas?,"I am a first responder and have been for the last 3 years. My schedule is a rotating shift pattern (days/nights). The pattern is consistent and I can tell you what days I’m working very far in advance. Because of this, I told my entire family last year that I would be working on Christmas this year and reminded them when we saw them. This is the first time I have had to work on Christmas. 

My side of the family understands and we are celebrating with just my parents and siblings another day. 

My husband’s family is really into Christmas. Like everyone needs to be at SIL’s house at 8am to open presents together and then we spend the entire day together. So when I asked if we could celebrate together another day over the holidays instead it got shut down with statements like “Christmas is on December 25th.” or “I don’t understand, can’t you just ask for the day off?”  So I let them know my husband would be attending solo this year.

This morning while I was at work, my husband (who works a 9-5 and is enjoying his day off) texts me “it would be nice if you could come by for a couple hours tomorrow after work..”  I declined because:
1. SIL lives ~90mins away, so that’s 3 hours of driving. I would be driving home alone at night with not the best weather.  
2. My job can be very stressful and my social battery is drained by the time I get home.
3. We already agreed that it made more sense for me to stay home and to have him go to his parents house on Christmas Eve so they could drive over in the morning together.. 

Well my husband is pissed and thinks that I don’t want to spend time with his family. He’s been sending me passive aggressive texts all day trying to guilt trip me… “we don’t know how much time we have left with my parents…” It’s working because I feel like I’m letting everyone down and I don’t want his family to think I don’t want to spend Christmas with them.  

WIBTAH if I stuck to our original plan instead of making an effort to go see his family tomorrow after work?

*I am locked out of commenting till Jan 2nd so I’ll just reply here* 

Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond, I was really upset last night and it’s nice to get an outsiders perspective. One of the comments said “it’s not the date it’s the day” and I’ll be using that from now on. A couple of you guessed right, yes, part of my job is answering 911 calls. My husband mostly understanding of how our shifts work but I usually get pushback on long weekend or celebrations. I have been trying to convince him to come in for an observation shift so he can finally understand, but he’s doesn’t feel comfortable listening in on the calls.  

I haven’t confirmed but I think what may have caused him to even request my appearance is that his father, who is in the early stages of dementia, may have asked what time we were both coming over, forgetting I was not coming over.  

This shift schedule is still new to him, and he hates showing up to events without me and having to explain to everyone I’m not there because working. This is definitely something we are going to have to work out before we try and have kids.

1hltmaz,AITA for getting engaged after my brother’s wedding?,"EDIT: paraphrased some direct quotes and removed some potentially identifiable info. 

My brother and his now wife got married three days ago. A very small destination ceremony under 15 people total. My now fiancé and I extended our trip after everyone went home and spent a couple of days exploring the Grand Canyon, a couple hours north of the wedding, where he proposed. 

When I shared the news with my brother and now SIL, he responded with hostility saying that it looked like we were competing.

I apologized, quickly realizing that he was advocating for my SIL and that she felt hurt (although I’m truly failing to understand why). I also texted her a separate apology and explained that it was not our intent to encroach and just wanted to share the news with family and that it’s my belief that there’s room for happiness for everyone. She did not respond. 

In response to my apology, my brother doubled down and said the timing and location were hurtful and that we shouldn’t planned around the wedding.",andthatsfine,7407,0.959999978542328,16,1735100679,2024-12-24 22:24:39,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hltmaz/aita_for_getting_engaged_after_my_brothers_wedding/,12,2024
1hltor3,AITAH for not allowing my mom to stay another week after her pipes burst just before Christmas?,"38/F I am celebrating Christmas with my mom 68/F, my brother 47/M and his family. My mom flew in from out of state and we are driving to a meetup location to spend time with my brother's family - a place in the mountains we all enjoy just for the holidays. All of us live hours away, our mom being the furthest, on the opposite coast. My brother and I are several hours away by car.


This year, we received the bad news that, while my mom has been at my place, her pipes froze and flooded her basement. She is upset, understandably, I helped her get everything started and have her insurance, a cleanup team and a general contractor all working on her place while she is with me. She then broached the topic that she wanted to extended her week stay to ""two weeks or more"". I said no, I need to get back to my regular routine and get ready to return to work. She's welcome to stay here as originally planned, which is until Saturday.


Then she said she may ask to ride back with my brother and his family to their home in another state (opposite direction than me). She refused to ask him until Christmas, so l gave my brother a heads up last night so he has a chance to speak with his wife. I also told him that he's under no obligation to say yes, as she is still welcome to stay with me until Saturday and her insurance company will be footing the bill for most of her stay at a hotel and meals (IF, BIG IF, her residence is uninhabitable, which we do not know at this time).


He told me he didn't have room to take her back with him (3 people in his car and no room for a 4th -assuming luggage is the issue). That I should let her stay with me because she's lonely. I told him I understood that, but I'm not wrong for wanting to cap my time with her at the one week originally planned. He had left that text on ""send"". My mom can be a challenging personality and with this unfortunate development, she's even more ... difficult. I love my mom, but I'm tired. I want my house back and don’t want to be criticized or complained at. I refused to allow my lonely mother to extend her stay with me, despite the recent damages to and unknown state of her home.

1hs6t1j,AITA for telling my girlfriend that her friend is too ugly for my friend?,"I’ve (29m) been with my gf (28f) for the past 8 months and it has been amazing. I’ve met her friends and I really like them all, and she’s met my friends and they all got along great. We are all hanging out together for the first time this weekend. The issue is that my gf has told one of her friends, let’s call her Sue, that she thinks she would be perfect for one of my friends, let’s call him Mike. She has told her this multiple times, shown her pictures of him, and gotten her all excited. My problem with this is that I don’t think they are a good match at all. Mike is a very good looking guy, in great shape, is 6’2” and is a lawyer. He has always dated very conventionally attractive women. Sue is great and I really like her, but she is just not very conventionally attractive. She is overweight and just doesn’t put much effort into her appearance in general. 

My gf has mentioned this potential match to me a few times, and I’ve always just kind of brushed it off with a “we’ll see” or “you never know” hoping it would just fizzle out, but after we made plans to all hang out and after I found out she has been telling Sue about it, I felt like I had to say something to her. I didn’t want Sue to get her feelings hurt, and I didn’t want to put Mike in an awkward situation. I told my girlfriend I think she should not try to set them up together, and to just leave it alone, and if something happens between them, great, but not to push it. When she asked why, I said I just don’t think they are a comparable match looks wise, and that I think Sue would get her feelings hurt. I said I don’t think they’re a great match personality wise either, since he is super active and she is much more of a home body. This caused a big fight (our first real fight) where she accused me of thinking my friends were better than her friends, asking who else I thought was “ugly”, etc. I was genuinely just trying to avoid an awkward situation, but I might have made it worse. Should I just have kept my mouth shut and let it happen?

I was watching a comedic British show with my friend ""Carly"" and we were having fun and making jokes  and stuff like that. I said ""I love this show. I wish British people were real."" As a joke, obviously. It was supposed to be unserious and stupid but Carly gave me a weird look. She said that's a weird thing to say. I was taken aback because she's seen me make much more weirder jokes than that and I had no idea why she was hung up on this one. But I apologized and told her it was a joke and I obviously didn't think british people are not real. I followed up by saying that on a serious note I like British culture, otherwise i wouldn't be watching this show. She asked how I would have felt if she said Korean people weren't real (I'm Korean) I told her I would also take it as a joke as long as youre not offending me or my food or whatever. She scoffed and just kept watching.

I didn't know this joke could be insensitive. I mean, I know it's kind of a stupid joke, but I didn't know it could offend like that. She's not even British! So I'm doubting myself on whether this was offensive or not.

It’s very old; but it’s beach front and surrounded by nature, great cafes and eateries etc. Our family have been planning to come down here for months, however my sister was always tentatively coming due to being heavily pregnant.

She gave birth on the 2nd of jan, of which I was there for. The following day my partner and I decided to head down to our holiday house as planned. My sister and her new baby, 3 year old and her partner decided they wanted to take two rooms - the two best ones - due to having a baby and wanting to bring their days old baby to the holiday house. My partner and I had already set up in one of the rooms they requested and had intentionally come down earlier to nab a good room. This is because I have severe skin allergies. Downstairs is very dusty in our holiday house and even when it’s just cleaned and I use my own bedding from home, I still get eczema flare ups pretty bad.

1htqwgu,AITA for booking a hotel in the same area as my son and dil’s trip that we didn’t get to go on?,"My son and his fiancée of six years go on a family trip every year with her extended family. From what my son tells me, they travel to different locations and rent an Airbnb that accommodates the 30 people who attend. For the past three years, they’ve gone during the holidays, and as a result, we rarely see them. My future daughter-in-law (DIL) and I have a good relationship, but I can’t say we talk much.

My son and his fiancée are planning a trip in March for spring break, and I asked my son when we might be able to plan a trip together in the future. He mentioned there might be enough room at the house they’re staying at. I told him that sounded great and asked him to let me know the costs for everyone attending. My 24-year-old son, 22-year-old daughter, and 3-year-old grandson also live with me, so we all planned to go.

A few days later, my son told me that we’d likely have to sleep on a couch or share one of the kids’ bunk beds if they were available. I assured him we’d make it work, and I sent him our share of the costs. I also told my kids, who were very excited—this would be their first vacation that’s more than a three-hour car ride away.

Last week, my son called and told me it wouldn’t work for us to join them after all, and he sent back the deposit. When I asked why, he explained that his fiancée didn’t feel comfortable with us coming. She was upset because I didn’t attend her engagement dinner last year to meet her side of the family, which she felt would make it awkward to share the vacation rental. She was also upset that I didn’t reach out to her directly to discuss joining the trip, leaving my son to relay the information instead.

I told my son it was fine, but I ended up booking a hotel about 15 miles from where they’re staying. I also told my son he didn’t have to worry about making time to see us. Now, my DIL is upset because she feels that we’re still somehow taking away from their trip.

1hts6wj,AITA for refusing to watch my neighbor’s kid before school because she kept nagging me?,"I F35 am a stay at home mom with two kids “John” M10 and “Ava” F8. My neighbor “Zoe” F42 works full time and asked at the beginning of the school year if she could drop off her daughter “Sue” F9 an hour before school started twice a week. I agreed and was happy to help out a neighbor. However, things got bad pretty quickly.

My kids do not get along well with Sue and see entertaining her as a chore. Both of my kids enjoy sports, arts, and playing outside, while Sue is glued to her phone. Despite this, Sue pouts when my kids do their own thing instead of trying to engage her. Zoe called me a few weeks into the school year to nag me for having the kids walk/bike to school, saying it was unsafe and asking me to drive Sue. I told her no–if Sue was old enough to have a phone she was old enough to walk/bike to school. A week later, she asked me to cook real sausage for Sue in addition to veggie sausage I make for my kids (my husband and I don’t buy meat). I told her no–Sue could eat what I cook but if she wanted specific food she would have to prepare it herself. 

For the first semester of school, Zoe nagged me with similar requests. Don’t play songs with explicit lyrics, don’t let multiple kids on the trampoline simultaneously, watch the kids when they’re outside, etc. When I refused, she was respectful and would be like “sorry to bother you” but she still had new requests every week. At the end of the semester, I told her I was not going to make adjustments to our family lifestyle and inconvenience my family for the sake of her child. Sue’s safety was not at risk. If she was unsatisfied with Sue’s situation, there were plenty of other people in the neighborhood who could watch her. Zoe seemed really receptive, and I was hopeful that would be the end of her nagging.

When my kids got home on December 20th, I asked, “Are you excited for 2.5 weeks with no school?” and John responded “I’m more excited for 2.5 weeks with no Sue.” Ava nodded and giggled along. It broke my heart to know that they were more happy to get a break from Sue than school.

Just a couple of days ago, Zoe reached out to me thanking me for agreeing to watch Sue and asking if I could watch her a couple afternoons a week in addition so Zoe could have some “me” time. I told her this would no longer work–our kids did not mesh well and I didn’t want to deal with more inappropriate requests. 

I thought Zoe might be mad, but instead she just begged me to watch Sue at least one morning a week. She apologized profusely and said I could parent however I wanted to. This made me feel bad because she genuinely needed my help and did not know what she would do. I told her I knew I could and that her apology was too little too late.

My husband and kids stand by my decision, but some of the other moms think I should have been more accommodating, saying I’m selfish, that moms help moms and I’ll never know when I might need help. Does my refusal to help Zoe make me an asshole?

Update: Thank you for the responses. It was so validating to see that you support my actions. The moms in my neighborhood didn’t, but at least a few hundred strangers on the internet did. I want to address some common comments and hopefully provide reasoning as to why I initially agreed to help Zoe. In addition, there are some new developments I’d like to share

First, I want to give background. This shouldn’t change the verdict, but hopefully it makes you think I’m less of a doormat. Zoe is married but her husband works in a city 2 hours away and is hardly ever home, and Zoe herself works a demanding job with weird hours. They already pay a fortune for their nanny, so I was happy to lift some of the burden. She did not pay me. This may sound snobbish but my husband makes a lot of money, so an extra few dollars didn’t seem to be a huge deal. Plus, one of the things I enjoy most as a stay at home mom is getting to do these things for other families (so long as they are pleasant) and having a house full of happy kids. Not to get too personal, but I grew up in poverty with alcoholic parents. My parents struggled to put food on the table and our utilities frequently got shut off, so it was often the kindness of our neighbors that kept me fed, clothed, clean, and maybe even alive. So yeah in retrospect I shouldn’t have agreed to do so much for Zoe for free, and I have learned from my mistakes, but hopefully this can help you understand why I did it in the first place.

Now onto the story. One of the moms who is close to me “Jen” reached out asking what happened with Zoe. I thought everyone knew, but I recalled the events of the semester leading up to a couple days ago. Jen said that’s not what she heard. Zoe had told everyone that she paid me $100 an hour and that I let the kids watch R rated shows and eat candy for breakfast and I called her a “stuck up bitch” when she asked me not to. She told them my kids bullied Sue so relentlessly that she came home crying every day she came to my house, and that I encouraged said bullying. When Zoe complained about this to me, I supposedly denied it. To top it off, I demanded Zoe pay me $200 an hour or I would stop watching her “little brat.” I was horrified that Zoe was spreading this misinformation about me. I assured Jen that none of it was true, showing her receipts of my text exchanges with Zoe. Jen told me she believed me and promised to help me set the record straight. I just don’t know what to do because none of the moms will talk to me and all of the playdates John and Ava had scheduled were cancelled. I worry because even if we can convince everyone that Zoe is a liar, people will still be suspicious of me. My family has only lived in this town for a couple of years and Zoe’s family has lived here much much longer. I can take my reputation being tarnished, but I worry especially for my kids. I don’t want their friendships to be ruined by some girl who can’t accept my decision to not provide free childcare.",friendlyneighbor154,4654,0.9700000286102296,440,1736035004,2025-01-04 17:56:44,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hts6wj/aita_for_refusing_to_watch_my_neighbors_kid/,1,2025
1hts7rx,AITA for telling my sister that my nephew is NOT my baby? ,"My sister (23f) lives at home and has a 6 month old baby. She never moved in with her boyfriend because they live far from each other and neither of them wanted to compromise. Her baby daddy never ever comes around, he’s seen their son probably less than 30 days total of his entire life. And because of this my sister has been treating me (21f) and my mom as his other parent. She expects free childcare CONSTANTLY while she works and whatnot and gets very upset when I act hesitant about it for whatever reason. Because she doesn’t want to send him to daycare (she’d be eligible to get free childcare in our state but doesn’t trust it). 

And I love my nephew to death but these are MY child free, college years; I have been parentified and forced to play mommy for my little siblings for years, and just when they’re getting to the age that they don’t need me so much I don’t think I should be forced to step up and play mommy to another child who isn’t mine. Especially when I’m on winter break for the next couple of weeks and just want to enjoy sleeping in way too late and being lazy before I’m thrown back into full time college (this has been happening for 4 months at this point though). So when she asked if I’d watch him tomorrow I got a bit of an attitude but ultimately said yes. But to that she got snappy with me and was like “Why do you always act like you don’t want to do it?!” To which I got upset and responded “Because he’s not my kid and I shouldn’t be expected to do this all the time.” 

She got VERY angry at me and is now not talking to me at all, and is surely going to weaponize my nephew against me. And to an extent, sure I understand her anger: I know that you should be able to rely on your village and I don’t know if I’m in the wrong for not wanting to do this. But I am so tired of taking care of other people’s children all the time for free, even if I love the kids to death. I can’t tell if I’m being selfish or not, AITA here?

1huj9e2,Update - AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding?,"My husband and I just recently celebrated our first anniversary, and I was thinking about all the dress code drama when I remembered this account and thought it would be fun to give y'all a little one-year update!

After I made my original post, my husband and I decided to contact my sister and parents and have a sit-down discussion about the situation. He offered to take everyone out to eat, and we had this really long discussion about my sister and my relationship.

My sister said she made a promise to herself never to let that happen again, and that if I wanted her in my life, I needed to be a normal person. My husband told her that if she was going to keep humiliating me for something I did as a child, then she wasn't a normal person either. It became a bit chaotic. My dad took our side, and said my sister's taking things too far. My mom took my sister's side, and said that, since I have NPD, I'm not capable of real change and if they ever give in at all they'll be hurting my sister. It ended with my sister calling my father an enabler and threatening to cut him of. It wasn't a great dinner overall.

What surprised me is my sister's husband. She called me the next day at his recommendation, and we talked for a long time. She told me that she doesn't want to feel like ""a side character in the (my name) show,"" and that was how it was for all our childhoods. I told her that I feel like I'm not allowed to have meaningful relationships with any of our family, since she restricts what I say and do and wear around them. I pointed out that she controls my clothes for like every family event, and this is my wedding, and she admitted that was a good point. Eventually, she agreed to attend the wedding in a really cute black and white checkerboard dress and leave if it became too much.

The wedding itself was incredible. It was the second-best day of my life so far and my sister said she was genuinely happy for me. I felt like a princess in a fairytale the whole day, and my husband was the handsomest prince in the universe. The whole thing was under the stars, it was perfect. I could talk about it forever, but character limits. As a wedding gift, my sister told me that she was going to start letting me wear what I liked at family gatherings, and talk about my accomplishments, AND talk about myself when it's just me and her a little. And she has, and it's been great. The only better gift I got that night was my husband himself.

This past year has been the best of my life, and I genuinely feel so much better about life and family these days. I'm a girlmom now, and I'm so glad my daughter gets to know her aunt and cousins too. I'm even allowed to babysit for my sister sometimes!

TL;DR: Everything really worked out, and it was a lot because this place helped me have confidence that I wasn't wrong. Thank you guys so much, and have a great new year!",ThrowRAgoldenbride,1254,0.8999999761581421,550,1736116075,2025-01-05 16:27:55,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1huj9e2/update_aita_for_wanting_people_to_wear_white_at/,1,2025

He begun to speak on how he was really on a rough financial spot, and he really had nowhere to turn to as he didn't have anyone to ask for a loan from and I was the only one left available.  Mind you I'm not rich or anything of the sort, I just happened to have the amount he needed at the time.

According to him it was a serious situation that he couldn't approach or tell other guys in the family, and the issue needed to be addressed soon. Without better judgement I lent him the cash after much insisting from him. We agreed on payment before December, and I didn't even ask for any interest on it. With lots of hugs and words, he took it and gave me his word on the paying it.

Fast forward and we are now at Christmas dinner at my grandma's house, and all that time I didn't give him any reminders or a checkup. I assumed he was late or something and he would let me know why at Christmas dinner because the larger family meets every year for that. He also didn't call or say anything to update on his situation and I just had to trust all was well. Now on a related side note for later, my cousin Aisha, (20, Daniel's daughter) recently underwent surgery a while back as she really had it tough for the whole of last year while she recovered from a traumatic back injury from an accident.

Everyone was enjoying their meal and suddenly my uncle stood up at the dinner table and called for attention for a speech. He began to speak on how his business took a really huge boost and long story short, how he has just cashed in a large profit from some deals. He looked at Aisha across the table and took out some brochure with some resort looking location and said it was a gift to her for her tough recovery from the incident. All I could see was Aisha visibly crazy excited. Someone asked what it was exactly, and Daniel said he was planning on taking Aisha and the rest of his family to the Maldives as a celebration on Aisha's accident recovery. Everyone was now happily cheering Aisha on her gift as it seemed it was something she always wanted to experience.

""You can afford all that but not repay my debt which you haven't said anything on,"" the words just slipped out of my subconscious mind as I looked at him straight in the eye. His words were ""why are you talking about that now of all places"". Now I was pissed, I reminded him Infront of everyone on the exact amount and I told him the fact on how he wasn't even communicating on repaying it. The entire family was in shock with dead silence as my mom hurriedly changed the subject to avoid an escalation of the situation. Later on, in the evening my aunt, grandma, and some cousins began to lecture me on how I ruined Aisha's moment after her struggles and embarrassed my uncle in the process.

They leave in a week, and he still hasn't paid or mention anything on the debt.

1hxnbq2,AITA for not cleaning my sister in law after she got sick drunk. ,"Between Christmas and New Years, me (43m) and my wife (43f) went to hang out and drink at my sister in laws (32f) house while her husband (wife's brother) and son went away for a few nights. Basically a normal night, my wife and I went over to keep my sil company. Played board games, drank etc.... My sil is very proper, fashionable, basic white girl. Maybe 5'2 and 100lbs. Anyhoo, we're in the living room, my wife passes out on the couch so we decide to call it a night sleeping on the couch. My sil gets up to go to bed, a little wobbly but she goes into the bathroom and shuts the door. I play on my phone for about 45 minutes and I notice she's still in the bathroom. So I knock on the door with no response, I knock a few more times then open the door to look in. She's a naked pooper, she passed out while pooping apparently and fell off the toilet onto the floor. Somewhere in all that she puked all over herself. So I'm left with a completely naked woman covered in puke, poop and pee. I try to wake my wife up but she's out cold, I try to wake my sil up but she's out cold. So I grab a bunch of towels, just do a quick clean up. Get the heavy stuff off of her, clean up the floor and made her a bed of towels so she didn't have to sleep on the cold tile, propped her head on a folded towel as a pillow and used a giant fluffy towel as a blanket. 

Here's why I'm told I'm an asshole. She was mad I let her lay in poop/puke all night. I should have picked her up and put her in the tub and bathed her. She was passed out drunk, I didn't think she wanted me touching her intimate areas. Where she replied that I have a wife and daughter, I've seen a vagina before and I've changed my daughter's diapers/baths so I know how to clean a vagina/butt/breast. She's only 100lbs so it would have been easy for me. My wife sides with me but the other women say that I should have cleaned her better. So am I an asshole? Would you want someone touching you while you're passed out?

1hxr5ew,Update: AITA for leaving my dad’s birthday dinner after overhearing my sister’s comment about my miscarriage?,"[link to my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/7nVIk1V4PJ)

Hi everyone, I want to thank you all for the support and feedback on my last post. This update is mostly about a few different conversations that I had.

I took your suggestions and called my dad, apologizing for leaving early. He completely understood. We talked a bit and he asked if we could go out to lunch this week because he missed seeing me, so we made plans.

Then, I talked to my husband and told him that I didn’t think I could’ve stayed and still thought leaving was the best thing for us. He apologized for invalidating my feelings and said he would’ve liked for us to spend time with family but not at the cost of my mental wellbeing. He offered to call my brother (not the one who texted me) to set up a playdate for our son with his kids so my son could see some of his cousins, which I appreciated.

Later, my mom called (I guess my dad told her we talked) and she apologized for taking so long to call, saying she felt ashamed and didn’t know how to talk to me. She said she wouldn’t have let Eva say that if they’d known I was there and that she didn’t mean it. Eva has been hormonal and frustrated, and my mom thought calling her out at that point would've just made things worse. She felt terrible for hurting my feelings. I thanked her for the apology but told her I needed more time before meeting her.

After this, Eva texted me, and I wanted to hear her out, so I called. She apologized a lot and emphasized that she didn’t mean it and regretted saying it, attributing it to the same thing my mom had. Apparently she and BIL also had a big fight about it when they got home, which delayed her talking to me.   
  
We had a long conversation, in which she confessed that she had a few early miscarriages before they even told us she was pregnant. But she felt she had to keep smiling through it, which made her slightly resent how I was handling my situation. I told her I was hurting and keeping my distance so she could enjoy her pregnancy. She felt bad for misunderstanding and thinking I was shutting everyone out. I assured her that this wasn’t the case; I hadn’t let anyone in, and with her being pregnant, it was tough for me. I wished her luck but told her I hoped she could understand why I didn’t think I could be there with her. She was sad but agreed.

We talked more, and by the end, things were better. I texted my family group chat with a long message about how I was feeling and why I would be taking space from meetups, because I feel I need it after this. While the apologies eased my mind and I can see myself forgiving them in the future, I am still hurting, and I think right now, I need to spend time with my husband and son and handle my grief with a professional.

Thank you all again for reading this, and I hope this answers your questions about what happened next. Hope you all have a fantastic day!",throwra_71839,10078,0.9800000190734864,244,1736467119,2025-01-09 17:58:39,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hxr5ew/update_aita_for_leaving_my_dads_birthday_dinner/,1,2025
1hyfs4u,AITA I refused to keep loaning a roommate money for dress clothes for a funeral ,"I’m 38 year old physically disabled male currently living in a group home until I can regain my mobility and independence. Over the past year of so I’ve developed a friendship with another resident who isn’t great at managing their money. I’m the type of guy who likes helping people and people go to seeking advice or at least support. Over that time I loaned him about $600. He’d make some payments but often ask for that amount back within a week. I eventually put my foot down and stopped loaning him money. 

Then one of his three daughters was killed, then the second died from an illness. I gave him more money in loans and gifts to help him with these extraordinary times. I probably loaned him about $150 and gave him $100 for travel to see his family and help with a headstone and flowers.

A week ago his last remaining daughter’s son died of COVID and I gave him another $110 loan for travel and funeral expenses but he still wants more. I’m on fixed income right now and will probably be for at least the next year and a half. I’ve basically written this money off in my mind but I feel I can’t just keep throwing money to him. Right now he wants money for dress clothes or says he won’t go to his grandsons services. It’s tearing his daughter up and it feels like the emotional blackmail he’s used against me before when he keeps telling me a true friend would help.

My family say I’m in the right cutting him off but it hurts my heart. I just need people unconnected to the situation to give me their opinion.

Since my mum and dad work all day grandma has decided to do the chores while me and my sis are at school. This has been going on for years. Last couple of months I've noticed she's getting a bit tired so I finish chores after school so she can sleep a bit. That fatigue is often shown in various arguments with my mum. Grandma often takes advice from her sister (83F) who has 2 daughters let's call them Jenny (53f) and Megan (46f) which tells her to dump as and leave for the village to live with her and her daughters. My dad always says that grandma's sister and her daughters are the worst part of our family tree and honestly I agree they are spoiled and really bad people that have done some immoral things to other members of their family. During a family table my grandma moaned a bit about having to cook all alone when mum had her day off and was sleeping until noon. Then her sister said ""I told you to leave those ungrateful bastards they don't appreciate what you've done for them unilke my daughters who are an example of children raised right"" in this moment I couldn't hold my anger I stood up looked her dead in the eye and told her ""Are you really saying this? For your information we are all grateful of her presence not only because she does the chores but because she grew up my mum, me and my sibling with values and morals unlike you and your daughters. Have you wondered why Jenny got divorced twice or why Megan cant even find a job. You didn't do as good of a job as you think raising your daughters. You have no right to call us like that in our house in our table"". Dad told me to go to my room so i left. I overheard my grandma's sister saying I wasn't raised right but my parents defended me. After she left dad said I was right and apologized for not interrupting earlier while mum said I shouldn't have done this.

1i1gqln,AITA for not hiding Tampon Trash at work,"I started my period earlier today while at work. No big deal, I put in a tampon and threw the wrapper and applicator into the mostly empty, medium sized trash can (no lid) without thinking twice about it. Then I just got back to my job.

Two hours later, the only other woman on this floor came into my office and told me I had left the tampon wrapper and applicator “out in the open” and that “anyone could see that.” She also said I “need to be more discreet because it is a mixed bathroom.”

I immediately thought her comment was rude, but a friend pointed out she might have thought she was helping by letting me know. Still, I don’t think there’s any need to hide perfectly normal trash. If it were an actual used tampon, I would wrap it for sanitary and smell reasons, but this was just small bits of plastic in the trash can. I grew up in a house full of sisters, and my fiancé is very chill about menstruation. I’ve heard of men being weird about periods, but I’ve never personally experienced it.

Another friend suggested I go to HR to make a statement and verify what’s expected, but I feel like that’s over the top. I’m more inclined to just fume about it for the rest of the day and move on without changing how I throw away things.

1i2arp6,AITA for refusing to fund my boyfriends ‘genius’ idea?," 
I (F24) have been dating my boyfriend (M29) for 3 years, and while he’s always been a bit wacky I usually find it kind of endearing. This time however, he’s really outdone himself. A few weeks ago, he told me he had a “groundbreaking” idea that would “change humanity forever.” Entertaining him, I asked what it was. His answer? He wants to invent a new color.

Before we go any further it’s important to note we are both college graduates. I graduated in Biochemistry last year and my boyfriend in Philosophy a few years before, which makes this all the wilder I guess.

I tried to gently point out that colors exist as part of the visible spectrum of light, so unless he was about to discover some new wavelength, this might not be possible. But he waved me off, calling me “close-minded” and saying he was “enlightened in a way you’ll never be”

At first, I just nodded and let him ramble about his “vision.” But then he told me he needed funding to start his “research.” Specifically, he wanted me to give him $4,000 so he could buy “supplies,” including “advanced art tools,” a lab coat (because apparently, scientists wear them, so it would make him “feel smarter”), and—wait for it—a trip to the desert because he thinks the “pure sunlight” there will inspire him.

I told him absolutely not. I’m saving for grad school, and even if I weren’t, I’m not dropping thousands of dollars on his… whatever this is. He got mad, saying I didn’t believe in him or his “potential to revolutionize human perception.” He even accused me of being jealous that he had a “world-changing idea” and I didn’t. It got really heated and he ended up saying a lot of things about using my card as he knew the details anyway. For reference he’s been unemployed for a while now, whilst I’ve got a regular job. I ended up saying some things I do regret, but a lot of it was retaliation.

Now he’s sulking and telling everyone I’m “unsupportive” and “afraid of innovation.” His friends are backing him up, saying I should be encouraging his creativity instead of “crushing his dreams.” AITA for refusing to fund his quest to invent a new color?",Rich-Painter-9008,5714,0.949999988079071,1432,1736983007,2025-01-15 17:16:47,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i2arp6/aita_for_refusing_to_fund_my_boyfriends_genius/,1,2025
1i31gj7,AITA for expecting my stay at home husband to do the stay at home duties?,"This is my first time posting so sorry for any mistakes. My husband ""Jack"" (33M) and I (28F) have a toddler together and have another one on the way. He's a stay at home and I work full time. I'm out of the house the majorty of the day while he's home with the toddler. 

Jack doesn't do anything. He never sets an alarm to get up with the toddler. I do. He sits in the living room until our toddler's nap (which varies every day) then goes to the basement to play his video games. Our toddler will sleep anywhere from 2 to 3 hours. Then once our toddler wakes up, he gets her, makes dinner, and maybe gets one chore done around the house. Almost every day he does this. There are some days when I'm pleasantly surprised. 

I've talked to Jack multiple times about keeping the house cleaned, but he claims it's not fair that I don't have to do anything (which isn't true). If the house is kept up on, I do dishes, laundry, and meal prep on my days off. Sometimes I'll bake too. I'll also be on toddler duty. However once he lets the house go, I don't do anything other than clean the areas my toddler is in so she's not affected by it because she deserves a clean house. 

I have (almost) gotten the house completely cleaned 3 times now, and he lets the house go. I've tried splitting chores, but again, it's hard when I work full time and I'm out of the house the majorty of the day. My job has me on my feet all day and some days are harder than others.
 
I tell Jack all the time (and have proven it sometimes) that if the roles were reversed, I'd have the house cleaned for him. Jack claims that's not true. He claims it's my fault that the house is trashed because I should do more, yet I work full time because he didn't want to work, which I supported and made more sense financially. I have also been really tired and just want to sleep due to my pregnancy, but Jack gets mad if I don't wake up in the morning, even though I let him sleep in most mornings.

I know how Reddit can be, which is why I didn't want to post, but I'm at my wits end. We literally had another fight about the house being trashed and instead of helping me clean like I asked, he's now working in the garage. (Jack will literally find other things to do other than clean the house. For example, if there's a task that needs to be done, he'll take all day to do it, even if it's an hour long job).

The children are hellions, but I try to treat them as nice as I can which is hard. They don’t get out much, only to go to school, so I told them to pick something to make and we will go to the store and get the ingredients. They chose candied grapes. Everytime I take them to the store, I have to preface our visit with rules as to what not to do in the store. No running, no asking for anything that’s not on the list, no playing, no wandering off. As soon as we get in the store, I put the youngest(4) in the cart and the oldest (12) promised that she could push the cart with no issues so I let her. The middle child (11) immediately began asking for stuff and tried wandering off. The oldest kept crashing into stuff and knocking things over and the youngest was screaming at the top of his lungs. We checked out and the cashier gave the youngest a coloring sheet and some crayons. We walked to the car and I watched all of them get in the car. 

When we got back to the house, I helped the youngest out of the car and realized that either him or the middle child had colored all over my car seats. I asked the youngest if he did it and he said no, and I told him I think he did and he kicked me. I took them inside and told my sister in law (who is sitting in the garage smoking a black & mild) what happened. She did nothing. 

The next day, I was going to the car wash and discovered crayon marks all over the rear passenger side door that the kids were using to get in and out the day before. Yellow and blue crayon marks all over the door. The crayon marks had been pressed in so hard on the door that there were scratches underneath and I couldn’t get the crayon or scratches off. 

I took pics and sent them to my brother and his wife telling them that they need to pay for this and that his kids have no home training. I told him they don’t watch them and just sit in the garage smoking and drinking all day while the kids run wild. I told them how I’m always trying to do something nice for the children and they don’t respect me or my stuff ever. My brother told me it was probably an accident and was very defensive. I took my car to get repaired which was $300 and told him to pay it. He said kids are kids and said that if it bothers me so much, I don’t need to do anything for them. I told him he needs to take accountability and he said just don’t do anything for them. Once he sent the money, I hung up on him. I wish I could show you all the outside of the door.

1i5ac68,AITA for asking my bf to wash his sheets before I stay over,"Ok so here’s the situation: 

By bf and I have been dative for 9 months and our relationship is thriving, except for this one thing. First to give a little background, my bf works as a landscaper and he is pretty dirty when he gets back from work. For some reason he doesn’t like to shower when he gets home and usually takes a shower in the morning before he goes to work (take note I said before). Anyways, the first few times that I stayed over I noticed that his sheets were kind of brownish and I kept feeling what seemed like gravel or pebbles on my skin while I slept. 

Additionally I don’t think that he washes his sheets frequently in the first place, so they just kind of build up grime and dirt. I wasn’t too sure how to approach the situation… I didn’t want to tell him to shower because that felt rude or like I was insulting his hygiene, so instead I asked him if I could wash his sheets for him. 

I kind of thought that he would get the message after that, but he didn’t. So last week I texted him and asked if he could do a load of laundry and put his sheets in there before I came over. He responded with:

“K this is getting weird, if you think that my bed is so dirty you can just come over and do it yourself”

Anyways I don’t really want to have to be his mom or whatever and wash his sheets for him all the time just so that I don’t have to sleep with rocks exfoliating me while I sleep, but I also don’t want to tell him to go and shower cause that’s rude asf, especially if I have to tell him every goddamn day.

1i64gwn,AITA for telling my sister not to bother coming to my wedding?,"I (24M) excluded my sister (28F) from my wedding but not my other sister (26F) and upset my entire family. 

I am getting married to a really wonderful man we’ll call Max (26) this summer but my sister will not be in my wedding party. Here’s why:

I have two sisters, Macy and Penny. We grew up close— but with no brothers I felt excluded. My sisters would go on ‘girls trips’ and I wasn’t invited. My father isn’t in the picture, so mostly mom would leave me with grandma. Sisters and brothers are different: Penny and Macy fight, but they always make up.

 Penny is a lesbian and as a gay man we’ve bonded more as adults. Overall I love both my sisters even if the relationships are painful.  

About seven years ago, Macy married her fiance Michael. Penny was her maid of honor and Michael asked me to be a groomsman. Her wedding party included our female cousin, but also Penny’s partner Joanne (26F). Max and I were together but he was not in the wedding. I barely knew Michael and all his groomsmen were strangers. I told my sister that I would rather support her on her wedding day, but she said that “isn’t the way things are done.” She was right, but I saw no reason why it needed to be gendered. I should have stood with my family. 

She was the bride, so I didn’t bother her about it again. 

I was excluded from everything leading up to the wedding. I missed the bridal parties, dress selection, and bachelorette activities, not to mention the fact that day I had to leave my house and get ready at her fiancée’s hotel because she didn’t want any men around while she was getting ready.

Two years later Penny married Joanne. Of course Macy was the maid of honor but I also got to be a ‘brides man’ and was with her every step of the way. Partners were excluded on both sides. 

Before the wedding, Macy kept making snide remarks about how I didn’t belong there. There were no “bachelor parties” but I think Macy thought without a groom men shouldn’t be in the wedding. I WAS invited to Penny’s bachelorette party much to Macy’s chagrin. 

Now Max and I are marrying and we weren’t going to have a wedding party— but Max insisted because he’s close to his brother Marshall. When I made Penny my maid-of-honor Macy was offended. When I told her that she was going to stand with Max and Marshall because my best friend Kohl is going to be in it, she was furious! 

Macy said she needed to be there for her “baby brother’s big day” and felt slighted. I told her that if I had to stand with strangers, she had to. Besides, we needed even numbers

My mother took her side when she complained and even my grandmother called me spiteful. Angry, I shouted that if Macy had a problem she needn’t come. Should I relent and let her stand with me? I feel like this is a total double-standard because when Macy was married the answer was “it’s her wedding.” Am I the asshole?

1i6u3os,AITA for declining to invite a woman who has called herself ‘a total klepto’ into my home?,"I joined a Women’s Social Club 6 months ago because I’ve been struggling to make friends after relocating to a new-to-me city. It took me a while to warm up to the group and to connect with people I actually had anything in common with. I had to wade through a lot of botox parties and boozy brunches to find things I was interested in. But I did, and I started coming to group events fairly often.

I hang out most often with the women who like to read, do crafty things, bake, skywatch, etc. Among these women is one, I’ll call her Andea, who has made several comments about how she’s a total klepto. I think that she makes these comments to seem “cool” to the other people in the group.

I reached out to some of the women I see regularly at these events and invited them over to my place to watch a TV show we’d been talking about and do crafty stuff. They were excited and agreed to come.

Unfortunately, Andrea found out (I assume someone asked if she was going) and reached out to me to ask if she was invited. I considered this for a bit and then told her no, as I only had so much room at home. She didn’t believe me and asked me for the real reason, saying “I thought we got along” which yes, is true. 

I told her I’m not comfortable inviting a kleptomaniac into my home. That I’ve worked hard to have the things I have and it would be stupid for me to invite her knowing that she openly brags about it. 

She said ‘Okay’ very quietly. She then said “You’re painting me out to be some horrible criminal when you don’t even know anything about me.” 

I said that her being proud to call herself a klepto was all I needed to know. She said that I was a high school mean girl and ableist. I am unsure what the foundation for that statement is.

This unfortunately has spilled over to the group, which is frustrating. But what has me the most surprised is that there are so many people defending her and telling me that I’m out of touch and take things too literally.

1i7n5bg,AITA for hiding my expensive shampoo and conditioner from my friend’s guest?,"I (28F) share an apartment with my friend (34M). Last weekend, while we were away, he invited his female friend (Sarah) to stay over. When we got back, I noticed she had used most of my shampoo and conditioner without asking. I had splurged on these expensive products to treat myself. I also make a lot less money than my friend.

Today, Sarah came over again for a visit and asked to shower at ours before heading to a dance class. However, I had taken my expensive products to my room this time, leaving only my friend’s basic shampoo out for her to use. When she couldn’t find the conditioner, she asked my friend, who came to my room to ask me about it. I told him that she’s his guest, and it’s not my responsibility to provide spa products for her. My friend got mad and thinks I’m rude and petty. AITA?

1i8g3sp,AITA for not paying for my fiancé’s mom’s funeral?,"!Small update! Thank you everyone for all your comments! They really opened my eyes. No plans are set in stone at the moment that was just the estimate they gave him for the service. After talking to him tonight and explaining that I will NOT be footing the bill for any sort of big expensive funeral, he left the apartment, after a long argument, to stay with his grandmother and basically hasn’t spoke to me since. We don’t have any combined finances/accounts so at this point I’m just over it and he can stay gone for all I care. 

New to Reddit so forgive me for any formatting issues. To make a long story short my (31) fiancé's (35) mother recently passed. She was never really in his life (abandoned him at birth) and l've only met her one time in the 8 years we've been together. Recently she had come back into his life and they were on civil terms. We got news from the hospital that she had died and they immediately wanted to know what funeral home we wanted to send her to and of course my fiancé decides he's obligated to figure all of this out since his other siblings are MIA or incarcerated. I recommended to him we just do something simple and keep it on the cheaper side since no one else will be helping financially and he doesn't have any savings either she also didn't have any kind of life/burial insurance. Well today he surprises me after work with a 10k bill that he expects me to pay the majority of out of my savings because he can't afford it. I will admit I did help pay for his dad's cremation multiple years ago but it wasn't near the cost of what he's wanting to do now. We just recently moved into a more expensive apartment and at this point a 10 thousand dollar funeral is just not on the table but he won't budge.

1i97bii,AITA - I rejected my BIL's child being a flower girl,"I (27F) am getting married this spring to my boyfriend (26M).
We have been planning our wedding for 2 years now and have been trying to get blessings from both sides of our families but only my family was supportive of our decision to get married.
While receiving racist remarks from my to-be in-laws, they disapproved of us getting married and wanted us to wait a while before settling down.

Since we weren't receiving full support, we decided to plan the wedding ourselves and finalized the details like date, venue, catering, etc. We are not and have not asked for any financial support and they have not asked if we need help in any aspect of the planning. I also asked a family friend's daughter (4F) to be the flower girl after the engagement and her mom agreed.

Fast forward about a year since the flower girl was confirmed: My boyfriend's older brother and his wife recently gave birth to a baby girl (let's call her Amy) and they have been badgering us about allowing their baby (will be 11MO by the time of the wedding), my fiancé's niece, be the flower girl.

My boyfriend and I pointed out that Amy isn't guaranteed to be able to walk by that time, and Amy's father responded by saying that he could carry her down the aisle. When we initially said 'no' to that idea (as I think it's weird giving the role of a flower girl to a child that wont be physically able to do any of the normal flower girl duties and it would look ugly having a toddler walk down next to an adult holding a baby), Amy's father and Amy's grandmother kept on badgering us with the same questions:

""Can Amy be the flower girl?""
""What color theme is your wedding? We'll buy a dress for Amy.""
""Since Amy is our first and only grandchild, it's tradition for our family for her to be flower girl""

AITAH to reject Amy as the flower girl??? 🥲

Here is some context:
Amy's father and my boyfriend have two other siblings
Amy is currently 7MO and cannot crawl or sit up unassisted.
Amy's father and Amy's grandmother make racist comments about me behind my back.",onemilkcarton,4651,0.9700000286102296,223,1737756190,2025-01-24 16:03:10,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i97bii/aita_i_rejected_my_bils_child_being_a_flower_girl/,1,2025
1i983ij,AITA for accepting an invitation on my husband’s behalf that I knew he wouldn’t like and refusing to cancel it?,"My husband is a busy person but he’s not such a busy person that he can’t manage invitations from his family and friends if he wanted to. His family and friends act like I’m responsible for his social calendar, which I didn’t mind at first because I didn’t have anything better to do but I’m tired of being the one to have to say no to everything and it sucks having to deal with people trying to convince me to come to things when I know they only really care about my husband attending.

I’ve tried to get them to go to him directly but he just sends them back my way or ignores them so they come to me anyway. I’ve spoken to him multiple times about not wanting to be responsible for ‘our’ social calendar and he acts like he gets it but then never responds to invites so nothing’s changed.

So I’ve done something that you guys may or may not think is petty. My mother-in-law has asked for us to join monthly family dinners with her side of the family. I prefer her side of my husband’s family but my husband is closer to his dad’s side so we see them more. Usually, I wouldn’t accept an invite like this without checking with my husband but since she asked him first and he ignored her I decided to accept on his behalf.

The first dinner is on Sunday which is the day we were also supposed to have dinner with his grandfather on his dad’s side but he never told me that was happening and neither did anyone else (his dad’s side have a horrible habit of just assuming we’ll be at something because they’ve told us). Part of me thinks the dinner with his grandfather is a lie because I know he’s been avoiding his half-brother like the plague since he keeps asking him for an investment and his stepsiblings will be there.

My husband told me to cancel but I don’t want to because my mother-in-law was so happy when I said yes. Also, his sister will be there and I haven’t seen her in forever. I won’t stop him from cancelling if he really wants to but he’s turned this situation into a fight because I didn’t ask him first and now I don’t want to be the one to cancel. He’s basically said if we go to the first one he expects me to tell my mother-in-law this won’t be a regular thing but I think he should be the one to do that since I have no problem having dinner with them regularly.

1ice5im,AITAH for moving out of my boyfriends over salsa?,"Hey guys! So I've been with my boyfriend for 2 years and he's absolutely wonderful. We're both in college and we live together with a couple other roommates. The place is my boyfriend's mom's vacation house and we all pitch in for rent. Every week my boyfriends mom stops by. I work at a restaurant so I always get free chips and salsa to take home. My boyfriend loves spicy things so I always grab him spicy salsa and I'll grab myself regular as I can't handle spice. 

Now here's where it gets weird.. I've been coming home and go to grab my salsa and I notice that all of the salsa has been put into one container. This has been happening for MONTHS and results in me being unable to eat it. After asking everyone in the house including my boyfriend ""who's been doing this"" everyone was in denial about it. 

Just a couple weeks ago I decided to get a security camera to see who's been messing with me and my salsa. Guess who is on the camera mixing the salsas together? HIS MOTHER. So she's been showing up while everyone is gone, looking through our fridge and pulling out all sorts of items and going into our cabinet and getting a bigger container and putting the salsa together. I was not okay. 

For the longest time I've been thinking it was my boyfriend messing with me, needless to say after accusing him for a long time, this led to a huge argument about how weird his mother is for coming into our space and messing with our stuff. 

She does this every time she comes over and I've had enough. So I told my boyfriend to figure out why she's doing this. He calls her and she says she's making space in our fridge and she is not going to stop.

1icg6ll,AITA for making my husband leave work to return my keys,"I feel so awful about this, but my husband has a habit of forgetting/ignoring things I say. I WFH and am always there to unlock the front door for my husband when he gets back from work, so the couple of times I’ve needed the car, I get very annoyed that he’s taken the house keys attached to the car keys with him. 
This has happened a few times, he’ll lock all the house doors in the morning and go off to work with the car keys so I can neither leave the house nor drive anywhere. 
So I made sure we have two sets of keys and the second pair must always be on the console table for emergencies. The problem is my husband started keeping the emergency keys in his work bag and if he took the car anywhere, I was again locked in the house. This recently happened again when my family was coming over and they stood at a locked door while I searched the house for his work bag. 
Today I woke up very unwell and wanted to run to the chemist between meetings and pick up a book I had on hold at the library, when once again, my husband has taken the car keys. What made me so angry was that I’ve told him this a million times and I could have had a massive emergency. He was so calm and apologetic on the phone and but that just made me angrier. I’m sick of him never listening.  
So I lost it and demanded he come home immediately and drop the keys back because I need to go to the chemist. He started apologising and saying he has a meeting at work about to start, but I told him this is not a discussion and I expect him back home right now because I’m sick of repeating myself. 
He said he’s on his way back but I feel so awful for stressing him out while he’s at work and making him take a 40 minute journey back.

1id64xi,AITA for calling ski patrol on a guy after he hit my son with his skis?,"My son (11M) and I (44M) recently booked a trip to go skiing in Colorado. It was my son's first time skiing, but he had seen a lot of skiing videos on YouTube, and he seemed really excited for the trip. We also live in Florida, so this is not the trip you can just go and do whenever you like (we are not rich). I grew up in Utah and I loved skiing when I was younger, and I would say I'm an expert on the mountain. The first day goes all good, and my son really enjoyed skiing for the first time, even though he fell a lot, lol. I made sure to be as supportive and caring as possible, even when he was struggling, because I wanted to make this as fun an experience as possible for him. However, on the second day of skiing, he says he's finally ready to ski down the whole mountain, and so we take the lift to the top. Luckily, there was a way to get down the mountain while only staying on green level trails, so we took that way. 

My son is having a blast, when all of a sudden, this guy in his 20s careens into my son from behind going on insane speeds, wiping them both out. My son immediately started crying and came running to me after he got his skis off, and once he calmed down, he ran to the lodge where my wife was, and she decided to take him to the doctor's office. I immediately confront the guy for being so reckless, and he simply says that I should have been paying better attention to my kid, and then he rode off. That was the final straw for me, and I called the ski patrol number in the app and told the guy the situation and what the skier was wearing, and they told me they would find him and kick him out. Later on, I saw him getting escorted out of the park by two ski patrol officers, and when he saw me, he immediately started cursing me out and calling me a horrible dad.

1id79v1,AITA for refusing to keep changing dinner reservations for my sister’s partner’s birthday?,"My sister asked me to book dinner reservations for her partner’s birthday, which she was supposed to organize. I secured a 5 PM reservation for 7 people at a popular restaurant and informed everyone three days in advance. The night before, she asked if I could move it to 6 PM because her partner had taken a last-minute work shift and wouldn’t make it at 5. We were both frustrated, and she likely argued with him over it. Since the restaurant was always booked, I told her I’d try but warned it was unlikely. When I asked about a backup plan, she said that I should just cancel it. She added that her partner was annoying for not being able to say no to work and that she was tired of doing things for people who couldn’t be bothered to help out.

The next morning, I called the restaurant, and they couldn’t move the reservation, so I canceled it, assuming the dinner was off. But then my sister decided we should still celebrate at 6:30 PM at another restaurant. At this point, I was frustrated by all the last-minute changes and questioned why we were going out of our way for her partner when he didn’t seem to care. She defended him, saying he had no family here and would have to spend his birthday alone, and that we shouldn’t blame him for taking an extra shift to make more money.

I suggested a restaurant, but she rejected it, choosing one she’d previously dismissed for “bad ambiance.” When I pointed this out, she got defensive, citing her exhaustion and travel. I asked why she planned dinner on the same day she was traveling, and my other sister and I suggested Sunday lunch, but she refused, saying her partner wasn’t available. When asked if dinner was canceled, she exploded, blaming us for not helping and claiming she had no Wi-Fi on her flight.

Later, she said her partner was available again, making me question why I’d canceled the original reservation. She yelled that no one could get ready for a 5 PM dinner and accused us of not caring, even though I’d followed her instructions. My other sister, who had rearranged her schedule, was also frustrated.

My sister then lashed out, saying she’d tell her partner no one cared about him. I reminded her she told me to cancel and had proof. She ranted about being the only one making an effort, despite me working two jobs and our other sister having a child. I decided not to go, and my other sister backed out too.

1id7hka,AITAH for calling out My Uncle in front of everyone After making weird comments on my girlfriend's looks and being too touchy?,"So basically, at a family barbecue last weekend, my uncle (mid-50s) kept making creepy comments about my girlfriend Kate(21F) who I invited. At first, it was backhanded compliments like, *""Wow, you’re way too pretty for him,""* but then it got worse-*""I would have snatched you up back in the day,""* and *""Must be a struggle to compromise for me?""* He even joked about how my girlfriend must get hit on all the time and how I should *""keep an eye on her.""*

On top of that, he was being *way* too touchy, putting his hand on her lower back, touching her arm when he laughed, and even leaning in way too close while talking to her. My girlfriend was clearly uncomfortable but tried to brush it off. She told me privately that it made her uncomfortable, 

I confronted him in front of everyone, straight-up calling him a creep and telling him to knock it off in a loud way. He got defensive, saying he was just joking, and my mom told me I was out of line for embarrassing him like that. 

Some family members agreed with me, but others think I overreacted and should've handled it privately since everyone knows him as a joker and just loves making conversation which he is good at. Some male cousins of mine are insinuating I was jealous and exaggerating stuff because my uncle talked to their partners too and they didn't have any complaints like Kate.

My Uncle said he was just making jokes, and he didn't mean any of them, and he is really disappointed that I looked at him as that kind of guy

AITA for calling him out publicly instead of pulling him aside?

My friend has a swimming pool and my son brought his swim trunks with him in case he decided to swim. My friend has two daughters (13F) and (14F).

1id8czv,AITA for lashing out at my coaches assistant for making a joke about my dad who recently passed?,"So I 16M, was at swim practice earlier today (6:30-8:30PM) and this is one of my first practices back after my dad passed in early December. 

Anyways, I come in and get changed as usual, and then I get showered and head out to the pool deck. Keep in mind, I have gained a bit of weight since the last time they have seen me and I’m quite out of shape and struggling to keep up when we start the practice. My coach says welcome back and hugs me and stuff and he basically catches me up on everything that’s happened, what I’ve missed, etc. Then we start the warm up, it was quite difficult for me as I haven’t swam in almost 2 months. To begin the warm up, we had to dive off the blocks, my dive was really slow and sloppy as I haven’t practiced for a while.

We get out of the water for the coach to explain the main set and the coaches assistant (I think she’s 38F but idk for sure) says “it’s a pity your dad couldn’t have died a little later to save you from this practice” and she starts laughing and I’m fuming at this point. I tell her to PO and to not talk about things like that and I left early. My mum has called the coach and told him that what was said today was unacceptable, and that she thinks it’s disgusting that an adult who I should view as an authority figure to trust and look up to would say such things.

1ies40z,AITA for kicking out my mom’s boyfriend?,"When I was 17 my mom came into money.  She tried to keep it quiet but she paid off my dad’s debts, bought him a small house, paid off her debts and paid for my sister’s college and set up funds for mine.  She had a boyfriend at the time and shortly after him and his son who was 7 moved into our new house.

Over the next few years mom bought my sister a house after she graduated college. Her boyfriend lived with us and didn’t pay anything but he did work.

When I was 21 mom got diagnosed with cancer. It wasn’t good. She sat me and my sister down and went over exactly how much money there was. She intended to give her current house to me and both me and my sister were left with a large sum at the end of it.  She asked if I would allow her boyfriend to stay in the house with his son until he got his own place. I agreed.

Before she died she told her boyfriend he would need to look for his own place but had time to save more for that journey.

For the last 4 years he has continued to reside in the house with his son. I haven’t minded because we get along okay. I pay all the bills but he does buy food for him and his kid.

He has dated off and on and mostly kept the women out of this house which I respected him for.  Until his current partner.  She’s been in my house 3 times and at first besides feeling a little uncomfortable I was okay with her. The last time this past weekend was the point where I lost my shit.

I was making myself some lunch when she came walking downstairs. She grabbed a plate and went to grab food out of my pan. I asked her what she thought was doing. She started telling me how I should look for somewhere else to live and leeching off my dead mom’s past relationship as an adult was pathetic.

I hollered for my mom’s old boyfriend he came down and I told him I didn’t know what he current thing thought but I wasn’t going to be disrespected in my house.  He wouldn’t even look me in the eyes as he mumbled something about my mom promising him the house and he was just “being kind” letting me stay.

First that isn’t remotely true. Mom pulled him and i together after she asked if he could stay to set expectations. My mom met him shortly before she won the money and told him and us girls that she had no intention of leaving him money. She did set aside a fund for his son for college when he gets there but he cannot touch it, only his son can.  He has lived in this house almost 8 years without paying a dime he should have plenty of money and if he doesn’t that’s on him.

I told him he had 30 days to leave. I wasn’t going to house someone who would lie and disrespect me in my house. He left that night with his son but his ex wife called to tell me I am cruel and an AH for her son losing his house (he is here every other week).

I really feel like my mom didn’t expect him to still be here but my sister said she feels like I am breaking my promise to my mom and  that made me feel like maybe I am the AH.",NotWillingToShare,8616,0.9800000190734864,464,1738364783,2025-01-31 17:06:23,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ies40z/aita_for_kicking_out_my_moms_boyfriend/,1,2025
1ifk4wo,AITA for telling my siblings about my sister stealing our inheritance before I confront my sister?,"Don’t get me wrong, I’ve tried to ask her many times about probate (which she refused to do with excuses there wouldn’t be enough money to recover to make probate worth it) and she’s also been asked multiple times about a specific inheritance my mother came into when my mother was actively dying. 
  When I discovered the circumstances and amount of the money left, it was obvious my sister (the executor, the POA and caretaker) hid this from us and that it would’ve been a life changing amount of money for each of the beneficiaries on my mother’s will, which states equal splits.
 We are going to confront her about this and give her the opportunity to fess up and make right to each sibling with the remaining amount and not even be penalized for what she’s spent, so long as she’s compliant and upfront. Honestly I just feel like an asshole wishing there was another way to handle it and fearing she will always resent me for outting this secret.

1ig8kit,AITA for not giving straight yes/no responses to my husband’s questions?,"I don’t give a non answer. I give an answer. It just might not be yes/no. It drives my husband nuts. He gets annoyed and I feel like he’s overreacting. Here are some examples:

“Do you want butter and honey on your toast?”
“I want butter and jam”

“Did you want to see a movie tonight?”
“I feel like staying in”

“Is that bill paid for?”
“I actually need to go back and look at that because they sent the wrong amount”

“Did you talk to X about Y?”
“He didn’t call me yet”

Are my types of answers really that bad? Why does he get so annoyed with these answers? (Feel free to convince me to be more sympathetic and change my answers; I just kind of think he’s being overreactive when I am clearly not avoiding the question. It’s like he wants an exact answer to the question. 

EDIT/UPDATE: A lot of people saying I do this intentionally and maliciously. I don’t. It’s a habit of how I talk and answer questions. I am aware it annoys him and I do try to adjust but I don’t always because, again, it’s a habit of talking. It can be difficult to change the way you communicate. It takes time. He also explains why it annoys him (unclear answers, sometimes ambiguous, he has a lot of vagueness at work and would just like some straightforwardness at home, sometimes lack of clarity scares him like wondering if I can’t be more direct with important situations). I understand all this and am sympathetic and do try to adjust. It just feels like a little much when he gets annoyed at something that I don’t see at that big of a deal.

1ih16sq,AITA for refusing to give back a family heirloom?,"A few years ago, my mom gave me a beautiful gold bracelet that originally belonged to my grandma. It had been passed down to my mom, and my mom told me she wanted me to have it because I was the ‘responsible one’ (I'm the oldest of her children) and would appreciate it the most. I was honored and have worn it regularly since.

Now, my younger sister (22F) is getting married, and my mom decided she wants the bracelet back so she can give it to my sister as a wedding gift. I was shocked because, as far as I knew, it belonged to me now. My mom keeps insisting that it was never meant to be ‘permanently’ mine—just in my possession until it was time to pass it on. But she never said that before.

I refused to give it back, saying that if she wanted it to go to my sister, she shouldn’t have given it to me in the first place. My sister is now upset because she thinks I’m being selfish and hoarding the bracelet out of spite.

Most of our family also thinks I'm bitter towards my sister because she's getting married, and I'm unmarried, but that's not the case at all. I'm happy for her, I just want to keep the bracelet as it was given to me first.

1ih278o,AITA for telling my boyfriend my dad was dead,"I (26F) lost my mother to cancer when I was 8 and have always had an absent father. I only found out who he was when I was 13 and even then he did not want custody of me forcing me to stay in the foster system until I was 18. Over my whole life I have had about 5 conversations with him give or take- he is like a stranger to me. He appears once in a blue moon to ask for money or something along those lines. It doesn't really bother me anymore, I've just learnt to accept it now but i don't like talking about it so to avoid that conversation with people i usually just say both my parents are dead.

This leads me to a year and a half ago when I had just started dating my boyfriend (25M) and like usual I had just told him my parents were dead but the other day my dad showed up at my door (I still don't know how he knows where I live) and asked for 100 dollars except my boyfriend was there and he obviously found out my dad was not dead. This lead to a long conversation with him that night where I explained the whole situation.

He said this was a breach of trust between us since I lied about my dad and that he needed some space to rethink our relationship but he doesn't think he will leave me.

I feel so shitty and that I should have told him earlier but I am going to be honest I just didn't think. So AITA?

UPDATE: my boyfriend texted me 5 mins ago asking to talk so we are going to have a full in depth conversation tomorrow after work and I'll update again then :)

  
UPDATE 2 (last update): Before I get to the update I would like clear things up.

1. I have only given money to my dad once when I was still desperate for his love and acceptance but he did not get any money this time.

2. Despite his confusion my bf stepped in to defend me and get my dad to leave and it was only after my dad left he asked me about it

Now onto the update. My boyfriend told me that all the sudden information along with the knowledge I hadn't told him the truth was very overwhelming and he just needed some space to not say the wrong thing. He also said that he got why I lied initially and he wasn't mad that I lied more hurt that I felt like I couldn't tell him about it. He also mentioned that he couldn't be there for me if he didn't know what was going on. The conversation ended in tears and it is the most vulnerable I have been in front of someone. He was very understanding and we have decided to draw a line in the sand and 'start again' if that makes sense.

I have also looked into therapy for my childhood trauma and all in all I am using this as an opportunity to better myself and heal fully.

1ihswh4,AITA.    Am I the asshole for deleting my wife’s text that upset me?,"My wife has made it clear to me through our entire 10+ years together that she uses “yeah”, “yep”, and “lol” to show she’s basically giving the what the fuck ever reply to whatever she is responding to. She has stated this throughout the years. 
And I have asked her in the past multiple times to talk to me about what’s upsetting her instead of replying to me in her basically upset code words.
She refuses. It’s always those words by themselves. Me or someone else will text her full sentences and she’ll respond with only “lol”, “yep” or “yeah”.
She never uses them unless she is upset. It could be however long and she won’t use them for weeks, and then something will upset her and she will only use them to express she doesn’t care about what the person is saying and that she isn’t even caring enough to respond to it.

This has always upset me. A few months ago I started to just delete the one word text where she responds with those words so that I can just move on from them and not get upset by them. Because it genuinely upsets me when that’s the only reply I receive and that when I try to talk to her or ask what’s wrong I’m only given those in response.

She recently used my phone to look up a recipe she sent me in the past, and in doing so saw our text from my side, where I had removed the text with one word text. She is upset and says that I’m disrespecting her by removing them because they are still responses.
 Even if they aren’t replying whatsoever to what was said and even if they are dismissing what was said, not to mention you only use them when you don’t care to respond??
I said it doesn’t affect the conversations we have, it just keeps me from getting worked up because she uses them with no regard for how the other person feels. I just want to continue our conversations without seeing them because even if I ask about them she refuses to say anything.

1iinj2v,WIBTA if I told my MIL she could no longer visit my child at daycare?,"My (29F) daughter is five months old and goes to a daycare at my husband’s (32M) workplace. My mother in law also works at the same place so she has easy access to the daycare. At least once a week she goes and spends 30 minutes to an hour just playing with my daughter. This rubs me the wrong way for so many reasons. As a mom, it frustrates me that she thinks it’s okay to just drop by whenever without at least saying something or asking (I actually just found out while writing this that she tells my husband but nobody communicates it with me). As a former daycare worker, I would have hated having someone just come in and spend time with a child because now not only do they have infants to watch, but now they have to work around a fully grown woman and make sure that she isn’t taking pictures/videos of other babies as well. I think my biggest issue is honestly that some days she gets to spend more awake time with my daughter than I do and I know that’s a horrible reason to be frustrated with someone but it is what it is.

1ikz8b3,AITA for calling out my aunt for lying about having a condition that I actually struggle with?,"So some background, this Aunt has a habit of copying everything anyone does and treats it like a competition. This also applies to illnesses. You mention getting ill? she is sick a day later and she always feels worse than you. Then acts like she never knew you were sick

6 months ago I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that doctors think I have been dealing with for years. The only reason they found it is because it very quickly got worse and has ruined my life. It won't shorten it, but I am in so much pain that I can't even walk to the store that is right next to my flat without feeling extreme pain and discomfort. My sleep is awful, my social life has become non existent unless people come to my place. There is no cure for it, I'm on specific targeted medications to try and stop it getting worse, the best we can do is pain management at this point and I'm on the strongest painkillers I can have but it's still bad. 

When I was first diagnosed I posted about it on my FB, not in detail, just said what I had. The only person who knows the details is my mum.

Yesterday mum picked me up so I could visit my nan. while we were there, aunt turned up. We were talking about random stuff at first but then she mentions she went to the doctors and they diagnosed her with  (condition I have) and they think she's had it for years. I thought she was lying so asked her some questions regarding it and every answer was bs. She claimed she told a doctor her symptoms and that's how they found it, when you need bloodwork done to find it. She claimed that they were looking into different procedures to cure it, which again, no cure. When I asked what meds she was on she said there wasn't any they could prescribe for it and she had paracetamol to deal with the terrible pain she was in. 

She then went on about how its affecting her life, its made things difficult for her. Yet she does martial arts 3 times a week and goes clubbing every weekend like she's a teen and posts about it on FB. I lost it. I just went off about how full of it she was and that pretending to have something so serious when I was actually going through it was pathetic attention seeking behaviour. I pointed out everything she said that proved she was lying and said the only medical help she needed was for her head as she clearly had issues. She tried to double down and say that she never knew I had it, (she saw my FB post), she thought I would be more sympathetic as I know what she's going through etc. At this point I was so mad that my mum drove me home. My aunt then later posted on FB about her 'struggles' and how some people just aren't sympathetic about this condition. I called her out in the comments of the post and mentioned what had happened earlier in the day and a load of other family started calling her out for it so she quickly deleted the post.

1il0yux,AITA for telling my SO that her parents getting home from the airport is not my responsibility?,"We’re in the U.K., and my SO’s parents are going to Australia in November. Good for them, I’m pleased for them, however…..

The day they return I have tickets to a gig. For what it’s worth, my SO isn’t going to the gig as she doesn’t like the band in question.

Anyhow, I agreed to take her parents to the airport (she can’t drive) but told her they’d have to get their own way home when they return. 

She has told me that I’m out of order and that they expect me to collect them as I am dropping them off. 

She thinks I should give up my ticket and collect them, I think they should use the train or an Uber. 

Long and short is that my SO and more so her parents think I’m a cunt, and right now the feeling is mutual.

1imjm1v,AITA for telling my ill dad to stop asking me to visit him in the hospital ?,"
I am in my mid 30’s. My parents are really old. My dad is almost 90. My mom is in her 70’s. My dad was in his mid 50’s when my parents had me. Since I was 6 years old, my dad has had major procedures in the hospital. At first it was once every 2-3 years, and within the last 15 years it’s been once a year. In the last two years, it’s been every few months.

My mom got married “later” in life. She lived her life to help her parents. I feel like because she “missed out”, she put unrealistic expectations on me. She pressured me even before I ever met my current husband to find someone and have kids. I had kids, and shortly after my youngest was born she let me know she wouldn’t be able to help me. I expected such with her age, but it was insane to me how even yet still she would ask me to have more. 

My dad has been in the hospital twice now this year for complications from congestive heart failure. My eldest is 3 and my youngest is 16 months. I am able only to see my dad for a short while in the hospital. They call me everyday to ask if I’m coming to see them. My mom sent me a text today in the middle of my work meetings saying “your dad is asking for you.”

I’ve been so exhausted from just raising kids, dealing with issues with my husband, work, cleaning house, potty training, etc. I saw the text and called her and said “why did you send the text?” She said “I’m just letting you know your dad is asking for you.” I responded “has anything changed? Is anything happening?” She said “nothing changed since yesterday” (when I last saw them). 

Is this practical, or normal ? I’m extremely overwhelmed and this is just added stress coming off as manipulation to me. My father just called me in the middle of writing this and asked me why I’m not at the hospital and I responded, in the middle of playing with my kids, “if you wanted me to be by your side all the time why did you all expect grandkids from me? Did you think that my job was just to give birth to them and abandon them once you needed me?”  I feel horrible I said this. My mom made a comment I can find a baby sitter and that she always sees advertisements for baby sitters. I told her that I can’t afford daycare and a baby sitter everyday to come see you. Then my kids will see me less than 4 hours a day.

I hate to add on this part, but — my dad has literally had everything. Heart surgery, intestinal surgery, cancer, a stroke, etc. His health is declining rapidly. But he will be in the hospital for weeks. Not only can I not afford child care to cover me for weeks — I don’t want to. I want to spend time with my kids, especially knowing that … he’s always in the hospital, and my kids are too young in my opinion not to have me for a set amount of hours a day. My mom told me I’m the a-hole for and that I should respect a dying man’s wishes — but he’s been having a dying man’s wishes for 15 years now.

1imk6md,AITA for telling  my neighbor to stop thinking she is the only one who can do it all?,"I am most likely the asshole.  But parents who think that they are the only ones who can keep the world going tend to drive me crazy.

A little background. I 47 male have had issues with this one neighbor before when she told me that my house gives her anxiety and I have been trying to just avoid her in general. After this one incident I have just avoided her at all costs and if there is anything we need to talk about it goes through the parent’s emails system through the school.

There is a school banquet coming up soon and I have volunteered a couple of times for it. I forgot it was coming up so naturally I didn't say anything. She stopped over the other day to see if I was interested this year. From the past experience my house was in a  
midweek state so kinda organized chaos. She said that she was at another parent’s  
house a couple of houses down from us so she felt it was just easier to just  
stop over than email. I guess it could be believable. 

She asked about the banquet and I looked at the calendar and saw that my stepson was going to begone for that weekend so I told her no I was not going to be helping and that Iwas actually relieved because there is a lot that we have going on right now.  
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF IT. RIGHT???? I thought so. 

Neighbor started on her own tangent about everything she does to manager her house and that includes managing all the kids events. And how she does it all herself with no help. I don't know why she told me all this. I told her and these were my exact words.  
""Well good for you. I'm lucky because in this household we all pull  
together and help one another out. My husband, stepson and myself we all share  
the house responsibilities. Maybe enlist your husband and kids to do the same.  
It might help free up some time."" 

She looked at me like I had a third eyeball and told me nobody knows how to organize the family like she does. I told her well that that was her own fault for making it so that  
nobody could live up to her standards. She didn't really like that answer. I  
told her I needed to get my own stuff done and she needed to go. 

I am now the public enemy number one among the school moms. Which is no big deal to me. It's just a giant clique. But from what I heard earlier I'm an asshole for not understanding what it's like to be a parent these days. This is funny. Last I knew I had three step kids one of which lives with me and my husband full time.

1ina65n,AITA for writing so bad my teacher couldn't read it because he didn't let me use my support?,"I (14f) live in the UK and therefore have to do my GCSEs next year. In preparation for these tests, we must do ""mini"" tests with our chosen subjects before. I also happen to have severe dyspraxia. I can talk and ""look normal"" but only as a result of years of OT. I can't run properly or move quickly and the one thing I can't do is write.

My old school didn't teach students to write normally and we were scolded if our handwriting wasn't in cursive/joined up so I never learned to write like the other kids quickly - all my writing is in cursive and I only learnt to write with a fountain pen (the school also didn't allow us to carry non-fountain pens). I manage just fine as I have had a laptop concession and word processor for any writing task that takes longer than 30 minutes and recently taken it up full time as my condition worsened with puberty.

**Heres where my story starts**. My teacher (??M) (we'll call him Mr S) gave out the test papers for a history test - a test that requires 8 essay style questions so naturally I pulled out my device (that I don't normally use in history because there's not a lot of writing - its mostly sheets and bullet points) but Mr S stopped me. He said he didn't see my name on the list of students allowed (even though I am definitely on the list as the only student there with a concession and extra time) and demanded I put my device away or he'd give me a detention.

Begrudgingly, I put it away and decided if he wanted to play, then I'd shoot too. I'm rather petty and this was one of those instances but I feel it was justified.

I opened my paper and while writing my answer, I didn't exert myself. This was an hour long assessment and I knew I'd burn out if I did my ""bestest girlies neatest caligraphy"" so I didn't. I just wrote loosely and didn't clench my hand to the point of cramping.

By the final question, I was exhausted and practically scrawling away so I handed in my sheet and went directly to the head of counseling and welfare. I told her everything and she went to give Mr S a slap on the wrist and re load my name on the god protected list.

Soon after, Mr S reported me to a teacher I'm under for being ""disrespectful"" after my writing was ""unacceptable"" and basically accused me of attention seeking. I have cc (ed) in the welfare department who have my records in the email he sent me and made sure to keep up my teachers pet act I've been building my reputation around for the past 4 years (in front of teachers anyway) and now I'm having the office tell me it was unfair on Mr S who didn't know the severity of my condition and I should've just talked to him (I tried). However, my friends are backing me up.

Its been weighing on my mind so tell me Reddit.

Am I the Asshole?

TL;DR

My teacher didn't believe I had a real problem and forced me to hand write a test. I reported him and scrawled my essay.",Kidsdontcheatonyou,2845,0.949999988079071,148,1739309806,2025-02-11 15:36:46,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ina65n/aita_for_writing_so_bad_my_teacher_couldnt_read/,2,2025
1inbt3w,"AITA for refusing to help my dad's ex-wife with rent after his passing, even though she is struggling and my half-brother is still a minor?","So here’s the situation. My dad passed away 3.5 years ago when my half-brother was 11 years old. My dad and his ex-wife had been separated for about 5 years before his death, but they weren’t legally divorced. During that time, they didn’t really have much contact, and she didn’t join any family gatherings or events. Even during the funeral, she wasn’t there where my aunt, my grandma, and I (32F) were, and I didn’t have a close relationship with her.

My dad was also struggling financially and he didn't left anything behind apart from a small boat he had purchased in my name, which I sold and put the money aside for my brother’s future and started paying towards his needs such as education fees and monthly allowances for him. My dad had still been supporting my half-brother’s mom financially, even though they weren’t living together, and I only had to communicate with her a few times fter his passing about my brother's expenses.

Here’s where things get tricky: my aunt has been paying the rent for my dad’s ex-wife and my half-brother for the past 3.5 years, as my dad’s ex-wife claims to be struggling financially. She works full time but also receives a pension through my dad. Now, the landlord wants them to move out, and my aunt, who has been helping with rent all this time, is not in a position to pay for the rent in the future apartment. My dad’s ex-wife is now asking me for help with rent, claiming she’s still struggling.

I’m honestly conflicted. I don’t have a strong relationship with her, and I don’t feel it’s my responsibility to help her out with rent, especially when I’m already helping my brother. I’ve made it clear that I can’t help with the rent, but she’s persistent and threatening me to tell my brother that I'm this bad sister who is not helping him out with their housing situation and she told me if I'm not helping her out with rent, I shouldn't act like a good sister and help out on anything else as well. I feel like it’s not fair that I should take on this burden when I’m already looking out for my brother’s well-being, and especially when my aunt has already been helping her all this time. My primary focus is on my brother’s future, and I just don’t want to take on any more responsibilities that aren’t my own.

I also want to mention that while my dad financially supported my dad’s ex-wife when they were separated, their relationship was strained, and I never felt close to her. I’m struggling with whether I’m being unreasonable for not helping her, even though she’s in a tough situation.

So, AITA for not wanting to help her out with rent, even though she’s claiming that she is struggling?",Professional-Cry1342,2073,0.9700000286102296,221,1739313906,2025-02-11 16:45:06,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1inbt3w/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_dads_exwife_with/,2,2025
1inbw35,AITA for not “passing it on” at the food cart?,"I was standing in a long line at a food cart, waiting to get a popcorn refill and the gentleman ahead of me gave his order, then said, “And whatever he wants!” directing his generous smile my way. 

I immediately protested, “Sir, you don’t need to pay for mine.” But he said he wanted to, and I didn’t want it to be a thing, so I thanked him. Then he looked me in the eye and (expectantly) said “Pass it on.”

He smiled again and looked at the long line behind me before turning to get his order. I got my refill of popcorn and said thank you again and he looked so disappointed that I left instead of saying “I’ll pay for the guy behind me.” And he stopped me and seriously said ”Make sure you pass it on someday.” I repeated the words of someone I once tried to pay back: “Pay it forward- that’s what it’s all about.” I thanked him again and escaped.

But I came for the cheapest thing on the menu - popcorn is like two dollars. And there was a large family behind me. And most people were coming in big groups for alcohol. So I might have gotten free popcorn, and I appreciate the gesture, but I might then have had to shell out fifty bucks for beer for a bunch of randos.

And I’ve never liked the “pass it on” thing. It’s generous of the first person, then the last person gets a freebie, but as is often said here, all the middle people get their prices randomized and it’s a headache for the workers.

So I will pay it forward sometime, and I definitely have in the past, but I didn’t play along in the moment and I could tell the man felt his grand gesture was wasted.

1io3thv,AITA? Mother-In-Law invites self over during lunch and tells my partner later that she was offended we didn't share.,"I (26m) and my partner (44m) just bought a house together. We've been in the process of moving boxes and unpacking in between going to work/school/etc. Our parents respectively have been helping a lot, gifting us the things we didn't have room for in our previous too-small apartment. 

However, my parents help when I ask. They show up when I need them. They don't drop in with a ""Hey I'm coming over."" text. And they certainly don't spend hours following me around while I'm putting things away to tell me that I'm doing it wrong. Nor do they gift us a white bathmat, just to criticize the fact that I actually put it in the bathroom because ""it'll get dirty, it's white."". They also do not criticize my decor choices or spend hours scrubbing things that do not need scrubbed. They also do not tell me how to hang curtains or act like I'm too stupid to do regular handy-chores and yardwork.

You know who does? His mother. 

A few days ago, she sent that ""Hey, I'm coming over text."" right after I started cooking lunch which was annoying, but whatever. She gets there and without prompt tells me that she brought food with her. She says she's gonna have her little sandwich. And while I understand passive-aggressive boomer speak I don't entertain it. She said she had food, therefore I did not offer. 

Upon realizing she had given herself the duty of scrubbing our brand-new and clean bathroom for hours, I did, however, put on some coffee. We're all big coffee drinkers.

Of course, because I made it, it wasn't good enough. She managed to try to take coffee before it was done so it was dripping on the burner while she was pouring it. 

She stayed through lunch (10am, we have breakfast at 4:30am) clear to dinner. She even stayed when my partner left for their study group. 

While I was making dinner I was hoping she'd go home. I was tired of her appearing behind me to micro-manage my unpacking. My partner (who returned around 3pm) and I began talking about how tired we were, and how we needed to take showers, etc because asking her to leave was out of the question. Trust me, I wanted to. 

Eventually, after realizing we did not make her dinner she left. I however did not realize this was the case right away, because she was still talking about how she brought food. And given that she invited herself to do things that didn't need done, I took her word for it. She's an adult, she said she was good and that she had food. She's not an incompetent baby that I need to micro-manage. 

But yeah, she's kinda mad and my partner was agreeing saying we were bad hosts. I do not agree, I think his mom is negative and pushy. And it feels like she finds reasons to show up and be critical. I'm not entertaining this behavior.

1iourgj,AITA for standing my ground with a crazy mother in law,"AITA for standing my ground with my MIL? 

My husband and I are expecting our first baby in June this year, it is the first grandchild on both sides of the family. My MIL was always a bit crazy prior to me getting pregnant but seems to have gone up a notch now. She has said things like ‘I can’t wait to tell people I’m going to be a mum again’, told someone I was pregnant and they doubted her so she reassured them by saying ‘no look at how fat she’s getting’ while I was standing beside them & made a complete song and a dance about how she needed to be the first person to buy our baby clothes and it’s going home from hospital outfit, the list goes on about how she’s amazing and no one will ever birth children like she did. What really tipped me over the edge recently was to do with our scan of the baby. For context we live in the Uk and you are provided 2 ultrasound scans, one at 12 weeks and another at 20 weeks they will usually print 3/4 pictures of the scan for you to take but this is ones they chose and your given what your given. When we went to visit I had shown the first 12 week scan and she demanded to keep it, I explained that as it’s a free scan with the NHS we only get a few and she can’t keep it as it is special to us, I did however take a photocopy of it to give to her. This is no longer good enough for the 20 week scan and she is now calling me and telling my husband he needs to bring her one of the scan photos as it’s her grandchild to. I am now fed up having to explain to my husband how this woman makes me feel horrible calling me fat and now demanding that she gets one of our scans that really means a lot to me.

1iowi46,AITA for telling my fiancée to stop being a brat?,"My fiancée and mom are fighting because my fiancée wanted a wedding at this lake in the mountains that she talked about before the engagement. We visited every year and it’s almost tradition to hike up there and camp there and there is more hiking past that point that we make a long weekend of it. 

My mom is not happy because she is not fit enough for the hike. Her family is because they are a hikers but my mom has knee issues and is overweight and cannot do anything too difficult. This hike is 6 km to get to the lake and everyone in the wedding party can do it. My fiancée agreed but then wanted to do it in her aunt’s backyard. Her aunt has the nicest backyard out of the people we know but I wouldn’t say it’s still very nice. She said she was just going to buy some string lights and an arch and do it there. I have been to the backyard and it’s not bad it just has garden beds and chickens in the corner which my mom isn’t happy with. My mom wants a formal location and is arguing the backyard spot is her punishing her from her first option. My fiancée denies it and says it’s because she doesn’t want to pay for a ceremony spot and she thinks the backyard is prettiest spot that is free. We looked at some public parks but they get very crowded and renting them is already not an option as they mostly filled up.

My mom found a rental spot in a building with a decorative wall and benches that cost $1200 for 2h rental and is something she felt like is pretty enough for a wedding. This is the cheapest option other than the parks we come across. My fiancée refuses to pay for it even though she agreed to half and told my mom if she wants to dictate the spot she needs to pay for it. My mom is taking it as her punishing her for not letting the wedding happen at the lake. They are arguing and I think my fiancée and I each paying for half is an easy fix and she is making it difficult for no reason. She refuses to make any compromises and told my mom if she doesn’t want the wedding at her aunt’s backyard then she doesn’t have to come. We argued about it as well and I called her a brat because it’s her way or the high way and she called me an asshole. I don’t know why this is such a huge compromise to her but AITA?

1ipofgi,AITA for not giving my sister credit for the tasks I get done around the house?,"Some Background: I (19F) live at home with my sister (20F) and mom (55F). At home we have 5 pets, our house is on the smaller size but it does have 3 floors.

My mom works 5 days a week. She spends most of her time on her days off, getting extra work done. My sister and I work 2 days a week, family rules dictate we can’t work more during the semester in order to prioritize our studies. The other five days, we both have classes. All of my classes are in person meanwhile all of my sister’s classes are online. I also have doctors appointments throughout the week each week.

•

My sister and I have equal responsibilities in the house. We must take care of the pets, clean what needs to be cleaned, etc. It’s basic stuff. The problem comes that I’m the only one that who gets the job done. When I get home from class (4 hours after my sister gets up), I have to turn off lights and open all the curtains.  Same with walking/feeding the animals, cleaning dishes, cleaning the other rooms in the house. I do it all every single day.

My sister has accepted that if she doesn’t do stuff, then I’ll just do it and I won’t say anything about it. The alternative is me not getting the stuff done then both of us get in trouble.

Today, our mom gave both of us the task of replacing the kitty litter. I spent the day studying and it completely slipped my mind. I fully admit that I did not do it. When she got home, she was frustrated with us for not having the job done. In a moment of irritation, I yelled and said “maybe if [sisters name] helped out for once, stuff could get done”. My mom asked me to explain what I meant, so I told her about having to do all the jobs by myself on top of all the stuff I had on my own. This of course got my sister in a lot of trouble.

I feel justified in not giving my sister credit because she really has not given any help. But my sister is calling me a jerk because I should have just let the lecture end by not mentioning her not helping. Instead she got chewed out, which didn’t help her mood since she was having a hard time with her boyfriend breaking up with her.

So I don’t know. Am I the asshole for not giving my sister credit for me getting tasks done around the house without her help?

(Before you ask: why don’t you move out? Financial reasons, with college expenses it’s too expensive to move into an apartment or dorm. The other reason for me personally is that I’m in a disability program that’s helping me get the skills I need to live on my own, I’m not ready to be independent yet.)",LlamaDawn-Throwaway,954,0.959999978542328,51,1739576619,2025-02-14 17:43:39,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ipofgi/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_credit_for_the/,2,2025
1iqccwe,"AITA for not inviting my friend to a party, after he consistently overstays and breaks all social contracts?","Recently I had some friends over for a party at my house, and notably didn’t invite my friend “John.” I didn’t lie to him, or say that we weren’t doing it, or rub it in his face, I just had some friends over and he didn’t get the invite. 

I felt bad, but at the same time he always stays too late, makes things really uncomfortable for me, and is just a difficult guest to have in my house. I hosted a super bowl party, and he stayed roughly two hours later than everyone else, even though I straight up told him, “parties over dude.” He vapes, he says the n-word (which i don’t think anyone should say, but especially not him) and makes jokes abt some of my mental health issues. 

I love him to death and he’s one of my oldest friends, but it’s at the point where if he’s coming to my house I have anxiety the whole day leading up to it. 

Anyways, he called me during my party and asked me what I was up to, and if I wanted to catch a movie. I said I actually had a couple people over so I couldn’t tonight, and he asked who, I told him and he asked why he wasn’t invited/if he could come, and i said something along the lines of “ehh not tonight man.” He kind of lost his shit at me and sent a bunch of angry texts the next day, which is imo a huge overreaction bc i tried to be as nice as i could about things. 

so ig aitah if i just stop inviting him? 

EDIT: for everyone calling me a racist in the comments; 

some things you should know, that i should’ve included in the original post. he recently had a large personality change seemingly out of nowhere , which included some things like new music taste, excessive working out, and as of LAST WEEK saying the n word. 

i am not a racist, i do not condone racism, or his actions. he HAS NOT been invited back to my house since the first time he said that word, and will not unless he changes some things. i am not “continuing to associate with a racist,” as this is a new behavior, and my other friends feel the same way as i do.

1irx3w4,"AITA for refusing to stay at my niece + her husbandswedding accomodation because it costs almost €2,000?","We have paid for the flights to the wedding and when I said we would book somewhere outside of the venue (20 mins walk from the place), they got stroppy with me. 


The cost of the accomodation she was expecting my wife and I to pay was just south of €2000 on top of the flights that we (of course, happily) paid for. 


We simply cannot afford that accomodation price in the presence of an Airbnb that came in at a fraction of the price. However, we are being made feel guilty over wanting to do things cheaper. 


It feels rather unfair to be expected to fork out that much money (and without any clear lines of communication or early notice to begin with) yet we are being made out to be the enemy. 


Realistically, we will have paid for flights and our wedding outfits + gotten a gift for her so even before the big cost of the accommodation, we will have forked out even more before we even reach the destination!! 


Am I being unreasonable to not want to be in the accommodation because I don't want to pay that kind of money or is there some unwritten wedding etiquette I'm not following?

1irxbpr,AITA for telling my friend's dad not to walk into my house uninvited?,"I (17f) and my friend (17f) hung out like we normally do at my house. She use to drive herself over, but she hit a deer and totalled her car (she was okay). Friend's dad drops and picks her up now, which was totally fine at first. 

He does this thing - that I think is weird - where he will walk her up to the door, and walk up to the door to pick her up. This was also fine, it may be weird but harmless. 
Recently, he's been rude (in my opinion). He picked up Friend and instead of doing the normal thing of knocking on the door and waiting for us to answer, he just walked in. Now, Friend just walks into my house but she has complete permission, her father does not. 

I talked to my mom about it the first time and she also thought it was very weird. just earlier today he came to get her, and he walked into my house. 
I said somthing along the lines of, ""did you just walk in?? Did you even knock?""

He said we don't respond when he knocks, so I said back that he could've texted or called, which he said we never reply. Not only is that not true, but he has the ability to ping her phone through parental controls. 

Now he says I'm getting too defensive about him walking in and says we're doing something we shouldn't be, but truly I just think it's weird and rude to walk into someone's house, not to mention a safety hazzard, without them opening the door for you when you don't have permission. He told Friend he didn't trust her further and he is obviously now iffy about her coming over here.

Very luckily if he doesn't allow her to come over we only have a few more monthsountil we're adults, but it would really suck. I don't know what to say or do anymore, but I don't think it's right on many levels to just walk into my house, not even my house but my mother's house. 

Tldr; Friend's helicopter dad walked into my house uninvited and without knocking, and thinks I'm too defensive about it. 


Edit/update

I should've clarified this in my original story, but the lock on my front door is slightly broken. It does lock, however it is pretty difficult and often it goes unlocked. I was recently told we don't always make sure the door is locked at night. My parents are aware of this, but my mother's husband isn't really a ""get it done"" Type of guy, and we've been low on funds. 

My house is one floor and it's fairly small, so if friend's dad knocked on the door, we are fairly sure we would've heard it. He let us know when he was leaving his house, about 15 minutes from my house. She was completely ready when he got there, about 25 minutes later, the reason we weren't standing right by the door when he got there. My step brother (also 17) was home but he didn't hear a knock, only came out when he heard the front door open. He said he knocked, but we're not entirely sure he did. 

I can drive and I offer to come get Friend, my mom also offers to get her because he drives her all the time but he insists that he drives her. My parents don't get home until past 4pm, and he knows that if he wants her home earlier than that he has to get her, or again we would drop her off later on.

I talked to my mom about everything later after it happened and it made her realize that if my friend's dad is going to just walk into our house, then really anyone can. 

Our house lock works like I said, but it's slightly broken and difficult to lock, however everyone in the house should be more careful to lock the door. We are also getting new locks after this, which is great. 

My mom is worried that Friend's dad won't allow her to come over anymore but it sounds like he's already on the edge about that. He is only seeing from our perspective and thinks we're hiding something, and if my mom tells him it makes her uncomfortable then hopefully he'll see from her side. 

No matter what happens my friend turns 18 in June and we graduate this year, so it's not too much longer but it still would suck not being able to hang out at my house anymore.

1irxhxa,"UPDATE: AITA for refusing to help my dad's ex-wife with rent after his passing, even though she is struggling and my half-brother is still a minor?","
[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/3cv9Ud9zK2)

Over the weekend, I realized I was blocked on socials by the ex-wife and also my brother removed me as well.

I reached out to my brother directly because I wanted to make sure he knew that none of this was his fault and that I will always be there for him. I didn’t want to say anything that could damage his relationship with his mom, but I needed him to know that I did nothing against him and that he can always reach out to me.

To my relief, he responded right away and reassured me that he has no hard feelings toward me at all. He already knew that a lot of what his mom told him wasn’t true and even said he was actually happy about the decision I made. He told me that if he were in my position, he would have done the same thing.

One of the most upsetting parts of our conversation was when he admitted that he never liked asking me for money through his mom because it made him feel like a beggar, but she insisted on it. He also told me that she had been looking for an apartment way beyond her budget and had been trying to collect money from different people to afford it, which confirmed my suspicions. I also learned that now they found an apartment within whatever budget she has. 

What really broke my heart was when he said he needed to delete our messages because his mom sometimes checks his phone, and if she found out we talked, she would be very upset with him. It made me realize just how much control she has over him.

I reassured him that the money I was sending for him is still his, kept safely with me, and that when he needs anything, I will find a way to help him—but it won’t be through his mom anymore. He understood and seemed relieved. He also told me that he’s already thinking about his future carefully and wants to choose a profession where he can be financially independent, so he never has to worry about money.

Honestly, I was happily surprised by how mature and self-aware he is for a 15-year-old. Despite everything, he’s handling the situation with so much understanding and perspective, and it makes me even prouder to be his sister.

For now, I will keep in touch with him privately to make sure he knows he is not alone. I told him that when he grows up, I’ll be there to support him, especially for things like university. He knows that no matter what happens, I will always have his back.

Edit: I'm not giving him a debit card or anything as clearly he doesn't need and want it. I will save the money for his future.

1iryg40,AITA for wearing my wrist brace at work while my coworker has a broken wrist,"
Okay so this is so weird, I (24F) work as a cashier at a sub place, and my coworker last week broke her wrist falling on the ice, so she is in a cast.

When I was 14 I was diagnosed with tendinitis in both wrists, for the most part it doesn’t flare up unless I’m doing a lot with my hands, well I’ve been doing a lot of embroidery recently and as such, have caused a flare up. 

It’s been bothering me for about two weeks and I wear my brace at home, and generally just sucked up the pain while at work, because with my coworker wearing a cast I felt weird about wearing my brace.

Well yesterday it was bad enough I had to wear it at work, as I’m putting my stuff down and getting ready to start my shift, another one of my coworkers who I’ll call Lisa, started to glare at me and asked in the usually snobby tone she uses with me “what is that for”

So I told her about my tendinitis and what it was, she then started to get huffy like I was making it up. Mind you, the coworker who has the broken wrist didn’t care, she didn’t say anything. But the rest of my shift Lisa kept giving me dirty looks, which is not out of the norm (she doesn’t like me, long story) 

Close to the end of my shift I had to use the bathroom, and being as it’s hard to do so with a wrist brace, I took it off. After coming out and washing my hands I was putting the brace back on when Lisa made another off handed comment about how I was lucky I could take mine off.

I didn’t do this to spite anyone, my wrist just hurts but now I’m getting ready for another shift and trying to decide if I should just suck it up and go without my brace at work.",Pardoned_Potato,5105,0.9700000286102296,295,1739835355,2025-02-17 17:35:55,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1iryg40/aita_for_wearing_my_wrist_brace_at_work_while_my/,2,2025
1isp11m,AITA for telling my MIL she can't see her grandchild until at least 6 months old?,"My MIL treated me very poorly after I had our first daughter during the pandemic. I had severe PPD and PPA and eventually I had full blown post partum psychosis. There's alot of things she said & did but her crowning moment was when I was being taken away by ambulance in full blown psychosis and she later referred to this event as a ""barrage of shit"". When i asked her to ""please not say things like that because they're hurtful & mean"" her response was ""you don't tell me how to talk"". My husband and her have a strained relationship and it's been even more strained since this. She has never offered any apology and acts as if she was justified in her actions. When I pointed out that we're all adults and we're all equal she said we weren't equal because ""shes the parent"". Anyways, Im pregnant again with our second and I don't want her around at all post partum. She caused such distress the first time around, tried to pit my husband and I against each other, tried to get my parents involved. She wasn't seeing her granddaughter as often as she wanted so she threw out toys she bought for her, sent back photos we sent of her, I could go on and on. I don't want to deal with it again and my husband REALLY doesn't want to deal with it again. We kept my current pregnancy private-ish until I was 6 months along. During a discussion with my MIL last night she told us she would be staying in town around my due date to ""help out"". We tried to politely decline but she was not taking the hint so eventually we just told her flat out we didn't want her around until baby was a bit older (atleast 6 months old) because we don't want any extra stress. She obviously reacted badly and is calling us toxic monsters (especially me) who are trying to deprive her of time with her grandchild (yet again, she said the same with the first one but reality was that i was really sick and couldn't be around a lot of people and also it was covid). Am I the asshole for holding this boundary? Part of me thinks i'm being to brash. Another part thinks back to all the chaos she caused and I feel at peace with the decision. She's not a terrible person at all, she just handled the situation so poorly that I do not want to go through it again. Husband agrees. So, am I the asshole?

1isqjm1,AITAH for taking my dad home after missing a train instead of waiting for the next one?,"My dad (60m), my sister (22f) and I (20m) were supposed to take a train downtown for a car show. I was the one who arranged and paid for everything since I thought it would be good family time.

I told him to be ready at 12:15 pm so that we would have enough time to drive to the station and park before the train arrives at 1:04. The drive is about 25 minutes, so my thinking was that I would have 49 minutes to drive to the station and figure out parking and to get to our terminal (I had never been to this station so just wanted to have extra time incase things go wrong).

He said he would come out to the car at 12:15. My sister and I got to his house at 12:10 and waited. He didn't come out until 12:31. I told him we would be late but he said we were fine since it was a only a 25 minute drive.

We arrived at the station at 12:55. Here's where the first problem came up. We could only find reserved parking spots. We parked in a reserved spot so that I could get out of the car and go find somebody to ask where the regular lot was. Turns out, nobody is in the customer support area as it's a holiday. At this point, it's 1:00.

Then, my dad saw a security officer in the lot and told me to go ask him where the regular lot was. He told me it was at the other side of the road. So, I park up in the regular lot, run back to the boarding area (where my dad and sister was waiting). The doors of the train literally closed as I was about 20 metres from the train. 

My dad and sister didn't board as they saw I couldn't make it. I was upset, but willing to let it go as there was another train coming in an hour. Then, everything got heated. My dad got mad at me for missing the train because ""I should have known where to park instead of wasting time in the reserved lot looking for the regular lot""! Now I was mad. I told him that the reason I wanted to come earlier was because I didnt know the station and where everything was, and since he was late, we didnt have enough time. He said I shouldve researched the parking lot before coming. We got into an argument, which eventually got very bad. At this point I didn't even want to go to the car show as I was so pissed at him for blaming me. I told him that I would wait in the car and that he and my sister could go to the show and I'll pick them up when they come back. He called me selfish as he and my sister got ready for this family outing just for me and that he wanted me to come on the next train as we already made the drive over to the station. I told him no because I was in tears from the argument and wasn't in the mood to spend an entire day with him after he said terrible things to me for something he did.

Eventually, he got in the truck and we headed home. He told me to never speak to him again as I was selfish and wasted his time (he will hold this grudge for at least a month).

1iti2n0,AITA for telling my dad he chose between me and his fiancé when he prioritized her surgery over mine? [UPDATE],"OG post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/YGMXJvjGhl
Hey guys, been awhile. Thanks for your love, I’ve been dragging my feet on an update but here it is. Surgery recovery has been great, I’ve been in therapy since 12, so my therapist knows everything about my dad. Can I just say it’s weird seeing my story posted on other apps with subway surfers and wood work? Love that people think my dad is a sperm donor and not a dad across all platforms.
Senior night is on Valentine’s Day which I’ve told him weeks in advance saying “games start at 7 usually but I would get at the school 30 minutes early since we will probably do it before the game.” I texted his mom(Memaw) to ask him if he was going and he texted her: “oh I never got a date, she doesn’t tell me anything” BULLSH!T! I told her I’ll go NC if he doesn’t go and I will go LC if he does go. If he wants to know? He can fvcking ask and write it in his calendar.
I told my mom to stop staying neutral and tell me why he acts like this, the relationship is almost ruined so there is no point in her trying to save it. He likes to play victim, try to make it sound like my mom doesn’t want him around, uses it as an excuse to make him look like a good guy. I’ve seen text messages when I was younger of my mom trying to get my dad to make an effort, (I showed her the first post so I’ll send her this one too, hi mom, the kindle had screenshots of some convos ily, I saw them in August when I found it so I knew for awhile). I see my mom in a new light now. She will be walking me down the aisle and my first dance, she sacrificed so much of herself for me. She is not only mom but my dad. 
For non Americans, senior night usually involves seniors and chosen people to walk them across the floor. My dad walked me down for my fall senior night, but he will not be one of my people this Friday. I am desperate to keep contact with my sister, I know Memaw will help me with that. I know that if fiancé and dad break up, he will do the same thing to my sister.
Friday came and passed, my dad got p!ssy when he realized I didn’t want him to walk me across the gym floor. He along with Memaw and my sister left during halftime. (We did the walk before the varsity game and pep band can’t leave the stands until third, same as marching band plus Memaw has been to previous basketball games along with football games). I left dad a long voice mail and message Friday for leaving especially since my sister begged to see me and he refused her. I told Memaw I was disappointed that she left when she knew what happens at games.
 Monday I finally sent him boundaries and blocked him. I know I’m going to cry later, this is going to be hard for me.

1iucnv5,AITAH for being rude when my wife had a zoom meeting in my office?,"I had a medical procedure this morning/afternoon and didn’t arrive home till about 3PM. While I was gone, we had some cleaners come to our home so my wife relocated from her office to my office where the dogs were being kept. This keeps them quiet. The cleaners left at 1PM so the whole house was available for my wife to have her meetings. Let me add that my wife has a local office, but wanted to work from home today.
The medical procedure makes me very sick, and I needed my medication, which was in my office. When I got home, my wife was still in my office, even though the cleaners were long gone. She refused to even look at me and I could’ve just walked in, but I think she would have gotten angry. I took 15 minutes to do a few quick chores for my wife, came back and she was still in there.  So I stood outside my office and waited. I was there long enough that I decided to just wait in the bedroom. When I came out, my wife was very angry, and sincerely called me the asshole. 
I explained that the cleaners had been gone for hours, and my wife had the rest of the house to have this meeting. She called me an asshole again like this is my fault. I couldn’t get into my office to get my medications, but I am the bad guy. I feel that my wife has terrible WFH etiquette and because of that makes her abrasive to these types of situations.

1iucy76,AITA for not explicitly stating my punch is non-alcoholic?,"I (25F) recently attended a potluck-style work party, and brought punch, which has since caused a problem between myself and another coworker (42F), who we’ll call Sandy.
Last week, my boss hosted a party at his house to celebrate the end of the busy season, and a job well done. All of my coworkers and their spouses were invited, and we decided it would work well to do a potluck to offset the cost of feeding everyone (about 35 people, since not everyone who came brought a spouse or significant other). I volunteered to make a punch that I’ve brought to previous work events that everyone said they enjoyed, as well as some fruit to go with it. This was a casual party with alcohol present, but since I have some coworkers who don’t drink, I didn’t add any alcohol to this punch, and figured that if people really wanted some they’d just add it themselves. Fast forward a couple hours, and Sandy is getting even louder and more dramatic than normal, and is stumbling around the party. I didn’t think much of it and figured she brought her own drinks, or was adding some of the hosts alcohol that was put out into something else. She suddenly fell off the chair she was sitting on, and made a big show of saying that it’s because she was so drunk- she then asked me, in front of the rest of our coworkers, what it was that I put in the punch. I was confused, and told her what was in it (just a mix of gingerale, 7up, orange juice, and a can of juice concentrate), and she wanted to know what alcohol I put in it, because she’s been drinking it all night, and is “really feeling it”. I told her that I didn’t put any alcohol in it, and asked if maybe someone else had spiked the punch bowl- nobody said they added anything, and one of my coworkers who doesn’t drink even said that they’d also been drinking the punch all evening, and was still completely sober. I also would like to clarify that I understand how context can matter, like if everyone else was really drunk then that can make even a sober person feel like they’re loaded, but that definitely was not the vibe- Sandy was the only person acting “drunk”. She then got really quiet, and went by herself to the bathroom. The rest of my coworkers and I exchanged some awkward glances, and tried to laugh it off. She left shortly after, and I received an angry text from her about how I shouldn’t have embarrassed her like that, and that now she looks like an “idiot” in front of our bosses, and the rest of our coworkers. She’s been hostile to me at work ever since, and is basically refusing to talk to me. I didn’t think I did anything wrong, and most of my coworkers agree with me, but some say that I should have just let her go on thinking that the punch was alcoholic to save her the embarrassment, and I’m wondering now if I’m in the wrong.

It also turns out that we leave Morocco the morning after my birthday and my mum “couldn’t book any other flights” (she could they were just on sale so more convenient for her ig).

Recently I was back in our hometown and she invited me to her birthday brunch to celebrate her 28th b-day. One day on my way home I happened to stumble across an estate sale where I found a set of really nice, crystal champagne glasses that were in really good condition and cheaper than their worth. Mary lives a high quality fancy lifestyle, so I thought they would be perfect for her, especially because they were within my budget (at the time I had been recovering from student loans and just put down a deposit on my first apartment in the city).

Fast forward to the brunch, we had a really good time and I got to catch up with Mary and other friends from high-school. Mary was eager to open the presents, and when she got to mine, she seemed to enjoy them, asking me where I got them since there was no label. I explained that I didn't know the brand, but the person running the estate sale had assured me that they were authentic and had been a wedding gift to the previous owners. At the mention of the estate sale, Mary became visibly disgusted. Although she didn't say anything to my face, she was very passive aggressive towards me for the rest of the afternoon. I overheard her whispering to some of the other guests about how I had the audacity to give her a used item and that she would be discarding them later.

  
After the event was over, I approached her privately, not wanting to make a scene and asked that if she wasn't going to use the glasses, if she could give them back as I would put them to good use and know their quality. She flipped out and told me it was extremely rude to ask for them back and it was not my business what she did with them.

My family is understanding and thinks that I did nothing wrong, but some mutual friends also at the event think otherwise. So, am I the a-hole?",cereal4dinner12,8680,0.9700000286102296,714,1740268492,2025-02-22 17:54:52,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ivwpqc/aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_give_back_a_gift_i/,2,2025
1ivwr5u,AITA for embarrassing my sister's rude boyfriend at dinner?,"I (28F) have a good career and recently bought a house. My sister (26F) is engaged to her fiancé (30M), who I’ve never liked. At a family dinner, he made a joke about how “women like me” use men for financial stability. I asked him what he meant, and he said that because I have nice things, I must be dating rich guys.

I told him that I paid for everything myself, unlike him—who my sister supports financially. This caused a huge argument. Now my sister and parents are demanding I apologize for embarrassing him, but I refuse. AITA?

1iwm13i,AITA for not cutting his hair? He isn’t talking to me at the moment,"Ever since the marriage of my parents, my mum used to cut my dad’s hair on a monthly basis. 
However, this arrangement changed several years ago when my mum sadly passed alway. 
Since my mum’s passing, things became odd. Dad will asking my brother in-law to cut his hair. He will offer my sister and my family a nice dinner to meet up as well which we were all fine with at first, but now both my sister and I have our own children to take care of, we have been pretty occupied with our family and no longer felt we have the time to cut his hair.

I recently took over the barber duty because I was away overseas for a few years. Being the son, I have been discussing with my brother in-law to convince my dad to find his own barber. So last week over the phone,  I tried in the politest way to ask if he can settle with a barber of his choice. But everything suddenly went wrong when he didn’t like my idea at all. He insisted that my brother in-law or I must cut his hair. He cut the phone call off before I had much to explain. And we haven’t spoke since that day.

Am I an asshole for getting into this situation?
My dad has been somewhat controlling being an Asian parent. But us family are fed up with his demand.

1iwmrhj,AITA for embarrassing my parents in public over an allergy?,"I (19F) have been allergic to dairy since I was a baby. My doctor and parents had a whole schedule for the first year of my life to get me acclimated to dairy. It went from me throwing up every night as a baby to the point where I could eat a pretty unrestricted diet and have no real symptoms other than stomach pain when I was in middle school. 

This sounds kind of stupid lol but it took me until a couple of months ago to realise that the stomach pain is actually a symptom and not a thing I just need to deal with. I was on a school trip and asked if I could have the dairy-free meals (because I knew my stomach would feel icky from motion sickness and traveling) and I actually ended up feeling great, so ever since coming back to university I've basically gone dairy-free and my digestion has been great.  However, because I now have lost all my tolerance for dairy, even very little makes me nearly as sick as when I was a really young child. 

I've told my parents this and they basically said ""Do whatever you want at school but we didn't spend nearly two decades getting you used to dairy just to get it out now, that's a lot of time wasted."" I had to go home recently for a family event that my parents hosted and we had a big family meal with a lot of extended relatives where nearly everything had dairy. I tried scraping sauce and cheese off of stuff but I ingested some anyway clearly because I felt gross and spent a lot of time in the bathroom. 

At one point my mother got annoyed at me for leaving the table so much (I was leaving a lot) and said kind of angrily, ""Why are you being so rude at this event?"" This annoyed me because I didn't feel I was being rude, I was sick, so I said to her ""Why don't you take my allergy seriously? You're the reason I've been eating stuff that makes me sick for all my life.""

The issue is that I think that was kind of harsh of me. My parents do believe I have an allergy, they just also believe they cured it with the diet plan my doctor had me on. And they've told me that they only pursued it because my doctor said it could increase my quality of life to not have an allergy--which, to be fair, when I was on this plan I was able to digest more without getting sick, my stomach just hurt a lot. I feel like I may've been unnecessarily rude in how I reacted to my mother, and I'm also worried I drew attention to myself that wasn't needed (a lot of my relatives were asking if I was okay after dinner, which was kind of them but really not the focus of the event).

1iwn9y6,AITA for telling my girlfriend I wouldn't make her coffee anymore unless she stops micromanaging me?,"So, for context, I (24M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been together for about two years, living together for roughly six months. Normally, we have a good routine: I wake up first, make coffee, and she wakes up to a nice hot cup. Recently, though, she started getting really particular about how she wants it done. She insists on using this super specific method: measure the grounds to the exact gram, pre-warm the mug in the microwave for 30 seconds, add the milk at a certain temperature, and on and on.

At first, I tried to oblige because hey, if she loves coffee that much, I want to make it nice for her. But it got to a point where every time I handed her a cup, she'd grill me: ***“Did you weigh the grounds first?” “Did you warm the mug?” “Is this whole milk or 2%?”*** If anything was off, even by a tiny bit, she'd sigh and say it wasn't as good as “the right way.” One morning, she literally took the mug from me, dumped it down the sink, and started the process herself—while ranting that I *never* do it the right way.

I got frustrated and told her, “If you’re going to be this picky, just make your own coffee. I’m done making something only to be told how it’s ‘wrong’ every time.” She got upset and said I was overreacting, that she just wants her coffee a certain way, and that I should respect her preferences. I argued that I *was* respecting her preference—I just didn’t appreciate the constant criticism or micromanaging. She accused me of being lazy and unaccommodating.

Now, I’m feeling guilty because I do want her to enjoy her morning coffee, but I’m also tired of feeling like I’m a barista under constant scrutiny. AITA for telling her she can just handle it herself until she stops micromanaging me?

1iy5n9x,AITA for asking my GF if she can take a shower?,"My GF really only showers once a week, twice if I'm lucky.

Typically we go to the gym together, and I've often asked her why she doesn't shower, and she always comes with things like ""Oh women don't really sweat much, and I sweat very little even for women's standards"". And I don't buy it, because I can smell. I used to just suck it up, because I know she's extremely sensitive. Kinda NSFW here but, this even affected our sexlife. I used to love going down on her, but after not showering after workouts/long work days etc I've lost interest. 

Fast forward a bit. She now starts using the sauna at the gym. Maybe on average 2 times a week.  
She. Still. Refuses. To. Shower. I've said ""There's just no way you don't sweat in the sauna, just me sitting 5 minutes in there gets me soaked"". She says she doesn't sweat much there either. And she sits there for 20 minutes.

Things are now worse. I can smell her, very badly. Almost to the point where I try not to breathe in too close to her because it's not good. I've tried so long to give hints to get her to shower more, like: ""Hey do you want to take a shower together ;)?"" But she can't take the hint, and says ""Why would we do that, there's only room for 1 under the water anyway""....

One evening, she wanted to lie down on the floor, and stare at a world map she has. She invited me to lie down next to her, and just talk about where we want to go etc. I lasted for about 1 minute, before I had to make up some dumb excuse as to why I had to get up. She then get's upset and says something along the lines of ""Why are you leaving? You never do stuff with me"" The truth is just I can't be close to her for long.

I'm not even sure if I started to resent her, because it was only this one thing that was bugging me in the relationship. But maybe I did, and that's my fault for being bad at communicating to her.

Anyway, I couldn't hold it any longer. I tried one last time to ask if she wanted to take a shower with me, to show I did want to do stuff with her, but she declined. Then I said ""I know you say you don't sweat, but I can smell. I don't like the smell of sweat etc and it being a popular gym we go to, I would just appreciate if you showered a bit more"". 

She freaked out. WW3 started. She accused me of things and asked if I found her disgusting etc. It almost felt like she wanted me to think she's disgusting for some messed up reason? Like this was an easy way to create distance between us, have less sex, and all that. I'm not sure, maybe I'm overthinking it. It's just to me, it feels awfully obvious to shower if not daily, at least every other day. She said she doesn't want to shower her hair often, but still, you can shower your body. 

Our relationship is borderline over because I hurt her, so AITA? What could I have done differently?

1iy63ei,AITA because I get up for five minutes after my fiancé and I have a meal?,"I (23F) and my fiancé (25M) have been living together for almost 2 years. In the last month or so my fiancé has adopted the habit of attempting to clean his teeth after eating by making this sucking noise constantly. It is such a disgusting noise and I can’t stand listening to it. 

For context, growing up I grew up with a grandfather that ate with his mouth open and my grandmother who had issues with her throat. Because of this, for most of my life I was subject to listening to some pretty gross noises while they ate. As an adult, I don’t want to be subject to the same experience if I don’t have to.

I’ve brought it to my fiancé’s attention several times. Every time he acknowledges it and says that he’ll try to stop, he just feels like there’s something in his teeth. I have suggested floss, toothpicks, those portable toothbrushes. Nothing has worked, he still continues to do it.

I don’t really see why I have to force myself to listen to him doing that so after we eat I’ve made it a point to get up and go sit in a different area of the house for five minutes.

We got into an argument about it and he is calling me an asshole because I shouldn’t be getting this upset about something he can’t help. Like I said, I’ve already told him several times that I’m not gonna subject myself to listening to him do that. If he’s not gonna make a more conscious effort to not do it then I’m going to remove myself from situations where I listen to him do that. 

I’m not even trying to make him feel bad or give him this ultimatum, but I don’t understand why I need to force myself to listen to him do something that genuinely makes my skin crawl just to make him feel better. It’s also important to note, it’s not like he does this just after big meals. He does this multiple times a day after eating pretty much anything.

Her mother has said that they will need to use both the spare room bed and our own bed when they stay as they can’t share a queen sized spare bed for 1 week as they’ll “not be able to sleep in the same bed together all week” blaming the bed size. My GF has unhappily agreed to keep the peace but it’s making me very uncomfortable they’ll be using our bed. WIBTA if I put a lock on our bedroom door just before we go away so they can’t use it?

1iyyk0f,AITA? Refuse to be on kitchen cleaning schedule at work.,"So I (34f) work in a pretty small office with maybe 10-12 full-time employees. It's a generally chill environment and I enjoy working there. But a recurring issue seems to be cleaning, to the point that one section of the offfice has to use a rotating cleaning assignment schedule to ensure certain areas are kept clean. I always cleaned up after myself, and the problem was one or two specific employees, but I didn't mind having an assigned day because I do use the space and supplies. 

However, or supervisor is threatening to do the same with the employee kitchen and said that she'd prefer if we figured it out ourselves before she has to step in. I point-blank but politely told her that I have no intention of participating in a cleaning rotation for the kitchen, as I only use it to heat up coffee a couple times a week and am not the cause of the messes she is referring to. She explained that she has no way to pinpoint who specifically is responsible for the issues, so she has to be fair and ask everyone to pitch in equally, to which I replied that I will not be cleaning up after other grown adults. If that means I don't get to use the kitchen, so be it. Supervisor is annoyed and said she'd have to think over what I said but she wishes I'd just do it to keep the peace. I told her, respectfully, that's not my job and what's to prevent people from just leaving their mess because it's technically not their cleaning day? 

I might be the a-hole because I may be making a big deal out of something that's just not worth it, and I don't want to refuse to do my part. I just don't think this is my part.

1izrplx,AITA for refusing to buy my girlfriend another pair of designer shows when she barely wears the first pair?,"In 2023, my girlfriend and I went to Hawaii. At some point, we ended up in a Christian Louboutin store, and I caved—I bought her a beautiful, expensive pair of red-bottomed heels. Not the most extravagant, but still a luxury splurge.

She wore them exactly twice—once prancing around our hotel room and once at the office, where they scuffed a little. I was informed that scuffing is part of the charm (which, okay, sure). But since then? They’ve been living a comfortable, untouched life in her closet.

I’m not mad, but I do poke fun at her about it from time to time for basically keeping them hidden.

Fast forward to two weeks ago, and we’re back in Hawaii. Naturally, we visit the Louboutin store again, and now they have “everlasting” red bottoms which basically resist scuffs.

My girlfriend wants another pair. The salesman enthusiastically backs her up but I say that I'd be willing to get her another pair when she actually wear the first ones.

Now, we're not fighting, but she shares the story with all her friends. She’s been telling me I don’t get it, that luxury fashion is an investment. She insists that one pair isn’t enough because she needs a pair that won’t get scuffed so easily. I told her that sounds like she’s asking me to buy display shoes. Now she’s been giving me side-eye ever since and I'm wondering if AITA for not understanding the big picture with shoes.

So, AITA for holding my ground and not buying a second pair when the first ones are still in mint condition?

1j0isvh,AITA for asking a guest to not crochet at my bachelorette party?,"I'm (28F) getting married this year (yay!) and went on my bachelorette party trip last weekend. The trip was to a cabin-type setting where we all stayed in the same house. I have three bridesmaids, but also invited some friends to come along.

Part of the group is my brother's girlfriend (36F, brother is 38M) of five months who isn't in the wedding party. She wasn't initially invited because I don't know her well and they live in another state, but my brother asked me to invite her as a favor to him. He said that she's never been invited to a bachelorette and likely never would be (I have no idea why, this is just what he told me), and hoped she could have this experience.

Since people would be paying their own way and the group wasn't large, I figured why not. She seemed nice enough.

The problem is that during the weekend, she would insist on crocheting all the time, even during our events and games. When I asked her to participate with us, she said that she took time off for the trip, and wanted to make the most of her ""vacation"" by catching up on her crochet projects. And that playing games and hanging out with my friends wasn't ""fun"" and she didn't want to ""waste"" her days off (all her words, not mine).

To be clear, I don't care that she wants to crochet in general. Most of our activities ended after dinner anyways and we'd just hang out in the living room. I just asked her to saving the crocheting for at night after the activities.

My issue is that she was taking her crocheting with us to places like wine tasting, brunch, a museum tour, etc. It was super disrespectful in my eyes because she'd insist on coming yet wouldn't participate in the activity. Honestly, I was bothered that she was crocheting when we were playing bridal games, but at least that was in our living room!

The trips over now, but apparently she was super peeved that I asked to limit her crocheting time, and my brother's been pestering me to apologize to her for ruining her trip. I personally don't feel like I should, because she shouldn't have come to a bachelorette party if she didn't want to do bachelorette-y things!

But I also love brother very much and I don't want this to come between us. I'm starting to doubt myself because his girlfriend sounds really annoyed with me. Please help!

Edit: I wanted to add some details in case it helps, because I think some people think I'm being a bridezilla: 

1. She was crocheting a throw blanket about the width of my entire arm span. That's what she was carrying with her to dinner, museums, wineries, etc. It wasn't some small thing the size of my palm. She also had the materials for the blanket with her: about five balls of yarn? I'm not sure what you'd call it, but each ball was about the size of a cantaloupe. 

2. We gave her the option to stay home. I told her I wouldn't be offended if this trip wasn't her style and she wanted to spend it crocheting. But she insisted on coming out with us to every single event. 

3. Even though my brother asked me to bring her, she admitted to me that she wanted to come and that she had asked my brother to ask me. 

4. She's doesn't have social anxiety. She just thought our activities were boring and a waste of her time. I mentioned this in another comment, but I overheard her calling my party a ""basic bitch bachelorette"", but I didn't want to confront her because I *didn't* want to cause drama. 

5. My biggest issue isn't that she wasn't giving me attention. Please! I'm a grown adult and already thankful for the friends giving me love and joy during the weekend. I just thought it was super rude to crochet such a big project during group activities. She literally brought her blanket to a museum and crocheted *during* a private tour!",Plane-Presence9361,7341,0.9700000286102296,694,1740778021,2025-02-28 15:27:01,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1j0isvh/aita_for_asking_a_guest_to_not_crochet_at_my/,2,2025
1j0lkc4,AITA for refusing to go to my sisters wedding after finding out only our side of the family were having to pay to attend?,"Obligatory ""this is a throwaway account"" clarification - I'm very active in a D&D sub that I don't particularly want it to tied to this situation. 

So my younger sister (Katie 28F) and her partner (Chris 29M) are getting married in April in Dubai. She has always wanted an extravagant wedding and is going all out on this - so the wedding is happening over 4 days. Theres 70 guests but they they want us (me, my husband, and parents) to stay in the same hotel with them along with her bridesmaids (which I am MOH) and groomsmen - the hotel is pretty lux so with flights is costing us just over £2900 each. 

Chris’ family are also staying in the hotel which includes his parents, two brothers, and his nephew. 

They are well off - I don’t know exactly how much they earn combined but I know Katie is on 88k and she is the lower earner. But about 6 months ago Chris and Katie came to us and asked to borrow 17k more. They stressed it would be a loan paid over time and said the venue had increased the price, Dubai law was different blah blah blah - they paid this money or they lost the lot - we believe them and I offered to loan 7k and my parents the other 10k.

So long story short - I have since found out through someone else that the 17k wasn’t for the venue - it was for Chris’ family to fly over there. They saw how much it was going to be, didn’t want to pay and refused to go. I asked Katie and she confirmed so my first question was if they were paying for his parents why not pay for ours? (I would never expect them to pay for me - even if we couldn’t afford it, I’d have wished them well and stayed at home). And her answer was “because they can afford it”. She got very defensive and said this was the fairest way she could think of doing it, it’s hard enough planning a wedding etc - but when I asked, if you genuinely thought this was the fairest way to do it, why did you lie about what the 17k was for and say it was a venue issue? She couldn’t answer. 

My parents are aware and are very disappointed they lied - but have said they’re still attending - but I have backed out. To me it feels like my parents are being taken advantage - and if they couldn’t afford to pay for both our and Chris’ parents and his brothers and nephew then they shouldn’t have just paid for the 4 parents or no one at all. And they especially shouldn’t have lied about it. 

Katie and Chris keep calling and asking me to attend, saying I’m making them feel bad and ruining their day. But the whole thing just feels… icky to me. 

I’m genuinely and open book so be brutal - am I being an AH here? Should I just suck it up and go? 

Edit*** - Crumbs that's a lot of comments haha - thanks so much everyone. Just wanted to answer a couple of questions/comments that have come up a lot. 

1) the repayment - my husbands brother is a solicitor and he kindly drew up a contract and repayment plan for both myself and my parents so the money will be paid off within 12 months of the wedding. If they don't stick to this I have access to a free solicitor haha. I hope it wouldn't come to that - but that's why I have the papers for worst case scenario. 

2) asking for the 7K back - Imight be a soft touch, but asking for this back feels like a step too far. Like I'm mad as hell but not enough to actively try ruin their wedding a few weeks before which it feels like (right now at least) is what that would be doing. But hey - give me a few more days to stew. 

Edit 2*** 

Thanks again for all the feedback everyone. Just another quick FYI - a few people have asked about Chris' family or seem to have the impression they're well off. 

I'm obviously not privy to their financial situation, but what the limited amount I do know from what Katie has said Chris and his family gree up very poor. Before all this I'd always though Chris was a lovely guy but I had caught him in the odd but harmless white lie (things like where he went to school, the type
Of house he grew up in, etc). I get the impression he is embarrassed or resentful of his upbringing giving their lack of money and this is how he now values his own self worth - by his much money he has. 

My guess is when his family said they couldn't go he panicked and worried people who ask why they weren't there and he would either have to say they couldn't afford it or he couldn't afford to pay for them. And look his past trauma/experience is not for me to judge - but if that were the case it just makes me more mad that they both didn't plan ahead and talk to friends/family about what they could afford BEFORE booking Dubai. If it was such a dealbreaker for his family to be there they should have factored in the cost of paying for all parents to attend instead of thrusting a 3k per person bill at them and expecting them to rock up.

I laughed and said no it just looked cool. She responded with accusing me of catfishing girls.
Tbf I have noticed some unusual positive attention lately from women but attributed it to me losing weight.

Now she is mad and calling me a fuck boy, but I can't really see what I did wrong. AITA?",lookoka,2621,0.949999988079071,403,1740866843,2025-03-01 16:07:23,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1j1b4od/aita_for_wearing_an_engagement_looking_ring/,3,2025
1j1cv51,AITA for telling a family member off for purposely triggering my OCD?,"

Hello I am 23F and I had a disagreement with a family member 60M over an incident. I am living with them and overall we have a very good and supportive relationship, but something that happened today really upset me. I was diagnosed with OCD as a child and have been in therapy/on medication for it since. It’s something I’ve spent a lot of time working on and I’m very proud of the progress I have made. 



My OCD is about contamination/germs. My FM has known about my diagnosis since I got it and I have spent a lot of time talking to him about it. I even bought a book about living with someone with OCD as I know it can be difficult. He has been a huge supporter of my recovery even though he doesn’t fully understand it. 



However, today as I was making coffee I saw that he came out of the bathroom without washing his hands. I playfully gave him a hard time and encouraged him to wash his hands. He did and we both joked about it and it felt like it ended fine. 



Later, when I was making lunch he came out of the bathroom again without washing his hands. I could hear him approaching me and I asked if he washed his hands. He laughed and said no before wiping his hands on the sides of my sweatshirt and pants. I was so shocked I ran out of the room to go change. 



After, I came back down and said that I thought it was a mean thing to do and that it was very upsetting and that not washing your hands after using the restroom is inconsiderate as well as an immature habit to have at his age. He begrudgingly apologized, but acted like I was lecturing him for no reason. To be clear, I never raised my voice- I was definitely a bit stern but I felt it was necessary. 



While I don’t expect him to keep track of all my triggers I feel like that is something that would upset anyone- OCD or no OCD. Especially within hours of our first conversation about the importance of washing hands after using the restroom. 



AITA for lecturing him about doing something he knew would be upsetting?

1j22f6e,AITA For telling a friend isn’t not her business how me and MY husband parent?,"My husband has a friend Erica. I don’t like her. She always seems weirdly judgmental of the way we do things. Most of that judgement being on me.

Anyways the last time she was over, my husband and her were talking about kids (Erica and her so have kids, as do we) and mornings got brought up. 

For some information, I don’t do mornings, my husband does. He works 9-6 and I start at the same time as him but end earlier. He does mornings because he doesn’t mind waking up earlier, and I get more sleep and less on my mind in the morning. It’s an arrangement that works for us and I always do mornings if he’s sick or physically can’t.

When Erica found that out, she started with judgement. I was in the same room as them but just wasn’t adding to the conversation. Stuff like “Oh both my husband and I do mornings” and “Kind of sucks you’re on your own 100% of the time.”  I didn’t like that and let her know that my husband and I’s decisions aren’t any of her business. The topic switched over to something else and she didn’t say anything related to me after.

1j2uu65,AITA for removing my brother's GF from our Life 360?,"I (24F) have a younger brother Matt (21M) who has a GF (21F) named Selena. They got together back in 2021 and have had 2 babies during their relationship who I love dearly. Throughout their relationship, I have tried to be cordial and friendly towards Selena, I have heard many times of how people don't get along with their sibling's partner and I didn't want to be one of those people. Throughout the years though, I have heard countless gossip from Selena about what she thinks about people in my family, including my mother. At the time, I would argue with my mother and sister (25F) in her defense, which now looking back I regret deeply. 

My younger brother currently works a food truck that my parents have loaned him to make a living for his family while Selena stays home with the kids. During this time, my mom (52 F) and I have been working with him, sometimes without pay since some weeks it is too slow. While working with my brother is fine, I have felt that Selena sees herself as a boss and sees my mother and I as only employees. There are times when my mom asks my brother if she can spend time with her grandkids, but he says no because they are with her family. We set up a life 360 a few years ago when they only had one kid and I would babysit, so it was Matt, me my mom and my sister. 

  
Recently, I noticed she paused her location sharing (since jan 28). I didn't think anything of it but she would still monitor everyone's locations, since when my brother and I are working the weekends he lets me know when my mom is near as soon as he gets off the phone with her. I didn't think this was fair since she is still able to view our locations. This morning I was talking to my mom and she was sharing how she wants to see her grandkids and how she invited Selena to an outing on Saturday Morning(she she ghosted my mom on). That was my final straw and I removed her from the account.

1j3lg3q,AITA for crashing out cause I’m not invited on the family holiday,"Hi guys (23F). My family recently booked a holiday and asked if I wanted to come I said I couldn’t afford it and that was that. Recently was talking to my mum and she said that both of my younger siblings are bringing a friend that she is fully paying for. My brother is 20 like he lives at home and she is paying for him and a friend. And my sister (15) and her friend to go on an all inclusive holiday to Spain. 

It was the same last year they all went on holiday without me but last year they didn’t bring anyone else. I was fine with it until I heard my mums paying for other kids to do but wouldn’t bring me so I’m annoyed with her. I do so much for her as well like way more than my other siblings. I live 10 mins down the road so always picking up/ dropping to school or doing things around the house for her but I’m butt hurt that she clearly had this extra money to spend to bring other peoples kids on holiday but not me. 

Am I the asshole? 

EDIT: I initially asked a few weeks ago for her to tell me how much it would be if I booked on cause I would have went if it was affordable. She got back to me saying it’s 900 and I just said I couldn’t afford that anyways and that was it. Until I found out she’s paying for 2 of my siblings friends. She said in convo who was going and I just said “what you could have paid for me to go but instead ur paying for 2 other children “ and she ignored that comment.

1j3n68v,UPDATE AITA for reporting my coworker for cheating in the company walking competition?,"So the feedback on my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ipgc44/aita_for_reporting_my_coworker_for_cheating_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) made me feel like less of an asshole for sure but what happened next definitely got rid of any remaining guilt I may have had.

Tiffany won the steps competition.

After I spoke with Matt he tried to clear things up with Tiffany but in his words she was “combative and rude” so he ended up looping in our HR rep, Jill. Jill decided that Tiffany could keep her 65,000 steps and the rules would just be clarified for everyone going forward.

Well going forward Tiffany continued to post 35,000-40,000 steps every single day. Less ridiculous then 65,000 but still ridiculous considering we all sit at desks 8 hours day. It was still a tight race between the 4 of us, because we (Dave Jenna and I) had been posting higher then Tiffany prior to the 65,000 step day. Then Dave got sick. He only posted 4,000 one day and that was enough for him to fall too far behind. Then I had something urgent and time consuming come up at work and only got 10,000 steps that day. That was enough for me to fall too far behind too. So it was basically up to Jenna at that point and she was really working for it. Even got up at 4am the last couple days of the competition to try and max out steps. The highest she ever got to was about 41,000 and in the end Tiffany beat her by about 250 steps overall.

Tiffany had zero issue happily accepting her award at the next company wide meeting and gave this super annoying speech about how “everyone did so great” and how in the end she’s “just glad we all became more active and healthy.”

I never responded to the message she sent me about being depressed about her dog or whatever.

1j4gw7k,AITA: opened a jar of sauce to use some and put the rest in the fridge,"So to preface this: my (18m) mom (47 F) usually has no issue with opening jars of red sauce, using a little, then putting them in the fridge and using them for a meal later on. My dad does it, I do it, she does it, my grandma does it. She has never expressed a problem with it before. This is important. It is also important to note I am autistic. 

So tonight, I opened a jar of Alfredo sauce. I asked my brother (12 M) for help with opening the jar, and mom starts freaking out and saying not to open it- but by the time she said anything, it was already open. So I used the sauce in my pasta and she starts complaining that it can’t be used for a meal now. 

Thankfully I had the self control not to say my immediate response out loud, and instead said “Yes it can?? It’s not like I stuck my fingers in the jar.” 

And now she’s moping on her phone and acting like I’ve committed a federal offense. 

Did I do something wrong?? Am I the asshole or is this stupid…
ETA: I closed the jar and put it back when I was done with it. Because it’s Alfredo, once it’s open you’re supposed to fridge. She’s never had a problem with this before, even with other cream based sauces. She never said I couldn’t open the Alfredo UNTIL it was already open.

1j4hpft,AITA for not telling husband he could get a form notarized instead of going with me in person to get our baby’s passport,"Yesterday we were in line at the post office for our baby's passport application appointment. We had a 12:30 noon appt but there were still 3 applicants ahead of us since they were backed up (meaning at least 30-40 min wait on top of the 20+ we'd already waited). The lady in back of us asked if she needed both parents for her baby's renewal; I said 'I think yes both parents need to be present or you can submit a notarized form on behalf of the dad.' My husband heard and started to get really angry that I hadn't told him. Then he said 'let's go home' and we proceeded to have a huge argument where he yelled at me and said I ""hid"" the fact from him and wasted his time. I explained that it didn't even cross my mind as we are together and both local. He said I should have at least mentioned the notary option to give him a chance to decide. I didn't know that the wait would be so long since we had an appointment. He called me ""negligent"" for not knowing that these things take a long time. I told him the passport process is his responsibility too, but he thinks that since I'll be waiting in line anyway, I should have respected his time and made it as quick as possible for him by giving him the notary option so he doesn't have to go and interrupt his day to come in person. So now he said he'll do the notarized form on HIS TIMING ""I'll do it when I do it and I don't want you asking me about it"" and then I have to go back a third time AGAIN on my own to apply for the passport. 

For context this was our second time at the post office because the first time we didn't have an appt and the line was so long we left and made an appt to come back. I honestly did not know the lines would be so long and backed up; who knew so many people would be applying for a passport at any given time? Husband thinks I should apologize for not telling him about the notary option and “not respecting his time”. Looking back, that would have been the way to go given that its been so difficult coordinating times with him to go (he's been dragging his feet on this because he doesn't care to go on any international trips anytime soon and I do, which is another issue). He's very protective about his time, especially on weekdays and mid-day events as it ""interrupts his flow."" Meanwhile I think it's crazy that he feels so entitled to me mentioning the notary option. I'm annoyed at him for being such a maniac about this. I think we should have just waited and finished the task; the argument + getting the notarized form + going back is going to take way more time than if we had just waited. AITA?

1j59byb,AITA for feeding my family a fish dinner while I eat steak and potatoes,"So apparently we don’t get many characters so I’ll try my best to make this short and simple and straight to the point. 

I am three months pregnant and almost everyday I’ve been craving steak and sour cream baked potatoes. I never really cared for steak I’m more of a chicken fingers and fries girlie but I’m guessing the baby must’ve loved steak in its past life because that literally all I crave when I don’t even care for it. 
Today I made my family baked pizza spaghetti with fried catfish a lunch eat salad (salad with chopped deli meat) and dinner rolls. I of course am making the same dish I’ve been eating for almost everyday these last few months. I pretty much make 2 separate meals each night for my cravings. 

Last night after I served the kids and was getting ready to make my finances plate he expressed he wanted steak and potatoes like me. Mind you he was aware of the menu because I have my meals planned night before . I told him I only had that one steak for me. He said “ well we can share” I politely told him that I will need to eat all of my food since I am feeding for two and this is all I have for the night knowing I’ll most likely still be hungry whilst you guys have a meal you can come back for seconds. I am now, in his words a “selfish woman using pregnancy as an excuse to be selfish”. I asked what’s different about today than all the other days when I’ve been literally eating the same shit almost everyday with no complaints?

I'm (15M)  black and I live in a predominantly white area and go to a mostly white school and I'm pretty introverted. I have a fro and the amount of people who will just up and try/ start touching my hair is wild. It's gotten to the point where it pisses me off.   I met my bf Colt (15M) at a wrestling meet a few months ago and I let him play in my hair and I play in his curly jewfro.  It's just kind of an intimate soothing thing between us.

We go to different schools so we don't hang around each others friends a whole lot. Saturday he was having like a movie marathon with some of his friends and he wanted me to come. While there one of his friends some white girl named Madison starts just playing in my hair saying it's softer than she thought. I immediately jerked back and asked her WTF are you doin? She tells me she just wanted to see what it was like. I snapped at her that I wasn't a damn dog and she gets all defensive saying she saw Colt doing it and thought it was ok. I yelled at her that I'm not dating her and went home.

Colt came over later and apologized for her ,but he says I didn't have to get so upset and go off on her like that. He says people come up to him trying to touch his jewfro to see what Jewish hair feels like all the time and he never took it that seriously..

1j606lg,AITA for leaning on a nearby wall after being denied use of gym equipment by a woman doing supersets?,"So my apartment building has a small exercise area including a cable crossover machine, an adjustable bench, dumbbells, some treadmills, and a small side room for yoga or other bodyweight/kettlebell exercises.


The gym was empty this morning except for one woman doing row exercises on the cable crossover machine. I noticed that she had placed her phone next to the bench with a couple of dumbbells. For context, I’m a tall-ish guy and she’s shortish and appears nonbinary (which is fine by me, I’ll refer to her as “she” here because I don’t know her pronouns or how she personally identifies). I specify this because it seems like that plays into the dynamic from her perspective.


“Can I use this bench?” I ask.


“No,” she replies. “I’m doing supersets.”


I was a bit taken aback. There is room for two, maybe three people in the resistance/weight training area, and she was using every piece of equipment.


Not sure what to do, I lean on a nearby wall and start looking at my phone. I’m a bit miffed and I look up every so often to see when she’ll be done. She takes her earphone out and says something to the effect of, “Are you just going to stand there?” and we get in a big argument.


I say something to the effect of “What else am I supposed to do? You won’t let me work in.”


“I don’t want you up in my space. Go do something else,” she says.


“So I can’t do pullups on the cable crossover while you’re using the bench?” I reply.


“No. I don’t want you up in my space,” she says.


“That’s just bad etiquette,” I reply.


It then continues like this for a bit. I accuse her of being rude, she accuses me (verbatim) of using my “male privilege.” Eventually she finishes her sets and leaves.

In every gym I’ve worked out at it would be considered rude to bogart multiple pieces of equipment while others have to wait. I lived abroad for years before this - is this still the case in US gym culture? AITA for leaning on a nearby wall and waiting, rather than going and stretching or running on the treadmill?

1j60urv,AITA for changing my legal name ?,"Hi! I was born after my mom had a stillborn baby. She was supposed to be named Angélique (a French name because my mom’s French). My stillborn sister was born and died on December 6th, 2004. Then my mom had me on May 6th, 2006, and named me Coline (another French name, like Colleen).

Listen, so the problem is—when I was told this story, I was about 14. I had never known before, but I had always hated my name due to bullying and really dumb jokes about it. But then it started getting weird for me because, in France, you have a name day, which is basically a celebration of your name for a day (because of Christianity or something—I don’t really know, I’m not very Christian. I don’t know if other countries do this).

I discovered that my mother gave me the name Coline on purpose because it was celebrated on my stillborn sister’s birthday. That made me feel like I was just a replacement for her since Angélique was supposed to be my mom’s last kid (she said that to my face, yeah).

What made it even worse to wear my name was my father. I won’t go into details, but he’s an asshole. He straight-up said they were supposed to have an angel—referring to my sister—but had the devil instead (me, lol). He also said he would have preferred if I had died instead of my sister.

Around that time, I started talking to my friends about it and asked them to call me by a new name I picked, which had nothing to do with my sister—Lyx. They all agreed and have never stopped calling me Lyx since I was 14. I’m now almost 19. They even call me Lyx when talking to my mom, but she got mad at me and said she would disown me if I dared change my name to Lyx.

So, AITA for wanting to change my name?

1j6u713,AITA for telling my client my birthday and she shamed my coworkers for forgetting my birthday?,"I was hired last May into a company that is all about celebrating everyone. I was asked and paid into collections for my bosses birthday, 3 coworkers birthdays were everyone got flowers and cake and cards and balloons and free lunch. I sung happy birthday and participated in pictures, etc. I also participated in collections for coworkers when family died and my boss for the Christmas party. My birthday was last week. I had mentioned I was excited for my birthday the week before. Nothing. No one said a thing. Noone wished me happy birthday, or a card or anything. It hurt, but I ignored it. So, my client knew there was someone on the staff with a birthday near hers and she was trying to figure out who the Pisces on staff was. Every day for 2 weeks. The day after my birthday I told her. She had lots to say to the staff about not celebrating my birthday in our usual fashion. It hurts I was forgotten, but I don't think I did anything wrong.

1j7hy7m,AITA for telling my husband his mom can't live with us for months-long stretches,"My husband and I have been married for almost 2 years and our son is 10 months old. My parents live nearby which has been invaluable during my pregnancy and since. My mom comes over regularly to help us out, my husband and her are on good terms too so it's been going well. His parents live in another country. We have visited them once since we got married, that was 7 months ago. The time prior to that was our wedding itself which took place there.

My husband had been talking about my MIL visiting soon for a long visit which I was happy with. We recently moved into our new house, I've done a good job decorating it, we have a large guest room, and I was looking forward to hosting her especially since it would make my husband happy. A couple of days ago he was complaining about how detailed her visa application was. I told him I was surprised it was so thorough. He told me that it's because while regular visa forms allow a stay of 6 months max, this one allows 2 years. I asked why would she need a stay of more than 6 months. He said that she had been thinking of winding up her medical practice and basically retiring, and this would then allow her to stay for a longer visit if we all decide that it works.

I was stunned. I told him he should just do the regular app because his mom won't be staying for anywhere close to 6 months. I had it in my mind that she'd be staying for like a month. That's how long we stayed for when we went there. He said that's his mom, she tells him how alone she feels, she can't go to my BIL's because he lives with roommates, and we can't just put a timer on her visit here. He said she's been looking forward to helping us out with our son. I told him we don't need help we manage fine on our own and with my mom's help. I wanted to host his mom as a guest not as a part of our household. He complained that how was it fair that my parents could visit whenever they wanted while his can't. I was hurt by that because my parents have helped us out a lot and I asked him if he wants us to limit how often my mom comes to visit. He said no, that's not what he meant, that he likes her but it wasn't fair to his parents. My reply was that when my mom comes, she goes at the end of the day. That wouldn't be the case with his. I ended it by saying he should look into the easier regular form because she can't be thinking of staying for that long. He chose to sleep on the couch that night and has been cold with me since. I hate that. We've never been cold to each other like this. 

I talked to my mom too. She said that having his mom live with us for long stretches would definitely affect me. That this is worth fighting for.

I haven't seen him working on the application since. Last night he went out when his mom called. When he came back I asked him how she took it. He told me he had told her he's looking into what application best suits her. He asked me if I'd changed my mind. I said no. He just shook his head and started watching TV.

1j7itfg,AITA for refusing to change my bachelorette trip date and shutting down a friend’s attempts to reschedule?,"I’m getting married this year, and my friends (a group of 16) and I have been planning my bachelorette trip. To make scheduling fair, I asked everyone to send me the dates they were not available so I could pick a date that worked for the most people—especially since some friends are traveling from other countries.

After going through everyone’s responses, there was only one date that worked for everyone. So, I announced it.

That same day, one of my closest friends suddenly said she had been planning a trip around that time. However, she had never mentioned it before, hadn’t booked flights, and was only reconsidering her dates because someone told her her destination might be crowded.

Since the condition for choosing my trip date was to prioritize the availability of the most people, I explained to her three separate times why that date was final. Despite that, she kept trying to change it. She even created another poll in our group chat to see if others could move their own important plans to accommodate her.

She also started privately messaging people, trying to convince them to say they could be flexible. At first, I didn’t directly call her out in the chat, but after she made a second poll, I sent a general message stating that the date was already chosen and wasn’t changing. Now, she’s upset and claims I embarrassed her by “calling her out” instead of speaking to her privately—even though I had already tried three times.

I feel like she put me in a tough position, making me choose whose availability mattered more. I understand she really wants to be there, but I also think it was unfair for her to disregard everyone else’s plans.

I have no intention of changing the date, and honestly, I’m not planning to apologize because I don’t think I did anything wrong.

1jamw4y,WIBTA for not going to my sister’s wedding because her venue is not wheelchair accessible?,"My (24F) sister (30F) is getting married soon. I’m very happy for her and there are no issues between the two of us.

She really wanted to get married in a specific location and she got it, which is great, but that location is pretty much not accessible to wheelchairs. I have a significant disability (paraplegia) and cannot move at all without a wheelchair, so going there would be tough.

She told me that I could be carried up any stairs and then stay at the tables, but that’s not something I’m comfortable with. Getting carried is very uncomfortable and dangerous, especially when done repeatedly by someone that isn’t used to it, and I really don’t want to have to be carried to the toilets at a wedding full of strangers… or even worse, have an accident.

Then I also wouldn’t expect people to just sit with me while the celebrations are going on, but the idea of sitting there and watch for hours feels wrong, especially that after a few hours sitting hurts a lot and skin becomes a concern, but I wouldn’t ask someone to leave the wedding just for me.

I’m not upset about the fact that they picked that venue, it’s their day and I don’t expect them to plan it based on my needs, but I also don’t think she understands that it’s not as easy as she thinks. There are so many things that could go very wrong.

I intend to get them a nice gift and propose to maybe spend quality time together afterwards/before. One of my cousins told me that it’s just one day and that it’s very important for my sister, so I should make an effort and “get out of my comfort zone”, but I feel like endangering my health isn’t as simple as getting out of my comfort zone…

1jbew6q,AITA for “sneaking” vegetarian food into my FIL’s meal?,"Not a throwaway but a private because my fiancé knows my main. 

My fiancé (23M) and I (23F) plan to get married in October of this year. I'd like to start off by saying i'm not looking to end my relationship with my fiancé. 

I'm a vegetarian, my fiancé is not, nor are his parents. This has never been a problem for me, my him, or his mother. But my father in law has always been weird about it.

For example, whenever we all go out to eat and I order something vegetarian, he always gives me weird looks. He also always tries to convince me to eat meat, saying things like ""You're really missing out."", ""You know you want some of this."", ""That fake meat will never be better than the real thing."", Etc.
 
Yesterday, my fiancé and I invited his parents over to our house for dinner. I made spaghetti & meatballs for my fiancé and his parents, spaghetti & vegetarian meatballs for me, I put them in two different pots and put them both on the table.

When his parents were grabbing their food, his father happens to grab the spaghetti and meatless meatballs instead of the real ones.

Now here's where I might be the A-hole, after I see him put the meatless meatballs on his plate instead, I decide not to tell him. He sits down, finishes the whole plate, and even gets a second helping.

Once his parents left and me and my fiancé were cleaning up, I tell him about the whole fake meat thing. My fiancé gets really mad at me and immediately calls his dad.

His dad then calls me and starts berating me on the phone, saying i'm a psycho and my fiancé should leave me for trying to ""poison him""???

I try to defend myself by saying I wasn't the one that gave him the fake meat, and he grabbed himself (which is 100% true) 

My fiancé says I should of told him which was which, but I genuinely don't see the problem. I know he isn't allergic to soy beans or anything, so I don't see the harm in trying vegetarian food once.

I think I might be the A-hole because usually my fiancé always defends me when his father and I get into arguments like this, but the fact that he isn't worries me. So reddit, AITA?

Update: A bit of a quick update, but after reading your comments i've decided i'm going to apologize to my FIL, whether I was in the wrong or not it wasn't right to not tell him what he was eating.

Also, I've seen a lot of comments saying if it was the other way around i'd be screaming at him or something. Just wanna say no I wouldn't, sure i'd be a little sad but i've accidentally eaten meat a few times (been vegetarian since I was 16) and I don't really care.

1jbglie,AITA for refusing to be the main caretaker for my elderly parents?,"My parents are both in their 80s and live about two hours from me. For reference, I have a sibling that lives right down the road from them. Neither of them have aged well- they always refused to be active and have lived very sedentary lives in their retirement so aging has been hard on them. My father especially has struggled with type 2 diabetes and dementia/alzheimers. He is very combative and mean about everything, which is how he has always been, but dementia and old age has made it worse. He directs a lot of his anger towards me and is especially mad that I am trying to get them to move into assisted living because they fall constantly and need so much help. Anytime he disagrees with me about anything he starts screaming and calling me names including “ fat-a** and “the thing.” “The thing” hurts especially hard because I am his daughter and he is reducing me to something that is hardly human. He will say “ don’t look at the thing over there, she’s so ugly she might break your face” or just ridiculous stuff. He does this when he is completely lucid and remembering everything/everyone. Or he will say “ don’t feed the thing,” when my mom tries to offer me food. I tried so hard to ignore this treatment, but once he did it in front of my kids I put my foot down and stopped visiting. My mother now wants me to come to her 3+ times a week to help with cooking,cleaning, helping dress my father, etc. i have said no because the way he treats me is terrible and I have to look out for my own well being.

1jc65zv,AITA for taking away my keys from my grandma?,"Bare with me because this is a long one.

My grandma came ""to visit"" today while I was at work and just wrote to me to say that she was horrified at how much rubbish was flying around my house. I was very surprised by the message and wrote to her telling her not to break into my flat when I'm not there and certainly not to criticise my non-existent mess. I just have a lot of stuff, but everything has its rightful place, the floor is clear and there's only what's supposed to be on the table.

Three hours later, I came home and realised that both my desk and the dining table were completely empty.


For context: I paint a lot of miniatures in my free time and have a whole desk full of paints and equipment for doing so. 

I found the paints, brushes and tools for my miniatures in a drawer under my bed, neatly lined up. The new Emperor's Children codex was on my bed. What was missing, however, were the plastic frames and bits from various Warhammer figures. On the dining table were all my new Emperor's Children figures, which I had received the day before yesterday and had just put on the table and admired with great anticipation. On my desk were three squads of Terminators, 700 points of Stormcasts and two Phoenix Lords. A total value of around €500! I searched through all the drawers and by now I was really panicking. After a very long search, I called my grandma and asked her what had happened to the grey plastic that was lying around. Her answer was:
""I threw the rubbish away. What was that anyway? Packaging material?""

I repeat again: she threw away stuff of mine that she didn't even know what it was! 
I asked her again whether she was really serious and whether she had any idea what ""this rubbish"" was for, to which she simply said that I should be grateful that she had finally tidied up the place and couldn't understand why I was calling about something like that.

... I then just said that I'd come round tomorrow and pick up my front door key and hung up.

I didn't raise my voice once during the whole conversation once and was simply in shock listening to whatever this was and then lay down on my bed, exhausted, and thought about what my next steps might be. After about 20 minutes, I put my shoes on, threw on a jacket and set off to go through the rubbish in the apartment complex.
It took a really long time, but I found the bag again, in the residual rubbish, on top of the remains of eggshells, a banana and a piece of gamy cucumber. After cleaning all the plastic frames and looking at the clock, I realised that this process alone had taken me two hours.

1jc77j4,AITA for calling out my husband's friend after he made inappropriate comments about my son's paternity?,"I (23 F) have been married to my husband, Alex (27 M), for 2 years, and we have a 10 month old son, Dylan.

Alex has a friend named Mike (27 M). They’ve been best friends since high school. From my first encounter, I did not like Mike. He is really childish, likes to be the center of attention, and has a crude sense of humor. It’s like he never got out of his frat boy phase. All of my husband’s friends are married or in long-term relationships, whereas Mike has never been in a long-term relationship or has brought any woman around. He has also made some weird comments toward me that made me uncomfortable. My husband has a deep bond with Mike, and they often go on hunting trips or have boys' nights. I’ve never tried to keep my husband from hanging out with his friend, but I have limited my contact with Mike as much as possible since we’ve been together.

Mike came over to pick up my husband to go golfing. I was holding our baby when I answered the door. Mike greeted us at the door, asked to hold my baby, and was cooing at him. Then he said, “Hey there, man…come to poppa,” and my husband and Mike started laughing. A bit of background: I have brown hair and blue eyes, and my husband has black hair and brown eyes. Our son’s hair is coming in blonde, and he has blue eyes. Mike has blondish hair and blue eyes. I was a bit caught off guard by it but ignored his comment. Mike then said, “He looks like me. Maybe he's mine,” and my husband and Mike continued to laugh. I was obviously not amused. I told Mike to hand me my son and then told him, “Not in a million years, and no woman with sense would want you.” Neither my husband nor Mike laughed at my comment, and Mike just made a face before he and my husband left.

Later, my husband told me I “took it too far” with Mike, that Mike was just joking, but I made it personal. I told him those comments were disrespectful to me as his wife and the mother of this child. He then said it’s obviously not true, so why am I so upset when I know how Mike is.

1jcwo15,AITA for not doing an art commission I was not told about?,"Title sounds a little confusing, wasn't sure how to best word it. Hopefully this all makes sense! 

I (F33) do a lot of art in the needlework medium. Embroidery, cross-stitch, weaving etc. I'm going to toot my own horn here, I'm very good at it. I've won first prize at a couple of our state fair competitions, and the one tapestry piece I had in a gallery sold for a good bit of money.  

A few years ago I made a choice I would no longer take commissions. The deadlines, back and forth between clients and all that jazz made me hate what was once a hobby I could do for hours shutting my brain off. I'll still make presents on occasion (my wife's bff just had a baby, and I made a cross-stitch birth announcement for the nursery, for example) but anything outside of that is not happening.  

This past week I got a message on my Instagram from my friend ""Mike's"" friend ""Abigail."" Abigail said Mike recommended me for an embroidery she wanted done, and how soon could I get to the process. I told Abigail I was sorry, but I no longer take commissions and Mike knew that already. Abigail was a little pissy, but Mike- omg. He texted me in a fury saying he really buttered up my work to Abigail and he was trying to date her and I've fucked things up for him.

I'm sad that Mike is acting this way, but I also wonder that since Abigail was ""misled"" about me not doing commissions- should I just do it? My wife says absolutely not and I 85% think she's right, but I just wanted the perspective of people who aren't married to me, lol.

The only issue is he has to leave pretty early because the trains get wonky at night and Ubers are expensive. I've offered to let him crash, but he says he didn't want to be a burden. 

Anyway last Saturday Josh wanted to stay out and asked if he could crash. I told him of course. We went back to my studio (he knew it was a studio) and he asked if I had any pajamas he could borrow. I told him no because 1. I genuinely own no pajamas and 2. I have some sweatpants but I'm weird about people wearing my clothes. Can't explain why just am. A germ thing. 

Anyway I suggest to Josh he just sleep in his boxers and he got annoyed. He said he wouldn't have stayed if he had known I'd be so accommodating and I said all I offered him was a couch to crash on. He ubered home and it was about 100 dollars.

1jfz99i,AITA for telling my coworker to “freshen up” for an important event?,"Throwaway account since the people involved use Reddit. 
I (32M) work at a company with the occasional events. I take them as chances to network with people from other companies and so on. 

My coworker [33M], who we’ll call Ben is pretty scruffy. Showing up to work in the same outfit he wore the previous day and even sleeping at his desk sometimes. I’ve never interacted with him 1-on-1 per se but we’ve been on the same projects and I’m friendly with him. 

Here is where the issue is: Recently, there was a company event, and, for once, Ben didn’t really participate or speak about it beforehand, so most of us assumed he wasn’t going. I didn’t expect him to come of course, but he did in the most unprofessional outfit. He was wearing wrinkled clothes and colors that didn’t match. Like he rolled out of bed. He walked up to my circle and we locked eyes and I joked that he should’ve freshed up a bit to an event like this and there were some chuckles but everyone was mostly silent.

I haven’t seen him since and he’s been actively avoiding me. mostly everyone in my circle is expecting me to apologize to Ben, AITA for making a joke?

1jg2rbt,AITA for not letting my dad's gf walk through the front door that's in my room when she was upset?,"I (23m) live with my dad, his gf (when my dad hasn't kicked her out after one of their spats), and my youngest brother for the past 3 or 4 years. We recently moved into a new house around August of 2023 and my new room is like a mudroom but we only use it as a bedroom for me, but it has the front door which is fine bc my family only uses the back door really, and I can just grab whatever food or packages are delivered and distribute them.

Anyways, my dad's gf, let's call her Stacy (34f), and my dad always get into arguments when he's drunk. We have a small house so she has no where to go but outside when they argue or their closet. Well sometimes my dad is on the back porch drinking with my uncles and even though they will ignore her when she walks through them to go around the house to sit on the front steps, she would rather go through the front door.

Well since the front door is in my room, Stacy needs to ask since yknow, privacy and things and bc I would have to move a bunch of things and leave the door and screen door unlocked and open for her, and she always does ask.

I normally let her, but a few months ago, when this incident happens, she asks me and I said no, bc I just didn't want to have to move all my stuff and I was stressed and wanted to have personal convos with my friends without worrying she's snooping (she likes to eavesdrop and had stolen my sister's gf's things when my sis and her gf lived with us). Also, I have anxiety of leaving the front door unlocked and open (PTSD things) which increased with my stressed state. Anyways, when I said no, she cursed me out and said I was being inconsiderate before storming out of my room and almost slamming the door.

My friends said I wasn't an asshole and that it was my room so I have the right to say no and it's just my people pleasing personality making me feel guilty. Yet Stacy didn't talk to me for almost a month after, and our relationship is still strained. I'm internally torn.

1jg2tqy,AITA for not loving my sister's children the way she and her husband do?,"TL;DR - On a recent visit to see my sister and her threr children, told me she was hurt and disappointed that I don't love her children in the same manner that she and her husband do. I told her this was an unreasonable expectation...AITA?

The past two years I (43f) have traveled to spend a week with my sister (40f) and her family. She and her husband and have three young boys - a 3.5 year old and twin 2.5 year olds. It's about a 6 hour flight, so it's not a trip I can make on a regular basis.

When I visited last February, it was a great trip. Good mix of sister time, hanging out with the kids and her husband, a night out, a house party, just all around enjoyable. Her husband is great and is a stay at home Dad. My sister works from home and is a successful business woman. I was genuinely excited to go visit again last month.

I'm not a kid person and I never have been. My partner and I are intentionally childless and we love our quiet, low key life. I'm good with kids. I'll play with them with their toys, I'll crawl around on the floor with them, I'm down to do whatever goofy thing they're into - but for only about 2 hours at a time. Then I have to tap out and recharge.

I'm also not great with the constant noise kids make. I understand that's just what they do, but I've got a low threshold for it, especially when it's the full blown meltdowns. For the first 3-4 days I was at my sister's, the three kids were screaming and crying nearly every 25 minutes. So when the temper tantrums started, I'd go outside or at least leave the room.

At one point, the kids and husband are out of the house and my sister took the opportunity to tell me how she's disappointed that I ""don't love the boys the way (husband's name) and I do."" 

I said that I do love the boys and I asked if there was something I did or didn't do with the kids that upset her. She said no, that I was great with them. I asked if she thought I was paying enough attention to them. She said I was, but brought up my low tolerance for the fits. I apologized and reminded her that I'm really not used to it and that it's kind of stressful, so I just remove myself from the situation.

Things kind of devloved from there, but we recovered and the rest of the trip was fine enough. Am I the asshole thinking that my sister's request is way off base? I love my nephews, but I don't think anyone can love children in the way that child's parents do. 

Edit: Thank you for all the feedback! It gave me a lot of things to think about and reflect on. I've come to think my sister's criticism that I don't love her boys like she does is not an actual, literal expectation. I think it might be a weird, kind of manipulative way of saying ""I need you to think I'm a good parent.""

It's entirely too much to get into here and of course details and context are missing. But, I think I need to call her so we can talk about this and what's going on.

Thanks for confirming that I'm NTA and that the perspectives of my family and friends were not just super biased in my favor 🙃",happyhappy_joyjoy11,5734,0.9800000190734864,348,1742512993,2025-03-20 18:23:13,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jg2tqy/aita_for_not_loving_my_sisters_children_the_way/,3,2025
1jg3cvi,AITA for not inviting my pregnant sister in law to my wedding?,"My partner and I are due to get married soon. My brother David has always been viewed as the favourite in my family, and so is his wife Jill. I on the other hand am always viewed as the problem in my mothers eyes

A few years ago, we celebrated my step brothers wedding with our family.  David, Jill,  my fiance and I  stayed in an apartment and had breakfast together the next morning and all was seemingly great. That was until later that afternoon when I received a call from my mum saying Jill was at her house in tears because I insulted her appearance at the wedding. I have zero recollection of this but my fiance was with me the whole night and was adamant that I did not say anything, plus Jill showed no signs of being upset or annoyed with me at any point. I was disappointed that my mum did not ask me and jumped to conclusions that I was in the wrong. I apologised to Jill and that was seemingly the end of it. 

Our relationship with Dave and Jill has been icy since then and Jill has made no effort to engage with my fiance on our upcoming wedding at family events. At Christmas, when we were visiting my mum and step dad, Dave and Jill both arrived and announced that they are expecting a baby (first grand kid in the family) and that’s it’s due on our wedding day. After a few drinks my step dad made a remark that ‘our big day is now about Dave and Jill aswell’ I spoke to my mum about this and she assured me that this wouldn’t be the case and that they would be celebrating us, my step dad disagreed again. Our wedding day is really important to us and our friendships. We have a two day wedding, the first day is a ceremony and a meal in an upmarket restaurant for 30 of our closest friends and immediate family. The next day is a party for all our other friends and extended family. David and Jill are invited to both days but given the long day and that she is due to give birth on the day, we did not have the space to accommodate Jill for the evening meal. She also said she didn’t want to go originally as she doesn’t like that kind of food but has changed her stance since on wanting to attend. 

My mum has now demanded that we invite Jill to the meal and has been pretty aggressive towards me and my fiance. We have stated that we don’t have the space (my fiances close friends and step mum aren’t going) and that we don’t think it’s suitable, the ceremony at the meal is very intimate and we only want our closest friends there. My mum has now said that they need to be there for Jill in case she goes into labour and so she needs to be at the venue. I should point out that Jill also has family albeit they are a 1 hour flight away, and not all of our family are going to the meal. We are paying for the wedding ourselves too. I just feel like this should be a day to celebrate me and my to be wife but my family have made it clear that they want it to be about Jill,who has made it clear she doesn’t even like us. So please help, AITA?

1jhkq9l,AITA for agreeing with my daughter it is weird her friend's mom has access to their conversations?,"My daughter is 14 years old and has a friend ""Chloe"". She and Chloe have been friends for a little over a year now. Chloe's mom ""Gina"" is someone I'd consider pretty strict. I was aware she'd check Chloe's phone (and I know a lot of parents do this), but I found out a few months ago through my daughter that she'd respond through Chloe's phone to Chloe's friends, including my daughter. It was never anything overkill, just ""Chloe can't talk right now, she's busy with homework"" or whatever. I thought this was odd but didn't say anything to Gina about it because that's her life and her business. 

I got a call from Gina earlier this afternoon. She was very pissed off and told me that my daughter was rude, I needed to start monitoring what she says, etc. I asked her what exactly happened and she said my daughter gave her an attitude via text. I was still very confused and asked why they were texting. Gina became exasperated and snapped ""Through Chloe's phone!!"" I told her I'd call her back and asked my daughter specifically what happened. My daughter willingly showed me her texts. She had texted Chloe something. Gina had responded (using Chloe's phone) saying Chloe was busy. My daughter replied asking when Chloe would be available to talk. Gina told her ""When she's ready, stop texting her"". My daughter replied ""You don't have to be so rude"". Gina said she wasn't being rude. My daughter said yes, Gina was, and also called her a weirdo for using Chloe's phone. 

I told my daughter next time, just don't engage. I did also say it wasn't kind to call someone a weirdo and not to do it again, but that I also understood her frustration. I didn't punish her, she seemed receptive to the talk and I left it at that. I called Gina back and told her I had spoken to my daughter and handled the problem. Gina started ranting that I need to monitor my daughter's phone and have I seen some of the things she talks about? She started on crushes, rants about teachers, saying there were times my daughter badmouthed me when frustrated. I said that's all fine, I'd rather her have a safe space to vent with her friends, after all, she's a teenager. Gina kept pressing on the issue and what would be done. I told her nothing, I spoke with my daughter and handled it. Gina said ""But she insulted an adult!"" I told her I handled it, but my daughter also didn't say anything that wasn't true, Gina \*was\* acting like a weirdo.

Now, Gina is angry with me, My daughter doesn't care that I said all of this. However, my husband thinks that I shouldn't have said it, as it didn't solve anything, and Gina can parent how she wants. I said I never commented on Gina's parenting, until she tried to undermine/insult mine.

1jiagdc,AITA for refusing to go to my grandma’s house on my birthday?,"It was my birthday recently. Usually, my family goes to my grandma’s to celebrate each other’s bdays. However, I didn’t want to do that this time. I told my parents I’d rather it be simple: stay home and get takeout. I also have a complicated relationship with my grandma, as I think she can be manipulative, guilt trips, and not respect my boundaries at times. I’ve also realized that I’m not big on making a huge event out of my bday and getting a lot of gifts. I told my parents about my plans, and they said that I could do as I wished.

I visited my grandma a week before my bday. During this, I told her I didn’t want to come over on my bday. She looked confused and didn’t say anything. Fast forward to the night before my bday, and my parents ask why I don’t want to go to my grandma’s. I thought this was odd, as they previously said they were fine with my wishes. I stated that I still didn’t want to go. My bday comes, and they repeatedly ask me to go.

My grandma then calls my mom at 11:00 a.m. and says, “What time are you guys coming over? I have gifts.” My mom tells her I’d rather not come over, to which my grandma breaks down crying. The call ends, and my mom says, “Well, it’s like you put a knife through her heart.” I felt both bothered and terrible. I texted my grandma that I could come over the day after to hang out and open the gifts. She left me on read. Throughout my bday, my parents continued to make me feel bad about not wanting to go.

I lay in bed, felt like a monster, and caved into going even though I didn’t want to. I texted my grandma, “I guess I can come over in two hours. Is that okay with you?” at 4:00 p.m. She responded at 5:30 p.m., and my mom and I got there at 6:00 p.m. I then opened the gifts, which I honestly believed were thought about at the last minute. I later went into her kitchen and saw a Walgreens receipt on the counter stating the gifts were bought 20 minutes before I came over. I felt some of the other stuff she gave me were things she had lying around the house. I also told my mom I didn’t want to stay more than 2 hours.

I wanted to still have time to go home, relax, and clear my conscience of the drama. This wasn’t the case, as my mom and grandma wanted to watch a Netflix show. I stayed in another room by myself until they finished. We went home at 10:00 p.m., and I quietly cried in bed because I was stressed out the whole day. I felt like I prioritized other people’s wants and couldn’t enjoy the day.",Upbeat_Hippo_1714,1633,0.9700000286102296,99,1742765761,2025-03-23 16:36:01,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jiagdc/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_grandmas_house_on/,3,2025
1jicfiz,AITA for calling friend’s penis decent?,"I (19F) am currently on spring break. Me and my friends (as well as some of their friends) decided to go to a nearby beach. It was a two day trip where we go swimming, eat out, and do a little shopping before heading back. While we were on the beach, some of us got hungry. A few people decided to go to a nearby gas station to grab some snacks and bring it back, while others stayed. I stayed and so did B (20M). B is a friend of a friend, and we aren’t that close, but we did get along. We stayed to watch over everyone’s stuff in case it got stolen or anything. 

The two of us were chatting and sitting. Now I want to note, he was wearing a *really* short trunks, which wasn’t a problem. Until he moved his legs and his penis peeked through his shorts. He didn’t realize and I felt awkward to point it out because I didn’t know this guy that well. I had only met him a few days ago. But after a minute or two, I kind of hinted for him to look down and he got shocked. He fixed the issue and we sat there awkwardly and didn’t say anything. 

That night, I get a call from B. He told me he was embarrassed about the situation and that he didn’t mean to flash me. I said to not worry about it because it was clearly an accident. Then he asks me what I thought about his penis. I was shocked and unsure how to respond. So, I just said that it was decent. Now, in hindsight, I genuinely do not know what I meant by decent. I just blurted it out since that was the first word that popped in my head. He got upset and was wondering why it was decent, and I didn’t have a response. We hung up. 

The next day, I saw him at breakfast and could clearly see he was upset. He wasn’t upset at anyone else and made it a point to completely avoid me, not sitting or standing near me. I assuming it was because of what I said about his penis. 

Now, I haven’t told anyone about this event, mainly because I don’t want to embarrass him or anything. But I feel like I was being an asshole for saying that and I could’ve like approached that better.

1jj3l3t,WIBTA If I refused to pay a cat rescue for fixing my foster cats?,"Personally, I felt I was scammed by a rescue. Which is a statement I never thought I’d make, because usually I regard a rescue as a very honorable and respectable organization that only intends on helping. 

However, I ran into a particularly unfriendly rescue helper who responded to a post I had made requesting help with two kittens I had rescued from outside. (In AZ, where temps get up to about 120 degrees). 

I had mentioned in the posts that I am a young mom who just bought my house and cannot afford to spay/neuter them and if there’s anybody out there who could help me help them, to please reach out. 

She contacted me, asked me to explain why I felt that I needed the help, and then proceeded to ask me to bring the kittens for the procedure. I thanked her profusely, and she never mentioned once requiring that I pay her back.

She also blew up my phone the day of the procedure telling me I must call her back NOW or else she will not see the kittens, even though I had sent her a text message the night before letting her know that I would be there. 

Anyways, now that the kittens have found a new home she sent me an invoice saying that I owe her $120 for the spay/neuter. She charged me more for the male kitten than the quote I got at a local clinic, and I would have definitely declined her offer for “help” had I known she would charge me and at this price. 

So, WIBTA for ignoring her texts or reaching out to tell her I didn’t agree to pay her back at this price?

I was really moved by his gesture and the thought he put into it. A couple days later, my wife said the photos in the frames are 'bad resolution' and that she wants to print the same images in better resolution so it doesn't look pixelated. To be fair, the images were pixelated, but I told her thats a part of the gift and it means something to me. So I wouldn't want to replace the photos, even if they're exactly the same (ship of theseus?). 
Today she went ahead and printed the new images (exactly the same image, dimensions etc.) and replaced those in the frames from my friend. She said she'll still hold on to the photos my friend gave with the frames. I had no clue she was going to do it despite my explicit disapproval when she originally proposed the idea. 
This led to a huge argument between us and she feels I'm being unreasonable because she's trying to improve the look of the photos while keeping the same image.

1jjxve6,AITA for refusing to go to the store when my significant other cooks meals for me?,"My signifiant other (M38) and I (F35) have lived together for over a year. His mother and our daughter (F13) are also in the home. He is the primary cook in the home as he prefers to cook and is picky about how the food is prepared. He also does the majority of the shopping because he prefers to shop at certain stores. I do also cook occasionally and pay for meals when we order out. Additionally when I give him money to assist with bills I give extra to help pay for food costs. I do also clean the kitchen after each meal which is not a small task because he doesn't clean as he cooks and typically any thing he touches in the meal prep process is left out. None of this bothers me so much as when he asks me to go to the store for last minute ingredients. For some reason he never has all the ingredients right before the meal needs to be cooked. For instance tonight, he starts cooking pasta at 6:45pm and right before he cooks he forgot that we did not have noodles. He started planning dinner at 10am. He then expects me to drop anything I am doing to go to the store to get the items. When I say ""no, you could have asked earlier or planned better"" he accuses me of being lazy or not helpful. He does this during holidays too. Days before the holiday I asks several times does he need me to go to the store. Every day leading up to the holiday he says no, then inevitably the day of the holiday he needs a few ingredients. I ask him all the time just to be thoughtful of my time because I could end up having to make trips to the store everyday due to his poor planning.

1jkqimr,AITA for not offering to split gas on a road trip I didn’t want to go on?,"Last weekend, I (24F) got dragged into a spontaneous hiking trip with my friends Jason and Lily (they’re a couple). We were hanging out Friday night at their place—I was already half-dead from the work week and had too much wine, so I just crashed on their couch.

Saturday morning, I was super hungover, like dry mouth, hoodie-over-eyes level. All I wanted was some water, maybe a hash brown, and no human interaction. But Jason was already up and buzzing about this hike four hours away. Lily was into it too. I said, very clearly, multiple times, “I’m down to hang but I’m not hiking. I feel like crap.”

They were like, “Oh come on, you’ll feel better once we’re out there,” and “It’s mostly flat.” I didn’t push back hard enough, I guess. I wasn’t trying to be a buzzkill. Next thing I know, we’re in Jason’s car, and I’m wedged in the back with my hood up and a bottle of Gatorade.

Spoiler: I never hiked. We got there, I walked to the trailhead, and then just sat in the car with the windows cracked, reading a paperback I found in the backseat (I think it was Lily’s copy of Circe? Good book though). They were gone for three-ish hours, came back sweaty and glowing and very into themselves. I clapped politely. We drove back.

Then—on the drive home—Jason says, all casual, “So if y’all could Venmo me like thirty bucks for gas, that’d be great.”

I hesitated and said, “Wait, seriously?” I told him I didn’t really feel comfortable paying for a trip I didn’t want to go on and didn’t participate in. I said it as lightly as I could, like I even added a half-laugh so it didn’t sound rude, but neither of them responded.

It got weirdly quiet after that. Like… not just “we’re tired” quiet, but stiff, polite quiet. Lily scrolled through Instagram the rest of the ride. Jason turned the music up and didn’t really talk to me again until they dropped me off.

I texted later that night just to say thanks for driving anyway, and Lily replied with a thumbs-up emoji. Not even a “np” or anything, just 👍.

I’ve been replaying it in my head because I do get that gas isn’t free, but also—I didn’t want to go, I said that, and I barely even left the car. I felt like I was being held financially hostage for a vibe I wasn’t part of.

1jlgkud,AITA for not giving my dad money he says he gave me years ago?,"AITA for refusing to give my dad $20,000 for a business, even though he now says the money was his all along?

A few weeks ago, my dad (62M) asked me (32M) for $20,000 to help fund a gas station business he wanted to start. I said no, respectfully, because over the years he’s started 30–40 business ventures—none of which have succeeded. He rarely takes advice, changes his mind constantly, and gets defensive when challenged. I’ve supported where I could emotionally, but I’ve seen this cycle repeat itself too many times.

After I declined, he sent me a message saying how shocked and disappointed he was, saying he was waiting for me to “wake up” and help him. Then, a few days later, I got another message—this time in Arabic—completely changing the story.

He now claims that back in 2015, he deposited $30,000 under my name, and that this money came from his government retirement package. According to him, it was meant to be shared between me and my siblings to help with living expenses and education while we were abroad. I did use that money during my time studying to pay for exams, licensing, rent, etc.—which is exactly what he told us the money was there for. He never said it was a loan or that I’d need to repay it.

Now, almost a decade later, he says I owe him the rest of the money and that he needs it—not for the gas station anymore, but to support my siblings’ education. The reasoning has completely changed. What’s worse is he knows that I’ve been carefully investing my savings for my own retirement, and he’s essentially asking me to sell off long-term investments to fund his latest business idea. He retired in 2023 at age 60 and has since refused to return to work to help support the family.

What’s frustrating is the story keeps changing depending on what might convince me: first it was a business, now it’s for the family. It feels manipulative. I’ve worked hard, earned my degree, and tried to support my family where I can. But this shift—framing past help as a “debt” and guilting me—feels really unfair.

I’m also honestly worried that if I “repay” this supposed debt now, it won’t stop here—what’s next? Is he going to come back asking me to reimburse him for diapers he bought when I was a baby, or the bus passes from when I was in high school?

I want to set boundaries, but now I’m torn. Would giving him the money just enable this cycle?

I told her to stop it and that I wasn't going to take her if she keeps trying to set me up with her friends' relatives. Problem is that Grandma insists I stay with her, and I just want a day off to myself.

After last week, I told Grandma I had enough and that was the last time I take her. She and my mom are upset because she doesn't have another way to get to church. Mom can't drive and we don't have reliable public transportation.

So far, I've been holding my ground but Grandma is upset. Sunday is coming up and she's sad she won't get to attend. I told mom she needs to figure something out because I'm sick of being the unpaid chauffeur.

1jmxadw,AITAH? Told my girlfriend not to use my electric face razor on her vag but she did anyway.,"So long story short, in the past my gf (me 27, her 26) admitted to using my razor on her coochie. I told her to never do that again and even gave her my old electric one to use. Fast forward to recent and I found out she used it again. Along with that, I have been telling her for months to stop showering without the fan on or door open a bit as it’ll cause water damage over time. Well, at the same time of finding out about the razor, she had made the bathroom walls wet with water again and I blew up a little bit. She has a hard time taking any criticism and has a hard time admitting fault so this went over not too great. Now a week or so later I was asking where something of mine was and if she possibly used it. Her response was, “why do you always assume I’m using your stuff???” I threw back, “says the person that was asked to not use my razor on her vag yet she did anyway!” Now for the first time she has decided to go spend the Saturday on her own instead of having me come with. I’m not worried we’re drifting apart, however I don’t want these things to keep happening without change.

For reference the ONLY thing we really bicker about is chores and who has done what (I really wish this would stop but we both keep on keeping track). We have also been together for about a year and 2 months. Any ladies or anyone else out there have any advice on how to get my lady to see my point of view or how to get her to be more reasonable to admitting fault/not being defensive all the time?

1jnn72a,AITA for cutting off all personal communication with my ex and only allowing co-parenting contact through a court app?,"I (30f) co-parent my daughter with my ex, (39m), and I’ve reached a breaking point. I need to know if I’m the asshole for cutting off all personal communication and only using the court-ordered co-parenting app.

When our daughter was four months old and I returned to work (I don’t work from home, he does), I chose a daycare near my job so I could breastfeed on lunch and be close in emergencies. I told him, and he said, “If you think it’s good, fine.” No input, no tour, no research. Later, he pushed to cut her from 5 days to 3 to avoid full payments—even though we’re court-ordered to split childcare 50/50. That change left me with only 2 days I could use for work.

The daycare charged weekly on autopay from my account. I told him he could make his own account to pay directly, but he didn’t. Instead, he reimbursed me whenever he felt like it—sometimes late or partially. Eventually, he started blaming me for choosing the daycare “without his input” and even threatened not to pay at all.

To keep the peace, I agreed to pick a new daycare together. But when I asked what he wanted me to do, he yelled that I “needed to fix it” without saying how. Eventually, he asked for a list of 5 local daycares. I did the research, sent him the list. He ignored it for over a week, then told me I was making him do “all the homework.” Finally, he said to pick 2, and he’d choose one. I did. He chose one.

I scheduled a tour. He demanded it be during my work hours so I’d be “making a sacrifice.” I don’t work from home—he does—but I still called off work. After the tour, we got the enrollment forms. I gave them to him to complete. We were in the last week of her old daycare and he was about to leave for a work trip, so timing mattered.

That Friday, I asked if he’d filled them out. He told me he “wasn’t sure we liked the daycare,” because I supposedly rolled my eyes at the food options. I hadn’t. When I calmly told him that wasn’t true, he accused me of lying, slammed his car door, and drove off mid-convo.

I messaged him later to say this behavior isn’t acceptable. He denied everything and acted like I was overreacting. After months of yelling in front of our daughter, slamming doors, twisting facts, blaming me, and storming off mid-discussions, I finally set a boundary.

I told him: from now on, unless it’s about Amelia, contact me only through the court app. No more personal calls, texts, or access to me.

Now he’s calling me controlling and unreasonable. I feel like I’ve done everything I can to keep peace for Amelia’s sake, but I’m tired of being disrespected and manipulated.

1jnnggj,AITA for turning away my partner's grandparents when they showed up unannounced?,"My partner and I had twins in February. We're currently living in her parents' neighboring house because they acquired it after the neighbor passed away, and we're renting/renovating it with them. We have set clear boundaries that we don't want surprise visitors, and we would like it if they only came over once or twice a week so we can have some privacy. 

Today, my partner's dad texted her while she was trying to nap, letting her know that her grandmother (his mother) had shown up at their house unannounced. We appreciated the heads-up, and she continued with trying to rest, as the twins were finally fed, changed, and no longer being fussy. About 10-15 minutes later, her phone starts ringing, and I see it's her dad. I answered, and he let me know her grandma and grandpa were walking over. I told him I would turn them away, as everyone was finally sleeping and it wasn't a good time. He said ""You shouldn't do that, because it will start a fight."" I said ""Oh well, it's not a good time.""

Her grandparents rang the doorbell twice during that phone call, almost back to back, waking her and one of the boys up. I told her to just keep sleeping, I'll deal with it. I answered the door, and her grandma could tell I was exhausted, because she asked if we were sleeping. I said ""Yes, we all are."" She said ""Too bad,"" and tried stepping towards the door. I pulled it shut a little more so it was barely open enough for me, and told her ""No. It's not a good time. They haven't been sleeping good, and I don't want them waking up since they're finally asleep."" She pretended she was ok with it, and parted ways.

A few minutes later, my partner called her dad with the boys screaming in the background, telling him we turned them away. He did what he usually does when he's mad, and kept giving short, one or two word replies. Then, after she was done talking, he blew up, talking about how he's going to have to deal with her grandma being pissed off now, and saying something like ""I might as well fucking broadcast your damn rules to everyone to not show up unless they call ahead!"" along with some other stuff I didn't catch, as I was in the other room. She started crying, said bye while he was still yelling, and hung up.

Now I feel like I shouldn't have told her grandparents to come back another day, because her dad apparently can't deal with his mother's (or his own) emotions, and it would've been easier to just deal with them coming in and disturbing the peace that we had just managed to establish. So, AITA for turning them away? Should I have just dealt with them coming in for a little while?",GingerKenobi,4490,0.9800000190734864,255,1743370951,2025-03-30 16:42:31,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jnnggj/aita_for_turning_away_my_partners_grandparents/,3,2025
1jnnufe,AITA for telling my dad’s fiancée I’m not her family?,"2 nights ago, I (15f) was eating dinner with my dad (40m) and his fiancée (41f) when we got into an argument. My dad and his fiancée have been together for a year so I didn’t really know her well before she moved in (My father also never told me she would be moving in). Me and his fiancee dislike each other, she was raised Christian and expects me to go to church with them even though Im not religious, this isn’t really a problem anymore because I told my mother I didn’t want to go but his fiancee still likes to make snarky comments about religion like saying I can’t celebrate Christmas if I’m not Christian. So, I’ve been on the edge with her.

I really hate onions, my father and his fiancée know this but they still decided to put a ton of onion in the dinner so I had to pick onions out of my food. I was complaining about them making something with a ton of onion when they know I hate onions. The fiancée started talking about how in her family whenever someone didn’t like something for dinner they would have to make a different meal for themselves. I got really pissed off and told her that I wasn’t her family so that didn’t apply to me and she started saying that when she and my dad got married she would be my stepmom. I told her that didn’t make her my family and then she started talking about if she and my dad ever had a child (which they won’t because he already has a teenager and she’s over 40) that I would be her family. I told her I wouldn’t be interacting with that child and then she stopped talking.

My sister and I have never been close growing up, to the point where this summer we went no contact after another argument. My partner and I will have been married 3 years this August, and after my partner proposed my sister messaged me saying she did not want to be involved in the wedding or even hear about wedding plans. Although hurtful I complied, and now that she is getting married she has begun to make contact again. Today while talking to my mother she mentioned that my sister had said she wants to wear my wedding veil. I told her that was okay as long as I could give it to her with a box stating “something borrowed” as I have already offered it to two other friends with upcoming weddings. Then my mother informs me my sister and her partner are getting married the weekend of my and my partners wedding anniversary, that they are booking the same photographer, that she wants her photos taken in the same location as mine- and then asked if my sister could wear my dress (which she would have to have fitted so it would never be my dress again). I expressed to my mother I wasn’t sure about using my dress and how I wanted to keep it. However, my father chimed in to the phone call saying I should “just give it to her”. AITA if I say no?

1joe3w9,"AITA for charging an “entry fee” for a family dinner on April 1st, leading my aunt to think it was an April Fool’s joke?","I (26F) am the go-to host for family dinners, and I usually enjoy it. But my aunt (55F) has a frustrating habit: she shows up uninvited with extra guests like friends or random relatives without telling me. It’s happened too many times, leaving me to stretch food and space on the spot. I’ve asked her nicely to give me a heads-up, but she just says, “Family should be spontaneous,” and ignores me.

With today being March 31st, I’m hosting a family dinner tomorrow, April 1st, for my parents’ anniversary. Knowing my aunt will likely crash it with extras, I decided to try something new. Last week, I sent a group message saying that because hosting costs keep rising (and the guest list keeps growing), I’m asking each adult to chip in $10 to cover expenses. I figured this was a fair way to handle it without pointing fingers.

Tomorrow’s the big day, but I can already picture it: my aunt will roll up with three unannounced friends. When I ask for the $10 contributions at the door, she’ll probably laugh and say, “Oh, great April Fool’s joke!” I’ll have to explain it’s not a prank and that it’s about respect and planning, especially since she keeps doing this. I’m betting she’ll get mad, call me “stingy,” and storm off, which has happened before when I’ve set boundaries.

The family’s already split. Some think I should let it slide since it’s a special occasion (and tomorrow’s April Fool’s Day might confuse things), while others say I’m right to stand my ground. I’m worried my aunt will spin it as me pulling a “mean prank” if she takes it the wrong way.

1jpa51m,AITA for forbidding my girlfriend from doing household chores?,"A few years ago while putting together furniture, my (26m) girlfriend (27f) injured her wrists from using the screwdriver. We ended up getting her some wrist braces until the pain went away. We eventually checked with a doctor who said it was no big deal.

Since then, I've slowly forbidden her from doing chores around the house. I noticed that doing these chores (sweeping, scrubbing, cleaning dishes, etc.) would consistently agitated her wrists and she wouldn't be able to work on her actual job (small handmade crafts that require a lot of wrist usage.) I kept seeing the pattern of her straining her wrist on chores > bail out on her job after an hour or two and have to wear her wrist brace until the next day. She does love her job and when things go well can happily work up to 6 hours a day on her crafts, so since I can't do her job for her I want her to be able to focus on it.

I have no problem doing these chores, but today I caught her scrubbing a pan when I'd just reminded her yesterday to leave them alone and told her to call me if I'd missed one (and I would have hustled over to do it.)

She told me I'm being overbearing and that she's fine to scrub a pan, but I don't want her getting injured or develop worse long term damage.

AITA for insisting on doing the household chores?

Edit: Some clarifications.

- I should have put ""forbidding"" in quotes. I can't really stop her from doing anything besides maybe chiding her afterwards. I'm not her dad lol.

- I have shown her this thread and she agrees my version of events is more or less accurate but she still feels she's right.

Edit 2: Hello everyone. I stopped responding yesterday because I basically had the answer I needed 10 comments in (I was being the asshole lol) and then this post ended up getting almost 300. I actually got chided myself for spending so much time responding to messages that I ended up slacking on my work.

- I've gotten her a little jig to open soda cans with. I didn't know these things existed until yesterday.

- A lot of people are trying to diagnose her in the comments. We'll keep your ideas in mind the next time we go to the doctor/specialist (and I'll accompany her (if she wants) since people have let me know doctors don't always take women seriously.)

- I appreciate the level headed comments that aimed to help me understand her perspective more (which is why I posted.) To the people voting ESH she says: ""Why am I catching strays here? I just want to do the dishes!""

- Some of you are very angry lol

1jq0f1m,AITA for leaving the house when I found out my wife invited her mom on our vacation?,"I (28M) have always had a rocky relationship with my wife's mom. She’s overbearing, constantly inserting herself into our lives, and doesn’t respect boundaries. Any time I try to set limits, she either ignores them or acts like I’m being unfair.

My wife and I planned a two week vacation just the two of us. I saved up and handled all the planning, while she was in charge of booking the flights. Her mom caught wind of the trip and immediately started pushing to come along. I told my wife no I wanted this to be a trip for us, not a family getaway. Her mom threw a tantrum, called, texted, and even got other relatives to pressure me. My wife tried to convince me to let her come, but I refused. She eventually agreed and said she wouldn’t invite her.

The night before we were supposed to leave, I was double-checking our travel plans when I noticed an extra ticket on the reservation—her mom’s name was on it. I confronted my wife, and she admitted she booked it behind my back, hoping I’d ""just go along with it"" once it was already done.

I was furious. Instead of arguing, I packed a bag—not for the trip, but to leave. I told her if she wanted to vacation with her mom so badly, she could, but I wasn’t going. She started crying, saying I was ""ruining everything"" and that since the ticket was already bought, I should just deal with it. I walked out and went to stay at a friend’s place for a few days to clear my head.

Now, she’s been calling me nonstop, saying I overreacted and made her look bad. She even told our families, and some of them think I should’ve just gone and ""made the best of it"" instead of ""wasting money"" and causing drama.

1jt74ox,AITA for how I explained to SIL that she wouldn't be my son's godmother?,"My wife and I aren’t practicing Catholics per se but we do follow certain traditions such as christening ceremonies for our children. Some people choose a married couple to be godparents; when I was a baby, my parents chose my uncle and his then-wife, and they divorced when I was still a child and I lost all contact with my former-aunt and basically grew up ‘without’ a godmother.

So my wife and I always thought it was best to choose one of our relatives, and one from each side of our family. For our second son, I chose my brother as godfather, and my wife chose a cousin of hers as godmother. When I called my brother to invite him, he assumed I was asking both him and his wife, and there was this awkward moment when I had to explain to him my SIL wouldn’t be the godmother. He seemed fine with it, but my SIL didn’t attend the ceremony and my brother later told me she was a bit upset.

So I called her later that day just so there wouldn’t be any ill feelings, and I briefly explained our reasoning, including my own personal history with my uncle's divorce. And then she got really mad, as if I was implying I believe she and my brother will get divorced down the road, which was not my point AT ALL. She also said just as couples might get divorced, anyone can also lose touch with a blood-relative, which is objectively truth, but again, not the point we were making here.

1jt7ogm,AITA for not buying my stepdaughter a new car after she's repeatedly gotten into accidents?,"My step daughter is not a good driver. She was not a good driver when she was a teen and certainly not as an adult. When she was first learning to drive, she did very fast hard breaks, she repeatedly left her car's lights on or left her car unlocked.

When she first got her permit at 16, we gave her two rules. We would help buy her first car but she'd be on her own for car insurance, gas, and up keep. If she wanted a car, she needed to be the sole caretaker of it and it was on her to ensure she was taking good care of it. Her brothers had the same rules.

3 months into her being 17, she got in her first accident. It was her first time driving in the ice and she slid. Her car hit another car. It was not a serious accident, but it caused roughly 1k in damages. Her car drove for another 2 months, but the transmission went out eventually. She bought it at 160-ishk miles so none of us were surprised it didn't last very long.

When she was 19, she was in another car accident. While on the highway, a semi-truck tried to merge wile riding next to her, she sped up and during it, another car tried to merge right as she sped up. The car was totaled. Outside of wiplash and minor wrist injuries, she was okay. Because of this accident, we made her get her own insurance because our payment went up.

Three weeks ago, she was involved in another accident. Again on the highway, she was passing an on ramp and a car coming on hydroplanned and lost control of a ladder in the back of it's pick up truck. It again totaled her car: it could not leave the scene and we had to get her to bring her back to her college. The other driver broke his collarbone and she has wiplash, a shoulder injury, and some facial damage that should heal in the next bit. The police officer told her that it was not her fault, but obviously we have to wait for the insurance to make that call.

Once she got home from the ER, she asked for us to help her purchase a new car. She said that it's not practical for her to constantly walk everywhere until she could afford a new car. She makes $21 an hour as a CMA at a nursing home so it won't take her long to buy a cheap car. From her apartment, she is about 1.5 miles from college, .25 miles from a grocery store, and 4 miles from her job. I think for the time being, she can walk, ask for rides from friends, or use an app. We don't have public transportation, but lots of side walks. She can walk the entirety from her apartment to class, most to a store, and on and off from her job.

My husband wants us to purchase a new car and have her pay us back. I don't think this is the right move. To date, the only time we have ever helped buy a car is when they all started driving, and we only paid half. She only saved 2k for her first car, so we only gave 4k for a new car. One of her brothers saved up 10k, so we gave 10k. If we start doing this now, we will walk down a very expensive walk.

I have gotten mixed reactions from others.

1junjqs,AITA for keeping a relationship with my brothers ex wife when they have two kids together?,"
My brother was married to his wife for 14 years and has two boys together (10 and 12). Their marriage struggled a lot, but they made it last for that long. I became super close with his wife and she was a wonderful wife and mother to him.

I know for a fact my brother cheated on her in the past even though he won’t admit it to me. I’m also 99% sure he left his wife for his current girlfriend although he won’t admit that either.

The divorce has been nasty and restraining orders against him have been in place and everything. They can only speak about the boys.

Recently myself (aunt of the boys) and my mother (grandmother of the boys) made plans to get together with the children and the ex-wife. These plans included staying the night at our house because they live out of town.  My brother found out and blew up, was super pissed off but we were firm that this was not fair for the children and the kids deserve to see everyone get along for their sake. My brother talks shit about their mother often, even infront of them, and we always vowed to not take sides for the sake of the kids.

Of course everything escalated. Our other sibling called me basically telling me we were terrible, how it was selfish to do this to our brother and how dare we pick the ex over family. Basically I was told we were pieces of shit for choosing the children over everything else and neither of my siblings see it as compassion for the kids.

At this the family is split and my brother wants nothing to do with us and neither does my other siblings apparently. 

AITA for this letting my brothers ex wife stay at our house with the kids? Should we not have any sort of relationship with her? In my mind it’s best for the kids to see each side of the family get along and not hate eachother. The divorce has been very traumatizing for both of them. 


ETA: I want to thank everyone who commented on this and gave me reassurance that we did the right thing here and severing ties with my brother isn’t the end of the world. I’m so disappointed at the behavior of him and our other sibling. Unfortunately, they will only associate themselves with people that are on their side 100% of the time and support them to the bitter end. This happens with all of their friendships and everything. However, I’m the person that will tell you when I feel like you may be leaning on the wrong side a bit, and urge people to see the other point of view, and it’s always out of pure love. Regardless, it’s okay if we’re the bad guys here.

Children always come first no matter what and I’ll be their ride or die forever. One day kids will figure it out and I hope when that happens, they know we were always on their side, because they matter the most.

1jvfln7,AITA for getting frustrated that my girlfriend always falls asleep on the couch?,"We’ve been dating for over 2.5 years. She always falls asleep when we watch TV or relax on the couch. Initially, this was adorable as someone was willing to trust me enough to consistently fall asleep on me. I was patient and gently woke her up and put her to bed. After a year, I became impatient because I knew her well enough to be able to tell she was getting comfortable and about to sleep. So, I pause what we’re watching and ask if she wants to go to bed. She always says she wants to stay on my lap. At first, I found this heartwarming and finished the remaining chores in the house, even though I didn’t appreciate she didn’t want to do it before falling asleep. And when i woke her back up to move to the bedroom she always wakes up confused and agitated. This makes me uncomfortable, and I’ve never liked waking anyone up. I also started feeling a bit parental which is not the kind of relationship i want to have. 

Last night she was falling asleep on the couch again and i needed to go shower. I asked her if she wants to stay up or go to bed because I am going to shower. She said she will stay up until i am back. When i returned from the shower i found her sleeping and all of her homework left out on the table (she needs to pack up so she can leave to work tomorrow). We had a major fight because i woke her up but in an openly annoyed and agitated way and told her to start “acting like an adult and sleep on the bed”. We havent spoken since and she is very mad at me. I am not sure how to handle this situation and wondering if i have to comfort her to bed for the rest of my life.

1jvjdip,AITA for refusing to be my sister’s bridesmaid because she chose “ugly friends” to make herself look better?,"My sister (27F) is getting married and asked me (24F) to be one of her bridesmaids. I was excited — until I found out who the rest of the bridal party was. Every single one of them is someone she’s either not that close to, or has made fun of before for being “awkward” or “not photogenic.” Some of her actual best friends — the ones who she sees all the time — weren’t even asked.

It felt weird, so I asked her why she picked this group. She kind of laughed and said, “You’ll understand when it’s your wedding. You don’t want people who’ll outshine you in your own pictures.”

I just stared at her. I asked, “So you picked them because you think they’ll make you look better?” She rolled her eyes and said, “It’s not that deep. I just want to feel confident that day, and I’m allowed to be a little selfish for my wedding.”

That rubbed me the wrong way. I told her I didn’t want to be part of a bridal party built on tearing other people down — even subtly — and that she should’ve picked people she actually cares about.

Now she’s calling me judgmental and sensitive, and our mom says I’m being “too idealistic” and should just support her. But I feel like going along with it makes me complicit.

1jx3t03,AITA for going out to eat when my husband is working late shifts?,"My husband and I work different shifts. I worked first shift and he works a late second shift. So we don’t often eat dinner together because he leaves for work right before I get home and he gets home from work after I am asleep. 

We also have very different tastes in foods. He has a more basic, American food based diet and he also loves seafood. I love foods from other cultures, but I don’t like seafood. Because of this, when we are home together we cook different meals and eat it together. If I make something he likes, I’ll ask if he wants some. If he makes something I like, he does the same. But we always eat together on our days off, whether it be eating out on a date or eating cooked food at home. We’ve been doing this for years and it’s worked. 

But since we work different shifts, 5 to 6 days per week, I am eating dinner alone. I usually cook, but a couple times per month, I go out to a restaurant that serves food he doesn’t like to have dinner. When we are talking later, I usually tell him how I had something from a restaurant and he asks how it was and I tell him. No biggie. 

The other day I was out trying a Peruvian restaurant recommended by a coworker. My husband and I had looked at the menu and he didn’t see anything he was particularly looking forward to on it, so I added it to my list of places to go when he works. And I went that day. He got out of work early and called me and I told him where I was. And he got mad. 

I finished up and went home and he was upset and asked how long this has been going on for. I was confused because he knows I do this. But apparently he thought I did pickup or delivery. I tend to eat in because I don’t want dishes at home. He also can’t really explain why he is so mad, but it seems he’s mad I’m out dining alone? I just go out, get food, and read while I wait and eat. Then I come home. It’s always food he won’t like as well, so I go alone so I can have it. 

He hasn’t been really talking to me since it happened. The conversations are short and cold and it makes me feel like I did something wrong by doing this for years and not specifying I eat in the restaurant to do it. He has never acted this way about anything else, he has always been very kind and willing to work through any issues we have. So I am not sure what’s different with this.

1jxqsks,"AITA for not inviting my dad’s partner to my micro “wedding” dinner, and for not reaching out to her first to explain why?","Using a throwaway to not connect this to my main.

My partner and I are getting married this summer, and we’ve decided to essentially elope. We’re going to have a private ceremony just the two of us during our honeymoon. Not only does this align very much with who we are, so no one in our life is very surprised by this, but we’re also doing it because: 1. our families live scattered across the world and a larger event would mean leaving a lot of people out, and 2. We want to avoid drama.

However, what we do want to do is get dressed up, take photos, and have a dinner together with our immediate families. So essentially, a micro non-wedding celebration. This is where the issues start.

So I told my parents I wanted to have this small event with just them, my partner, and my sister (not including their “new” partners). My parents went through a nasty divorce when I was in my teens, and for several reasons that I explained to them I wanted an intimate event just the five of us. My mom was fully supportive, saying she can understand why this would be so meaningful for me.

My dad understood too. But he wanted me to be the one to break the news to his partner (54F). I didn’t think I had to, because it’s not like I’m calling everyone single other family member who isn’t invited to explain this decision. But I said that if she’s upset she’s more than welcome to call me and we can talk about it. His partner is very sensitive, and we’ve clashed a lot over the years because I don’t think she’s ever been fully willing to understand the nuances of coming into a family after a divorce. Their relationship started shortly after the divorce, and she tried to parent both my sister and I (who were teens/pre-teens) from the get-go. But even though we’re not close, I’ve done my best to otherwise be welcoming and kind.

Well, now he’s told her and all hell has broken lose. She’s completely beside herself, and he wants me to mitigate the issue and reach out. I’ve reiterated that she’s free to call me - if she can’t possibly understand why this is about me and not her (and I can understand she’s disappointed, but so is, I assume, everyone else) then she should reach out to me.

AITA for not inviting her, and for not breaking the news to her, and for refusing to be the first person to reach out here to resolve this? I can kind of see my dad's point, who says I should be extra mindful of her since she is a sensitive person who has had a hard time accepting we're not very close and takes this personally. However, at the same time, I don't think I'm responsible for her feelings or for cleaning up this 'mess.' I also believe in the idea of “my wedding, my choice.”",Powerful-Bug-7639,3636,0.9200000166893004,905,1744490260,2025-04-12 15:37:40,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jxqsks/aita_for_not_inviting_my_dads_partner_to_my_micro/,4,2025

1jyksrp,AITA for yelling at a 19 year old and asking for him to be fired?,"Throwaway account. I (37M) and my husband (39M) have been together 11 years. My husband owns a small bookshop and recently has hired a boy to help him. This lad (I'll call him Joe) is gay and while me and my husband very obviously have no issue with this, Joe seems to do things a lot differently to us. For context both me and my husband are Irish immigrants to London. We grew up a 20 minutes away from each other and went to the same, very Catholic, school. We aren't exactly flamboyant or outwardly 'gay' and don't exactly do PDA since that's how we were raised. On my lunch break from work I like to visit my husband bringing him records I think he might like and his coffee. Recently however Joe has started making comments. It started small with him saying things about'queer joy' and how he loves gay couples which we didn't mind at all, in all fairness it's a fairly scary world for queer people right now and I understand seeing a happy married gay couple means a lot for a kid. But then he started getting a little too comfortable for my liking. He started asking things like 'whose the top' and calling us the f slur jokingly. I think it's entirely inappropriate to be making those comments to his boss but my husband told me to let it go. Joe calls us the f slur a lot which I had brought up a few times telling him calmly to not do that but when he continued I learnt to let go despite my distaste for it since it didnt seem to bother my husband too much but last Wednesday I lost it. 
I was up by the counter when Joe came in. He immediately started blathering on about how f---y we are and while my husband chuckled awkwardly,I did not. Joe noticed this and said I was a stick in the mud and repressed. I was trying to keep my cool until he called me 'a fenian f---t' and I lost it. For anyone who doesn't know the term 'Fenian' isnt exactly a slur or anything but it isn't exactly nice either. Me and my husband jokingly call each other fenians or paddy's from time to time if weve something particularly 'Irish' and I've never exactly viewed as a very offensive word to me but something about this English boy made me snap. I asked him if he thought that was an appropriate thing to say to his boss's partner and started shouting. Telling him hes way out of play and if he wants to keep his job he should buck up. I left to cool down a bit and 30 minutes later got a call from my husband berating me saying that Joe was crying and that hes just a kid. I do feel really bad since hes only young but I still think he needed to be knocked down a step or two, am I the asshole?

Edit: I see a lot of people making comments about the nature of the relationship between Joe and my husband, my husband has asked Joe to stop on my behalf before but this isn't something that really bothers my husband and to be fair it's his workplace not mine.


Update: Joe is my husbands son.
I won't go too much into the details for both my and their privacy but I had a major fight with my husband about why he was being so lenient with him and why we didn't have my back in this. We were shouting back and forth until he shouted something about 'blood being thicker than water' I shout back about him being just some boy and he stopped suddenly. Then he told me. Joe is from an ex girlfriend of his whose now unable to take care of him so my husband picked up. He's been playing child support for years. We each have our separate bank account so I didn't even notice. I'm contemplating separation and divorce. Someone I've known for 25 years became a stranger in 10 seconds.

I made reservations at a restaurant for the evening of my birthday and planned for me, my mum, my stepdad, my best friend and my younger sister (18) to go. Two days before my birthday, me and my sister had an argument because I wasn't able to pick her up because my friend had a medical emergency and I was the only one with him at the time so stayed with him. I was able to leave when the ambulance arrived due to his sister getting there. I was panicking at the time and forgot to text her that I wasn't able to pick her up. I completely forgot I was supposed to pick her up and then went home. I apologised profusely and she was still furious. We were both shouting because the argument got heated. She then said ""You're acting just like our dad"". Our dad was neglectful and emotionally abusive to us growing up, we often argued with him and he frequently forgot to pick us up from school. This comment devastated me, I still have a lot of trauma I am working through because of our dad and she knows very well these type of comments hurt.

1jzb2tl,AITA - told mom she can bill me using the tuition money she stole from me,"When I (m33) was preparing to go to uni, my mom confessed that there was no tuition money for me. Through the years my dad would give her cash to deposit but she only did the first one. She spent the rest. TBH I wasn't even surprised. I was used to being disappointed by her. She promised that she would ""pay me back"" and asked that I never tell me dad. So for four years I thanked them for the tuition money while I took out loans.

For reasons to do with her narcissism, I have an arms length relationship with her, but she would say we're pretty close as she assumes my smiling and nodding while she drones on about the same stories is a relationship.

We have a family cottage that she puts above everything else. She lives there about 90 days of the year. I've been going there with my gf for about 4 days for a couple summers which she begrudges as it takes away from her time. My dad supports my going which is how I pull it off. 

She recently told me that it was time for me to start paying for some of the maintenance on the cottage since I use it. She actually suggested 1k which is wildly disproportionate. I told her she could take it out of the tuition IOU and we could negotiate the amount with dad.

She was speechless. She texted me later to say that it manipulative to bring up the tuition and to threaten to tell dad. It went on and on. 

I've been thinking about it and First, I'm hurt/offended that she can't just do a nice thing for me, she has to get something for it. 
Second, I guess I'm not really over the whole tuition thing. 

WITAH for bringing up ancient history and not paying her for use of the cottage?

Edited to add: at the time, it never occurred to me that I should have told him. I thought I was doing the right thing by protecting both of them. That pretty much summarizes my childhood.

My husband wanted to come along even though I told him it could be just a girls night with my daughter and I.

So my daughter and I enjoy the concert so much! She was so excited she almost cried from pure joy. Everything was great, concert ended, we go to our vehicle.

My daughter and I are still having a good time, kind of on a post-concert high. I turn one of Megan moroney's songs on and we start singing along. My husband abruptly turns it off. At first I thought, ok maybe he just wants some peace as he drives but he says ""turn it on something else!"" I said ""why, we were listening to that?"" He said ""well I don't want to"" or someone like that and starts complaining about how awful megan moroney is and how her songs are all man-bashing, etc. I said ""whoa buddy we told you that it could just be a girls night like you insisted on coming!"" So we ride home in silence and my daughter is really disappointing. One of our favorite things to do is turn the music on and sing along in the car.

1k0uoqa,AITA for cancelling on my friend after she wouldn’t pay for our lunch?," I 16F and my friend 17F (let’s call her D) have been friends for about 3 years. We are very close and hang out outside of school very frequently. We agreed to meet each other for a couple hours to study for our ap test. For context: every month my parents give me 100-200 dollars on a credit card so I can budget out what i’m going to spend for the month and D has been asking me almost every. single. day if I can get her coffee before school as I go very frequently. I’m going to be honest it does bother me that she asks all the time considering she has a bigger amount of money than me and she could easily just go get one herself before school and she never offers to pay me back. So knowing this, I asked her if she could pay for the food at our hang out since I got her about 5 coffees this month without being payed back. She agreed at first and then said she couldn’t anymore because she needs to buy a different friend a birthday present. I told her that my monthly allowance had run out and that I couldn’t go anymore. She seemed annoyed but I didn’t want to ask if she was upset or bring up that I was upset. I feel like it’s very selfish that she asks me for coffee almost every day but then won’t pay for our most likely 20 dollar meal. She also asks other people for coffee when I say no and I feel really used just because I drive to school and she has a license and a car but her dad drives her. 


UPDATE: she reluctantly agreed to pay after I told her I couldn’t go if she wasn’t paying and to answer some questions: the coffees are about 7 dollars each and I do get myself one too when I get her one and to be clear she has had my back in the past and payed for  big expensive meals once or twice when I really had no money she hasn’t been asking for the coffees for very long only about a month or so .

1k1q1zp,AITA for setting boundaries with my sister during her pregnancy?,"
Hi all,
I (19s, F) have a older sister who is pregnant with her second child. She has a 1.5-year-old son. During her first pregnancy, I supported her a lot because her husband was working full-time. I was happy to do it at the time.

This time, her husband is studying from home and is present all day. Still, she frequently asks me for help—running errands, watching her toddler after I finish work, etc. I’ve suggested they consider part-time daycare to give her a break, but she insists her son is too young and that I should help.

Recently, she told me she expects me to care for her toddler for the entire first month after the baby is born, so she and her husband can focus on the newborn. I told her I’m exhausted after work and that since her husband is home, he should be more involved.

What’s been hard is that when I do help, she often tells our mom that I’m not doing enough. Then I get scolded by our mom, which makes me feel unappreciated and guilty.

I care about my sister, but I feel like she’s assuming I’ll always be available, without considering my own limits. I’m starting to feel emotionally drained and like my efforts aren’t respected.

So, AITA for saying no and establishing limits even though she’s pregnant?",Internal_Path8845,2326,0.9700000286102296,346,1744930250,2025-04-17 17:50:50,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k1q1zp/aita_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_sister_during/,4,2025

1k3yc8d,AITA for not cleaning before guests came over because I was tired?,"I usually do a majority of chores in the house. My husband helps with laundry and sometimes vacuums, but that’s pretty much it. I usually don’t mind because things get done at my pace, if something bothers him, he cleans it, and he is generally appreciative of what I do. And if I ask for help, he will help. 

Lately he has been having friends over after work. He works second shift, so I am asleep by the time this happens. In the past, if he mentioned having people over, I would clean. 
But a couple days ago he mentioned people would be coming over and it was a couple hours before I was going to sleep. 

The last few weeks have been very stressful for me and I haven’t been cleaning as much as I usually do. I just didn’t have it in me to clean much before they came over. I was tired. I just cleaned up the dishes from dinner and took out the trash but didn’t have energy to do more. Then I went to sleep. 

I woke up and he was not in bed. I had some text messages from him saying how it was embarrassing having people over the house because it wasn’t cleaned. He says it was disrespectful to him and his friends because I knew they were coming but didn’t fully clean up. 

I talked to him about it later that day and he said the same points again. He said I had a couple hours before bed and I should’ve at least vacuumed, mopped, and picked things up. I told him I was too tired to do that and if he wants to have me do all the cleaning, then he needs to accept it will be done at my pace and depending on what time, energy, and motivation I have. I don’t mind doing it, but it’s on my schedule. That’s the price of the arrangement. 

He thinks I was being spiteful by not cleaning more and that I am being rude by my comment on our arrangement. But I just didn’t have the energy for more cleaning. 

AITA for not cleaning before bed knowing my husband would have friends over?

1k4rt8k,AITA for agreeing to help a woman beggar at the grocery store and then bailing on her?,"I was going into my local grocery store to get a few things and a woman outside stopped me and asked if I would get something for her kids. I would prefer to buy something from a store than give out money because I know exactly what it’s being used for (not drugs or alcohol) so I agreed. She insisted on  coming into the store with me. We go in and she bee-lines it to the laundry aisle and picks out the most expensive detergent (around $30-40). She tells me she needs to wash her daughter’s clothes. I reluctantly agreed and started walking her towards the check out. Then she starts saying she hasn’t washed her hair and picks out a shampoo, soap, and conditioner. Not the grocery store brand either that’s fairly cheap but the name brand stuff. It seemed like she was intentionally picking out the most expensive items in the aisle. 

I get in line and she joins me with like 7 or 8 things now in her arms probably adding up to $80-100. I froze for a minute not knowing what to do. It was a long line that day so I had a few minutes to process. Finally I just told her I was sorry and walked out with her standing in line holding the items. I walked a few streets over to a smaller grocery store and got everything I needed. 

My gut tells me she was trying to rip me off but I also felt awful thinking about the look on her face as I turned to leave and how embarrassing it must have been for her to be stood in line after that or putting the items back. The money wasn’t insignificant but it wouldn’t have been missed from my account. I would have liked to have done something nice for someone but the whole experience felt off and now I’m worried I did the exact opposite of a good deed and left someone hanging. AITA?

1k5hmpj,WIBTA for telling my boyfriend's parents I'm not his babysitter?,"I 23f have been dating my boyfriend Josh 29m for 2 years. We live together as well. Recently, his parents have started asking me to get him to do things. ""Make sure Josh to go to the dentist for his cracked tooth."" or ""Make sure Josh updates his passport."" or ""Make sure Josh changes his pet food for his cat. We don't like the brand."" Or ""Make sure Josh does his taxes. You may need to sit with him and help."" The most recent has been convincing Josh to get a new job in an entirely unrelated field because Josh's parents don't feel like he makes enough money. (Josh makes 70k, I make 110k so we are doing fine.)  

Typically I respond with some variation of ""I'm fully capable Josh can figure it out himself, and if not, it will be a good learning experience for him."" but that hasn't stopped Josh's parents. Now I'm planning on being a little harsher and telling them I'm not Josh's babysitter and to leave me out of these concerns.

WIBTA for saying that? Is there anything else I should do differently?

TL;DR Boyfriend's parents want me to make sure he does normal adult tasks. I feel it is not my job.

1k5jzjb,AITA for refusing to cover my tattoos for my boyfriend’s family dinner?,"I’m (21F) a girl who has several tattoos (some big and quite visible), my boyfriend (26M) met me like that and I hadn't had any problem with it.  
He invited me to go to dinner with his family and I accepted, but he casually mentioned, “Maybe you could wear something with sleeves? Just so we don’t start any drama.” I asked what he meant, and he said his grandparents are very old-school and might not react well to my tattoos. He said he didn’t want the night to be awkward.  
I told him I wasn’t going to hide part of myself to make his family more comfortable. He said it’s not about hiding, it’s about respect. I told him respect goes both ways, and I shouldn’t have to pretend to be someone I’m not.  
He got upset and said I was overreacting and making it a bigger deal than it is. I told him that I would go to the dinner but that I wouldn't cover my tattoos. But then he asked me to please not attend, that if I was only going to be difficult, it would be better not to be there.  
That really rubbed me the wrong way and made me feel confused, because I think maybe I did behave badly and I shouldn't have reacted so vehemently against the idea. I don't want to cause drama with his family, but I have had a hard time feeling comfortable in my skin and learning to deal with the stigma people have towards me because of my tattoos... and I don't want to go back and hide again, plus I don't think I would be honest with his family either if I show myself as I am not.

1k6aqqe,AITA for sitting on a woman’s purse on the train?,"I live in a metropolitan city and the train I take home from work is crowded since everyone is also getting off work. There have been many occasions where other passengers on the train will occupy the empty seat next to them with their bag. There are people standing during the ride when there are available seats. 

I walked multiple cars to try to find an empty seat (without a bag) but couldn’t. The last car I went to I asked this woman if I could sit there and she pretended to not hear me. I didn’t want to tap her shoulder because you never know how people would react so I waved a bit to get her attention and she said she didn’t want to hold her bag (which was a no). I told her I couldn’t find any other empty seat and I had already walked the entire train and it’s leaving soon. She ignored me again. I asked if she could move her bag and she still ignored me. I ended up just sitting in the seat on her purse. 

She began yelling at me telling me I’m a b!tch and told me to move because she never said I could sit there. I told her that there was no other seat and the train was departing. She began pushing me to move and the conductor luckily came by them and told her to relax. She told him that I touched her purse and he asked if it was occupying a seat and she didn’t reply. He ended up telling her to be considerate and left to check tickets. 

When the train stop came she said she’s going to report me to the police for touching her belongings and said I’m inconsiderate for invaliding her personal space because she had a rough day at work and wanted personal space. I told her that it was still inconsiderate when many people are looking for seats. She said they should’ve been there early enough go get empty seats (this was 9 minutes before departure). 

I’m a woman for reference so it’s not like she was simply uncomfortable sitting next to a man. ",CyclingSkater,6663,0.9399999976158142,728,1745443190,2025-04-23 16:19:50,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k6aqqe/aita_for_sitting_on_a_womans_purse_on_the_train/,4,2025
1k6bxmx,AITA for snapping at my mom after she tried to force me to learn sign language?,"My (13M) mom (35F) has been dating with her now fiancé (38M) (let’s call him Jeremy) for two years. Five months ago he proposed her and they got engaged, and moved in together, and now they are planning their wedding. I am cool with this. I really like Jeremy, they were friends before they started dating, so I met and got close to him before he started dating my mom. I think he’s really cool and I am happy for my mom. 

My issue is with his annoying and arrogant son, he is only 2 years older than me but acts like he’s too cool to hang out with me. He treats me like a little kid but there’s only 2 years between us.

I will call him Dean. Dean is deaf, and has to use a device (it’s called cochlear implants) to hear. But he can’t wear his device all the time because apparently hearing can be exhausting for him. Tbh I think this is an excuse he uses to avoid hanging out with us. But that’s what he claims. 

Anyway he and Jeremy both know sign language but my mom and I don’t. My mom has started learning after she got engaged with Jeremy and she’s pressuring me to learn too but I’m refusing because i don’t want to spend my time learning a whole language for him when he clearly doesn’t even like me. 

My mom says I am being disrespectful because we now basically live semi together. (He comes to stay with Jeremy on the weekends. I live with my mom full time. So unfortunately I have to stay with Dean on weekends) 

Two days ago my mom (in front of Jeremy btw) started telling me about this great ASL tutor she found online and how she’s thinking sign me up for her classes.

1k6cvh7,AITA for leaving to have my break in another room when someone else walked into the one I was already in?,"Apologies for any grammer mistakes, writing this in a waiting room and I think im being called up next so im not really spell checking anything. 

Okay so for some context my workplace has 4 small break rooms. We're allowed to take our breaks whenever we want and because we dont have alot of employees at the moment most of the time when I take my break no one else is present in any of the rooms. 

I prefer the quiet since being yelled at by customers constantly gives me quite the headache, and im pretty introverted normally so I quite enjoy break time. The break room I prefer to use is labled as ""room A"" and its where my and a few others lockers are located. 

Okay now, I was enjoying my break as normal and my co-worker Selly walked in to grab something from their locker, shortly after their phone rang and they took the call. They were in this call for only about 2 minutes, and it didn't sound like they were gonna end it anytime soon, so I moved to break room B. This wasnt out of malice or anything, I just like my peace and quiet.  

The next day I noticed the stickynote that labled my locker was missing, I assumed it fell off, put a new one on it, and went to start my day. Break time hits and theres someone in room A so I go to room B and thats when I found my old stickynote on a random unused locker. I was confused and asked the guy that was in room A if he knew who moved it and why. He said ""Oh Selly moved it because he thought you were going to move lockers anyway."" This answer was very confusing so I went and found Selly to ask him myself if he was the one who moved it and why. 

After I asked he said ""Oh I thought you wanted a room to yourself since you so rudely left room A when I walked in for only a moment"". I told him that me leaving had nothing to do with him, and that I just liked the quiet, but his response was something like ""well now you can have all the peace and quiet you want"" and got into his car before I could respond.  

He seemed really mad, and honestly I just want to know if I really did do something wrong. I dont always catch if im being rude so maybe I really am the asshole here, thus I wrote this post to find out.

1k73ok5,AITA for taking my daughter out of school for a week for a vacation,"I (m39) have a daughter (10) “K” from my previous relationship, I also have a daughter (18 months) with my wife now. My wife is mom to K, I don't want to get into it but K’s  bio mom is not a part of her Life. 

I go on business trips for work around 3-4 times a year. In a week I'm going to Florida. My wife and I decided to make this one a trip for our family, we figured it would be perfect staying in a resort with pools and things to do for my wife and Daughter’s while I work then in the evening we can do stuff together. Of course K will have to miss a week of school, we are getting her school work for the week so she can work on it while gone. 

Yesterday I was talking on the phone with my mom. I had told her about my business trip and how I my wife and daughter’s were going. She mentioned something about K staying with her. I asked what she was talking about. She said K has to stay with her since we’ll be gone for a week. I told her no, K is coming with. She argued that she has school I told her its a trip and memories, she’ll always remember. Unlike a 4th grade spelling test. My mom got really upset with me, said It's not good to let K miss so much school. The only other time she missed school this year was 2 sick days. I don't think its smart to constantly let her miss school but going on a trip with her family and missing a little school isn't the end of the world.

1k76rc2,AITA for telling my friend that the things that happen to aren’t bad luck and they are her fault?,"I am 22f and my friend is 23f.

She quit a job she had for about a year because she had a disagreement with a colleague, she ended up reporting this colleague even though the disagreement was about the best way to complete a task. She reports every person who dares disagree with her or gives her negative criticism.

Four of her pets have died in the past year because she doesn’t look after them properly, and everyone gives her sympathy. She goes into depressive episodes because a fish died. I lose a close friend and I need support, but she cannot be there for me because her fish died.

She quit another job this week because they provided feedback for her performance, she reported the entire company and is now job hunting. I have given her hundreds of job recommendations for companies hiring, yet she doesn’t want to apply for any of them for various reasons, then complains that she doesn’t have a job.

Every single thing is about her in my friendship group. If she plans something and no one is free, then it’s because none of us want to hang out with her. If I propose a certain activity, it’s because I’m selfish. If I don’t want to go out one weekend, it’s because I think I’m better than her.

She also tries to frame every single man as being a creep, even if he has done nothing. She harassed my boyfriend at the time, yet she accused him of being a creep for staying in a hotel with me. She also accused him of being a creep for worrying about what my friends thought of him, as they have a history of labelling men as creeps even if they are innocent.

She has a view that everyone is evil. She wouldn’t speak to me for a week because she found out I watched a film that starred a problematic man who was cancelled for being accused of SA, even though I did not know he had been accused of that before I watched it. She accused me of being obsessed with her when I bought the same top as her unknowingly and when I got my belly button pierced after she did.

I told her that these negative things are happening to her, not because she has bad luck or has been cursed, it’s because she doesn’t care enough about her life to even try and because she is used to the world bending over backwards for her. I said that she is the issue and she lives in a fantasy world.

I think I am the AH because I spoke to her in a very harsh and cruel way when I know she struggles with criticism and feedback. I should have been more gentle because she cried, and has not spoken to me in a week.

1k7yr8k,AITA for holding SO responsible for kid eating food meant to be shared,"SO has 2 teen boys. They're going through puberty and rapidly growing, I get it. My problem is one of them consistently - about once a week - eats ALL of something that was bought for everyone to share. Sometimes it's all in one sitting, sometimes he takes it to his room and munches over 1-2 days until it's gone before anyone notices. In the past I've never complained because he's a teen (try to be understanding) and not my kid....

But a few days ago I get groceries including Costco size bags of tortilla chips and chocolate chips. Next day I'm looking to eat some chips and salsa, chips gone. I know what happened. Annoyed but don't. A few hours later I go down to bake with the chocolate chips and they're gone too, an entire 48 oz bag disappeared, emptied.

SO is out to dinner so I wait until it's supposed to be over then text him simply saying all the chips and chocolate chips I bought yesterday got eaten, buy more on the way home. Which he does. But then gets home fuming for making him do it. I tell him I think his anger is misplaced because I shouldn't have even had to ask, that stuff shouldn't be gone already. He's like what do you expect me to do about it? I tell him I just expect him to be responsible for his kid's actions. Then he said he will tell the teens not to touch anything I buy ever again. I replied you know that's not what I'm saying, you can allow whatever behavior you want but if it's inconsiderateness you should be still responsible for making right when it affects other people. He still thinks I'm being ridiculous, that it's no big deal.

They were already older when we got married, their mom is actively involved, and SO and I agreed that I should stay out of parenting and punishment.

I'll also add that if I see this kind of stuff happening I do say something politely just being the adult, like hey how about take a bowl of chips to your room instead of the whole bag, you can always get more but somebody else might want some... or like hey before you eat that last slice of pizza maybe you should see if your brother wants it since we got it for yall to share. I just don't lecture or reprimand after the fact, because it seems to cross into more punishment territory... besides that, SO allows it and it seems to mostly just happen behind my back at this point.

Also I could not go to the store myself because we have a baby who was already asleep for the night.

1k7znn0,AITA for not inviting my nephew to my sons birthday party?,"I (35f) have a son, Cillian (14m) who just recently had a birthday. The issue stems from his birthday from last year, where we invited all his cousins and his friends to celebrate him. The party went great for the first half, but when it came time to cut the cake I went over to fridge to go get it and saw it was half eaten. I was obviously upset about this because this had been a cake that I had made by a professional baker that cost me around $140 and my son really loved the design.

I asked who ate the cake and my sister (44f) laughed it off when her son, Robbie, (16m) told her that he ate the cake because he was hungry. To be clear the cake wasn’t the only food at the party, throughout the party we served many different dishes such as wings, veggie platters, pizzas, chips, and sodas. I was obviously angry that my son couldn’t have his cake and had to quickly go out and by one from Walmart. I’m honestly still shocked that with all the food at the party Robbie still managed to clear half of a huge cake, it was enough to produce about 20 slices.

I called my sister later to tell her I wasn’t happy with what her son had done and since I had spent so much money on the cake I expected it back. She then accused me of being fat phobic which absolutely is not true, I have never once discriminated against Robbie at any time, this was just a false accusation. To explain, Robbie has a weight problem and has been having issues with binging since he was around 13 which is why he is about 250 pounds and my sister has never failed to let anyone know of that and expects for everyone to bend over backwards for Robbie since he has it hard. 

This year Cillian wanted to have a friends only party with the exception of 2 cousins, one that only his friends and closest cousins could come to since he hated his party from last year. I asked why and he explained to me that he was embarrassed of Robbie since all he did was poke fun at his friends and him, bring his own uninvited plus one, and obviously he ate some of the cake. 

I complied and only invited his friends and allowed 2 of his cousins to join as well. Luckily some of my siblings were understanding, the only one who had an issue with this was my sister. She called me to ask why Robbie wasn’t invited and I explained to her that Cillian doesn’t want him there because of what he did last year, my sister was infuriated and said she knew we had an issue with her sons weight.

I explained to her that there were vegan and gluten free options and we could let the restaurant know of her allergies so everything would be fine. She refused saying it doesn’t make a difference and told me if I don’t pick a different restaurant she wouldn’t attend and hung up.


This has happened in the past as well, whenever I want to go out to a restaurant whether it’s for an event or a birthday she has an issue with it and has been doing this since I was younger. I remember when I turned 16 she told my parents that I had picked a restaurant she couldn’t eat at. Because of this my parents let her pick where we went for my birthday and she picked one of my least favourite restaurants and I had no fun. 

To be honest, I don’t really care if she attends or not so I texted her and let her know that I wouldn’t be changing the restaurant. Because of this shes been going absolutely feral and texting others to not attend because I’m being inconsiderate. I’ve been asked if maybe I can change the restaurant for her preferences but I denied.

1k9g8wn,AITA for not taking down my yard flamingos after neighbors complained?,"I bought a house a couple years ago and I have been working on making it look nicer. I spent a lot of time redoing the front gardens, trying to make it neat and nice. 

I a few weeks ago was at a greenhouse buying some plants for the garden and I saw two yard flamingos marked down on clearance. I knew they belonged in my garden. They’re not everyone’s cup of tea, but I think they’re a lot of fun. 

I set them up when I got home and a couple days later my neighbor was knocking on my door. She was demanding I take down my flamingos because they’re “extremely gauche” and “lowering the property value of the neighborhood”. I told her I am not taking them down because I like them, and the property value isn’t going to be hurt by two yard flamingos. I also don’t live in an HOA and as far as I am aware, there are no town ordinances about yard flamingos lol

She has posted pictures of my house, the street I live on, and a close up of my flamingos in our towns Facebook group to complain about them. Some people agreed I should take them down. After that, another neighbor came over to tell me to get rid of them. My mom also agreed I should take them down to keep the peace with my neighbor. 

I like them, I smile when I see them when I pull into my driveway. I have no plans to take them down.

1k9gy15,AITA for not eating the birthday cake my boyfriend got me?,"  Alright so my birthday was a couple days ago and I asked my boyfriend like a week before to get me a carrot cake. While I know its not a popular choice for a birthday cake, it's my favourite and practically the only flavour of cake I like (besides red velvet but I wasnt feeling it tbh.) Keeping in mind that I was gonna have a birthday party with my friends, my boyfriend suggested that I get a ""flavour that people like"", which I'd understand maybe if it was a huge party with tons of people, but I know my friends and I know they wouldn't  mind carrot cake at all. 

  Anyways fast forward to my birthday, my boyfriend goes and gets the cake from the shop in the afternoon and I dont get to see it since im getting ready, but he doesn't mention anything to me about it, so i think nothing of it since i like a surprise. My friends arrive and everything's going great until its time for the cake to be served. We gather around the table and everyone sings happy birthday while my boyfriend brings out the cake, and to my horror, i see this big chocolate cake in his hands. I hate chocolate cake. It makes me sick. He KNOWS I hate chocolate cake. 

  My face fell when I saw it but I obvs didnt say anything at the time. However, I did give my bf a glare or two, which he clearly picked up on since he kept insisting I eat the cake infront of everyone as we were serving it out. Something about that made me angry in the moment and I refused to try the cake at all. I cut it, i blew out the candles, I handed it out to eberyone, but i didn't try it myself. 

  I dont think the others took huge notice but once the party ended i started getting unready when my boyfriend comes into our room and is lile ""why do you have to act like a child all the time??"" And im like what the hell and hes like ""you have to make a scene just cos i didn't get your fucking carrot cake"" and he went on about how nobody likes carrot cake and how im spoiled and selfish and looked stupid not eating cake at my own birthday and then claimed he couldnt find carrot cake which is crazy cos 1. Ive never not gone to that shop and NOT seen carrot cake, and 2. even if there wasnt any he coulda picked ANY other flavour, besides the only one I hate. 

 I told him that and he just got really upset like I was the one who started the fight and started going on abt how I was overreacting over cake and how he tried his best to make this bday good for me (which in fairness is true since he put a lot of effort into organising it for me) but honestly I was just livid then. Now we're still kinda off about it and neither of us have lile apologised or anything but im starting to think i did overreact over cake and I probably shoulda just eaten it and then talked tochim later but idk 😭

1k9hce1,AITAH for leaving my sister’s wedding early after she wore my “revenge dress” without asking?,"hi everyone, i really need some outside perspective because i am feeling super conflicted and my family is making me feel like i am being unreasonable

for some background, i am 24f and my sister is 27f. she just got married this past weekend. i was genuinely excited for her. we have our ups and downs like any siblings but i love her and i wanted her wedding to be special. i helped her plan, went to the showers, picked out decorations, and tried to be as supportive as possible

about a year ago, i went through a really rough breakup. my ex, 25m, cheated on me in a really humiliating way. everyone else knew before i did and it crushed me. after a lot of crying and long nights with friends, they convinced me to go buy a ""revenge dress"" — something that made me feel powerful again.  
i found this black silk dress that fit me perfectly. it was not expensive but it made me feel strong. i wore it to a few events where i needed confidence. it was a symbol of healing for me, not just a piece of clothing. i kept it in a garment bag in the back of my closet

fast forward to my sister’s wedding. she had a strict dress code and asked for no black dresses because she thought it was bad luck. fair enough, her day her rules. i wore a light blue dress that was not really my style but i wanted to be respectful

during the reception, my sister did an outfit change, which she had planned.  
when she walked out, i realized immediately she was wearing my black dress.  
not a copy. not something similar. my actual revenge dress

at first i thought maybe i was crazy but then i saw the little hand-stitched seam on the side. it was mine

i pulled her aside and quietly asked her about it. she laughed and said i was being dramatic and that i was not using it. i reminded her she had asked to borrow it months ago and i had politely said no. she said she thought i would get over it and needed a second dress

i felt completely blindsided. it was not about the dress. it was what it meant to me.  
i told her quietly that i felt hurt and she rolled her eyes and said i was making her wedding about myself

i did not want to cause a scene so i told my mom i was not feeling well and left quietly before the cake cutting

now my family is saying i ruined the wedding because my sister cried after i left and that i should have just smiled through it. they are calling me selfish and dramatic

i honestly feel awful. i did not want to hurt her or ruin anything. i did not yell, make a scene, or tell any guests. i just left because i could not sit there pretending i was okay

so AITAH for leaving instead of just pretending everything was fine?

1k9i2j5,AITA for not letting my brother's girlfriend have one of my cupcakes??,"ok so like last weekend my mom threw a little family get together at our house cause it was her bday. nothing crazy, just cousins and stuff. i decided to bake cupcakes the night before (i'm not a professional baker or anything but they came out super good tbh).

anyways i made like 24 cupcakes and put them out on a tray on the counter. i specifically told everyone that they were for after dinner because my mom wanted to do a candle thing with them instead of a regular cake.

so my brother (he’s 22) shows up with his girlfriend, who nobody really knows that well cause they been dating for like 2 months? she’s nice i guess but a little pushy. like she acts like she’s already part of the family or whatever. idk.

fast forward, we're all just hanging out and i see her just straight up grabbing a cupcake off the tray. i go over and i’m like ""hey can you pls wait till after dinner? my mom wants to do candles with them"" and she kinda just stares at me like im crazy and goes “it’s just one.”

i said ""yeah but they're for later"" and she literally rolled her eyes at me and put it back... after taking a BITE. so now that one’s ruined obviously.

my brother got mad and pulled me aside later saying i was rude and made her feel unwelcome and ""it’s not a big deal"" but like?? it wasnt just about the cupcake, it was about the whole plan.

my mom said i didn’t do anything wrong but some of my cousins said i shoulda just let it go cause ""family first"" and now my brother’s still being weird with me.

so idk. AITA??",Electronic_Deal_4513,3026,0.9700000286102296,307,1745797959,2025-04-27 18:52:39,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k9i2j5/aita_for_not_letting_my_brothers_girlfriend_have/,4,2025
1kb0w6d,AITAH for telling my grandma she can’t wear blue at my wedding?,"PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE THING!

My (24F) fiance (25M) are getting married in June and we’ve invited our families, obviously. The colors we chose are light blue, tan, and navy blue. For a little bit of context, my parents went through a horrible divorce when I was 13. My dad’s mom (the grandma I’m talking about) was VERY hateful to my mom and just outright disrespectful to her so I’m not her biggest fan. She’s always gone against the rules and done whatever she’s wanted to with no repercussions. She enables my dad who is an addict and she knows it’s wrong (not important but just trying to set the scene). It’s a little awkward going to family gatherings on my dad’s side because I feel like the black sheep of the family. My sister (33F) is my half sister on my dad’s side, we’ve become closer through the years. 
My grandma called me about 2pm today and we talked about wedding stuff and she asked me what I wanted her to wear. I told her I wasn’t picky, just no white and no light blue. 

Later today, my sister and my grandma went to JCPenny to shop. My sister found a dress she loved, it’s also important to note my sister is a bridesmaid in my wedding. They are wearing light blue. My grandma sees the dress and loves it as well saying it would be perfect for the wedding. However, she meant for herself. Not for my sister. My grandma bought a light blue (almost white) dress to wear to our wedding. My sister told me about it, as she thought my grandma had bought the dress for her and didn’t realize that she bought it for herself (my sister is not the brightest bulb in the box), and my grandma picked the dress when my sister walked away from it because it was too expensive for her to buy for herself. I know this is my grandma, it’s not that deep, but it does upset me she chose a color I specifically asked her to not wear as my wedding party is wearing that color. Since she has a habit of going against the rules and wearing whatever she wants, this doesn’t surprise me. We have recently thought she has been having some memory problems, but I’m not sure. I haven’t confronted her yet but I plan to. I just don’t know if I’m being an asshole by confronting her. TIA!

1kb1xx9,AITA for wearing underwear to sleep,"For contexts I am a male who lives with my parents and siblings. I live in the southern part of the US and it is starting to get hot again and as a result I’ve started to go to sleep only wearing a pair of boxers. I’ve done this for most of my life and have never had a problem until this morning. The reason why I might be the asshole is because today my brother and his girlfriend walked into my room with zero warning to wake me up. I don’t know what he expected to see and why he would bring his girlfriend in the room too but I woke up to them walking in and like any other healthy dude I was rock hard. I realized and immediately tried to cover up but the damage was already done. My brother turned his girl around and told her to go wait downstairs. He then proceeds to get mad at me for being hard. I tried to tell him that it’s normal and he should have expected me to not be wearing much since it’s a normal thing for me and my other brothers to wear as little as possible when sleeping but he would not calm down. So now I’m being forced to wear pants while I sleep because he told my dad and he agrees with my brother. I personally don’t even think it’s much of a problem.

1kbt483,AITA for winning my mom’s storage unit at auction instead of giving her the money to save it herself?,"I (24F) was in and out of the foster care system. My mom would lose custody of me and my three siblings, only to do the bare minimum to get us back, just for the cycle to repeat. I eventually aged out of foster care, went to college, and moved to another state. I still check in with my mom every week. She was diagnosed with heart failure. (which came on from other terrible decisions). I offer support when she reaches out, whether it's with money, food etc. Most of the time I don't hear back. And when I do, it's usually because she wants something. She has a long history of lying to and stealing from all of us. She's currently homeless. We have offered her a place to stay if she gets clean and she wont. After we turned 18, we reconnected with our extended family, grandparents, and cousins, and those relationships have become important to us. A couple of months ago, she called me in a panic at 2:00 in the morning. She said her storage units were about to be auctioned off, that she wasn't even behind on payments, and that the owners were trying to scam her.
She needed $1,000 immediately because there were only 15 hours left before the auction. I told her l'd check in the morning once I got to work and see what I could do. The next day, I did some digging and looked at the contents of the storage units. What was listed broke my heart: family photos, vases from great-grandparents, personal documents (birth certificates, Social Security cards, my mom's clothing and tools, and everything from my grandmother's house (she passed away just last year). I decided to bid on the unit myself and ended up spending nearly $1,200 for it. Afterward, I spoke to the owners, who told me they'd been trying to help my mom for months: discounts, payment extensions etc. But eventually, she just stopped answering them. They said they had no other option but to auction it. I was devastated. My siblings said that if I hadn't stepped in, all of those memories and important documents would've ended up in a stranger's hands. My siblings were relieved and grateful... but my mom? She accused me of violating her trust, told me l ""emotionally robbed her"" , that I stole from her, and said I was a mistake. She even claimed our grandparents would be ashamed of me. I ended up taking a few days off work, drove out of state to the unit, and went through everything. I only kept what belonged to me and my siblings-photos, documents, anything tied to our family history. I didn't throw away a single item of hers. Instead, I rented a new storage unit just down the road, moved all her belongings there, and paid three months in advance. I gave her all the info. Now I'm stuck with this heavy feeling. I can't shake the guilt, like l crossed a line or sank to her level somehow. But at the same time, I couldn't bear to see everything important to us vanish, especially knowing it would probably happen again in six months.

We split all bills 50/50 even though he earns more, I also buy her clothes, pay her swimming lessons and all the bits I notice that she needs. 
He has lived here for 2.5 years and I have lived here 5 years. I moved out of my parents when I was 17 and I worked my ass off to buy the place by myself 5 years ago. I was paying rent and saving for a mortgage at the same time, it was hard work and took dedication as I did not get any financial help.
He has asked to be added to the mortgage as he has been contributing here (monthly payments only), he says he is entitled to a share and his family have been doing research on that.
I feel hurt that they would do that, it feels like I’m not sure if I can trust him or them now. I haven’t had an easy journey to get to the security that I built for myself and I can be a bit over protective about that, especially now I have a child and inevitably I want to build her future too. 
I’m very careful not to put myself in vulnerable positions but now I feel I’m vulnerable. We have really disagreed on this, and he has moved out.
Morally I find it wrong that the father of my child, and his family would support him taking from me and his daughter. He said that would never happen, but why would they research it? And also, I’m not putting someone on the mortgage who does not have any actual investment to put down, it feels like he wants an easy ride to the property ladder.

As far as teacher salaries go we are generally paid very well, but I also happen to be an incredibly frugal person. I have some goals for the future that are very important to me, so at this point in my life. So, especially when it comes to recurring expenses, I will choose the cheapest option available almost always. I could afford to pay more, but at this point in my life that doesn’t make sense to me.

Today, parent saw me buying canned chicken, a bag of rice, and some tortillas from a dollar store.(I don’t think she would ever step foot in a dollar store, but the store is next to a pretty fancy gym.) She started making comments to me about how she knows that we’re paid well, so it’s “unprofessional” to “make myself look poor” by buying food at the dollar store. I tried to deflect with humor like I usually do just talking about how I’m a cheapskate. That didn’t seem to work.

I did have a chance to walk away, but I didn’t take it. Instead, I told her it was none of her business, and that on my free time I live whatever life I want to, and she has no say over that.

I’m making those tax dollars stretch.”

1kggjrd,AITA For telling a woman that I'm not at fault because she can't control her dog?,"Hey y'all! So, this morning I (25f) took my 6 month old lab/malinois mix puppy to the local park for a walk/training session. The way the park is set up is that there is a children's play area and a walking track that starts at the mouth of the play area and loops around the perimeter of the rest of the park (not the play area). So, on my final lap another couple with a medium mix breed dog gets out of a car and starts walking the path in the opposite way as me (so that we would meet in the middle). Once I notice them getting closer, I stepped off the path and start making my way to the parking lot, cutting through the grass because while my puppy is generally good with passing another dog no problem, I like to minimize the possibility of issues especially with us leaving. I'm still walking in the same direction I was, just about 50ft away from the path more in line with the parking lot. As we come almost parallel with this couple, their dog hits the end of its leash almost yanking the lady off her feet growling and barking and trying to get closer to us. I keep going, ignoring them and calling my puppy into a close heel to keep him from engaging with the other dog. This woman then proceeds to yell at me telling me that I'm at fault for her dog reacting and that I shouldn't be at the park cause I'm never there when they are and I'm the one causing a scene. I turn to this woman and tell her ""Don't blame me because you didn't train your dog and can't control him"". I then promptly continued and got to my car, loaded up my dog, and left, the whole time this lady is cussing me out and her dog is going even crazier. I was venting to my mom, and while she was empathetic, she told me that it was rude of me to respond instead of just continuing to walk away.

1khbnh9,AITA for not “swapping apartments” with my sister?,"I (24F) live in a 2 family home that I share with my immediate family. My sister and her girlfriend (both 26F) live upstairs (3bed, 1bath) with our dad, while I share the downstairs (2bed, 1bath) with our mom. Recently, my sister moved her friend A (26ishF) into the guest room upstairs along with her cat after A escaped a bad relationship. Our mother (L) has been in Arizona tending to her very elderly father for about 6 months now, so I live alone downstairs. L is a bit of a hoarder and while she’s in AZ I’ve been slowly clearing out the apartment to make it functional again. I’ve spend many hours and a fair bit of my own money to accomplish this. Due to A and her cat moving in, upstairs now has 4 people and 4 animals (3 cats belong to A and my sister, and dad’s dog). 

This past weekend my sister approached me about swapping apartments for an undetermined amount of time, which I (stupidly and a little bit stunned) agreed to initially. I eventually retracted my agreement and decided I didn’t want to swap. There would be a lot of moving around and and my sister’s girlfriend (N) and L don’t get along due to mom’s generally shitty parenting in my sister and i’s childhood and N being kind of awful. After some snarky back and forth between my sister and I typical of our not great relationship, I pointed out it was a bit unfair that my sister moved in two of the people and three of the animals and is now complaining it’s cramped and trying to move into mom and I’s apartment despite all the work I’ve put in. She called me selfish, which I guess is kind of fair, so I figured I’d get some outside perspective.

I’m usually in bed by 10 because I have a long commute and a manager who micromanages everything I do.

This past weekend, my friend “Lena” (24F) invited me out with a few people for drinks and dancing. I said I’d come for a bit but couldn’t stay out super late since I had to be up early Monday for a project deadline.

Around 1:30am, I was home and already in bed when Lena texted me saying she’d missed her last train and asked if she could crash at mine. She lives in the suburbs and would’ve had to wait until 5:30am for the next train. I didn’t respond immediately because I was half-asleep and honestly didn't want to deal with someone stumbling in at 2am, making noise, and crashing on my tiny couch. I just let the text sit and went back to sleep.

The next day she sent a passive-aggressive message like: “Thanks for the help last night. Good to know where we stand lol.”

1kivn3t,AITA bf doesn't pay rent or do chores but is upset he can't decorate my home,"i (25f) and my bf (24m) just moved in together this year in february. we have been together for 3 and a half years. i paid a full years worth of rent up front for a trailer, and he is staying with me. he pays for some groceries very sparsely, and does not do any chores or household tasks/upkeep i ask him to do without constant reminders or becoming instantly defensive. at this point, he has started growing 4 small plants in the living room. it started as just a little project i could appreciate him engaging in, bc of the joy it brings him, but very quickly in two weeks spiraled into him demanding to have a practical green house and literal separate biome for these four baby plants. 

i am very put off by this, because there isn't a lot of space already, and on top of that, i don't feel like he does enough around the house to have a say in the decor, especially something so drastic (ie. running a humidifier constantly which can create mold in enclosed spaces, blockading my favorite window in the house with his grow lights etc.) he doesn't pay rent, hardly does chores without an argument, never cleans up after himself or the messes he makes, and the only thing he pays for has been the electricity bill (twice now) and two months of internet. that is it. 

tide pods, toilet paper, the bed we sleep on, furniture, shampoo, conditioner, hand soap- everything else in this home including the home itself i am paying for or have paid for and continue to pay for. every daily task/chore and weekly chore i do myself, since he puts them off for as long as he can. taking out trash, doing dishes, wiping surfaces, sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, laundry (including HIS CLOTHES TOO), cleaning his cat's litter box, replacing his cat's water, etc. AITA for feeling like he isn't deserving of completely changing the decor in the house whenever it suits him since he doesn't contribute to the home whatsoever?

1kjkog3,WIBTA for wearing deodorant even though someone may be allergic?,"Throwaway account for privacy reasons. 

So, at the beginning of the second semester, we got a new teacher. This teacher said she had scent sensitivity and couldn't be around any perfume or fragrances. 


The people in my family have scent sensitives, so all my deodorant, soaps are unscented. 

I have continued wearing this deodorant for months, and I sit in the front of the class. This teacher has never seemed to react. 

Also, some of my friends put on scent products in the morning, and she never react, even though you can clearly smell it. 

Yesterday, I had Gym class and it ran over. I had to change into my school uniform and had no time to apply the deodorant. The bell rang and I was late for class. 

I reapplied the deodorant in the bathroom and went to class. However, I forgot to zip up my backpack. When I was in class, the deodorant fell out, and the teacher saw the deodorant. She asked if it was sent, and I said no. She then yelled at me, saying she was having an allergic reaction. 

But here's the thing. She didn't look like it. Her breathing didn't change, no watery eyes, stuffy nose, anything. And she just taught the class like normal.  

I felt bad and emailed her about what deodorant she didn't react so I could buy it, but got a response saying that was inappropriate. 

Part of me thinks she is faking. So, would I be the asshole if I just countinued wearing it.

It’s not a normal blender. It’s industrial strength. It's the kind of thing you’d use to puree cement.

She uses it *every single morning* at 6:00 a.m. to make a “power smoothie.” I have asked — politely, repeatedly — if she could maybe wait until like 8 a.m.? Or just make it the night before and keep it in the fridge?

She says (verbatim), “I have sensory needs and blending calms me.” She calls it her *emotional support blender*. She even named it. (**Gary.**) She says Gary helps her feel “in control of the chaos.”

I work night shifts and usually don’t get to bed until 3:00 a.m., so this means I'm getting jarred awake by a jet engine three hours into my sleep. Every. Day. Thanks Gary.

Last week, I lost it. I came out of my room, and said, “Tina, either Gary goes or I do.”

She cried. Legit tears. She said I was “ableist,” “cold,” and “don’t respect her coping mechanisms.” I feel bad now. Like, I *get* that people have mental health needs, but does it have to involve pulverizing frozen bananas at sunrise?

1klzbca,AITA for grounding my stepdaughter for selling my formal dress?,"I 37F have a stepdaughter, Amy, 16F. Amy was looking for formal dresses, and I mentioned that I have my old formal dresses. She picked my old prom dress to wear, and she has kept it in her wardrobe since wearing it at prom. I don't fit in my old dresses anymore, and I kept them and some other clothes to hand down to my kids, however, I have two sons who aren't interested. Since my nieces, 15F and 13F are interested in my clothes, I planned to give them the rest once they were old enough to fit them.

  
Amy left her earbuds in her sweatpants pocket and turned on the washing machine. When she asked for new ones, me and her dad told her to save up to buy new ones (she works part time) as she wanted an expensive brand new pair and not the wired earphones I had offered. 

  
Amy went to stay with her mom, and when she got back, she had the new earbuds she wanted, so I asked if her mom had bought them for her, and she said she had resold my dress on a second-hand site and bought herself the earphones. The dress is 100% silk, one of a kind, and the brand doesn't exist anymore. I was really upset to hear she had sold my dress, without even asking.

  
I confiscated her earbuds and told her I would give them back when she repaid me the cost of what she sold the dress for.

Over Christmas, Mila was at Leo's, where she got him to promise that if she still wanted to pierce her ears after her birthday, he would take her to get her ears pierced. When he dropped off Mila, she excitedly told me that her dad had finally agreed.

I told her that it was not fair of him to throw me under the bus or to back out, as he had promised her she could, and that I had agreed years ago she could, and it was now his problem to talk to her about it. 

Mila told me she had planned to go after school this week while she was with me, and I didn't tell Leo. Leo saw Mila's new piercings and blew up my phone that I didn't stop her or tell him, and I replied that it was important for him to show her that he would follow up on promises.

1km0znf,AITA for refusing to give up my life insurance payout and asking my ex’s family to refinance the car he left me?,"So my ex passed away recently in a work-related accident. It’s sad, of course. I have a lot of mixed emotions about it. But the truth is, we hadn’t been together in over a year when it happened. We were together for five years, and we broke up because he cheated on me and got someone else pregnant. That breakup wrecked me. It took me a long time to recover. I haven’t seen him since.

After the breakup, I went no contact. I’ve spent the past year healing, learning to be happy again, and moving on. I didn’t go to the funeral. I didn’t want to see the baby mama or his family. And while I’m not happy he’s gone, I can’t say I’m devastated anymore either. I grieved this person when I left the relationship.

Now here’s where things get complicated.

Six months after our breakup, and **after**   the baby was born, he took out a life insurance policy. In it, he named me as the 50% beneficiary. His mom and the baby mama each got 25%. I didn’t know this until the insurance company called me. I assumed it was some paperwork leftover from when we were together. But nope this was a new policy, dated well *after* the breakup. That means this was his decision.

At the same time, there’s a car. He financed it while we were still together, but it’s under *my name and credit.* I begged him for **over a year** to refinance it, to the point the only reason I ever contacted him was for the refinancing of that car. He never refinanced that car, I doubt he was ever going to. Now that he’s gone, it’s still tied to me. The car is sitting in my garage, and his family has reached out saying the baby mama needs it for work. I told them, fine. You can have it as soon as it’s refinanced and no longer on *my credit.* I will **GLADLY** sign whatever paper they need. But I am not going to risk my credit on people I don’t trust to make payments.

And now they’re demanding that I give up the life insurance payout too. That I should “do the right thing” and give it to his mom or the baby mama. But here’s the thing, *I didn’t ask for any of this.* I didn’t ask to be put on that policy. He made that choice, after everything that happened between us.

Honestly?

I feel like I *earned* that money. I spent five years with that man. Five years dealing with the stress, the gaslighting, the emotional pain, the betrayal. I loved him deeply and I lost so much trying to make that relationship work. I stayed with him until *I found out* his baby mama was pregnant, because he was *actively hiding it from me* at that time. I was with him through the worst parts of his life. If anything, this money feels like the only thing I ever got back from all the bullshit. He chose to leave it to me. Probably because deep down, he knew how badly he treated me.

1kmru7h,AITA for not letting my husband with $13k debt have access to my credit card,"Okay so my husband (36M) and me (33M) keep getting into arguments over money, especially getting him onto my credit card as an authorised user.

I’ve got 0 credit score because I immigrated here to the U.S. and only just managed to open a line of credit. I wasn’t even able to finance a car without huge interest on it (only one bank accepted me) so I’m still without a car.

He has not been good with his credit history, racking up $13k of debt with Amex before we had met which he has yet to pay off. 

I suggested to him he should see if he can improve it with a credit builder loan but I am not comfortable with him being on my credit card or having my CC details in his phone. He responds with saying married couples should be sharing assets and building credit together? 

Is it a given that spouses should have shared credit? Because I’m trying to establish my own credit history I cannot risk a bad credit score if he racks up debt without the means of paying it off. At the same time I feel guilty because he did support me when I wasn’t able to work before I got employment authorisation. 

Am I the asshole here for protecting my own interests? 

UPDATE: Thanks everyone! I really needed this vote of confidence and encouragement to stand my ground on this. I feel less guilty for putting my foot down with him. Going to see if I can put a freeze on my credit report this week and see if we can get him onto a personal finance course.

1kmu395,"AITA for telling my mom ""You lost two kids, do you want to lose another?"" when she treatened to kick me out?","Prefacing this with the fact that there is a lot of abuse and history I can't cram into a Reddit post.

My mom (50F) has always had problems with substance abuse, as well as untreated mental illness. After a few times of her getting drunk, one of which ended in a hospital visit, she vowed not to buy alcohol for herself. Her mental illness has led to the abuse, mostly mental, of me (20F) and my sister (17F).

The night of Mother's Day, my mom started drinking. She got inebriated. Every time she is drunk, it is a traumatic trigger for me. She lied to me and said she had two shots. Later she seemed more drunk, so I checked the trash and found ten shot bottles. I confronted her again and said that I wanted better for her and that she agreed to not have alcohol. She began to vent (she vents to me without my consent often) and scream to me about the loss of my siblings, which I did not know that was why she was drinking. This argument got heated, so I decided to go on a drive. Contacted my partner (19M) who offered to let me stay the night at his place. I accepted and went home to grab my things. My mother confronted me again. I said I was going to my partner’s house, and she threatened to kick me out of her home. She has done this on several occasions, then later told me that she ""never means it"" and says it ""only to instill the fear of god in me.""

When I came home, we had a discussion that I thought would fix things a little. I said it would be good for us to keep the alcohol out of the house and I could help find resources for therapy for her. She agreed to the alcohol, but declined therapy sternly. I also asked not to be threatened with homelessness which she did not seem receptive to.

Went to work the next day and came home. She begins an argument with me and states that ""if I wanted to not be homeless so bad, why doesn't she leave me the house and take my sister with her."" I asked if she would give me enough time to get a better job. She said ""I don't know."" I told her if she would leave me high and dry without that, which would be the same as being homeless, she would be throwing away the future she wanted for me (i would have to drop out of college to work) and i would go no-contact. She did not have remorse, and things got very heated until I said ""You lost two kids, do you want to lose another?"" in reference to going no-contact with her. I don't know if she interpreted it as that or taking my own life. She was, for lack of a better word, flabbergasted. I said ""I didn't want to pluck at your heartstrings but maybe that's what I need to get my point across."" She said ""that wasn't a pluck, that was a fatal blow.""

I have since apologized for what I said over text as I haven't been home as of the time of posting this.

I have a backup plan. I might be too jaded to tell if was I really disrespectful or rightfully standing up for my wellbeing.

1knjmh3,AITA for not inviting my brother’s fiancée to my wedding after she didn’t invite me to hers?,"So this has been bugging me for a while and now it's turning into family drama, so I need an outside perspective.

I’m (29F) getting married this fall. My brother (31M) is also recently engaged to his fiancée, let’s call her Lisa (28F). We’ve always been friendly, not super close or anything, but there was never any bad blood between us. At least, I didn’t think so.

Anyway, a few months back, they started sending out wedding invites. I didn’t get one. I waited a bit, thinking maybe it was a mistake or that mine was just late, but then I asked my brother about it — kind of awkwardly — and he straight-up told me Lisa didn’t want me there. When I asked why, he said she felt like I “draw too much attention” and she didn’t want “any distractions” on her big day.

That really hurt. I wasn’t planning to wear white or break into a choreographed dance or anything ridiculous. I just… show up, be supportive, enjoy the day. It felt like she saw me as some kind of threat, which honestly blindsided me.

Worse, my brother didn’t really stand up for me. He just said, “It’s her day, I want to support her,” and that was kind of that. I didn’t go. I tried to let it go even though it really stung.

Fast forward to now — my wedding is coming up and I decided not to invite Lisa. I invited my brother (just him), figuring I could at least try to maintain that relationship. But now he’s upset. He called and said I’m being petty and punishing him for something that wasn’t really his doing. I told him I just don’t feel comfortable having someone at my wedding who clearly didn’t want me at hers — it’s not about revenge, it’s about protecting my peace on my own day.

He said he won’t come without her and now our parents are getting involved. My mom thinks I did the right thing by setting a boundary, my dad says I should just invite her and not make it a bigger deal.

1kp4ekd,"AITA for giving my daughter $60 a week, but my son nothing?","I (45F) have two kids, 17F and 15M. We moved earlier this year to be closer to my parents as my parents health is declining. My daughter was excited about the move, but my son has struggled to adjust.

Due to the move, my job shifted to hybrid, and I needed a work-from-home setup. My bedroom is too small, and the only options were the lounge or one of the kids’ rooms during school hours. I proposed this to them - my son flat-out refused (“no way in hell”), but my daughter offered her room and half-joked about charging me rent for the space.

I thought it was fair, as I get a $20/day work-from-home allowance. I agreed to give it to her if she was okay with me setting up a small office in her room. I work from 8:30 to 5:00, and she usually starts homework right after I finish, so it’s worked out well.

Now the issue: my son is pissed that his sister is getting $60. I don’t do regular allowances, just canteen money (about $10/week) and other needs as they come up. I told him he had the same opportunity and was now shit out of luck. He got angry and brought up the move, saying he never gets to see his friends. (For the record, I drive them back to visit every two weeks for visits) I told him I understood his feelings but said I wouldn’t tolerate being spoken to like shit. He then started an argument with his sister too - going in on her for being an opportunistic bitch and she called him a whiny little asshole.

To cool off, I offered one of them the option to stay at their grandparents for the night - not as a punishment but to break the tension. My son opted to go & while dropping him off, my mom told me I was favoring my daughter and should be paying them equally. My dad disagreed, saying my son had the chance and was shit out of luck.

AITA?

1kp5ed0,AITA for accusing my wife of using weaponized incompetence to get out of doing things she'd rather I do for her.,"The wife has been going to see a life coach and she a few months ago came back with the term ""weaponized incompetence"" which basically means a husband is intentionally failing to do a task he doesn't want to do, so that the wife will just do it herself to get out of helping out. This is something she accused me of doing after she pushed some of her household duties onto me. I was simply just learning how to do things in the way she likes after not doing them since we moved in together.

Ex. I started doing dishes, I washed them, put them up and she didn't like the way they were arranged because I arranged them by what we used the most, whereas she did it by height. ""Weaponized Incompetence"".

So recently, after a package was stolen off our door step while I was out of town, I started reviewing our front of house cameras and I saw my wife removing the doors off her jeep while preparing to take our sons to the beach. This is strange because until that moment, I had thought she couldn't do it herself as it's too heavy and/or complicated for her to do it herself. So I always did it for her. Not really an issue, I don't mind doing it for her, and I had just assumed she figured it out by herself since I wasn't there.

This Friday we decided to go for a nature drive, and my wife said she'd get everything ready while I was at work so we could go the second I got home. I got home and the doors were still on. I ask her why she didn't take the doors off. She said ""You know that's too heavy for me to do myself, I was waiting on you"". I told her I saw the video of her doing it through the front cams.

She got flustered and I quickly realized she probably could do this the entire time but just pretended not to be able to. I called it what it is, weaponized incompetence. She got incredibly mad and accused me of not wanting to help her ever and said I had been saving this to ""deflect"" from my own shortcomings. We had a huge fight and the trip ended up getting postponed, which disappointed our sons.

I don't think I was wrong to say what I said but here we are. Am I the Asshole?",ShenBapiro34,2182,0.8999999761581421,598,1747521881,2025-05-17 17:44:41,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kp5ed0/aita_for_accusing_my_wife_of_using_weaponized/,5,2025
1kp6qgp,AITA for refusing to babysit my sister’s kids after she called me “selfish” for prioritizing my career?,"I (28F) have been working hard to build my career in graphic design. I recently landed a big freelance contract that requires a lot of late nights and focus, which I’m thrilled about since it could open major doors for me. My sister “Jen” (32F) is a single mom of two kids (6M and 4F), and I’ve always tried to help her out when I can, like watching the kids for a few hours here and there or picking them up from daycare if she’s stuck at work.
Last week, Jen asked me to babysit her kids for three full days (Friday-Sunday) because she got a last-minute invite to a friend’s bachelorette party out of town. I told her I couldn’t because I have a tight deadline for this contract, and I’d already committed to working through the weekend. She got upset and said she “really needed this break” and that I was being selfish for always putting my job first. I suggested she ask our parents or a friend, but she said I was her “best option” because the kids love me and I’m “free” (I don’t charge her, but I also don’t get paid for my time).
Things escalated when she called me the next day, saying I was “abandoning family” and that I’d “regret choosing work over her and the kids.” I got frustrated and told her I’m not her built-in babysitter and that she needs to plan better instead of guilting me. She hung up and hasn’t spoken to me since. Now my mom is saying I could’ve been more understanding since Jen’s had a rough year, but I feel like I’m allowed to prioritize my own life sometimes.

This is a multipurpose pool (family, lap, ect) and marked. 

On multiple occasions I have been bumped for various reasons (school needed the pool) but the most frustrating interruption in my workout was when a lady showed up demanding the lane I was in 20 minutes into my workout. She said it was her lane and she wanted to teach her kid to swim 

I didn't love moving but decided it wasn't the hill to die on that day. 

Flash forward to today and 10 minutes or so into my workout she shows up, kid in tow and tells me it's her lane and I need to move. 

I told her that lanes weren't assigned in that way and I want to be let alone to continue my workout. 

She didn't care for that answer and went and got staff who all acted like I'm an asshole who should've just moved 

It might seem petty but AITA really? This lady shows up and demands a lane and I'm supposed to care just cause she has a kid.

1krg6rl,AITA for refusing to engage with my dead husband's secret mistress?,"My husband passed away suddenly and violently a year ago. While cleaning out his items I uncoverd several letters from a female detailing a 10 year affair - mailed to our home that he had apparently intercepted.  We had his creamation and private family ceremony, and then one year later to the day i get a text message out of nowhere from a female claiming to be his girlfriend.  She claimed she was the love of his life, and she told me that she knew I was keeping his creemains away from her and she wanted half of them.  Which was odd as I woked witht the funeral home and organized events to bury his cremains in a private family ceremony a month after his passing.

This woman also took it upon herself to contact my inlaws (his sister and brothers) and beg them to take them into their lives, send them photos of my husband and her together and said that I was a rotten human he promised her he would leave for many years but never did.  She also contacted our 18 year old daughter and posed as a friend of her fathers, got her to meet up for coffee and started asking all sorts of personal questions about me and my relationsip and the funeral.

During her message to me she called me many names, and was very immature.  I also need to note that this woman is 60 years old - a full 15 years older than myself, and claimed that my husband and her had big plans and that i was a rotten person and she would prove it and tell my inlaws.

Am I the a-hole for telling this woman not to interfere with my family and his family and to leave my daughter alone? I have blocked her, but I'm pretty shaken up.  It feels like i have been blindsighted and am not allowed to move forward in my life, and how have to defend my marriage and myself to a stranger.

My parents (both 46) got divorced 6 years ago. My mom remarried 3 years ago, and my dad has had a few girlfriends. His current girlfriend is the only one he has ever brought around. My mom has met her and likes her, and my sister idolizes her. She's nice and I don't dislike her. 

The actual problem: she's 27, exactly 10 years older than me. To me, it's so weird. I dont understand why my dad wants to date someone so much younger than him. When he asked my sister and I if we were okay with him asking her to marry him, my sister was excited. I wasn't. I told him i wasn't comfortable with the age gap and thought she was just a sugar baby. Dad explained she has her own career, but said okay. 

Since that conversation, my dad has been really sad, and the atmosphere in his house has changed. His girlfriend hasn't been by as frequently either. I feel kind of bad because I want my dad to be happy. Aita?

1ksaj9r,AITA for refusing to babysit my sister’s “miracle baby” after she refused to help me when I had a miscarriage?,"A year ago, I had a miscarriage after trying for a baby with my husband for 3 years. It was devastating. My sister (32F), who never wanted kids, announced she was pregnant two months later — a “miracle baby” after a one-night stand.

I congratulated her, but emotionally, I was still raw. I asked her not to talk about baby stuff constantly around me while I healed. She said I was being selfish and needed to “get over it.”

Fast forward — she had the baby, and now she’s constantly asking me (29F) to babysit. I declined gently at first, but recently I said I don’t feel emotionally ready to watch her child — the one she had after dismissing my grief.

She blew up, called me heartless, and said I’m punishing an innocent baby. My mom says I need to “be the bigger person” and “stop living in the past.” But I think I’m allowed to have boundaries.

Things are good between us, but I’m naturally very introverted and need alone time to recharge — especially after a stressful semester at university.

My parents invited me to join a short family vacation (5 days at a lake house), and I was really looking forward to just relaxing, reading, and spending time with them. When I mentioned the trip to my boyfriend, he immediately assumed he was invited too and said something like, “Awesome, I could really use that break too.”

I awkwardly told him that it was meant to be a small family trip and that I wanted some solo downtime without needing to “host” or be social all the time. He seemed surprised but didn’t say much then.

Now, days later, he’s clearly distant. He hasn’t brought it up directly, but he’s been short with me and mentioned feeling “excluded.” A mutual friend told me he thinks it’s weird I wouldn’t want him there, and now I’m wondering if I was selfish.

I just wanted a quiet trip, not relationship drama.

While I loved the presentation my boyfriend did, and the topic was really funny and he loved getting to share it with the group, other members of our group clearly put a lot more effort into theirs.
I told him it was a tough call but I didn’t want to be biased.

1ktw147,UPDATE - AIAT For Refusing To Pay My Cat-Sitter?,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kndv4r/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_catsitter/)

I have been incredibly busy with handling my job (apparently three people were fired in my absence) and caring for Daisy since making my original post, but I've read many of the comments and understand that many people have questions and want an update, so I'm taking my first real free moment since coming back from my vacation to fill you all in on what's been happening.

I took Daisy to the vet the day after making my original post due to the scratches I found on her. Like I mentioned in comments, they were 2-3 inches in length and had dried blood on them. The vet's opinion was that they were decently deep and likely infected, which was later confirmed and Daisy was prescribed meds to deal with that. She's much better now and seems to be back to near-perfect health, but there will be subsequent visits to determine if she has any other issues (such as FIV, which can't be accurately tested for so soon).

My vet was kind enough to give me quote for the future visits I have scheduled, which I presented along with the bill from this visit to Ava and her parents (who ended up getting involved as well, but were much less aggressive than Ava or BIL). The current bill by itself exceeds what we had agreed to pay Ava. Ava tried to push back more, which I ignored, and then her parents reached out to me. The four of us (me, Ava, her mom and her dad) met up, and Ava's parents immediately brought up small claims court and asked that I please not drag them and their daughter through the system over a vet bill. Just to be clear, I **never** threatened to do so. The only time court came up was when BIL brought it up to me (and I'm assuming Ava as well) and I insisted that I didn't want to make this a legal matter. I told Ava's parents the same, that I was not seeking legal action, and was happy to consider us square. The only other thing I wanted was for Ava to apologize for endangering Daisy. She didn't seem happy, but she said sorry, and that was that.

I'm glad my cat is safe and healthy and I'm glad the drama is over. Safe to say I wont be planning any more trips away until my regular sitter is available again.

There are a few other questions I noticed in the comments that I'd like to answer, they will be in a comment I post below.

1kul2is,AITA for bringing my neighbors packages inside my apartment because I was worried they’d get stolen?,"I (28F) live in a mid-rise apartment building in the city. We don’t have a front desk or package lockers—just a narrow hallway where all deliveries get dumped. If you’re not home within a few hours, good luck.

My across-the-hall neighbor, Marcus (30s? late 20s? I honestly don’t know), gets a lot of packages. Fancy ones too—clothing boxes with brand names, curated subscription kits, expensive-looking stuff. I'm not trying to spy or anything, but when you live in close quarters, you notice these things. I’d occasionally see boxes just sitting out overnight while he was clearly out of town, which made me anxious on his behalf.

About six weeks ago, I heard him swearing in the hall and went out to see what was wrong. He said one of his packages—some cologne he’d ordered—got stolen. He looked genuinely upset and mentioned it wasn’t the first time. I said something like, “Man, this building really needs lockers or something.” He nodded but didn’t push it.

So after that, I started bringing his deliveries inside my apartment whenever I noticed they’d been sitting for more than a few hours. Just to be safe. I stacked them in a corner near my front door and gave them back when I saw him. Usually, he just said thanks and took them. No big conversation.

Then last week, he knocked and asked me to stop.

He wasn’t rude about it, but he looked super uncomfortable. He said he appreciated the intention, but it made him uneasy to know his stuff was in someone else’s apartment. He added that it felt like I was “tracking his movements” since I always seemed to know when he wasn’t home.

I was kind of stunned. I explained that I was just trying to help—that I wasn’t snooping, I just saw stuff piling up. He said, “I get it, but... yeah, it crosses a line. Please don’t touch my packages anymore.”

I said okay, and he left. But now I feel weird. I genuinely thought I was doing a good deed. I wasn’t opening his stuff, just holding it for a few hours until he got back. It’s not like I was rifling through his mail.

But then it got more awkward. A few days ago I saw him through his peephole (yes, I was walking to my door, not lurking lol), and he literally waited until I went back inside before he came out to grab his box. Like he’s timing it now?

Then this morning, I overheard him talking to another neighbor while checking his mail. He said something like, “Yeah, some people think doing favors means ignoring boundaries.” I don’t know he meant me, but… it felt pointed.

Now I’m second-guessing everything. I told my sister and she said it was “weirdly possessive” and that I should’ve just left a note asking if he wanted help next time. But I never thought it would turn into this.

So... AITA for taking matters into my own hands when I thought I was doing something neighborly?

Would love honest thoughts because now I feel like I’m the hallway psycho.",dunkdeboffin1,1027,0.9100000262260436,610,1748118629,2025-05-24 15:30:29,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kul2is/aita_for_bringing_my_neighbors_packages_inside_my/,5,2025
1kunvna,AITA for refusing to give a reward after two kids returned my opened mail with money inside?,"I'm 27F but I am pretty petite and could easily pass for like a high schooler. So I am home alone at my parent's place dog sitting and I get back from walking the dog and as soon as I close the door and lock it, I hear the ring cam doorbell go off and knocking and I can see through their Alexa that it's two kids. Probably middle school aged. They have a bike and scooter. I did not see them when I came back from the walk, so I don't know where they were waiting or where they even came from.  

They are just standing there and so I'm thinking that they are trying to sell something or another so I plan to just ignore them and focus on getting the dog resettled. Except now the dog is barking like crazy because she senses someone by the door and I can hear the kids say ""I just saw her go inside"". They then say ""we found something of yours and it has money inside"".

So they are knocking like crazy and even start kicking the door. I figure that I'll just speak to them through the ring bell so I say (without opening the door) ""Hi. Just leave it in the mailbox. I cannot open the door right now because my dog is not friendly"". Which is, true, but also like, I have no idea if this is a scheme or if there's an adult in a car waiting for them, etc. My mind is going into all sorts of scenarios that could end horribly for me. 

After them standing there for like five minutes, I can see through the cam that they put it in the mailbox and walk slowly away on their bike/scooter. About two minutes later, one of the kids comes back and puts his hood on. Rings the doorbell and I can see him put his hood on and I say ""what's up?"" through the ring cam. And he says ""My friend wants a reward"". And I say ""thank you for bringing back the mail but there is no reward, please leave"". And the kid just stands there demanding a reward. So I say ""I have your faces, if you try to threaten me, I will call the cops"". The kid then says ""call the cops I don't care! I returned your *money*. If I ever find something for your house again, I'm not returning it"". He then walks away before giving me the finger. 

I'm not looking to get these kids into any sort of trouble or anything because I think they were just being dumb fucks and they couldn't have been older than like 14/15 but AITA for not giving a reward? What they returned ended up being an opened envelope (don't know how they got it, if it was already ripped, or if they opened it) from my aunt that had a $20 bill in it (my aunt is old school like that). 

I've had my fair share of finding misplaced items/wallets and I've never once demanded or even expected a reward. My friend wanted me to post their faces on the NextDoor app and blast them but I don't know. So, AITA?

1kvd1su,"AITA for posting screenshots of my SIL's texts online and ""making her look bad""?","I (29F) and my wife (28F) had our sons six days ago, the pregnancy was complicated and they had TTTS (Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome) which resulted in them coming early. They are currently in the Neonatal Unit and my wife and I practically live there so we can spend time with our boys. 

My brother and his wife got married two days ago, I didn't want to leave my sons or my wife so I missed the wedding though I sent them their gift from us and a text wishing them a fantastic day and I thought nothing more of it. Yesterday I got a text from my new sister in law explaining that because my wife and I missed the wedding she'd need us to send her £140 for our plates of food. I asked her if she was joking and she told me that she got my wife couldn't go as she had to stay in the hospital but that I wasn't the one who gave birth so I could have went and saved two plates of food from going to waste.

I told her she was being ridiculous and asked if my brother was aware she was asking his sister for money for food, she brushed that off and said weddings were expensive and she had to try and recoup her losses and this should be between us ""woman to woman"". Between this and her thinking I should have gone anyway I admit I lost my temper. I ended up taking screenshots of the conversation and posting it to facebook.

This shocked several people in the family and she must have gotten bombarded with messages as she told me to take it down, as I was making her look bad and people were taking it out of context and thinking she was some kind of villain. My brother called me and told me not to worry about the money that it was stupid to expect us to pay for the plates though asked me to take the post down and he'd handle it.

1kw5ss6,"AITAH for exposing my sister’s financial manipulation of our elderly mom, even though it blew up the family?","My mom (72) is in the early stages of dementia. She’s still mostly clear-headed but has some confusion—especially when it comes to money. My younger sister “Chloe” (45) has always had a history of asking for financial help. Over the past few years, I noticed Mom was constantly ""lending"" Chloe money for things like car repairs, rent, or medical bills. Chloe always promised to pay her back, but she never did.

Meanwhile, Chloe’s social media told a very different story. Fancy trips, new gadgets, designer stuff… all while Mom was suddenly being super frugal. She even stopped buying things she used to enjoy. It didn’t sit right with me.

Mom asked me to help her look at her bank statements because she was confused. With her permission, I started going through them and what I found made my stomach drop. Chloe had been taking large amounts of money for years—way more than what she claimed she needed. It wasn’t help anymore, it was financial abuse.

I confronted Chloe, showed her the evidence, and she flipped. Accused me of being jealous, trying to control Mom, etc. I gathered everything and showed our other siblings and Mom’s financial advisor. It was brutal, but the truth was undeniable.

Now Chloe’s been cut off, and most of the family has distanced themselves from her. She’s livid, saying I destroyed her life and tore the family apart. Mom’s heartbroken by the conflict, which absolutely kills me. Some relatives think I should’ve handled it quietly or just let it go for the sake of Mom’s peace.

So... AITAH for bringing this all into the open and protecting Mom, even though it caused a huge family rift?",LavenderBreeze34,1321,0.9800000190734864,239,1748294183,2025-05-26 16:16:23,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kw5ss6/aitah_for_exposing_my_sisters_financial/,5,2025
1kw7k5z,AITAH for putting up a security cam that caught my neighbor's kid wrecking my yard?,"For the past month, weird stuff kept happening around my house (I’m F, 42). Gnomes knocked over, mailbox dented, flowers pulled out… just random annoying vandalism. I figured it was some local kids, but had no proof. After the 3rd time my flowers got destroyed, I’d had enough.

I set up a small cam facing my front yard. It’s on my property, not hidden or anything, just not super obvious. A couple days later, boom — caught my neighbor’s 10 y/o son yanking out my flowers and tossing them in the street. Clear as day.

I went over to their house, calm, showed the vid on my phone. I thought they’d apologize or offer to replace the plants. Nope. They lost it. Accused me of “spying” on their kid, said I was “overreacting” to a “harmless prank,” and even threatened legal action for “filming their child.”

I explained the camera’s legal, on my property, and only points at my yard. They wouldn’t hear it. It turned into a full-blown yelling match.

Now they’re telling everyone I’m some creepy neighbor who hates kids. The street’s basically split. Some are on my side, some are giving me dirty looks.

So yeah… AITAH for putting up a camera to protect my stuff?

1kw8lf9,AITA for asking a coworker not use the bathroom in my office?,"I work in a school (not as a teacher) where my designated workspace/office is a former teacher workroom. Having a traditional office wasn’t working because I was constantly having to find a larger space to do my job, so my admin moved me a few years ago. 

I love having the space, and it comes with the benefits of a printer and bathroom. I have never been a gatekeeper of the space and don’t mind when nearby staff members need to use it even though there’s another workroom a few doors down. 

I have one coworker who frequently (several times per week) uses the bathroom. Not to be crude, but the smell she leaves behind is toxic. I have put air fresheners in the bathroom and bought a bottle of poopouri, but it doesn’t help. I genuinely think she needs to see a doctor. 

We are both 12 month employees, so no summers off, and the heat has not helped with this issue. I pulled her aside last week and explained that I would appreciate if she found an alternative location to do her business. I’m fully aware that everybody poops, but that is my designated workspace, and I don’t want to have to smell it all day, especially when there are other bathrooms on campus that aren’t somebody’s office. 

She got upset and told some of our coworkers that I’m singling her out and not letting her use the bathroom. Some of them agree with me because they have smelled the aftermath, and some of them think I should have taken a different approach (asked for a different workspace/asked for more air fresheners, etc).

1kzg04r,AITA for refusing to accept the wrong drink at a restaurant nm,"Recently, my husband and I went to a restaurant with his family. My husband and I ordered their ""handmade"" margaritas. These were listed with your choice of anejo tequila with fresh sqeezed lime juice and simple syrup. However, when the margaritas arrived, they were in giant fishbowl margarita glasses (1 shot of tequila, plus lime and simple syrup cannot fill a 20 oz glass) and they were ORANGE. I immediately knew we were brought the house margaritas with the mixed sweet and sour, but I tried it anyway. It was awful. My husband shrugged and said he'd drink his, but at $20 each, I wasn't going to accept a cheap tequila with a mix. 

I called the waitress over and explained that we were given the wrong margaritas, but she insisted they were ""Handmade"". So I said, ""Ok. Well, it's not good. So you can just take it, I can't drink it. I don't want anything else, please just take it off the bill."" 

Which should have ended it, except she came back with the bartender holding the drink. He asked what was wrong, I told him what I ordered, he insisted that's what it was. So I asked, ""Then why is it orange? If it's lime and tequila and simple syrup, why is it orange?"" He looked at me, then looked at the drink and said, ""You're right. It's not the right drink. I can make you the right one and I'll remake his."" 

I said no, I didn't want a drink anymore, I just wanted it corrected on the bill to reflect the $10 margarita my husband actually received. They left, and I thought it was settled until the MANAGER came over and insisted they remake the margaritas to make it right. At this point I was annoyed and regretting not letting them remake it just to be left alone, but I also no longer even WANTED it, so I said, ""How about I just get a mezcal, neat, instead?"" That seemed to make the manager happy. But after the manager left, my husband said, ""Why didn't you just let them bring you a replacement the first time? Or just drink it when she told you it was right? You've made everyone uncomfortable.""

1kzignf,AITA for telling a clients boyfriend to leave?,"I’m a 27yo (F) and I work as a piercer in a parlour. Recently, this girl came into the shop with her boyfriend and told me that she wanted to get both of her nipples pierced. As I was helping her pick out the jewellery she wanted for her piercings, I noticed that the entire time her boyfriend was just sulking behind her. He kept asking her if she really had to get her nipples pierced and was overall just creating an extremely awkward vibe. 

When we went into the back so I could do the piercing, her boyfriend came along, which I don’t mind as many people bring someone along with them. As I was preparing everything, her boyfriend asked me If there was any way I could pierce her nipples without having to see her boobs. I told him that obviously she doesn’t have to just completely show me her boobs, but I still need to be able to see her nipples or how else would I be able to pierce her?  He then started speaking to her quietly but I could still hear what he was saying. He was saying that he wasn’t comfortable with someone who wasn’t him seeing her in that way. I didn’t understand why he was being so insecure as this is just my job? I don’t view what I’m doing as sexual, i’m just simply giving someone a piercing

And then he asked me in these exact words if i’m “into girls” and I tried to make a lighthearted joke by asking him why that mattered and he just responded by asking if i’m going to be “turned on” by seeing his girlfriends boobs. His girlfriend kept telling him to shut up and just let me do the piercings so they can get it over with. I am straight and I’m engaged to a man but why does that even matter?? Even if I was into girls that doesn’t mean i’m going to just get turned on by piercing your girlfriends nipples?? 

I politely asked him if he would mind just standing outside while i done the piercings because I didn’t appreciate the questions he was asking me as they were extremely inappropriate. He then started accusing me of wanting to be alone with his girlfriend, he also spotted the engagement ring on my finger and said he felt sorry for whoever had to marry me knowing this is my job. I kept telling him to leave, he refused and started getting loud enough that he alerted several of my coworkers who all came in to see what was happening. 

My coworkers were eventually able to get him to leave and his girlfriend decided that she would leave with him. I told her that I still had no problem doing the piercings for her but she said that she didn’t want to make the situation any worse and she apologised for the trouble and left. Afterwards my manager told me that I should have just ignored what he was saying and just done the piercings. I just felt that him asking me If i was gonna be turned on by piercing his girlfriend was extremely gross and inappropriate?? Most of my coworkers agreed that I should have just ignored what he was saying and not have made a big deal out of it but i’m honestly just so conflicted. AITA?

1kzjdfn,"AITA for continuing ""adult"" activities in front of children because they crashed my party?","I own a lakefront property and usually enjoy hosting friends and family. For example, every 4th of July I throw a big BBQ, cover all the food and drinks, and don’t mind if people bring extra guests as long as it’s respectful. My family gets it and never takes advantage. If someone brings more than one person, they’ll usually contribute something like drinks or sides.

This past Memorial Day Weekend, I planned a reunion for a close college friend visiting from abroad. It was meant to be a kid-free, adults-only weekend. Lots of drinking, with friends staying over afterwards. 

My cousin happened to ask if she could use my house and lake that weekend, and I kindly said no and suggested nearby resorts. She got annoyed, saying she’d already told her kids they were coming since I usually never say no. I explained about my party, and she didn’t reply, so I thought it ended there.

Then Saturday afternoon, she showed up with her kids anyway. I told her they couldn’t come inside, but they could hang out at the community lakefront nearby. The issue was that the kids kept trying to come in to use the bathroom, grab water, etc. My friends weren’t doing anything illegal, just drinking and having fun like adults do, but my cousin asked me to get them to tone it down because of her kids. I told her no. She wasn’t invited, and I wasn’t changing my party for uninvited guests. Plus, they were already well into drinking for the day so it’s not like I could instantly sober up 20+ adults.

Now she’s telling our family I let my friends act “inappropriately” in front of her kids. Some relatives think I should’ve paused the drinking, but others agree she was out of line for showing up uninvited. 

For what it’s worth, the kids didn’t interact with my friends and were only inside briefly (I made sure to keep an eye on them when they came in), but they could see the alcohol. Since they drove 1.5 hours, I didn’t feel right just kicking them out completely, but I also wasn’t going to let her hijack the weekend.

We both work in the same company with the same schedules sometimes even until Sunday depending on what the job demands. We have always been very open about our 50/50 roles in our home like paying bills, laundry, chores etc. And that was never an issue. I got diagnosed with a thyroid problem that forces me watch what I eat and not let my weight go up no more than 80 pounds (I'm 74p and should be less that 70p) or it could trigger an uncontrollable weight gain and other problems. We used to eat whatever we wanted and that leaded me to gain some pounds in just 2 months. We decided that for dinner, each one would cook for themselves. He is more of a high protein/carbs intake kind of guy while I can't eat like that at night or I wouldn't sleep well. So my dinners are more like a small portion of protein, a light salad and hot tea. This worked out but little by little he has been asking me to make his dinner. At first I was like hey I'm already here so why not. But that has been turning into a routine. So I end up making 2 different dishes every night. That's not the bad part. When we are dinning, he is always putting from his food on my plate and I know it tastes good. (I made it) hus excuse? I'm not eating enough and he worries. I'm thankful he does, but everything I eat too much, I wake up very tired the next day.

The only issue that I have is that Mia is kinda spoiled. She pretty much gets whatever she wants whenever. She’s usually a very sweet kid overall which is why I’m questioning if I’m being an asshole. Jackie left on a business trip last night. Before she left, I told her that I would handle making dinner, bringing Mia home from track practice, and general tidiness of the house. I would also continue to take care of my two very large Great Danes that I was given my grandmother. My family plays with and snuggles them, but they are my dogs. 

Mia’s chores were the dishes after dinner, bringing her dirty clothes to the laundry room door, and taking the trash out. It all seemed fine when Jackie left.

1l2nzr3,AITA for refusing to open my pool w/o a safety gate?,"This has been a matter of contention for three years between myself (F36) and partner (M47). He inherited his family home 3 years ago, which includes a large 20x40 foot pool with a 10’ deep end. The sliding glass door in the kitchen opens directly onto the pool area. For context, we have two kids together, age 5 & 3, and I brought three of my own into the relationship, 11, 12 & 17. 

Since we moved in, I have said the pool needs to be fenced in. The back yard itself is fenced in, so home owners insurance grants a policy. But there is no gate/fence/anything between the house and the pool. The slider also grants access to our detached garage, which holds his office, and my oldest son’s work shop. So the slider is utilized multiple times daily. Years one and two, I got child safe sliding door locks and alarms, trying to force everyone to go out the front door and around the house to access the garage. It didn’t work. Partner would still utilize the sliding door. Older kids would go out that door to access the garage. Even forcing everyone out the front door isn’t a fool safe because a younger kid can still run around the house, through the garage, or gate. 

Drownings happen fast. I get told “just watch them”. Yes, obviously. Youngest two are also in year two of swim lessons. I don’t feel comfortable without a gated pool, bottom line.

Here is my AITA? question. This summer, I’m refusing to open the pool until a six foot fence with a locking gate is installed around the entire pool. My older kids are giving me grief that I’m ruining their summer. Partner has said he doesn’t have time to install a fence, but won’t hire anyone because no one can do anything as good as he can. #sarcasm. Family is upset they can’t come swim.

The kids are usually asleep by the time she gets home, so I usually make dinner for the kids and wait until she gets home to reheat the food for her. The main issue is that she has not been cleaning the dishes. I have talked to her multiple times, but nothing has changed. She gets home, eats, and goes right to bed. She always claims she is too tired after her shift to do the dishes, and when I suggest she does them in the morning, she claims there is not enough time before she needs to get to work.

He paid me 210K and said he would get me the rest as soon as he was able. (We both put 100k down when we were married to get the house in the first place). He signed a legally binding divorce agreement. I last spoke to him in December about when I could expect the rest of my money. He told me he didn't know. He did say that he wanted me to come pick up the rest of my stuff I had in the old storage shed. I told I could get it when I got back into town after the holidays and he told me no, get it before Jan 1. I canceled my trip home to see my family just for him to take a hammer to everything and leave it in the street Christmas morning. That's when I went to my lawyer and filed contempt charges. He was already in violation of the agreement but now im suing for interest, legal and damages. His lawyer has approached mine with a settlement offer. Everything im asking for, paid in six months. He will return some things he chose to keep rather than smash. If I decline, he will have 30 days to sell the house. I don't want to make a decision in anger. He loves that house and wants to die there. I don't need to force the timeline for the money but he has dragged this process out for years (being a no show to court, ducking service, refusing to sign the papers, requesting continuances for hearings etc). Maybe he will pay me in six months and he can still keep the house but part of me wants him to finally suffer the consequences of blowing off his legal responsibilities. I want to decline the offer but I feel like that is coming from a place of hate. If I decline, would I be the asshole?",butt_muncher_10000,5926,0.9300000071525574,1118,1749159939,2025-06-05 16:45:39,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1l4blmf/wibta_if_i_turned_down_my_exs_settlement_offer/,6,2025
1l53pxa,AITA for saying no no to my friend for the art  they gave me,"So about 10 months ago, my friend gave me three little artwork pieces that they thought were really ugly and they hated. I absolutely adore them and I think they’re very pretty so I have them in my living room and so I redecorated my living room and rearranged everything so I could have these paintings in a very specific spot.

One day they were over and one of my friends that they have yet to meet until that day was over as well . My other friend who did not give me the artwork looked up the art pieces through Google lens because they also liked them and wanted to get some for themselves. 

That friend found out that the artwork that was given to me was worth $1000 per piece . And I said wow, that’s an insane price. So the friend who gave me the art pieces told me that I needed to give them back to him. And he started taking him off the wall and I said absolutely not. You gave those to me. 

He started yelling at me because I wouldn’t give them back. Then he said I better pay him $3000 for all of them and I said no because you gifted them to me almost a year ago. 

So he told me that he was gonna call the police and he left because me and my other friend kicked him out.

Am I the asshole for keeping them?  ",PotentialMammoth673,6042,0.9800000190734864,151,1749244568,2025-06-06 16:16:08,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1l53pxa/aita_for_saying_no_no_to_my_friend_for_the_art/,6,2025
1l542ki,"AITA for not bringing my niece shopping after she was extremely rude/mean to me, even if she “apologized”?","I’m 26F and do not have kids, and I also have not really had a lot of experience dealing with kids before my niece. I don’t have younger siblings or cousins, I never babysat, etc. I’m explaining this because this is my blind spot and why I’m posting.

About a month ago, my niece “Gabby” and I were at the park together. I like to spend time with her and usually take her out to do things just the two of us every couple of weeks. While we were at the park, I was talking about an event I am going to attend with my boyfriend of a few years. She asked to see my dress, so I showed her a pic of me in it.

She made a “yucky” face and said “That’s soooooooo ugly. You look really fat. Isn’t \[\[my boyfriend\]\] gonna think it's bad?”

I was so hurt. She’s only 13! I’m not even a big girl in any sense. I have fat on my body, but I am definitely not fat. 

My sister was surprised and said she would talk to her. A few days later she had Gabby come over to apologize. From my POV, it was not sincere. She was rolling her eyes and looked angry and just got out the words. I told her thank you for apologizing and then told them to leave. I have not gone out my way to spend time with her since.

I had told Gabby that I would take her shopping for the summer and we’d pick out fun stuff together. I look forward to doing things like this with her. Not really anymore. When we were at my mom’s house for mother’s day, Gabby asked me when we would go.

After her stunt I’ve changed my mind. I said that she probably has plenty of summer clothes to wear. She was upset and said “But I said I was sorry!” over and over. 

I told her that I know she said she was sorry but just because someone says they’re sorry to you doesn’t mean that your actions are forgiven. That you have to prove to the other person you won’t do it again, and she hasn’t. 

My mom and sister say I’m expecting adult behavior from a child and that it was ridiculous to cancel the shopping date. I am apparently beefing with a child at my big age. They said that she apologized and hasn’t said anything else rude to me since. They asked how long I’m going to hold it against her. 

I really don’t know how to take this. I trust their judgment most of the time. But this was just an outright mean thing from her. I am worried that as she grows up this behavior will continue and she will turn out to be a bully.

1l55bfp,AITA for being possessive over my food?,"So, I’m going to get straight to the point.

Today, I brought wings and fries. I didn’t finish it all so I put it in the fridge so I could have it later.

Few hours later, I go into the fridge and it was all gone. Mind you, there was 4 wings and a whole container of fries in there.

It was just me, my mom’s boyfriend (Sam) and his son so, I asked Sam where my food went and he said he gave it to his son.

Obviously, I was upset because 1. You didn’t even ask and 2. You gave all of it to him, knowing he wouldn’t finish it so now half of the food I paid for is sitting in the trash.

I told him to stop just feeding my food to his son without asking, which he does ALL the time. He’ll take my food from the fridge, and just give it to his son. He never, ever asks. 

Like I don’t mind sharing but I feel like taking my things without asking isn’t nice.

He told me I’m being possessive over food and that it’s not that deep. Sam also said I’m 16 refusing to share with an 8 year old as if I’m a toddler.

So, AITA? ",Sea-Bumblebee-4895,1794,0.9800000190734864,212,1749248756,2025-06-06 17:25:56,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1l55bfp/aita_for_being_possessive_over_my_food/,6,2025
1l5xyih,AITA for not letting my neighbor take my children swimming?,"I have 3 children between ages 3-8. Today my husband was supposed to take them to the park but he procrastinated and now it's too late because he has to leave out to an event. Our sweet next door neighbor ended up messaging us to see if the kids could join her child at the pool (our children enjoy playing together). My husband thinks this is a great idea since they were excited to go to the park but are no longer going. He told the children about this exiting new option to go swimming instead before bringing it to me. But I said no. I am 40 weeks pregnant, exhausted and it's much too hot for ME to go and sit at the pool w/ my children right now (which is why dad was supposed to do the park w/ them). I am sure my neighbor would not mind me sending them out by themselves because again she is so kind and sweet and I don't think for one second that they will be unsafe with her. Sending THREE children w/ this lady to the pool all by herself on top of her own child is selfish in my opinion. I would also be the parent dealing with the aftermath of swimming like hair and baths etc. My husband thinks it's not fair to the kids because they now have to ""be stuck in the house all day with nothing to do"". They have plenty of toys, board games and a whole backyard to play in, as well as each other. They will be fine and again, had he moved faster then they would have been able to stick to the original plan and been back from the park by now. In his opinion there is no difference in sending them to the pool without me since I wasn't going to be joining them at the park. Now the children are upset and I look like the bad guy because I won't let them go to the pool.

1l6o14h,"AITAH telling Sil my kids will follow my rules on vacation not her ""rules""","So my family me f38 hubby m38 son 12 and daughter 10 will be joining husband's family on vacation. (His mom/dad, his sister/bil and his brother/wife/ 3 kids f/f/m). We have vacationed with this group before and it goes well except for my sil. She is a narcissist and expects me to follow her rules with my kids so her kids don't melt down. Like no snacking 2 hrs or less before a meal. Only water with meals. Stuff like that.  Her middle daughter has ODD and her son has ADHD. And tend to melt down often. So now on to the situation. We were at the in-laws discussing dinner for the week as each group will take a night to purchase and prepare dinner for everyone. My kids are not picky eaters, but obviously have things they don't like. Both my kids hate potatoes. (Only eat French fries) Sil reminded us that her one daughter has a severe peanut allergy and mild seafood allergy. My 12yr old said awe man I forgot about that. I wanted fish tacos for dinner. (We are going were seafood is amazing) hearing this sil raised her voice at my son and said...""yeah lets have fish tacos so my daughter dies"" ""great idea"" my in-laws and I  snapped back saying that was not what he meant. He was not demanding we have fish. So I'm already irritated with her. When she announces she will make chili my heart drops. My sil puts cubed potatoes in her chili. My husband says to my son. Guess you won't be eating chili that night your Aunt puts potatoes in her chili. Sil loses it and says to my son well that's how I make it so deal with it. My son says ok I'll just have a sandwich that night. Sil says no you won't. You eat what's served or don't eat anything that's the rule. I say no it's not the rule and he most definitely can eat a sandwich that night.  Sil replies absolutely not. My kids eat what is served or they don't eat. If your kids start that carp then my kids will expect the same treatment so your kids need to follow the rules. I said my kids will follow my rules and my rule is son can have a sandwich instead of chili end of story. Sil starts to say something and my father in law says everyone quiet!! I paid for this trip so if anyone has a say in rules it's me...my rules. So my rule right now is drop the dinner disagreement  and move on. The rest of the night went OK. However when leaving my husband's brother told him I over stepped and we all know how his kids get if they are set off so  just make your son eat the damn chili. He can pick out the potatoes. On the way home we decided we will skip family dinner that night and go out to eat.  Hubby called his dad and told him our plan. His dad said that's fine. This is a family vacation, but everyone is allowed to do as they want with their families.

1l6pxot,AITAH? I don’t want my husband coming on a family cruise,"I (50f) have been with my (52m) husband for 24 years. Over the past few years, he’s aged in dog years. My fun-loving, energetic happy husband has become someone who only sits and stares at the wall. When he’s not doing that, he’s sleeping. Without interference, he would sleep for 20 hours out of every 24. He’s been like this for 4 years now, has seen 20 doctors and takes three pills for each one he saw. 
In January, he broke a bone in his foot walking up the stairs because he developed a heel wound and didn’t tell anyone. Bone infection = weak bones. Since then, he’s been hospitalized three times, had two surgeries (currently has a large external fixator on his right ankle/leg that resembles like a metal halo) and two more planned. I have to give him IV antibiotics twice a day through his PICC line(second round of 6 weeks) as he can’t see well enough to do it himself. He gets daily wound care to his heel from visiting nurses that I have to do 4 days a week because they will only come three times a week. Plus, I have to change it every time the dressing falls off which is another 2-3 times a week. As you can imagine, he cannot work which forces me to carry every burden we have. I have had to work more hours to support the entire family. I have to clean our house, cook every meal, pay the bills, food shop, car maintenance, arrange and go to medical appointments. I just had to fix the garbage disposal that my husband dropped a fork into and our youngest’s scooter got a flat . . . Oh, did I mention we have two daughters, 21 & 12? We do or rather, I do. If someone is awake but spaced out only 4 hours a day, can you really call them a parent?
A year ago, we booked a cruise for the family. A week in the Caribbean, water parks, snorkeling, sight-seeing, shows, food, you name it. We have all been looking forward to it but I am desperate to go. I’m mentally and physically exhausted. I need a vacation, a break. I’m being pulled in every direction 24/7. 
We learned two days ago that the large metal apparatus in his foot is not coming off anytime soon. Plus, the wound is healing incredibly slow. My husband and I talked about the cruise. It’s in a month. He says he is going. I told him that I didn’t think he should. I told him I needed a break. That he can’t do anything once we are there (he can’t swim or submerge the leg with the fracture). That he isn’t supposed to be up and around as he’s ordered to be non-weight bearing on the one leg. I told him it would be completely unfair to me and the girls as I would be forced to nurse him and push him everywhere in a wheelchair while our daughters would feel guilty about leaving him behind and going anywhere. How is that fun? I explained all that and more. He says he’s going. He will just sit in the casino with all the money he doesn’t have. I told him ‘no’. He’s mad and sulking. So, AITAH? I don’t want him going.",50isnotthenew90,4964,0.8700000047683716,2054,1749424956,2025-06-08 18:22:36,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1l6pxot/aitah_i_dont_want_my_husband_coming_on_a_family/,6,2025
1l7gavf,WIBTA if I told my wife to get off her phone and take care of the baby?,"the title basically says it all, but to add some detail - we have an 11 months old, I work full time, my wife stays home indefinitely taking care of the baby, that was a mutually agreed arrangement that couldn't work any other way as her income would have been less than half of mine. I would love to stay home if that was feasible 

my wife seems to have a common these days phone addiction, where she will be glued to the screen for hours either watching reels, videos or messaging or exchanging audio messages with friends. I have no problem with that, I'm on my phone often myself, it is what it is, that's the way most of us decompress in 2025, but I do see the difference in our ability to snap out of it - I'm on my phone in my downtime and I can drop it at a moments notice for example because the baby crawled to me or there is something to do, my wife on the other hand tunes out completely and doesn't see or hear anything around her. I also tend to pick my phone when work is done, the house is clean and the baby asleep, while she is on it in the middle of things - as we are going somewhere, getting ready, cleaning, putting baby to sleep etc

She is also on her phone a lot when I'm leaving for work and it's actually time to be actively engaged with the baby, to the point where the baby might be crawling after me as I'm closing the door or running to me as soon as I come back, which is stressing me out a lot. I also notice it a lot when I'm driving and my wife is in the backseat on a baby duty, but actually completely ignoring any crying or screaming, again, to the point that I have to reach back and give a pacifier or sing a song to get the baby to calm down as I drive

she gets very defensive whenever that's brought up, either turning it into ""well you are using your phone as well"" or ""well that's for work"" because she does some side projects online, which is fair, but the amount of the time she spends and the money it brings is nowhere close to making it worth it, nor is it actually taking most of her time on the phone

WIBTA for calling it out and saying that she needs to at least put in 8 hours of phone free baby time every day and then we can split the evenings?

UPDATE, since this is getting out of hand and I can't engage with everyone:

1) the question is framed in a provocative manner because this sub requires a clear conflict spelled out, no, I'm not actually looking to police my wife's phone time, but directionally I am concerned with the balance between baby needs / self-care via doomscrolling

2) I am not expecting 24/7 attention on the baby from my wife or myself, that wouldn't be possible or healthy, but I do think there is a time for naps/meals/independent play/active play + need for passive supervision for safety reasons and soothing as required and the conflict seems to be in where to strike the right balance 

3) I am not talking about neglect, obviously the baby is healthy and clean and well fed and is hitting all the milestones, that doesn't mean though that she is getting sufficient face to face time, including reading, playing, singing, being held etc

4) might be a cultural / regional norm, but I wasn't even aware that sitting in the back with the baby in the car or letting them sleep in the stroller/outside can be weird to anyone. In any case we are in agreement about that with my wife so that's not an issue for us, baby is happy with it too

5) I don't think ""crying it out"" is a legitimate parenting approach and my wife doesn't think that it is either, but she ends up unintentionally using it if distracted by the phone, which, when I'm there, means I need to drop anything I'm doing and tend to the baby, or if I'm not there, results _potentially_ in a inconsolably crying baby which I'm not a fan of.

6) I'm not the dad of the year nor attempt to look like one, but I do a significant portion of childcare and am very involved. Obviously everybody is still going to project whatever they/their partner/their gender stereotype is telling them, so I can't argue with everyone about my actual level of involvement. The issue is really about when I'm not there, so what I'm doing when I am there might make it more or leas fair, but won't fix it",SomeAd8993,2210,0.8299999833106995,1572,1749502648,2025-06-09 15:57:28,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1l7gavf/wibta_if_i_told_my_wife_to_get_off_her_phone_and/,6,2025
1l7gk9l,AITA for involving myself and angering the new neighbors?,"I(33f) live in a culdesac with 5 other house on my street. 3 of these houses have motorcycles. Now, i must say, the bikers are really respectful of noise. One gets home late, one leaves early and they walk their bikes to the end of the road before they start them so they dont disturb the gaggle of young children in the neighborhood. Often times, you will see the bikers giving kids rides around the circle. All in all, fantastic neighbors. 

On to the issue. Recently, the only empty house on our street was bought by a young family. Mom and dad look to be in their early to mid 20s, and the kids look to be maybe 3 and 5. Mom started making a fuss the moment they moved in over the bikes. ""They are too loud"" ""they shouldnt have bikes around such young kids"" and finally ""they keep waking my kids up in the middle of the noght"". Most of us ignored them until they yelled at my neighbor for driving thru at 2pm on a Saturday. He was driving under the speed limit and he was making a normal amount of noise.

I was outside when she started walking towards him and his bike, screaming about the bikes and horrible neighbors. I got up, walked over and yelled back that she moved into OUR neighborhood and she could clearly see the bikes when they were viewing the house. She turned on me telling me i was a monster for allowing my kids near that death trap and it was ridiculous that i hadnt complaimed yet. I told her she was a crazy b-word and to stay off both of our properties, that she and her family could keep to themselves and could go suck a catcus.

She wont so much as look at me now but one of our neighbors said that i was being a dick and that it was a hell of a way to welcome them to the community. I do feel bad now because i hate to speak to people like that.

1l7j8s9,AITA for returning the jewelry my husband gave me for our 10 year anniversary?,"Hey reddit, long time reader and possible asshole here. My Husband (34M) bought me (32F) a beautiful necklace and earring set for our 10 year anniversary. He had it professionally wrapped and included three different types of liquor filled chocolates in the box. It was stunning, my favorite color, and I was SO appreciative of the time and effort he took in picking out a set I would truly like. Here's the problem. During this time my husband, we'll call him E, and I were struggling, not only in our relationship but with finances as well. E would spend most nights out with friends while I was home with our kids. We had many disagreements about his drinking, partying, and late nights. Because of everything that was going on I had chosen to take a break from alcohol. E knew I wasn't drinking so I was somewhat disappointed when I saw the chocolates. Now, I have never been much of a jewelry person but I was very happy with the set E got me. I had planned on wearing it the next day but forgot in the whirlwind of getting kids ready for school. E asked me why I wasn't wearing it that afternoon and said that if he was going to have to go hungry to afford the set he hoped I would at least wear it. I immediately felt terrible that I forgot to wear it and that it cost so much. I asked him how much he spent and it was enough to pay off a few bills and reduce some of our stress financially. Knowing that and how my husband wasn't able to eat lunch for the week I didn't feel right wearing the set. During that time, he continued to ask why I wouldn't wear the necklace and reminded me that he wasn't able to eat lunch because of what it cost. Now, this is where I might be the asshole. I took the set back to the store he got it at, told them I didn't like it, and returned it. It broke my heart to return it but they were able to give me a full refund minus a small fee. I took the money and paid off a few of our debts and said nothing. With how little I wear jewelry I had hoped he wouldn't notice after some time had passed. Unfortunately, someone he knew was in the store and saw me return it. A few days later E and I had a long conversation about how hurt he was. I apologized and explained why I returned it and how sad I was that he would choose to go hungry to get me something material. Shortly after we decided to go to therapy together and things have gotten better. However, I noticed for the last several holidays E hasn't gotten me anything, not even a card. He says it's because I'll return anything he gets for me. This has become a recurring disagreement between us where he says I'm the asshole. So reddit, am I the asshole for returning the jewelry my husband gave me for our 10 year anniversary?",Nearby_Zebra_8889,1727,0.9100000262260436,437,1749509990,2025-06-09 17:59:50,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1l7j8s9/aita_for_returning_the_jewelry_my_husband_gave_me/,6,2025

She told me to stop laughing cause it’s a horror film and not a comedy. I could not help it, I was laughing so hard at the first death sequence. I just found the whole Goldbergian chain of events that caused said deaths to be hilarious. I was the only person laughing in the theatre. 

She was not happy and was pissed off on the way home. She said I ruined the tone of the film. I tried to stifle my laughter and some of the deaths I didn’t find funny so I didn’t laugh during them. But when a funny death did happen I couldn’t help but laugh.

1la0lx4,AITA for refusing to help my roommate move out after they broke our lease early?,"I’m 26F and had been living with a roommate for almost two years. We renewed our lease back in March for another full year. Things were pretty normal, no major drama, we split rent and utilities evenly and mostly did our own thing.

A few weeks ago, my roommate got a new job in another city. Cool, good for them. But they gave me two weeks’ notice that they were moving out and had already spoken to the landlord about getting their name off the lease. No plan, no subletter lined up, nothing. Just “I figured you could cover things for a while until you find someone.”

I told them that wasn’t going to work for me. I didn’t agree to live alone and I definitely can’t afford this place on my own. They brushed it off and basically said I should be supportive of their “big opportunity” and that I’d figure something out.

Fast forward to moving day and they asked if I’d help them carry furniture, load the U-Haul, clean, etc. I told them no. I said I didn’t feel right helping out after the way they left me with everything. They got really cold after that and told some of our mutual friends that I was being bitter and making their move more stressful out of spite.

Now some people are saying I should’ve just helped to be the bigger person and that it wouldn’t have killed me to lift a few boxes. Others agree with me and say it was pretty bold of them to expect help after bailing.

1laurb1,AITA for telling my girlfriend that her using her accent in public alienates people from her?,"AITA for telling my girlfriend that her using her accent in public alienates people from her? 

So, my (27M) girlfriend (26F) and I are huge movie buffs; we are cinephiles and that's actually how we first met, through Letterboxd. We watch a lot of classic movies together, from the 30's and the 40's. (Sidenote: People, do not be afraid to watch old black-and-white films, please. Some of them can feel just as funny and affecting as new films). 

Now, on to the real problem. My GF's a huge fan of Katharine Hepburn, and insists on watching at least one of her movies every other day. However, recently, she's started imitating her speech patterns and mannerisms. 

For anyone who's interested, Katharine Hepburn didn't speak in an organic American or British accent. It was a weird mix of the two, called the Transatlantic accent. [This](https://youtube.com/shorts/UgrL-8RRyJE?si=fMvFetACdqb57ypQ) is what it sounds like. It isn't an organic or natural accent, but rather one that was taught to upper-class children and media personalities back in the day. 

My GF has exclusively started to use this accent in public, and with me, and it's weirding people out, and giving off a sense of entitlement. What makes it worse is that we're actually a bit more financially secure compared to our friends, which makes her seem bragging and shameless in front of them. I've tried to tell her, but she just ignores me.

I told my mom this over and over again and I for the past days had been informing her of the huge amounts of pain in my feet and legs.
Yet she still decided to offer me up to help someone move out of her house which had involved some very heavy lifting that could have injured my legs and feet given the tension and stress already upon them.
The person she offered me up to help had called her while I was in the same room and said “If he doesn’t want to go, he doesn’t have to. No was an acceptable answer.” And after I heard this I blew up on her yelling at her that I had been in a very large amount of pain in specifically my upper and lower legs for the past 4 days while this person was on call, and that she clearly hadn’t listened to me and continued to not listen to me and or didn’t care about my physical or mental health because she made decisions for me regardless of it being my choice, and me being in severe pain.

1ld6790,AITA for telling my DIL that I will never be her mother and to leave me alone,"This is mostly about my daughter-in-law (Kat). Her mother ran out on her when she was a child, and she went into foster care. According to my son, she’s currently seeing a therapist.

My issue with Kat is that she has repeatedly stomped on my boundaries. She’s a very touchy person, she  refuses to call me by my name and only refers to me as “Mom.” I correct her every time since I’m not comfortable being called “Mom” by her, and I want her to use my name.

There have been multiple times where she’s asked inappropriate questions, mostly about why I’m not close to my own mother. (For context, my mother was horrible) Kat keeps pushing for details and insists I should get closer to her because “family sticks together.” She basically tells me to forgive my mom, and she doesn’t understand not being close with one’s parents. I’ve told her to drop the topic multiple times, and she refuses. Because of all this, I’m not a huge fan of hers.

I’ve spoken to my son about it, and he asked me to be patient. I’ve also talked to Kat multiple times and asked her to respect my boundaries. She always says she will, but then goes right back to ignoring them.

This is where I might be the jerk: My daughter Sam (20) and I are taking a weekend trip. Sam has medical issue and needs to see a specialist a few states over. She hasn’t disclosed the issue to the rest of the family yet (she plans to when she has a firm plan).

Somehow, word about the trip got back to Kat, and she called me asking why she wasn’t invited. I told her it’s an important trip and not a fun one. She accused me of lying, claiming it was a “mother-daughter” trip that she was excluded from. I told her again this is not a girls’ trip. She wouldn’t let it go and started demanding that she come, saying that she’s my daughter and needs to be there. I said no again. She kept insisting, saying I am her “mom”and she has to come on this trip since is my kid. That’s when I snapped. I told her I will never be her mother. Just because she married my son does not make me her parent. I told her to leave me the fuck alone and that even if this was a mother-daughter trip, she still wouldn’t be invited, because she isn’t my kid. I then hung up. 

My son says I need to apologize and invite her. That I am a huge dick to her. That I was way out of line and need to make it up to Kat. The situation has spread to the rest of the family, and everyone seems to have their own opinion. Sam is getting flack too, which isn’t helping especially since she doesn’t want to disclose the reason for the trip yet.

Am I being an asshole and need to apologize even tho those are my true feelings on her trying to make me her parent.",Slow_throwaway_8233,8844,0.9300000071525574,1081,1750111521,2025-06-16 17:05:21,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ld6790/aita_for_telling_my_dil_that_i_will_never_be_her/,6,2025

1le15s2,AITA refusing to pay my friend for her package that was delivered to me?,"Hi reddit! I need your take on something rq. Also throw away acc because I don't know who's on here, lol.

I 19, female and my friend 20 female are currently having an argument over the stupidest thing ever.

Here's the context. So, I order things from online A LOT and recently, I ordered a few things from a popular brand. Now, my packages were spilt up so what I ordered would've come on two separate days(far apart) which I didn't mind. 

I picked up the first package and a week or so later, I kept seeing notifications in my email about a package(completely different tracking number than either of my split up packeges) pop up. I checked my bank account to see if maybe I had ordered something and didn't remember but that wasn't the case.

I brushed it off and ignored it. A few days later, the mystery package and my original package came up as delivered so I went and collected both since they were BOTH addressed to me. For the mystery package, I paid 50$ to clear it. 

As soon as I got home, I dug through the mystery package since I paid a good buck to collect it, was awfully curious and I thought the company gifted me free items since I shop on their site quite often. There were slippers, shorts, dresses and a few other things in the package all which I'd never personally order but they were good picks. I gave away one of the dresses and currently am wearing one of the shorts while typing this lol. 

Now, the actual tea. My friend sent me a message today asking if I had received a package recently(i picked up the package a week ago and we talked. I did mention getting freebies and it didn't go beyond that) and I said yes and obviously started telling her about my freebies(again). She asked what exactly I got, I told her then SHE said it wasn't free since it was HERS. How? Well, she placed an order from the same site I buy from and put MY address in to have it delivered to ME. Did she ever tell me about this before today? No. Am I shocked and lowkey upset? Kinda, yeah because why wouldn't she tell me that? I told her I took two items since I initially thought I was mine and she could have the rest of her stuff. 

Now, the cause for the argument? She said I'd have to pay her back for the two items I took and I refused since I did pay 50$ to collect it(she no longer has to) and my other friend works close to where she lives so she'd get free delivery too. She called me selfish and a b-word(dunno if I can say that here) and has been telling our mutual friends and my mom about what happened. She's been saying I STOLE from her and refused to pay her back. My mom's saying I should pay her to keep the peace and my friends are split on the situation. So reddit, am I the ahole for refusing to pay back my friend after she ordered her package to be delivered to me?

P.s. I tried to edit this as much as possible, sorry for any typos.

1letyfj,WIBTA if I kicked my dad's girlfriend out of our home?,"I really need outside opinions because I don’t know if I am being super unreasonable.

My mum died when I was a teenager. In her will, she left the house to me but gave my dad a right to live in it until he dies. She inherited our family home from her parents so it was always just in her name.

Honestly I never thought of it as “my house.” Even though legally it is. I moved away for uni but after I got a good job back in our hometown, I moved back in. I have been living here again for a few years now. 

I guess I knew deep down that my dad must have dated over the years but he never talked about it and never introduced me to anyone and honestly I kind of liked it that way. I didn't want to know that he moved on. It was just us- him and me against the world.

His new girlfriend kind of appeared out of nowhere. I met her a couple of times and suddenly she moved in without any prior discussion. 

I was stunned but I tried to be happy for him. I really, really did. I tried my best to be polite and keep my resentment to myself. But it’s getting harder every single day. Every time I see them giggling in the kitchen or cuddled up on the sofa my mum picked out, I want to scream. My mum who died too young, who loved my dad, who was only ever with my dad, who never got a chance to move on. And now I have to watch him do it, every single day, in her house, in her childhood home. I didn't know I just feels like this is so disrespectful to my mum's memory.

She is redecorating. She has moved furniture. She changed the curtains and wallpapers my mum and I picked together and reorganised the kitchen cupboards.

And worse she has been making comments like, “Have you ever thought about living independently now that you are settled in your career?” Or telling my dad they will need to turn my room into nursery eventually when they have kids as the third room is his home office.

Like. What?? The absolute audacity.

I’m not a tenant or a guest. I own the goddamn house. My dad just has a right to live here but I don't think that right gives him the right to just move in a partner and act like it’s their shared marital home especially when I live here too. If he wants to build a life with her he should at least move out and not do it in my mum's home.

From what i understand she has no legal right to live here. She is not a tenant as she pays no rent. I think I can legally kick her out anytime i want to without a court order. At best she is an ""excluded occupier"" and can be evicted with reasonable notice which is classed as one rental period. And I don't think even that is applicable here.

I havent confronted him yet but I am this close to sitting my dad down and saying all this. And if he refuses, I am considering speaking to a solicitor and making it happen formally. I know it would cause a huge rift but i am so tired of feeling like a stranger in my own home. I feel like my mum is being erased.

At 18, I moved in with her after a fight with my dad, working and studying while helping her with bills. Two and a half years ago, I met my husband, quit working, graduated university, and moved into a new house with him and my cats. My husband earns well, providing a comfortable life, and began supporting my mom financially when I stopped working. Recently, she moved in with us because she couldn’t afford rent, agreeing to help with chores for extra money. However, she’s been toxic, constantly complaining about issues like a broken toilet, and after a man came fix it, she complained about the man and said she had no privacy. She also invited my older sister, with whom I’m estranged, my husband said she couldn't come, leading to conflict, but he even offered to drive her somewhere where they could meet, she refused.

I'm not exaggerating, every. single. day. she complains about something/acts offended/plays the vicitm. She also says my husband is stingy, for not helping her more, but this isn't comunism.

1lfnln7,"AITA for refusing to be an unpaid maid for my BFF? Am I wrong for telling her her expectations should be that her husband cleans THEIR house? Am I wrong for saying she should be grateful for the help I'm offering, not expect more?","
*Update at the bottom* I was planning to fly over and help my BFF kick labour into action the two weeks running up to her due date. I had planned to help out with the school run of her two other kids, take my bff on long walks and catch up on some good old British TV all day whilst they were at school.

At her hospital appointment on Monday she found out she needs to have the baby via C section, two weeks early. So about 24-48hrs after i get through her door. 

She called me all apologetic, I said yeah not ideal, there would be no TV anymore but I can at least help my bff with er two oldest whom I love. She  said yeah "" you'd need to have main responsibility for the household cleaning, dishes, cooking, hoovering etc""

I said nah, I can do a meal or two, wash up after a meal or two but I'm not cleaning your bathroom or your kitchen on my holiday with my own home I could clean when your husband is also there. (Two weeks paternity leave)

She got very upset with me, said that my pride is in the way of helping her, that I'm not willing to support both her and her husband. Said her expectations of me were to clean and look after the kids, and her expectations of her husband was to bond with the new one and IF he had time/energy for him to help me a bit with the housework, and if I wasn't willing to do that she'd refund my flight ticket.

Am I the arsehole or what? Is this normal expectation, should I still go and be the BFF she needs? Am I wrong for feeling like her expectations should be that her husband cleans THEIR house? Am I wrong for thinking she should be grateful for the help I'm offering, not expect more from me than her husband whom she CHOSE to have three children with?

EDIT: I am English,when I use the word ""holiday"" it  does not mean beach and hotel, it means the period of time when you are not at work, normally 4-6 weeks paid leave a year. Mine are usually used to help/visit my best friend. 

I paid for the tickets (like I usually do) hence the word refund

My flight is 2nd July. The original due date 19th July. My flight back 21st July.

I visited (hopefully visit doesn't mean the equivalent of holiday) three weeks before the previous child successfully. Best friend of over a decade, played at their wedding, given (and happily taken) title auntie by their first. 

Help with the two children under ten - so that they got time to just focus on the new one. So that includes everything a child must do throughout the day, bedtime, food, homework, take them to activities, iron school uniform, pack and make lunches...those that know know.

I'd normally clean during the adverts, it's the expectation that is getting me turned upside down. And the fact there's no more TV time. 😅

Update:
So I realise it is a split decision. Those that mean to say im the AH would happily take because they seem i am in a position to give (mother Theresa it) , and those that say i am NAH are identifying that having the ability doesn't mean to say I must (rich staying rich).
Morally I don't deem it appropriate to expect something you'll never be able to give yourself. My best friend would love to be able to think she'd one day be able to do this for me, hence why she thinks it's appropriate to expect, however she will never be able given the amount of dependables she has.

The majority of the AH comments wanted me to give give give as much as I can cause she needs needs needs. I won't stop trying to give to better my friends situation, but it's just like when a charity cause is asking for money, you don't empty your bank in donations, you give what your comfortable with that month, and should not be subjected to ""oh so little"" or ""we need donations of x and up"". 

The majority of the NAH comments meant it was appropriate to ensure self perseverance and demonstrate boundaries. It's true, even though we speak 24/7 her life isn't mine, and therefore any requests to put mine in a deeply compromised position to save her family from a choice the made knowingly is unfair. I love my best friend but, I don't feel comfortable being that selfless, not when I don't deem it necessary. If she was suddenly single mother no questions or demands needed, I'd step up, however she isn't. It took two to tango, they made three tangos, i shouldnt have to turn maid. They shouldnt expect more from me because I don't yet have children, your choice to have children shouldn't be my cross to bear.

How we're doing:
We're still maintaining our snap streak. A good long-term friendship has ups and downs, disagreement and union. Both parties are hurt but still care for one another, however this is her time to nest and get ready to be a family of five. For me, I got the time back  to focus on what I initially had planned for my first summer after purchasing a house. There is a mutual agreement that this time around I'm not going, and she has refunded the cost of the tickets. she will have her mom come as planned, they wear very easily of her ""help"" and often cut her trip shorter. I am the preferred help. But I feel when you want someone to slave about, you should be able to tolerate their personality. Cause at the end of the day, it wasn't her choice to have three children or her choice of ""partner"" for her daughter. Only a PAID cleaner can you expect a lack of (voiced) opinion cause they are paid to do the job and keep their opinion to themselves.

Side note: I hope someone high up in the educational department in the US fixes the comprehension levels expectations before one gets a GED /graduates highschool. It's been enlightening, I thought I was 100% correct but I wasn't. Thank you all for your comments and advice.

1lghj66,AITA for telling my BIL he needs to book a hotel when he and my sister were staying at my house?,"My sister and her husband live across the country and decided they wanted to come visit. I live in a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom and I set up a bed in my home office because they wanted to stay at my house. They had been here for 4 days. 

The bathroom has been a big problem. He spends hours in there. After the first day, I talked to my sister about it. She says he has a condition where he needs the bathroom a lot. So I let it rest. On day 3, it was even worse. There was a time where I had to excuse myself to go to the store so I could use the bathroom twice because he wouldn’t leave. 

The last day i woke up at 4am and had to use the bathroom very badly. I knocked on the door and he said he’d be out in a minute. I told him I really had to go. It took him an hour to get out. The nearby store wasn’t open at that time and I had to do something I am not happy I had to do because I couldn’t wait. 

The next morning I told him he needs to get a hotel. I can’t be blocked from using the bathroom in my own home because he takes it hostage. I get he has a condition, but so do I. And I make sure I have my own bathroom when I travel so I don’t get in the way of other people needing the bathroom. 

My sister and her BIL were very upset and called me ableist. I told them what I had to do last night because he was in the bathroom for so long and they said I could’ve held it. I told them they need to leave and find a hotel or stay with other family, he just can’t stay here anymore.

1lh9z5y,AITA for ordering fries instead?,"This is one that's been haunting me intermittently for the majority of my life. I've been called an asshole several times over this, and finally decided to poll a larger group about it.

Where I live, there's a local mom and pop drive in restaurant that's been open and family run for about 70 years now. They open every spring and stay open until October. They sell north American classics - burgers, hot dogs, onion rings, French fries, and a variety of different ice cream cones, sundaes and milkshakes. I'm 30 and have been going there all my life. The food is always great.

Here's my apparent crime: when I and a group of my friends or family or inlaws all pile in the car and go to the drive-in, they all tend to order some kind of cold sweet treat. Shakes and cones, etc. But I am a) lactose intolerant and b) a fiend for french fries. So 9 times out of 10, I go against the grain and order fries instead of any ice cream. In the spirit of full disclosure I WILL say that I am 100% one of those lactose intolerant people who ignores it and takes the L to eat dairy when it suits me. I just prefer the fries, or maybe sometimes a hotdog, over ice cream.

The cooked food and the frozen desserts get served up out of two different windows with two different lines, and the ice cream line definitely moves faster. 

So for about 20 years now, I've been getting intermittently complained at and criticized for ordering fries when everyone else ordered icecream, and therefore holding up the entire group for an extra 5 to 10 minutes to get my food, so we can all leave. It's apparently very inconsiderate of me to order something that takes longer than everyone else, when the whole rest of the group ordered from the quicker options. They're all getting what they want, they're not settling. It's just apparently rude of me to also get what I want. 

It's been several different friends, family members and inlaws now who've said this, ranging from 'playful jokes' to downright cranky bitching. Is it actually so bad of me to order something that takes 5 to 10 minutes more? It's not like I ask them to wait to eat, or anything.

We dried after reading beside it, I made dinner, we had a long conversation, watched a show and then it was time for bed. Even tired, I still took a quick shower to rinse my body before bed. Husband didn’t want to, fine, I didn’t complain. But he was in bed in his swim trunks so I asked when he was taking them off. He said he was sleeping in them.

Normally, he sleeps in his underwear only. I sometimes sleep in a t shirt that i only use in bed and undies, sometimes my birthday suit. It depends. And honestly, idk why it bothers me so much that his swim trunks were in bed, but to me they’re like dirty shorts. He’s worn them outside on dusty furniture, has cat fur all over them, doesn’t wash frequently, that kind of vibe. So it feels like outside clothes shouldn’t be in bed. I’m not a super clean person but any means, but I like my bed to feel clean.

He said he was too lazy to change into his underwear. No problem buddy, I’ll get them for you. Begrudgingly he changed into them, even though he didn’t want clean undies on his dirty body. I agree with that but prefer it over his dirty swimshorts in our bed. 

Anyways, I don’t like feeling like a control freak or nagging wife, I keep the bar pretty low in general, so I don’t always know when my requests/insisting is actually reasonable or if I’m being extra. My husband didn’t think there was any “rule” about what you’re allowed to wear to bed and I disagreed and said there’s an unwritten rule. He says he needs it in writing, so here I am. AITA for insisting on no sleeping in swim trunks?

1li21zm,"AITA for revealing the ""rental costs"" of my van after the trip was made?","I was recently asked to help out since my friends could not go on a trip they needed to make because the car they meant to take was not good for use at the time, and I own a travel van. I also got invited to join on said trip to drive since it was a really long trip and a short time to make it, and it was questionable if one of them could even drive due to a health problem that arose near departure. The trip was to another country to take something there and another thing home from there. Most of the time I was more or less treated like staff and as someone not very welcome in their circle. During the trip one of them started to ask who's turn it is to pay for gas this time, and I was pointed out as the one. Also they spoke of evening out the costs afterwards, clearly implying I was to pay an equal amount of everything. Of course I was going to pay for my own food and other costs like any decent human being would and was not going to ask for compensation for the use of the van to be a fair friend, but was assuming that since the trip was not a holiday trip planned together but rather I was invited out of necessity quite last minute, I should not be paying for gas (at least not an equal amount which would make me the one paying the highest price for the entire trip since the van was mine and I pay for the keeping of it). I gave them some time to make their intentions clear about how they thought the costs should be divided, and was left with the impression before mentioned and so decided to let them know that I wanted them to pay rent per mile to cover costs of using the van. The price I set was the same I use with any other friend who would take a trip with the van without me, and very fair at that. So this lead to me being called a criminal for not letting them know beforehand they'd need to pay ""rent"". Am I really the ahole here?

1lisji4,AITA for not bringing my kids to their stepmom?,"I have two children, 12 and 9. Their father left me while I was pregnant with my second. He and his GF have two together also. 

He is out of town for work. He said he would be back in about a month. He is scheduled to have the kids every other weekend. He will not take them for his weekend because he has to work, he has plans with his other family, or my kids have a stuffy nose/headache and aren’t allowed. He often goes 2-3 months without seeing the kids.

He is pushing me at this point to still bring my kids over to his GF on the weekends so that they “can keep them on a schedule” and see their siblings. The thing is, I flat out refuse to interact with his GF at all. She has accused me of heinous things. She talks down to me and is all around disrespectful. I will not put up with it anymore. This has been going on since the beginning.

I have been accused of drinking throughout my pregnancy, withholding my children, making up medical conditions that my youngest has, and putting my hands on their child. I drew the line and cut off contact then. I do not feel that my kids are taken care of while they are there. My youngest has several food allergies that they said I made up and would continually cause flare ups because they kept feeding them the foods they react to.

More recently, my kids have expressed that they don’t want to be there. Their siblings are mean to them. There is no corrective action towards this behavior. My youngest is called a wimp, a pussy, a nerd, etc. Their kids will get to go do fun things while mine are left to clean the house. At this point, I don’t even feel comfortable with my kids being there when their dad IS in town. I have told him no to his requests every time he has brought it up. He refuses to acknowledge any of what has happened and will not accept no as an answer.

They both think I’m being unreasonable and vindictive towards their kids. So, AITA for not doing this?

1liua1b,AITA for having fun at a beach while my friends waited in a Wendy's for 3 hours?,"Context: Me and 6 other friends went on a beach trip. The plan was to spend 2 days. We had booked a hotel for one night($1222) for which our friend said we could pay him back later. I paid for a rental van which we took there($571) which I also said everyone could pay us back later. 

The first day everyone went to the beach and was satisfied. The second day, 4 people in the group were not trying to go on the sand. Instead, they wanted to walk around the city around the beach. (For context this is Virginia Beach). Me, and 2 other people in the group wanted to go in the water. We brought the keys to the rental van with us since we were the only ones with licenses. We had planned to leave the beach by 7pm so 2 people in the non-beach going group could go to work the next day, while allowing us to fulfill our rental van dropoff for 2:30AM

While me and my 2 friends were in the water, the non-beach going group called us 5 times claiming that they wanted to leave early.(It was 4:57) and we didn't see the calls until we got out at 5:43. They said they were so exhausted that they sat and waited in a Wendy's for 3 hours. Me and the beach-going friends still wanted to get food. So we got the food and then we went to pick them up and go back home(This was 7 on the dot). My friend is giving me the silent treatment.

1livtwi,"WIBTA if I refuse to come home from college, daily, to do house chores?","I'll be starting college this fall. I was invited to apply to a leadership program where I must live on a specific dorm floor with others in the program. With my past leadership experience and major, having this credential only makes sense. After talking to my dad about it, he said go for it (knowing I will have to live on campus - across our very large city).

He just gave me a list of things I'll be expected to do daily once school starts. With my dad working long hours I've always been the one to take care of anything to do with the house (and the 5 dogs my dad has taken in with no conversation with my sister and I). My sister is 14 and doesn't do anything. Homework during the year? no. Cleaning her room? no. Cleaning up after her friends? no. Taking care of the dog she begged for? no. She's never been given a chore list like this.

I'm trying to graduate a year early from college (like I did in HS) and so that means I'm taking a full in person schedule and multiple online classes. I don't have time to come home early in the morning to take care of the dogs, go to my morning classes, use my lunch break to come back and take care of the dogs again, attend afternoon classes, go to work, take care of the dogs again, and then spend time on my online classes.

I understand that I am a part of this family and therefore should have responsibilities, but giving me a list of things to do daily, when most of them only have to be done a few times a week, is insane to me. It would make sense if I had some responsibilities on the weekends and breaks from school but every day is wild. Even if I had a list of things to do every weekend and my sister handles minor things during the week. Not to mention, the amount of extra gas I'll be paying for by going back and fourth 3 times daily.

So WIBTA if I told him there's no way I'm doing all this while handling a job, an overloaded course load, and while trying to find a bit of a social life while my sister does nothing and all he does is come home from work at 12AM and ends up drunk?

-I'm a minor (obviously)
-My dad isn't paying a cent for my education

1ljon7k,AITA for yelling at my aunt when she decorated my books for school?,"I know, the title sounds bitchy. I (14F) go to summer school because I did very poorly in my classes last year. This summer, I have tried to take the initiative to change. I bought 10 compositions notebooks and started researching study methods so I can perform more efficiently. Now, back to the summer school thing, my mum works long hours at her place of work, so my aunt (her sister) is the one to pick me up. 


A few days ago, I had brought to my aunts one of my books so I could study and take notes while at her house. I had a few stickers on there, maybe 2-3. After studying, I left the book on her dining table and took a nap on the couch. While I was laying down, she started looking at the notebook and kept saying things like “Oh its so lovely, I have the perfect scrapbooking tape to put on it,” or, “I’m gonna go get my crafting stuff to add things on it.” I laughed and said No, that I liked my book the way it was. She kept pushing and pushing for her to decorate it and it got to the point where I firmly tell her no, that I was happy with what my books looked like at the moment, and I would be very upset if she did something to it, and went to sleep. 


If upset was the only word to explain how I was feeling, It would still be an understatement. 


I woke up and completely forgot about the book, and I only remembered when my mum picked me up and told me to collect my things. I asked my aunt where she put my book, and she had a cheeky grin and said “Your new and improved book is over here” and she pulled it out. 

I. was. furious. The book wasn’t ugly, but still. She didnt listen to what I told her to do, and did the exact OPPOSITE. I started yelling at her asking her “Why did you do that? I specifically told u not to. You waited until I fell asleep to do it?” She had a sad expression on her face, and that kinda made me feel bad, but it honestly was the last straw. I got in the car and my mum God bless her soul was so tired so all she told her sister was that when I tell her not to do something, she needs to listen and respect that. 

I still feel bad I yelled at her, especially seeing her expression after. AITA?

Update; I called her and apologized for yelling. I know the comments were on the fence about me apologizing, but I recognized that yelling at her was not the correct choice and there were multiple different approaches to the situation. I am a very neat person and I like all my belongings a certain way and color, so her doing that irritates me not only because it didn’t “match the vibe”, but because I clearly expressed I didn’t want her to. Anyways, I sat my mum down and told her how I felt, and she offered to drive me to my aunts place so I could apologize. I said no (it was my mum’s day off) and that I would call her. I called her, and she said she was surprised for me yelling at her because she thought she was just decorating and helping me because it looked “sad”. I asked her what she meant and she said the book looked depressing and needed a bit of pop. I told her respectfully that it didn’t matter how she took it, if I enjoyed it then that was all that mattered. She mumbled an “I guess” and kept going off about how “some people just don’t appreciate help”. She asked me if I used it still and I said no because I didn’t like how it looked now and I had an extra anyway and found similar stickers. She proceeded to tell me I was a “neat-freak” and “might have OCD.” I.  Had. It. I went off. Not in a bad tone, in a firm one. I said “Auntie, if you see a house on your street, and you don’t like the color, you don’t paint the house. It was my notebook. I liked it the way it was. You asked if you could decorate, I said no. If someone is your age and doesn’t understand boundaries, Lord help them. When someone says no, it means no. I don’t have OCD for not liking a book you decorated after I specifically told you I did not want you to decorate it.” The phone was quiet, then a simple “Just crazy.” and she hung up.

1ljpb3e,WIBTA if I don’t attend my daughter’s wedding because her father will be there?,"
28 yrs ago, my daughter’s father left us for our babysitter just a week after her 1st birthday. He had 2 kids with her, & left her for their babysitter as well. Moved across the USA and married her. Our daughter didn’t see or hear from him at all. No emails, calls, no child support. When she was 14 we discovered she was bipolar & put me thru hell, even with medication. Fast forward 28 years. Found out lots of things, including that he had people spying on me all those years & reporting back to him on what I was doing. “He was worried about the kids with me as a parent.” (For context - I raised 7 kids (this daughter Is child #4, mostly as a single parent, by my own choice. I never had a welfare check, went thru college 3 times for 3 different  degrees and never had the electric shut off, go to a shelter or was homeless.) he Never sent any messages, emails, phone calls, birthday card, anything. Now, I’m raising said daughter’s son, he is 9 and I have had him since he was 1 due to neglect and emotional abuse. He will soon be 10. She visits with him when it’s convenient for her, which isn’t often. Her boyfriends have always been twice her age and way more important to her than her son. One bf went to prison. We have full legal custody and have the right to tell her no any time we like, but for the boy’s benefit, we figured some contact is better than none. He is in counseling and his counselor has ripped her a new ass twice. He said “either be all in or be all out.” She just can’t seem to do either one. She also didn’t pay child support for 7 years, but the last 18 months they ordered her to pay $60 a month, which we discovered her father has been sending her to pay. She cant hold a job or a place to live. He gave her a BMW & drove it here. He’s given her thousands of dollars & paid her rent. He has said some vile stuff about me that has gotten back to me. I feel like both of them has really made a lot of my adult life a lot harder than it has had to be. While they’re off living it up & having fun, being all “lovey dovey family” while I’m over here exhausted and struggling. While I went on with my life and I have a wonderful man now….my daughter and her twice her age flavor of the week are talking about getting married. He hs had a vasectomy, doesnt ever want kids and has no desire to be in this boy’s life, let alone encourage her to do it. Good for her, if that’s what makes her happy. However, I have zero desire to attend that wedding, especially if her father is there and giving her away. Their relationship is not my business and I hope it’s a happy one, but I really have no desire to have all that rubbed in my face. It’s like neither one ever gave a shit how their behavior affected my heart, soul, or life. Would I be an asshole if I choose not to attend?  Because I feel like if I don’t, that’s just another reason for those 2 to bad mouth me and make me feel like a piece of shit parent bc I’m supposed to support her no matter what.",doiattendthewedding,1802,0.8799999952316284,570,1750804833,2025-06-24 17:40:33,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ljpb3e/wibta_if_i_dont_attend_my_daughters_wedding/,6,2025
1ljpmdq,AITA for kicking my brother out after he insulted my wife?,"(Hi reddit made this account to get some insight into a situation)  
  
I (32M) have a younger brother (27M) who’s been staying at my house for the past month. He’s between apartments, and I offered our guest room to help him out. My wife Kara(30F) and I have been happy to have him until last weekend.

We were all watching TV and having a normal chat when my brother suddenly made a really nasty comment about Kara. For context, Kara recently switched careers (to something that makes her much happier) and is earning less right now. My brother joked “Haha, youre basically living off my brother, right? What a gold digger.” I immediately told him off. Kara looked shocked and hurt. She told him that was a rude and wrong. Instead of apologizing, my brother doubled down. He said something along the lines of “Well, I call it like I see it. Maybe if you weren’t so lazy and got a better job, you wouldn’t have to mooch off my brother.”  

At that point I got a little mad. I told him to get out of my house if he was going to disrespect my wife under our own roof. He scoffed and said I was “overreacting to a joke.” It didn’t feel like a joke to either of us. Kara was quietly tearing up at this point. I was furious and told him to pack his stuff right now. We got into a shouting match. 

Now a few days later, my parents are upset that I kicked him out and he has nowhere to go. They admit what he said was wrong, but they think I should have been the bigger person and just talked it out the next day rather than throwing him out immediately. I personally feel I did the right thing standing up for Kara. he is an adult and should deal with this stuff himself. 

My brother hasn’t apologized at all. He’s texted me basically blaming Kara for being sensitive. That makes me even angrier. However, a part of me wonders if I moved too quickly by kicking him out on the spot. 

My wife, for her part, thanked me for defending her and says I did the right thing. My parents say family is family and I should let him come back and just set some rules. I don’t want him back unless he genuinely apologizes, which doesn’t seem likely right now.

So, Reddit, AITA for kicking my brother out after he insulted my wife?   
(My parents live in state funded housing and aren't allowed more people)

Edit: after some talking people in the comments (and someone in my DMs who showed me how to edit this post) I think I might rent him his own studio apartment in a  lower income neighborhood that I can afford. BUT only if Kara agrees and he genuinely apologizes to both of us. I love him and care too much about him to see him go homeless.

1lleol5,AITA for hiding my pregnancy from my sister?,"I (28F) am over 3 months along, and I'm worried if I tell my sister (21F) that shes going to try to get pregnant too... again.

Two years ago I had my first pregnancy. I announced it to my family at dinner and everyone was very happy and supportive of me. Ive been with my bf (34M) for 5 years now and it seemed like everything was falling into place for our midwest life. But my sister is a narcissist, and saw how happy and excited everyone was for me and decided she wanted that for herself. She made it her mission to also get pregnant, while in college, with no job or place of her own. She got pregnant within the next 2 months while at school and expected everyone to also be excited. Obviously she got a different reaction and was really mad at everyone for not just accepting her irresponsible choice. She ended up dropping out. 

Fast foward to my emergency c-section where we fought to keep my baby alive in the NICU, only to pass away at 9 days. I don't want to get into the details of it,  but obviously it was traumatic. And my sisters world completely changed from thinking we would be raising kids together. Her baby was born on time and healthy. And I hate to say but shes a terrible mother. She doesnt prioritize her child at all, doesn't even capture milestones or spend quality time with him, just dumps him on a family member for a few days so she can go out. To each their own but its extremely infuriating, considering how motherhood was ripped away from me and she doesnt have a maternal bone in her body. 

Now 2 years later, shes still in the same spot. No job, living with her mom, doesnt prioritize her child and didnt go back to school. He isnt speaking words and just grunting and is developmentally delayed. I see this and it makes me realize she didnt really want a kid, she just wanted that unconditional support from our family that they showed me. So now that im pregnant again, I really dont want to tell her. And my family has agreed with me not to tell her. I'm worried shes going to see that as an opportunity to get pregnant again because shes obsessed with attention whether its negative or positive, and can't stand the spotlight on me. But i feel bad the further along I get, and the more people I tell, shes going to be extremely upset when she finds out. And if you know narcissistic rage, then you understand.  I figured maybe I'd tell her this weekend finally, BUT she just posted on her story ""going crazy this summer bc i'm manifesting a babygirl next year."" Like HUH? You cannot keep a job, you dont even help your mom with rent and you want to have a 2nd kid already? For WHAT? You aren't even a good mother to your first! The father wants to take him for custody! Makes me want to shake her by the shoulders ugh. Now I know when I tell her shes definitely going to try it again. 
I rarely see her and we arent technically that close, so I could hide this for as long as I wanted tbh. AITA? or are my fears valid? 

Edit: I understand the concern for my nephew. My family is all for the father getting custody, my sister is the only one against it. We all see her for who she is, but she doesn't seen anything wrong with her actions.Hes only 2 right now. She doesn't think shes a bad mom. He and my sister both live with her mom, my step mom, who is a school teacher. She does as much as she can to help him while also still trying to maintain her own life, but she doesn't want the entire responsibility of raising a child and I'm sure thats understandable.

1llepvm,AITA for telling a woman to keep her comments to herself in an elevator?,"This happened earlier today. I was waiting for the elevator in my office building. The doors opened, no one was directly in front of me, so I stepped in. A woman and an elderly couple were just behind me, but I hadn’t seen or heard them until after I got on.

As soon as I stepped in, the woman complained out loud that I didn’t let her on first. I was caught off guard, but I apologized and said there was plenty of room for everyone, so it wasn’t a big deal. I wasn’t trying to cut anyone off; I genuinely didn’t notice anyone behind me.

She got on with the couple but kept going, saying how rude I was, how I had no manners, how people like me are what’s wrong these days, stuff like that. This went on for at least a minute, maybe more, and eventually I snapped a bit. I raised my voice and said Could you just keep your comments to yourself.

She went quiet, but the old couple sort of whispered something to her and gave me a look. Now I’m wondering if I just confirmed whatever idea they had about me, like maybe I actually was the jerk here.

I honestly didn’t mean to offend anyone. I just wanted to ride the elevator in peace.

1lm5b47,"AITA for telling my daughter she needs to grow up, and apolgize to her sister","My late husband died when my oldest daughter (Sofia) was 9 and my youngest daughter (Julie) was 2. Julie has zero memories of her biological dad. I started to date 4 years after his death and remarried 7 years later (Sofia was 16 and Julie was 9). Sofia wanted nothing to do with him and looking back was a dick to him. My husband (Jim) never tried to force Sofia to see him as a father figure, but Julie did see him as a father figure. She refers to him as Dad. Both girls have been to therapy, Sofia hated it and I actaully think it made the issue below worse. Julie like it and helped her overcome never knowing bio dad.

That was the main issue between Sofia and Julie, Sofia thought julie was abandoning and replaying their bio-dad.  Julie made it very clear that Jim is her dad and basically bio-dad doesn’t mean much to her since, she doesn’t remember him. Many fights and their relationship was strained. Therapy didnt help, separate and group were tried. 

It got better when Sofia went off to college and they had space. Julie (24) is getting married. She announced this during dinner last Saturday and asked for Jim to give her away. Sofia did not take that well and started telling Julie that she was a horrible daughter and that she is replacing dad.

The announcement was ruined and Julie told her not to come to the wedding. I pulled Sofia aside and told her that she needs to apologize to her sister for her outburst, that she is way too old for this and it is time for her to grow the fuck up. That is fine that she doesn’t see jim as her father but get over that her sister does. 

She was crying when I finished, told me it is my fault for getting remarried in the first place and had not contacted me since. I know she apologized to Julie but she won’t respond to any of my texts.

1lm814y,AITA: For telling my boyfriend no to an invitation to an all-inclusive resort (getting engaged) because his mom will be there.,"Myself (25 F) and my boyfriend (27 M) have been in a relationship for eight years. We have been planning to get engaged for the past year and the ring just arrived in the mail. Yes, we picked it out together, but the plan is that he would execute the actual proposal. He always said the proposal would be small and didn't want anything extravagant or in public, which I agreed to. Before we began picking out rings or ordering the ring, we were talking about going on a vacation with his mom. 

This vacation would be the first for him and his mom and they want it to be international. I was in agreement with this, as there are no issues between myself and his mom and they are really close. By close, I mean a pattern of her word before mine, him agreeing to her wishes, my opinion being put on the backburner. Yes, a momma's boy, but this is not the issue at hand, as I love them both and accept this about them. This just helps with the context of the situation. We all went together to get our passports and are now planning on going to an all-inclusive resort in Mexico. 

As far as I was concerned, I thought the proposal would happen sometime before or after this vacation. Today he mentioned wanting to propose while we're on vacation with his mom and I feel that this would:

 1. Make it so that we are unable to enjoy a romantic time together while his mom is present. 

2. Cause it to be uncomfortable for her as we may not spend as much time with her since we'll be celebrating.

3. Her praise for her son may overshadow our celebration and divide his attention.

I was very clear about not wanting his mom to be there, and he said that there would be no other way that he would want to propose because he wants it to be somewhere extravagant and away from where we live. His idea is that for the most part, she would be doing her own thing while we spend time together. I brought up the fact that if she wanted to do something without him, she would be going on vacations on her own. I also mentioned that my expectations are not that we need to be doing something special and if he was open to it, to get engaged before and keep the vacation separate/make it part of the celebration. He was not open to this idea either, so I offered to not go to save money for the trip, and plan something different for us, and now he's upset.

I really just want this to be a special moment between the two of us that we can share with our friends and family after the fact. His mom being there just makes it seem like I'm taking away time with her son from her or she's going to be taking away the joy of my engagement celebration. If this vacation was separate from the proposal as planned, I'd be so down to go.  So reddit, AITA for not wanting to go if he plans to propose?",Educational-Yam-1846,2407,0.8999999761581421,705,1751065955,2025-06-27 18:12:35,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lm814y/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_no_to_an_invitation/,6,2025
1lmyqd5,AITA for not letting my mom into my apartment when her power went out during a heat wave,"Okay so I (24F) am working a summer festival this weekend meaning I work roughly 12 hour days that are very busy. My mom (60F) texted me around 10 am saying her power went out and it's really hot in the house (we are currently in the middle of a heat wave and it's roughly 90⁰F with high humidity). I told her she doesn't have a key (I don't have the best relationship with her) and I didn't have time to give her one today. She kept begging and eventually I had to leave her on read and I've felt really guilty about it even though I'm pretty sure I was being perfectly reasonable. For full context I included a transcript of the text convo in this post. 




Mom: The power is out. Can I hang out at your apartment if it doesn't come on soon. Super hot


Me: Do you have a key? Also its pretty hot in my apartment even with the AC on so idk how much better it is lol. You might have more luck going to like the library or a coffee shop. 


Mom: I don't have a key but I'd rather hang out there than the library if I can


Me: idk how you'd get in without a key


Mom: can (insert GFs name here) let me in?


Me: shes working till 4 today


Mom: can I get a key from you or do you not want me there


Me: I'm running around a lot today idk when I could give you the key or how I'd get it back 


Mom: that makes me feel great


Mom, a few minutes later: please



At this point I just left her on read


For added context without getting too much into it"" when I moved out about two years ago she wouldn't let me take my mattress or my bed frame because ""she bought it for the room"" and I couldn't take the AC unit I had in my room because they were going to use it but it's literally been sitting in the corner of my old bedroom, uninstalled and unused for the last two years. I purposefully did not give her a key to my apartment because I knew otherwise she would drop in unannounced as she never gave me personal space when I lived with her. 

Anyways AITA?


Update 1:

Hey everyone! Lots of people are asking if there's more reasons I don't have a great relationship with me mom and the answer is yes. She refuses to acknowledge my SA and has asked me repeatedly to visit said relative with her. Additionally I have been her therapist for as long as I can remember and have been the acting mom of the household until I moved out. Additionally she lives with my two siblings (both 21) and has a bf who lives about 90 mins away. She is fully mobile and can drive. The reason I am so wishy washy in my texts is because this is the best way my therapist and I have found to communicate with her without her having a meltdown. I do 100% wish I could be more blunt with her as I am a very blunt person otherwise but it's really difficult

I'm very excited to be an aunt, but I have had to balance that excitement with difficult emotional choices about how much financial support to offer. 
My sister has lead a chaotic life in her teens to now, and frequently changes friends, where she lives, her phone number, etc. While I would love to be close to her, it can feel like walking into a hurricane. 
Now that she is pregnant without much income, I feel very guilty to turn down her frequent requests for money. However, when I do give her money, I try to go about it in a way where I can tell that the money is going to food and not something else. 
My sister doesn't do drugs, but the father of her child and on-off boyfriend has served time for federal drug charges for using and selling cocaine and heroin/fentanyl. I worry that the money I give her may end up going to something completly unintentional on my part due to his influence. 
Typically, when she asks for money, (often to order food) I ask if I can put the order in through the restaurant myself or see the DoorDash order. Usually this results in her asking other people for money instead.

My younger sister 30F booked the camping site and we all paid our share to her 101 each. My sister had decided not to bring her dog or invite my younger brother and his 3 young kids ages 2-6 because she did not want to spend her vacation babysitting,she wanted to drink and relax. My older brother and I agreed as we both work high stress jobs and just really need a break. That brings us to today my sister calls me and informs me that my 6 year old niece will be joining us and that we will be baby sitting her for the trip. I am now considering dropping out of the trip for a few reasons, one I feel blindsided that my sister offered to bring our niece along without consulting anyone first. Also I know she did not contact my older brother about this as she knows he would not be okay with taking her. I adore my niece but babysitting her is really taxing she has severe ADHD and is prone to screaming fits when ever she is told no.

1lpecq5,AITAH for not taking my son’s friend who is our neighbor to events and activities because he’s not potty trained?,"TL;DR:
One of the kids in our neighborhood friend group is 9 and still needs an adult to wipe him after he poops. I don’t think that’s my responsibility, so I don’t include him in activities that take us far from his mom. Other parents apparently have been wiping him, and now I’m being talked about for “excluding” him. AITA for setting this boundary?


I live in a close-knit neighborhood where the kids all play together, go to the same school, and bounce between our homes for meals, sleepovers, and activities. It’s a great dynamic most of the time.

One of the boys (M9) in the group still requires his mother to wipe him after using the bathroom. Again—he’s 9. I’m not here to judge his development, but I am saying this: that is not my responsibility, and I didn’t think it needed to be said out loud.

The kid avoids using the restroom away from home entirely. He’s held it through school days, playdates, even had accidents trying to get back home. If he’s at my place and has to go, he just leaves.

I’m pretty active—I take the kids hiking, camping, geocaching, to hot springs, beaches, golf courses—all-day stuff, far from home. I don’t invite this boy on those kinds of outings because, frankly, I don’t want to be out in the middle of nowhere and have to wipe a 9-year-old kid’s butt. I don’t think that’s a normal expectation to place on anyone outside of his parents.

Recently, another parent vented that they had been wiping this kid, which shocked me. Then I hear that people are saying I’ve been excluding him—and yeah, I have, from situations where it’s absolutely unreasonable to expect me to step in for that kind of care.

So, AITA for not including him in certain activities because I refuse to take on what I consider to be an inappropriate responsibility?",GoDavyGo,4893,0.959999978542328,712,1751406133,2025-07-01 16:42:13,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lpecq5/aitah_for_not_taking_my_sons_friend_who_is_our/,7,2025

I just woke up from a nap maybe 10 mins before we got to the restaurant and I jokingly replied, “Sorry, I don’t allow guests in my house. It might be worse than the motel you picked.” I said it sarcastically, thinking we were still joking around.

Later that night, all three sisters pulled me aside and told me to be “more mindful” around their husbands because I might’ve made a bad impression. They said I sounded unaccommodating and told me they were giving advice “as sisters,” even bringing up the loss of my brother.

I felt blindsided. I wasn’t intentionally trying to be rude but I was tired and made a blunt joke. I live alone, I wear hijab, and it’s not appropriate for me to host a mixed group anyway. I thought it was obvious the comment was a joke in response to their joke.

1lsnj7d,AITA for telling off my 'future' sister in law when she didn't want to invite my younger  brother to her wedding,"I 23f have an older brother, Drew, 26m who is getting married at the end of this summer. To say it lightly me and his fiance, Lacy, 25f, do not get along. She's very stuck up and has made some snide comments to me and my younger brother, Max, 16m. For context Max has always been the black sheep of the family. He is very academically and artistically talented but my father and mother are disappointed in his lack of sports (cliche I know), not to mention they've favored my sister, his twin, Caroline, 16f. Max and Lacy were civil for awhile but I guess I haven't seen them speak in a long time for reasons unknown to me. 

The problem occurred last night when I was asking Lacy about the wedding and how the planning was going. She started telling me her seating chart and showing me what she had planned, I was looking at the chart and Max's name  was nowhere to be found. I don't love Lacy but I'm not going to assume the worst of her, so I asked her where Max's name was and she got suddenly quiet. "" He's not going to be there"", she said. ""You mean not in the wedding party?"", I ask. ""No, he's not invited"", she said it so calmly I'd assume she was talking about the weather. I kept asking her why she wouldn't invite him but invited Caroline. She just said that she feels Caroline is more mature because she is a girl.  


This wedding isn't going to be child free, Lacy has stated this multiple times. I have many little cousins who are being invited, since family is very important to us. Not inviting Max makes no sense. He is a very nice kid, and very mature for his age. Much more mature than Caroline. He never causes problems but like I mentioned earlier, there are some big issues with him not following Drew's and my dad's footsteps in football. I know Lacy is very desperate for my family's approval so maybe outlining Max is the way to do it for her but I have a feeling there's something more to it. 

After what Lacy said about not inviting Max, I stood up and started yelling at her for not including Max.She kind of just ignored what I was saying but when I escalated, Drew came over. As he was walking over she started to cry and make a bigger scene about it. Drew knelt down to comfort her and gave me dirty looks. Once she was inside he turned to me and started yelling at me about being rude to her, when she is under so much stress from planning the wedding and trying to get my family to like her. I understand that my family is closed knit and kind of not welcoming to newcomers but that doesn't excuse her behavior and I told my brother so. I asked him why he didn't want to invite Max and he just told me to stay out of it (Classic move of him). He walked out then and we haven't spoken since last night. 

I don't want to fight with Drew, but I'm standing my ground for Max's sake, Max also doesn't know about any of this yet and I'm hesitant to tell him. My parents have stayed out of it so far but Drew is still set on being mad at me AITA?""",Accurate-Damage-7458,4189,0.959999978542328,855,1751759334,2025-07-05 18:48:54,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lsnj7d/aita_for_telling_off_my_future_sister_in_law_when/,7,2025

1ltdxi1,AITA for telling my friend i don't want to end up like her after she told me to lower my standards?,"I (22F) met Rachel (23F) 3 years ago in university, and we became friends. For context, I have never dated before and I am ok with that, I don't purposefully seek out relationship and I am comfortable being by myself. I have a few close friends and this is enough for me. In contract, Rachel has had a lot of boyfriends, and doesn't like to be single (her words). She met her husband, Max, 2 years ago in one of the uni classes, and they quickly began dating. He isn't the most pleasant guy to be around imo, and they had quite a few big arguments during the relationship. He even tried to flirt with me, and I told Rachel about it, but she dismissed it saying he was probably just trying to butter me up so I help him with homework. He has told some sexist jokes in the past too. Whenever they fought, I always told Rachel she deserves better and to break up with him, but in the end they always made up. He proposed to her after one year, and they got married 4 months ago. However, after they moved in together (in the flat that Rachel's parents pay the rent for) Max became even worse. He never helps out with cleaning or cooking, doesn't really take Rachel out on dates anymore, and whenever she tries to talk to him about it, Max tells her to stop complaining about ""wife's duties"".

So, a few days ago Rachel asked me if I would like to go on a date with one of her friends from high school who is single and is looking for a relationship. I've never been on a date before, so I agreed out of curiosity. We went to a nice restaurant. The guy never asked me a single question about myself back, and after I got tired of coming up with questions about him, we just sat the rest of the meal in awkward silence. We split the bill, and after he walked me to the subway station, he tried to kiss me. I declined as politely as I could and went home.

The next day I met up with Rachel. Apparently she's already heard about how the date went from her friend. She asked me why I rejected him. I told her the reasons I mentioned before, and that I didn't really like the guy. Then she rolled her eyes and said that I need to lower my standards because I'm honestly not that attractive, that I blew maybe my only chance to date, and if I continue like that I'll end up forever alone. Even though she knows I'm fine without a relationship! Also I'm not insecure about my appearance, but hearing my friend say that about me hurt. I got angry and said ""Better to be forever alone than end up like you, with a husband that doesn't respect me"". She started crying and said that I'm being rude when she's just trying to look out for me, and then left. We haven't texted or spoken since.

Honestly I'm not sure if I want to salvage this friendship after finding out this is how Rachel felt about me all this time. However, I feel guilty for saying this to her when I knew it was a sore spot, and also for kinda blaming her for the fact that her husband is awful. So, AITA in this situation?

1lte1fp,AITA for drinking fruit juice when my partner has said he doesn't like it?,"Let me give you some background. I (26F) have been drinking diluted summer fruits juice all my life because I hate drinking water. When I do try drinking water I physically wretch due to the anxiety it gives me trying to drink it. So I stay hydrated by drinking diluted cordial.

When I met my current partner (34M, let's call him Jim) I was drinking 30% cordial 70% water, which I admit now was strong.
About 6 months into my relationship with Jim, he confessed he didn't like me drinking the juice because it made my breath smell bad (of the juice), it stopped me trying new foods and it stopped us from travelling cheap because we would have to pay for baggage just so I can take the juice on holiday. He even compared it to an addiction and how he was able to quit smoking so I can quit this. 

We decided to compromise and 1 year later I had reduced it down to 5% cordial. I was able to take my juice in mini aeroplane bottles and I had to admit I was tasting food better.

However Jim was still not happy and we keep getting into fights about how 'disgusting' it is and it is putting him off wanting to kiss me. I can't even have other fruit flavoured drinks because Jim says it smells and tastes too similar.

So I tried to give it up for him. It has been a month of attempting to drink sugar water. I am getting panic attacks and dehydrated because I'm not drinking enough. I am considering going back to the cordial because of this but I am worried I'd be letting myself and Jim down.

In the past, I usually did most of the chores. My husband does the typical “man” chores” my kids have some of their own chores like doing their own laundry, taking turns sweeping/vacuuming, cleaning their own bathroom, etc. I did a majority of the rest and all of the cooking. 

I am a year into my degree. At the start I was keeping up with the chores I did before, but it quickly wasn’t possible. I asked for help and was told “everything is fine, you’re being too picky”. But over time, my family seems to be getting fed up. 

They’ve been complaining about things a lot lately. From eating frozen meals (I make them myself in a large batch and freeze them for later), to the floors having stains (if you cleaned up skills, they wouldn’t be there!), the stairs have dust and pet fur on them, etc. If they bring it up, I tell them they are capable of handling it, but they just walk away and it doesn’t get done. I’m doing what I can, but between work, school, and everything else at home, it can’t all be done. We aren’t living in squalor, i just can’t get to the finer details like I could before. 

Yesterday my husband came to me while I was doing my homework and said the shower curtain liner in our bathroom was moldy. This pushed me over the edge. 

I had my family come into the living room and told them that if they don’t like how something is, they have able bodies and can deal with it themself. That they have the skills to clean, I have just been taking care of so much they didn’t see. Now I need them to step up. That they don’t like something, they need to step up and take care of it. And how I also plan to redistribute chores. 

My kids were arguing that they shouldn’t have to do more, they’re in school and busy afterwards. I told them that I don’t care, I am busy too! And I can’t do it all. That need to step up or shut up, in nicer terms. That night my husband told me I was too harsh and need to lighten up. He says I was rude and basically telling them their feelings don’t matter and I need to lay off of them. I told him the message wasn’t only for the kids, it was for him too. He needs to step up. 

But afterwards I started to doubt myself and felt too harsh. No one is really talking to me right now. I’m worrying now I was too harsh. I did change up the status quo in the house for my own personal reasons. 

So AITA for telling them if they see something they don’t like, they need to step up and take care of it and not complain about it?",TA_busywife,10993,0.949999988079071,1364,1751846334,2025-07-06 18:58:54,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ltfwg9/aita_for_telling_my_family_if_they_dont_like_the/,7,2025
1lu69qb,"AITA for pulling my daughter from soccer camp and telling her that she can't see her ""ghetto"" friends anymore","Throwaway account

My daughter is in soccer camp twice a week since the beginning of the summer, she is 15. She has made two new friends and I do not like them. They have been over my home once and they were rude, loud, and obnoxious. They made a mess of the house, gave me attitude when I asked them to quiet down (one rolled her eyes and started arguing with me), they were blasting music, and money went missing ( I had 40 dollars on the counter and it disappeared). So I am not the biggest fan of them, and after that I didn't allow them to hangout at our home. My daughter was not a fan of this but still saw them at soccer camp.

The soccer camp is next to a plaza and they allow the kids to get food from the fast-food places. I got a call from the coach that my daughter and her two friends caused issues at Arby's. She recorded it on her phone, her two friends were heckling the fast food worker and left after causing a mess (dumped there drink all over the ground and flipped off the worker). My daughter was recording this and laughing along. TBH I found it disgusting.

I informed her that she is being pulled out of soccer camp because she can't behave by herself and that she won't be seeing those friend anymore. She was very unhappy and started an argument. She told me that I don't like them because they are ghetto and I told her she is correct. They are too ghetto, too loud, too rude, too disrespectful and I am not allowing her near them. She hasn't talked to me since. I shared this with my sister and she basically told me I forgot my roots and to let her see the friends.

Edit: for more contexts, I grew up in a horrible neighborhood and yeah that type of behavior was common where I grew up. Yes I do find that behavior  ghetto as hell

1lv1o01,AITA for telling my husband to choose between me and his smart home obsession?,"I (33F) have been married to Alex for 5 years. He was always into tech, which was fine, the last couple years have gotten out of control with his obsession with making our house ""smart.""

It started innocently with some smart bulbs and a video doorbell. But now everything in our house needs an app or voice command to work. Every door has a smart lock, every window has smart blinds, every outlet has a smart switch, there are smart sensors on all faucets, and he even got a smart toilet I can't figure out how to flush without my phone. (I'm way past asking)

Yesterday was my breaking point. I left work early with a terrible migraine and my phone almost dead at 2% battery. All I wanted was to get inside, take my meds, and rest in a dark room. But our WiFi was down so the smart lock wouldn't work. My phone died before I could try the backup cellular system he installed.

I had to sit on our front porch in the sun with my migraine for two hours waiting for Alex to return. He had disabled the regular key lock because it was a ""security vulnerability."" I borrowed our neighbor's phone to call him, but he was in meetings with his phone on DND.

When he arrived, instead of apologizing, he got excited about adding more backup systems to prevent this from happening again. He completely missed that I don't want more tech solutions. I just want to enter my house without needing an app.

This morning made things worse. I couldn't make coffee because he replaced our normal coffee maker with a fancy smart one that ""learns our preferences"" but needs WiFi to work (which was still down). Even the microwave was unusable because it's connected to his system.

I snapped. I told him he needs to choose between me or this smart home obsession. I'm done living in a house where I need tech support just to turn on lights or use the bathroom. He got defensive, saying I'm being dramatic and should appreciate how he's ""improving"" our home. He claims I'm ""holding back progress"" and this is how all homes will be soon.

Here's the thing: I'm a software developer myself, so I understand home automation. But this isn't about convenience anymore. It feels obsessive and controlling. He's spent thousands on this system and keeps adding more complicated features.

For the first *three months* I didn't have an issue with it but a few weeks ago he had something important sent to the house that he needed asap. He wanted my husband to bring it to him but when my husband when out for drinks he forgot the letter. The next morning (a saturday) this dude calls us over a dozen times at 6am... like my husband didn't answer the first time so his ""friend"" just started calling again and again and again in a super passive aggressive fashion. Eventually my spouse answered the call, grabbed the letter and went to bring it to his ""friend"" like some servant. It was not a pleasant way to be woken up and I told my spouse to tell his friend that we aren't the post office and that he can send his mail elsewhere. Hubby, who is incredibly too kind, thinks I'm over reacting. I dropped the issue but today I found not one but *four* peices of mail including a new bank card and something thick and important looking from the social security office.

1lvuvkt,AITA for shitting down whenever my brother's university plans come up?,"Apologies in advance, this is long — but I feel like I’m going to go crazy if I don’t get some outside perspective.

I (26F) have a younger brother (18M) who’s about to start his undergrad in the US. He’s really excited, and I'm happy for him — but I’m also struggling with a lot of complicated feelings. 

When I finished school, I too had dreams of studying abroad. I went to an international school where almost everyone went on to study in the States. I applied to universities in the US and UK, got a few admits, and was starting to plan my next steps.

Right as everything was coming together, my dad pulled the rug out from under me.

Out of nowhere, he decided I wouldn’t be going abroad — and instead, I’d be going back to our home country. He sent out my applications himself, got me admitted to one of the top engineering schools there, and just told me that’s where I’d be going. End of discussion.

The thing is I never wanted to study engineering. I told him *so many times*, but it didn’t matter. His reasoning was that I needed to “get in touch with my roots.” For context, I’m a third culture kid — spent my entire life abroad, grew up in a different country, and studied in a predominantly American system. His decision felt like exile.

Those four years of university were the worst years of my life. I was stuck in a country I didn’t feel at home in, studying something I had no interest in. I was numb the whole time, and I’ve spent years trying to block it all out. It still fucks me up to this day. My parents know how I feel, but they believe I should be “grateful” to have graduated from such a prestigious university.

After graduating, COVID hit. I was stuck with a degree I didn’t want and no idea what to do. Eventually, I decided I would pursue a Master’s, but this time on my terms. Fast forward three years: I’ve built a life I love, I live in a great country, I have a job I actually care about, and I’m happy.

But now my brother is going to university in the US — the exact path I wanted to take. He said he wanted to study there, and they supported him without hesitation. And I’m finding it impossible to process.

I feel so fucking angry. I feel like I was robbed of a future I could’ve had. Every time someone brings up his college plans, I feel like I’m choking. And so I stay out of family discussions. My parents have noticed, and when I tried to explain why, they called me jealous, fake, and ungrateful. They told me I have no right to be upset since “everything worked out in the end.” They said, I should be supportive and present during this important phase in my brother's life.

But it’s true, I am jealous. Not because I don’t want my brother to have this opportunity — I do. I’m glad he gets to live out his dream. But I’m angry that I didn’t get the same chance. That I was given no choice. I just resent my parents, and the unfairness of it all. And so I stay away.

Question is: AITA for still being upset about this, even though things have worked out for me now?

1lvxapt,AITA for refusing to punish my daughter after she blew up on the classclown that she dint want at her birthday party?,"My daughter is 12 and she goes to a small school. Her grade only has 18 students (10 boys and 8 girls). My daughter also has other friends from the sports she does. We plan to have her go to a much larger high school in the future. Her 13th birthday party was last weekend and I asked who she wanted to invite, she wanted to invite 7 of the girls from her class and 5 from her soccer team. The one girl she doesn't want to invite is name Kelly.

My daughter doesn't like Kelly, she is the class clown in her grade and my daughter hides her annoying and attention seeking. I asked her why she didn't want her there and her response was ""she ruins school for me all the time, I don't want her to ruin my birthday."" I agreed with her list and sent the invites out.

My ex-wife is invited to all her major milestone instead of us doing separate events. I learned an hour beofre the party my ex-wife sent an invte to Kelly since her mom found out about the party. My daughter was not happy to see her (it was a suprise for her), I told her to enjoy the party.

It was going well until the cake came out, my daughter wanted a glitter cake (when you blow out the candles glitter goes everywhere). While everyone was around the cake, Kelly took her fingers and swiped icing off the top layer of the cake. It ruined the cake and my daughter lost it. She yelled at Kelly, basically saying, "" what is wrong with you, this is why I didn't want you her and that you ruin everything."" She ran to her room after and Kelly was crying.

Kelly's parent is wanting an apolgy, my ex-wife wants her to apoligze as well. I am refusing to make her do that or punish her at all. I pointed out that my ex never should have invited her and to the mom that her child ruined the cake, and that at 12 years old should know better.

1lwo8b9,AITA for saying guests could go ahead and leave my 4th of July Party,"I (33F)  hosted a 4th of July party for my friends.  A friend brought their relatively new spouse.  Met him once at a restaurant and spoke for a few minutes.  I have 2 German Shepards, Jameson & Guinness. My house is their house. I chose this property, because it was a good fit for them.   

This friend (32F) dislikes my dogs on a bad day to being tolerant of them on a good day. When they arrived both dogs wanted to say hi, neither my friend or the spouse acknowledged them.    I found that annoying.   Literally everyone else that showed up said hi to my dogs. Like all 20 other people. They sat on the couch when Guinness came up to them.  I see him say something to my friend.  My dogs are the sweetest things ever.  He gently pushed Guinness away and he asked me if I could put the dogs in another room, citing they don't want the dog bothering them during the party.  

I backed up my dogs, told them i'm sorry, but this is Jameson and Guinness's house, you need to deal with it or leave. My dogs live here and they don't get put away for anyone.  If you just pet them, they'll leave you alone.  After a brief convo, they decided to leave. I told them they don't call the shots at my house about my dogs.   The rest of my friends were split on how I acted. Some said it wasn't a big deal to put them in another room for a few hours and others said I was right.  AITA?

1lwow5n,"AITA for ""letting"" my sister go thirsty through an entire meal?","My sister does this thing where she'll just say something she wants with the expectation that someone will do it for her. For example, if she wants the AC turned on, instead of asking someone to turn it on for her, she'll keep repeating things like ""Oh, isn't it super warm in here?"", ""Does anyone else feel really hot?"" or ""I heard that today is a super hot day!"" and if someone asks her if she wants the AC on, she'll reply with ""No, no, I'm good! But if *you're* hot then you should turn it on!""   
  
Anyways, last weekend it was my birthday so my family and I went out to celebrate. During the meal, she kept making comments implying that she wanted another cocktail, but wouldn't order it. The waitress even came by and asked if we needed anything, but she didn't order a drink even when we all did. I could tell she was agitated at that point, but it was my birthday so I just ignored her. 

When we all got home, she got really snippy and said that it was super rude that we all got our own drinks and didn't order one for her. My brother and I brought up that she said no when the waitress asked, but she said that wasn't the issue. In her opinion, we should've known to order her a drink too because everyone else got one, and the fact that we ""let"" her go thirsty was inconsiderate. And that in the future we ought to order her drinks too. She also said that she was only saying ""no"" to the waitress because her family should've ""taken care of her"" (her words, not mine). 

The three of us have been kind of arguing back and forth about it, and I'm just tired of fighting, so I wanted to get some more opinions on whether or not I should've ordered her a drink as well.

1lwqser,"AITA for ""embarrassing"" my more fit coworker?","I am a camp counselor (25M) who works with elementary aged boys. To give some context, I am incredibly short and fat. Like, I am under 5 feet tall and around 200 pounds. This does not affect my ability to do my job. I'm just as active as any other counselor, I work with the kids just as much.I have to get blood tests done regularly for unrelated reasons (related to why I'm so short) and there's never really any concern when it comes to my cholesterol or insulin or anything weight related. I'm just saying this so you have some context for my general appearance and the fact that no, my weight doesn't affect my health or my level of activity.

My co-counselor is a guy around my age who is (I think) a baseball player. We could not look more different. He's got more than a foot of height on me and probably about the same weight, so he's obviously more visibly fit. He brags a lot about how even after we spend all day chasing kids in the sun, he still goes to the gym for a couple of hours. 

The issue is when it comes to actually having to use strength practically, I out do him every time. I'm not trying to do it intentionally. But when we have to carry 20 kids backpacks and he can only handle 8 while I have 12, or when he can't open a jar, or when we have to lug heavy equipment and he's huffing and puffing while I'm not having a problem, it becomes pretty evident that I am just stronger than him, at least for stuff like that. I'm sure he could out bench me or whatever proper fitness stuff is, and trust me he crushes me when we play sports with the kids, I'm just talking about that kind of work.

The issue is that the kids have started to pick up on the fact that I am the ""strong counselor"". If they want to be picked up or can't open something in their lunch or want a break from carrying their bag on a hike, they come to me. Apparently, my co-counselor complained to one of the other counselors that I am ""embarrassing"" him because a guy like me shouldn't be able to be stronger than him. That counselor then came to me and told me I should tone it done because it can be hard for someone who prides themself on being an athlete to be worse at something than a guy ""like me"". I said there was no way I was going to do my job worse just to protect hit ego, and the other counselor said I was being a jerk and as the summer goes on the boys might start bullying my co-counselor if they think he's weaker than me, which I don't think is going to happen but I'm not sure.

1lye9uj,"AITA for throwing out my friend’s couch after it sat in my garage for 3.5 years, even though I said she could only store it for two weeks?","In 2019, a friend asked if she could store a couch in my garage. It had belonged to her late father, and they were clearing out his house.

I said no.

My garage is small. One car and barely any extra room. It isn’t insulated, it leaks, and squirrels basically have squatter rights. I don’t store anything there on purpose. I also told her that people always say they’ll “pick it up soon,” and then never do. Somehow the person doing the favor becomes the villain.

She kept pushing. I offered options:  
– Rent a storage unit  
– Get a U-Haul, take the couch home, and have her kids drive up and get her car  
– Leave it at her dad’s and take the risk

Her niece even borrowed a trailer to bring it to me. All that, just to keep it out of her siblings’ hands.

I finally said yes, but I was crystal clear. Two weeks. After that, I could do whatever I wanted with it.  
She said absolutely. Her kids would be there that weekend to pick it up.

They never came.

I called a few times that first year.  
“Oh yeah, we’ll come get it.”  
Crickets.  
In one of my “please get your couch” calls, she said, “I’m a Sagittarius. We’re not good at this stuff.”  
I’m still not sure what that has to do with picking up your couch.

I tried again in year two. Same story. After that, I gave up. She never once brought it up on her own.

Around year three and a half, I had construction work happening. The crew backed a trailer into the garage and accidentally crushed the couch. When we looked closer, it was already moldy and torn apart by squirrels. The workers felt bad. I told them not to worry. It had been sitting there for years.

We even discussed whether I should tell her. Everyone agreed there wasn’t much point. She hadn’t mentioned it in over three years.

So I didn’t.

Fast forward to this year — now year six. I mention I’m cleaning out the garage and she casually says, “Oh, I need to come get that couch.”

Me: “It’s gone. The squirrels got it.”  
Her: “What?”  
Me: “Yeah. The garage isn’t insulated. They love it in there.”  
Her: “I had no idea.”  
Me: “You did. You just forgot. And I said two weeks.”

She hasn’t spoken to me since. Unfriended. Full stop.

Meanwhile, I lived around that couch. I broke my toe on it. I had to work around it constantly. I paid to have it hauled away. It took up space I didn’t have for three and a half years. The first time she brought it up was in year six.

So I’m really asking:  
Should I have told her back when it got ruined, even though she hadn’t asked about it in years?  
At year six, should I have just said “sure, come get it” and played along, even though I doubt she would have?  
Or was this always going to end the same way, no matter what I did?

**TL;DR:**  
Friend asked to store her dad’s couch “for two weeks.” I said no, then agreed with a firm limit. She left it for 3.5 years. Couch was destroyed. I tossed it and didn’t tell her. She finally mentioned it in year six. Now she’s upset.

1lzyqp8,AITA for not kashering the kitchen for my son?,"Throwaway blah blah. I grew up Orthodox Jewish but it wasn’t the lifestyle for me and I left while remaining very culturally Jewish. My husband is Jewish and I raised our children to be very in touch with their cultural identity (sent them to Jewish schools and sleepaway camps) but don’t really practice the religion in terms of keeping the Sabbath, following the dietary laws, etc.

Our son is 19 and has, over the past two years, become pretty religious. He spends the Sabbath with friends, which is fine with us. We have tried to compromise on the dietary laws by purchasing kosher meat/poultry for him, not mixing meat and dairy, etc. we live in an area with a large Jewish community and he has cart blanche to use Apple Pay to buy himself whatever food he wants. 

Because I grew up in the community I know the rules and do the best I can for him while not limiting myself to a culture that I chose to leave.

I recently found out from one of my other kids that he is annoyed that we haven’t converted one of our ovens (we have two) into a kosher oven for his use, or purchased separate dishes for him etc.

Sibling was like “Did you ask Mom and Dad to do any of this?”

Son was like “no, mom grew up with all of this so she definitely knows what I need and is choosing not to do it.”

Sibling pointed out he can’t be mad if he doesn’t ask while ALSO pointing out that Son is 19 and that this is our house and if he’s that pressed he can get his own place and do what he wants.

Fact is, I don’t want to. I cook and bake a lot. I like having two ovens. I don’t want to relive the exhaustion of a kosher (semi-kosher) kitchen, though I could.

She said her mom doesn’t let her drink sugary drinks. Then she pointed at a shelf where there are small boxes of unsweetened almond milk, saying that those are okay. So I got one of those for her.

1m02rxj,AITA for letting my boyfriend tell a friend to find her own ride home from the beach?,"Took a friend to the beach after she’d been begging to go. She brought no money, ate our food, drank my alcohol, then disappeared to make out with two random guys. We stopped our day to look for her, made eye contact, and got ignored.

She has a pattern of flaking, mooching, and crossing boundaries like commenting on my looks, smacking my butt, and getting upset when I didn’t want her sleeping in my bed. My boyfriend’s always been uncomfortable with how clingy she is with me.

When she finally showed back up, he told her she could ride with the guys she was with since she clearly wasn’t with us. She started crying, and he still told her she could ride back with us, but it’s not fair for her to disappear and treat us like a free ride. She chose to leave and turned her location off. Now she’s acting like we abandoned her.

1m0uegm,AITA For letting a family fail an escape room on purpose,"I (M24) work at an Escape for a second job, and throughout the week days I'm usually by myself as there aren't a lot of bookings for rooms. One of these times, I had a booking for a group of 7. The group gets here and it's a Mother, 4 Daughters and 2 boyfriends of the Daughters. All of them appear to be at least 20 or older except for the youngest Daughter who, at the oldest, was around 13. I take the family back to the room and explain everything, then let them Start the room. The second I sit down in the control to watch them, I notice only the boyfriends, who have never done an escape room, and the mom seem excited and are looking around. The daughters start looking around eventually and even find one of the puzzles for the room. They start working on it and not even 2 minutes go by and the mom swoops in, takes the puzzle, and makes them go look elsewhere as she worked on it. That was how the rest of the room went, the kids would find the stuff, and the mom would take over and make them leave. The youngest, getting fed up with this, decides to just sit down and wait in the first part of the room, (This escape room had 4 separate rooms for them to go through). After the group gets to the 3rd room, the mom storms into the first room and tells the little girl to stop pouting and come join them, then before she can respond, the mother tells her ""You're ruining this experience for everyone. I wish I didn't bring you""... I was flabbergasted... how could anyone speak to thier daughter that way? Eventually they're nearing the end and all they need is to find a key fob to open the door and escape. In thier haste, they miss it and the mom keeps asking if I can give them a clue to where it is. Here is where I might have been the asshole. They had already used all 3 of thier clues and I was feeling petty, so I told them that unfortunately I wasn't allowed to tell them any clues on its location, even though I totally could and my boss would have preferred I told them... but I was alone so I decided that I wasn't going to help. 30 seconds left and the little girl who had been yelled at by her mother found the key fob they needed, smiled, put it back where she found it, and walked away without a word to her family. The timer goes off and I come back to the room, saying the did a good job but unfortunately weren't able to escape. The mom was pissed and starting blaming the kids but eventually calmed down, thanked me for all the help and left. The kids slowly followed and the last one to leave was the youngest daughter. I asked her why she didn't show them the key she found and she smiled and said "" Well my mom already said I ruined the experience for her, for I made sure she couldn't win"".

1m1pky4,"AITA if I don't want to meet biological kids I have never seen, did not raise, etc?","When I was 32 years old, I was married with three young children and both my husband and I were struggling with full time jobs, him also with school, and life in general.  I found out about a program where I could ""sell"" my eggs.  I went through a company a friend knew about, did one cycle of shots/hormones, and they retrieved 15 eggs.  I posted my info on the site and a couple from California contacted me, as wife did not produce eggs and could not carry baby.  They were interested in my eggs in particular because I already had three healthy children, and they both had red hair and green eyes; as do I and all of my children.  They ended up having 3 healthy children, which I guess are technically half me biologically and half her husband.  This happened over the course of a few years with a surrogate.  I never saw pictures, didn't ask to, and didn't communicate with them after the last child.  I received $5000 at the time and it was sorely needed for anything from medical bills to daycare costs and day to day expenses.

My current boyfriend is absolutely apalled that #1 - I never told him about this and just brought it up in normal conversation, #2 - that the action itself was completely ethically wrong, and #3 - how can I function knowing I have three biological children in CA somewhere I will never meet or so and my genetics or just ""out there.""

1m3e5ty,AITA for telling my nephews no cake after they were told they could have cake?,"This happened a week ago and I have no remorse but my in laws are still upset over it. 

My sister in laws birthday was last week. I spent the day making it special for her, driving her around to her favorite stores and spots around town until eventually her friends had a suprise birthday party for her that was our last stop. 

She had way too much to drink and I had to drag her out of the party when her mom called me multiple times to get home to pick up our kids. It took me an hour and her friends kept booing me but eventually we were on our way home but she kept demanding I take her to other friends houses the whole time. I said no, it's 8:30pm and we need to pick up our kids. She was upset at me but ended up passing out anyway.

We got to my mother in laws house to pick up the kids and while I was in the bathroom, I heard my mother in law talking to my sister in laws sons and telling them that they can have cake at my house (they were going to stay the night at my house so my sister in law can have a peaceful night).

I was already so frustrated and tired and when I heard that, I was done. I walked out and helped everyone get ready. My mother in law was handing me the cake and asked ""Oh, can you take this?"" I just looked at her and said ""No."" And walked away. 

The boys all pouted and the older one started crying. I just didn't care. I got them all packed up and told them that it's bedtime and we aren't having sugar but we can have cake tomorrow. The older one bawled again and had a fit the whole way home. 

The next day, I brought them over, all the kids had cake, everything was fine. But my SIL and MIL think I overreacted, that I was being horrible and mean to the boys. I wanted to tell them so bad that saying no is not a bad thing but I just kept my mouth shut. It's been a week and they are still bothered by it.

1m47ks1,AITA for not sharing my food with my in-laws,"I (24F) grew up with 2 sisters so of course I was constantly forced to share everything especially food with them. My husband (27M) was an only child. 

We live with his mom for the moment and what bothers me the most every time I bring home fast food or any other food for myself or the both of us, he offers it to his mother. I wouldn’t have an issue picking up something for her as well but when he goes and offers something I bought for myself that I was excited to eat it irks me a little bit. 

Well recently I was really craving Italian food. Stuffed shells to be exact. My husband and I agreed to go pick up something from the local Italian place and bring it home to eat. Well we get home and he instantly offers his mother some of our food but this time I protested and said she can have some of his dish because I wanted mine for myself. He immediately got an attitude with me and said I wasn’t going to eat it all (the dish only had two large stuffed shells??) and told me I was being stingy. His mom I guess kinda read the room and said she would just have some of his. He then doubles down and basically tells her to take the other shell from my plate and puts it on her plate for her. This is was really irritated me because I then ended up still hungry after because half my dinner was given to his mom. He offered some of his to me but he KNEW I didn’t like what I got.

1m527cz,AITA for wanting my parents to pay me the money back that my brother stole from me,"My brother (14) has been stealing cash from my bedroom for almost 2 years now. I rarely have cash but when I do I either put it in my desk or in my wallet. I used to just leave it out but then some of it, or all of it, would randomly disappear and I would get in trouble for loosing it even though I knew it wasn't me. So about a year ago I asked my brother if he really did steal from me the one time almost 2 years ago now and he laughed and confirmed that he did. I still have not got that money back and probably never will.

Because I'm pretty forgetful I always leave my wallet in my purse which is always in my room, I've tried to hide it from him before but then I end up just forgetting about it myself so I went back to just leaving it in my purse. In the last 3 months since I've been home from uni he's stolen over 150 dollars from my wallet, as well as earbuds and full cans of alcohol that I left in the fridge. I'm broke and trying to save money for school, so I work hard for the money I make. Any money or anything that I buy myself is pretty important to me no matter what it is.

My parents say it's my fault because I should be hiding my stuff better but its frustrating to have to hide my own things in my own room. I want to ask them if they could pay me back all the money that he's taken, even though it's not there fault, but every dollar counts for my savings. Idk what I should do.

1m52myo,AITA for telling my roommate's friend about my heritage?,"I 21F am half Mexican and half Chinese. My parents came to the US before I was born, but thought it was very important for me to learn their native languages and participate in both of their cultures. Because of this, I can speak Spanish and Mandarin. Both of my parents also loved cooking, so growing up we ate a lot of traditional Mexican and Chinese dishes as well as some blended fusion meals as well.

A few nights ago, I was cooking dinner at my apartment. I was making one of those fusion dishes, but I got stuck on a particular step, so I called my mom to ask for help and we talked in Spanish. I was on the phone when my roommate, Ann 23F, came home with her friends, who I was not told were coming over.

Later, one of the guys from the group came into the kitchen and asked what I was making because it smelled  good. I explained the dish was created by my parents to blend Mexican and Chinese cuisine. He then asked why I was speaking on the phone in Spanish earlier, so I told him that I’m half Mexican and half Chinese, and that I grew up speaking both Spanish and Mandarin with my parents. He seemed genuinely interested and asked me more about the languages and the cooking, so we ended up talking for a while about my background and how food and language are such a big part of my life.

The next day, I found out through my other roommate that Ann had told her I was showing off and flirting with her friend. This pissed me off because I wasn't trying to flirt with him and he was the one who started the conversation with me. I tried to talk to Ann about this, but she just seemed annoyed and told me that it was obvious how it looked and I should be more mindful when she has her friends over. I told her that I can't be ""mindful"" if she doesn't even warn me about having company over. She said that she doesn't have to get my permission to invite people to the apartment. I was getting irritated by this point so I let the conversation die down after this.

It's been so awkward ever since this happened and every time I see her she's short with me and barely acknowledges me. I'm starting to wonder if I behaved out of line. AITA?

1m5usmr,AITA for telling my mom she’s not my kids mom?,"
Throwaway because I just want a verdict and to be done with it. So for background I 28f and my husband 30m have two kids. 7m and 4f. My mother is actually a great grandmother. She lives the kids and is very helpful but she has this habit overstepping. 

So both our kids do chores. We give them things to do that they’re capable of doing. Like my son does the dishes sometimes after dinner. My daughter will help set and clean up the table afterwards. Those kinds of things. My mom came to visit us recently and I’ve been noticing she’s being doing this thing. She stops my son from whatever chore he’s doing and does it for him but if she sees my daughter doing something she won’t. At first I thought she just didn’t want her grandkids to do work because she often calls me a cold mother for making them do chores but then I figured out the pattern and it rubbed me the wrong way because I remembered she used to do the same thing to me. My brothers would do nothing while I did everything so I started correcting her and making my son finish his chores himself which made her really agitated. Yesterday we were having dinner and my daughter and husband were clearing up the table because it was my son’s turn to do the dishes. She tried stopping him but I told him to the dishes and took her outside. She told me I’m so cold for making my son wash dishes and why couldn’t I do it, I explained to her that we like to split chores evenly in the house and if he’s capable he should(it was like 5 plates and cups and a few spoons). She kept going and she called me lazy (something she would often do whenever I asked my brothers to help me out with chores). 

Here’s where I may be an asshole. I told her ‘she’s one to talk after making me clean up after everybody my whole life’ . I told her I’m not going to enable my son to be ‘f*cking’ losers like her sons. My little brother literally had to be spoon fed until he was ten because he refused to eat if my mom didn’t feed him. I was apparently ill treating my son by making him do all these chores. I told her ‘I’m teaching him to be independent and that she may have raised two boys but she’s not my kids mom so she should f*ck off when I’m trying not turn my son into an incompetent asshole.’ She left crying. My dad called and told me she’s moping around.  My husband says it was deserved but he really doesn’t like my mother because he’s seen over the years how she treats me compared to how she treats my brothers. Did I go too far and any advice is appreciated.Thank you.

1m6svtc,AITA for not constantly helping my friend with her toddler,"I (29F, childless) have recently had an argument with my friend (33F, one son aged two) because I was not constantly available to help her take care of her son after her husband left. 

We met during college and have known each other for 8 years now. We were very tight during the first years of our friendship but have grown apart after her marriage, because of our busy schedules (we both have very demanding jobs with night shifts) and because our lifestyles became too different, but have remained  in contact. 

She has informed me last summer that her husband was planning to leave the country for an opportunity at his job, for an indefinite period of time. I asked her how she was planning to take care of her infant son on her own, especially during her night shifts. She said that she would « figure it out » and added « you could stay the night at our house when I’m on call, so that if I have to leave, [name of her son] wouldn’t be alone ». I figured that she meant that she would hire a nanny (she and her husband definitely have the means) and ask me to help if she didn’t have any other option, which I would’ve been glad to do. I should also mention that she lives far from my home and my workplace (approximately a 40 minutes drive). 

Cut to this summer, her husband has left and I have received multiple texts asking me to stay the night at her place multiple times a month. I was very confused at first and has since understood that she didn’t make any arrangements and is fully expecting me to babysit her son whenever she is on-call (her family lives far away and she says that she doesn’t have any other friends she can ask). Which is problematic for me since I work multiple late nights each week and have very little free time. I’ve had a burnout a couple of months ago (which she is aware of) and am still trying to recover, mostly by trying to make the most of the few moments when I’m not at work. 

I’ve tried to explain this to her and said that I would help her when I could but that she couldn’t reasonably expect me to be there every single time. It turned into an argument where she called me selfish, said that she was there for me during my darkest moments (which is true, her husband and her helped me during a breakup a few years ago, but I thought it was unfair to bring that up since I’ve also helped her during low times). She said that I would rather « have fun » than be there for her when she desperately needs me to. 

I don’t know what to think anymore, I feel very guilty but at the same time, it seems unfair that I would have to shoulder this responsability, especially when things aren’t going me so well in my own life. I also fear that she would become entirely reliant on me, since her husband is planning to stay abroad for an indefinite period of time.",ExplanationUnited848,1750,0.9700000286102296,179,1753225006,2025-07-22 17:56:46,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1m6svtc/aita_for_not_constantly_helping_my_friend_with/,7,2025
1m7m35l,AITA for forcing my diet on my boyfriend?,"I’m from France originally, and I moved to the states almost 2 years ago. Now for some reason, the food here makes me sick. Not in an “Ew, that’s gross.” Kind of way. But actually physically sick. My body seems to struggle to digest it. Whether it’s take out or fancy restaurant food. Either I can’t go to the bathroom for days, or I’m violently vomiting. I tried dealing with it for months and months, but I started losing weight very quickly because I couldn’t eat. I ended up developing a serious aversion to food, and my family recommended I go and speak to a specialist.

I had never had a problem back home, and I was terrified I was seriously ill. So I went to multiple doctors where I was poked and prodded and I had multiple tests done. They have all said nothing is wrong with me physically.

I spoke to a dietitian and he explained that my body is probably not used to the amount of salt and preservatives that is found in the food in the states. (Please don’t think I’m bashing the US! I love it here and it’s a great country.) My dietician recommended fresh and organic produce to see how my body coped, and to my delight, I improved.

I stopped vomiting and I was able to start slowly putting weight back on. I started making meals from scratch and meal prepping to save time throughout the week. My dad is actually a chef back home, so he was more than happy to send me some recipes to keep my diet interesting. I made a delicious vegetarian lasagna from scratch, and put it in the oven to cook. My boyfriend (American) came home after work and asked what was for dinner. I said I was making a veggie lasagna. He rolled his eyes and said he was sick of “that organic crap” and wanted a cheeseburger.

The comment hurt. I made a real effort at meal times to keep it varied so we’re not always eating the same thing. I said I couldn’t make one because I didn’t even have any burger buns. He said it was unfair to “make” him eat my diet. I had never realized he was opposed to it. He benefited from home cooked meals and I had seen that his clothes were fitting him better. He had more energy and he didn’t sleep so much on the weekends. I apologized and said I didn’t mean to make him feel forced.

1m7n3cw,AITA for leaving my mom to drown in work?,"I’ve worked with my mom since 2022. She owns a small business that made \~$60–100k/year when I joined. I helped her grow it to \~$380k last year. I manage most of the business side and also do service work.

About a year in, she offered to make me an equal partner. I said no. I want to move out of state and don’t want to be tied down. Still, she defers to me a lot, especially with things she doesn’t understand.

Recently, she decided to reintroduce a service I strongly disagreed with. I don’t hate the service itself, but when she and her husband offered it years ago, it led to them working past midnight, often needing my help, even when I had school early the next day. It turned me off the whole industry for years, despite being good at it and enjoying the work.

She wanted to add the service again due to recent legal changes that could hurt the business. She sees this as future-proof. I partly agree, but I think it’ll eventually be impacted too. I pushed for a pivot to a related but new area. It’s slower growth, but healthier long term.

I told her the business is already disorganized and overwhelmed, and the new service is fast-paced and deadline-heavy. She agreed in theory, but said my idea wouldn’t scale fast enough. When I kept pushing back, she pulled the “it’s my business” card. I told her that’s her right, but I wouldn’t sacrifice my work-life balance again and would quit if forced to.

We eventually agreed: if the new service required after hours work, she’d handle it herself.

That was six weeks ago. Since then, I’ve already stayed late once because she didn’t know how to use the tech. She also asked me to stay late tomorrow for an unrelated deadline, and I agreed. Today, I finished my work early and said I’d clock out to offset overtime. She was clearly annoyed.

Later, she texted saying she’s overwhelmed (from the new service). I didn’t respond because I didn’t know how to without saying “I told you so.”

I feel bad. But I’ve warned her for years that the business is too disorganized and unsustainable. She always shut down suggestions because they’d require slowing down.

Also, our history is complicated. She made big decisions when I was younger that negatively affected me. I’ve had to deal with trauma from some of them. I’m tired of paying the price for her choices.

I’m exhausted and emotionally drained, and the same issues affecting the business are affecting my mental health too. She even suggested I take an extra day off, but there’s always “something urgent” that comes up.

Now she’s overwhelmed, and I feel guilty. But I knew this would happen, and I don’t want to be the fallback again. If I say yes once, it’ll become the norm.

So, AITA for not helping her now, even though I know she’s drowning?",EducationalShift6857,2342,0.9800000190734864,133,1753309161,2025-07-23 17:19:21,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1m7n3cw/aita_for_leaving_my_mom_to_drown_in_work/,7,2025
1m7nrky,"AITA for not giving my nephew food I cooked just for my husband, daughter, and myself, even though we live in the same house?","We live in a multigenerational house, but we have separate households under one roof. My husband, our daughter, and I have our own household – we buy our own groceries, cook our own meals, and take care of ourselves independently. My in-laws (husband’s parents), his sister, and her son (my nephew by marriage) form a separate household within the same house.

One morning, I cooked a small, portioned lunch just for myself, my daughter (1,5 years old), and my husband. I didn’t make extra because I had no idea anyone else would be eating with us. Meanwhile, my father-in-law was cooking a separate meal for his other grandson (my nephew(4 years old), who decided he wanted spinach – which happened to be what I was making.

The spinach dish was specifically prepared for the three of us, but out of courtesy, I gave my nephew a ladle of it. He didn’t even end up eating it.

I felt upset because I had to give up part of my husband’s portion to serve a child who isn't mine – especially when I hadn’t planned for it and had made just enough. I’ve cooked for him many times before, but this time I portioned the food precisely because I didn’t know he and my daughter would be eating together.

After lunch, my mother-in-law told me that “ethically and morally,” I should serve all children the same. I felt judged, as if I’d done something cruel, even though I tried to share what I could.

To my relief, my father-in-law defended me and said I’m not obligated to feed a child who isn’t mine. That set off an all-day argument between him, my mother-in-law, and my sister-in-law once she came home.

So now I’m left wondering – AITA for not setting aside a full portion for my nephew, given we live in the same house but maintain separate households?",Few-Cardiologist7291,1775,0.9200000166893004,392,1753310838,2025-07-23 17:47:18,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1m7nrky/aita_for_not_giving_my_nephew_food_i_cooked_just/,7,2025
1m8i37v,AITA for expecting my bf to grab a bag for me,"I (20f) was at my bfs house (20m) yesterday. Im on my period and keep a few tampons in my purse, but had a ton in the bag I brought over, along with my change of clothes. When I went over I went to talk to his mom in the kitchen, and we talked for a few minutes and I left my bag there. I went to his room and he was playing games at his desk and I was on his bed.

I started bleeding and went to the bathroom and realized I bled trough my underwear and a little trough my pants. I checked my purse and saw I had no tampons as I forgot to refill it since I had filled the duffel bag, I realized I couldn't just go to the kitchen as I now didn't have pants and I couldn't even leave the bathroom because someone might be there. I called my bf and he told me to let him finish his game. I asked him how long that would take

He said that it would be like 20ish minutes till he could help me since him and his friends just got into a new game. I asked if he expected for me to just wait cramping, in the bathroom him and his sister SHARE, for 20 minutes. He told me that me not having tampons in my purse wasn't his problem and that he wasn't going to sell his game for me. I said that he was being really mean. When he finally came I told him I was upset that he made me wait and he told me that he didn't know what I expected him to do and that I needed to manage myself better. I said even if I did, I still would have bled trough, which is why I couldn't leave. He told me that I could have figured it out. I told him that I literally couldn't and he just said whatever and I went home a little after that and I'm starting to think that I could have planned a little better for it.",DiscussionMental7742,3671,0.949999988079071,1135,1753395535,2025-07-24 17:18:55,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1m8i37v/aita_for_expecting_my_bf_to_grab_a_bag_for_me/,7,2025
1m9c0n0,AITA for not telling my dad I will not pay for my brothers college?,"Had an argument with my dad the other day, and he told me that my parents will pay for my college fully but I would have to completely pay for my brothers entire university tuition if I want them to pay for my college. If not, I would have to take out a student loan.

I told him no way I can pay for someone's college tuition right out of college. 

A little bit of background, we are pretty well off and have a nice home in a gated community. My parents afford enough to go on nice trips, they pay for all my extracurriculars, I've never had to work for my family, and I can use their money to go out with my friends. I know I am extremely privileged, and I know based on my parents line of work, they could pay for my brother. My brother is a smart kid and definitely aiming for an out-of-state school, I do not think it is feasible for me to have to pay 80k+ a year with my starting salary to pay off his college tuition.

I said I would definitely help out my parents financially in other ways, but I could not do this. I also have been applying to scholarships so my parents don't have to pay for my college fully.

However, my dad said I am being selfish, and the financial burden on them is too high.

1ma3zye,AITA for going back on my promise to help my sister pay for her wedding when she wouldn’t move the date?,"Hi Reddit. So I (28M) have an older sister “Tina”(30F). When I was 15, I met a girl in the same grade called “May”(15F). May and I clicked instantly and we started dating a few weeks after. May and I dated through the rest of high school and college and I asked her to marry me when we were 22. We got married at 23 and had our son at 24. May unexpectedly passed away in a car accident when our son was 2, so 2 years ago. I’m still devastated and genuinely don’t think I’ll ever date or get married again. My whole family really liked May and we all took her loss hard. Except for Tina. 

Tina didn’t have a lot of luck with boyfriends during high school or college. Until she met Daniel (32M) she had never even been on a date. I know she felt really jealous that I got married and “started a life” first but other than that we were warm with each other. She was polite and respectful at May’s funeral and I thought she had gotten past the jealousy thing. 

Apparently not. Tina and Daniel started dating about 6 months after May died (1.5 years ago) and I was really happy for her. They got engaged 4 months ago and are planning their wedding for summer 2026. When they first got engaged Tina asked me if I would be willing to help cover some costs. Despite raising my son alone, I work a good job and make a lot more than Tina or Daniel, and I really wanted my sister to be happy so I said yes. Well, they just revealed their wedding date. 

Yes, you guessed it. Tina and Daniel are planning to get married on the same day that May and I were married. She “gave me a heads up” by texting me last week and letting me know. I asked her if she was mental and why would she do this. She said that it was the date they liked, and they had every right to pick it. Her and I went back and forth for a few days where I kind of begged her to reconsider. She did not. She posted it to Facebook yesterday. 

I sent her a text saying that she was in her right to pick the date, but that I would not be in attendance or contributing financially. She freaked out, repeatedly calling and texting. She called our mother who started to call and text me and word spreads fast in family so now everyone knows and it seems like the family is split in three sides. Half of the family says that I am in the right. Tina says I’m being an AH, both for not coming and not paying, and there are some cousins supporting her. Mom says that I don’t have go, but I should keep good on my promise. I don’t know. I feel like I’m in the right, but I need some objective opinions.",aitathrowawawa,3582,0.9300000071525574,655,1753563126,2025-07-26 15:52:06,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ma3zye/aita_for_going_back_on_my_promise_to_help_my/,7,2025
1ma53vh,AITA: Did I cross a line by calling the hotel to check on my adult daughter when she wasn’t responding?,"Throwaway account.

I’m (57F) a mom. My daughter (31F) is married, and they live on the East Coast while my husband and I are on the West Coast. We’re close, and she and I mostly communicate by text. We both have iPhones and share our locations through Find My.

Recently, she flew out to a city about an hour from where I live for a job interview. She had been traveling all day and landed around 9 PM local time; which, for her, was midnight. We exchanged a few light texts after she landed. She mentioned she was going to get a burger at In-N-Out.

After that, I sent a few more texts. One wishing her good luck on the interview and another with a picture of our family dog, which she absolutely adores and usually replies to right away.

But I didn’t hear back.

I also texted a reminder to be careful since I know the area where her hotel is located can be a little sketchy. Still no response.


At that point, I started to feel uneasy. I don’t usually check her location, but I opened Find My and saw her phone was showing up at what looked like a residential address: not a hotel. I called her twice. No answer.

Eventually, I noticed there was a hotel next to that location, but she hadn’t told me the name, so I wasn’t sure. I waited about 20 minutes to give her time to settle in, and then I called the front desk. I knew they couldn’t confirm if she was staying there, but they offered to call the room.

My daughter was in bed, asleep, and got startled when the hotel phone rang. She figured it was probably me and told the receptionist she’d call me back.

She did, but was very upset. She told me to never do that again. She said I crossed a line, that I was being “weird” and overbearing, and that she’s 31 and can take care of herself. She added that if anyone should be calling to check in, it should be her husband, not her mom.

Did I cross a line? I really wasn’t trying to overstep, I was just worried when I didn’t hear back and saw what looked like an odd location. But I do understand she’s an adult and wants boundaries. It’s just hard to turn off the mom instinct.",Throwaway_concerned8,1764,0.8100000023841858,1373,1753565995,2025-07-26 16:39:55,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ma53vh/aita_did_i_cross_a_line_by_calling_the_hotel_to/,7,2025
1mbtusi,AITA for not allowing Airbnb guests to use my patio,"I bought a flat as an immigrant a few years ago in a bad reputation street of a bad reputation city in a bad reputation country in Europe. 

I won't say that it was just luck, but the country became an attractive country to visit, the city developed a lot, and my street, being in the center, became very attractive to visitors. 

Now my street has been fully renovated and so has the façade of my building, because we got public funds for that. But the inside is still prewar grey because we are fine with it. 

My flat is the only one that opens to the courtyard and after speaking to the neighbours they were all enthusiastic for me to turn my corner of the courtyard into something pretty, on whichever way I felt. In this kind of buildings it is defined how much each apartment owns of the land, but not delimited. So I own, let's say, 5% of the land. Usually I would use it for a parking space but it is not like you have a delimited parking space and since I don't drive I asked the neighbours if I could take the corner next to my door as mine. This was a no parking space and everyone enthusiastically agreed to let me make a mini garden/patio. 

After the city and the street blew up with tourism someone did some legal trickery to buy the flats on top of mine that were supposed to be saved for low income people and turn them into Airbnb. We are not happy about it for many reasons, starting with those flats were supposed to be for actual low income people. 

But to the actual conflict: I let my neighbours use my patio, but I've been kicking Airbnb guests out of it. Apparently the Airbnb host posts pictures of my little corner of the courtyard as a public space. I don't think it's a public space since I own part of the land and the Airbnb owner does not, and it has been accepted that this is my portion of the land. 

Now the Airbnb owner is saying that he will sue me for discrimination since I share my little patio with the other neighbours but I don't allow tourists in it and he has had some negative reviews. 

I'm absolutely safe legally, but morally am I the asshole for not allowing tourists in my space when I let neighbours use it?",DisneyWitchyGirl,7453,0.9399999976158142,357,1753740221,2025-07-28 17:03:41,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mbtusi/aita_for_not_allowing_airbnb_guests_to_use_my/,7,2025
1mbu5xt,AITA for yelling at my partner who keeps buying crappy branded food when I’ve asked him not too,"My partner (M37) and I (F38) have two young kids and we are well and truely in the trenches with our newborn at the moment. Both of us are like ships in the night, barely have time to think or do anything and our routine has been shot to bits managing our newborn. 
He has taken on the responsibility of going to the supermarket more these days as he finds the walks enjoyable and takes our toddler out whilst I’m home with the new born. 
I sometimes buy myself a coconut water as a treat as I love this one brand. Recently he’s been buying some coconut water for me because he knows I love it. 
But when he’s at the shops he grabs the cheapest brand coconut water but I cannot stand the taste of it and have asked him calmly several times to not buy that brand and to please spend the extra dollar to buy the other brand one that I really enjoy. (So back note, my husband is the stingiest cheap scape known to man and he’s actually admitted to me his money saving isn’t normal compared to others. We both have seriously well paying jobs and are not financially stressed at all, he just loves a bargain and buys the no name brand everything alllll the time) 


He says he just grabs the one mindlessly and doesn’t mean to upset me but he’s done it 5 or 6 times now, and the last time I didn’t get angry at him I just got him to really focus and explained my frustrations and for him to please stop buying that brand, it tastes gross, its not a treat for me and to please get the other brand that I would occasionally but and he was like yep ofcourse and said he would (like he has every other time, but I thought sortof explaining it more it would sink in) Then today he brought home the shit wee tasting stuff AGAIN and I just lost it. We’ve had a huge weekend, I’m sick and a coconut water would have been the nicest treat for me but bringing home the brand I cannot stand felt like it was the biggest punch in the gut to me. When I saw it, I was literally shook, I just lost it and yelled at him and was like WTF did you buy this shit again and threw the carton in the bin without even opening it. He was like woah woah woah I didn’t do it on purpose. I then yelled what is wrong with you?! Like why do you keep doing this and he just walked out of the room so it ended there. 

He got really upset with me and said I’d made him cry by yelling at him and made our toddler upset (cos he got a bit scared when I yelled). The whole thing felt like a complete set up to me and I don’t know after asking 5-6 times previously patiently and calmly how to not get to a point of just cracking up and yelling for him to stop buying that stuff because it feels like a constant reminder of how much he doesn’t care about me after asking him to stop buying it several times.

1mbv5wi,AITA for hiding my baby bump and telling the father that he shouldn't bother showing up for the birth?,"I (24F) have been with my boyfriend (28M) for 5 years now and I am pregnant with my first baby. We've been trying to get pregnant now for about a year so we were both super excited when we found out. I am now 21 weeks pregnant and have a super noticeable bump. I absolutely adored seeing my bump at first, as did my boyfriend, but now it's something that I've become very insecure about.

For context, I have always looked extremely young for my age. Even though I'm 24, I genuinely still look like a teenager. It's never been something that's bothered me especially, but now that my bump visibly shows, I've noticed that I've been receiving very judgemental looks when I'm out in public. It's blatantly obvious that people think I'm a pregnant teen and they don't like or support it. My boyfriend has never noticed these looks so it's something I've kept to myself. But it's become something so bad to me that it makes me not want to go outside. So I'll wear clothing that hides it the best it can.

My boyfriend has recently noticed this and accused me of not wanting the baby. I tried to explain the real reason I'm hiding it but he ended up telling me ""Maybe you weren't ready to be a mam if you're this embarrassed by it"".

We don't usually fight but hormones have been acting crazy so I just snapped at him. I told him that he should support me during this instead of guilt tripping me and that if he can't even support me through this, then maybe he shouldn't even be around when the baby actually actually gets here, as he'll clearly show no support there either. That not only am I dealing with the physical affects of pregnancy, but I'm also dealing with the emotional affects of it. That everywhere I go I'm being judged like I'm a knocked-up teen girl who made a mistake, and the person who should make me feel the safest is the one ridiculing me.

We haven't spoken properly in a few days, and he's telling me that I overreacted and that he's hurt by what I said. I know I went too far but I was just so angry and hurt.

1mco56v,AITA for not being 'present' for a once in a lifetime trip?,"A while ago my family (mom, dad and older sister) and I (19M) went on a trip to Europe. We had been planning it for the better part of a year, watched all the travel vlogs we could, researched places to go, made itineraries, the works. My mom and sister especially put a lot of effort into planning the trip and did a really great job at doing everything.

A few days before the trip I had an appointment with my doctor. Without going into too many details, he referred me to a specialist because he thought it might be cancer. He said that it was probably nothing to worry about, but it was better to be safe than sorry in the case that it was cancer. Unfortunately, I couldn't get an appointment with the specialist until after the trip. My family was great and super supportive, and promised me that everything was going to be okay. I really didn't want it to ruin the trip.

I like to think that I'm a pretty chill guy. I don't let a lot of stuff get to me and I can usually put things to the back of my mind and not think about them. This time, I was worried. Even though the doctor said it was probably nothing, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was really wrong. I was okay when we were busy because I could distract myself, but in any downtime I kind of spiralled.

Whenever we weren't talking and were waiting in a line, or on a bus driving somewhere, or at the hotel or something I couldn't stop spiralling. It started with convincing myself that it absolutely was cancer, then to what treatment would be like, then to that I was probably going to die and before I knew it I was planning my funeral. I know, it was super dramatic, but that's where my mind went.

Here's where I might be the asshole. To distract myself, I downloaded a bunch of books onto my phone and read any time I started to think about it, aka any time I was left to think. My parents noticed I was reading and asked why and I told them, so they left me to it for a little while, but then my mom and sister started to make comments about how I wasn't 'present'. I tried to tone it down, but I couldn't get it out of my head so ended up reading like six books in the couple of weeks we spent in Europe. Eventually, my mom and sister took to clicking their fingers in my face and saying that I was not present again.

I want to stress that I would only do this when we weren't doing anything, so I put the phone away for all of the activities and tours (or when my parents were letting me have a beer because the drinking age is like 18 in Europe) and stuff. I also made sure to put it away when someone was talking to me. It was just when I had enough time to think.

We got back and I had my appointment and it luckily wasn't cancer. My mom drove me to the appointment and on the way home she said something like ""I bet you feel stupid for not being present on our trip"". I told her how scared I was, but we got into an argument and she said I ruined the trip.

1mcq63z,AITA for leaving work early without telling anyone because it was over 130°F where I work.,"So i (18M) am currently interning at a very prestigious nursery in the Midwest. Its a really big deal for me because the company has government connections, and having this on my resume basically guarantees me future job opportunities. 

But here is the issue. My boss (lets call him MB) has been out of town on vacation for the past week. Normally, he's the one who works alongside me and checks in. But because he is gone his boss (WB), who works out of a completely different office across the state from where I’m stationed, has been “supervising” me remotely using the security cameras in the greenhouses. The greenhouse I work in is about a mile away from mine and my bosses office building, and since MB is gone, I haven’t had access to the air-conditioned office at all. I’ve been stuck at the greenhouses the entire time in the heat. 

Now, the weather has been brutal lately, with highs around 100–105°F. Inside the greenhouse, it's even worse. There’s no fan, no AC, and barely any ventilation. The only way I can cool it down is by opening the roll-up walls about 3 feet, but that doesn’t do much. Even with shade cloth, the temperature inside reached over 130°F today. I was working in those conditions for 6 hours straight before I started feeling lightheaded and got a headache. 

Since I couldn't cool off and had nowhere to rest (again, I had no access to the office), I made the decision to leave about 2 hours early. I didn’t notify WB because I knew she’d be upset, and I don't have any sick leave to use anyway. About 30 minutes after I got home, WB checked the security cameras, saw I was gone, and called me. She asked where I was, and I told her I had gone home because I wasn’t going to keep working in a greenhouse that was 130°F. She told me that if I didn’t return immediately and finish out the day, I’d be suspended with no pay for a week. Problem is, I live about 30 minutes away and can’t work past 5 p.m (it was already 4:30), so there wouldn’t have been enough time to drive back and get anything done. 

So here is where I might be the ass I told her that even if I could make it back in I wouldn't go back in because it was just too hot there and that if she wants to make sure the plants in there are fine she should come out of her nice ac'ed office and try working in there when it is as hot as it is. She then told me her intern isn't having any problem with the heat (she only has one greenhouse to take care of and it actually has ventilation unlike the 6 I have to take care of). So I just gave up on the conversation said I was sorry and hung up. 

So now I might be suspended, and I’m worried it’ll ruin my reputation at this company. I get that I probably should’ve told someone, but I also think I shouldn’t be expected to work in dangerous conditions with no break and no access to AC.

So AITA for going home early without telling my boss?

1mcqd6e,AITA for giggling at a family's problems during an HOA meeting?,"This happened this past Sunday. My dad and stepmom are out in a small trip and I'm pet sitting their cat and staying at their apartment whirl they're out.

My dad asked me to attend the ""HOA"" (not sure how to call it, we live in Mexico and we don't have an HOA in the US sense) meeting due to some points about renovations,and other important issues would be touched upon.

During the meeting, there was an ""open mic"" moment to discuss other matters in a more neutral way. One of the neighbors, a woman that we'll call Carol, raised a concern about the ongoing issue with the ""gang"" that's been terrorizing the complex for a while now, and how nothing had been done to stop this.

The gang in question? a group of kids between 6 to 10 yo

Their ""clear gang activities""? talking about games in the elevator/corridors, playing in the main plaza after school, going from tower A to B to pick some of the other kids, or getting toys out to go play.

I know some of them, they sometimes come to the apartment asking for bandaids or get one of my nephews to go play with them, really good kids imo, most outrageous thing they've done was hit a garden light with a ball and breaking it, which they took full accountability for and told management as soon as it happened.

According Carol, the kids are an issue and they make her feel HIGHLY uncomfortable, because she can tell all of them are ""up to no good""

Her daughter, a mid teens, added that she feels so insecure when she's home alone cuz more than once the kids have come up to her door and tried the door handle, banged on it, and that they've even tried picking the lock.

Mind you, her apartment is across from my dad's, and the kids only knock on his twice a week when my nephew is there. And that she also felt unsafe walking anywhere near the plaza because she felt ""perved on"" by, again a bunch of kids between 6-10yo.

The husband was also very mad cuz according to him, he's seen them running around the underground parking lot, and I quote, ""Keying cars and trying to open them, probably to steal the cara or whatever is inside!"", which cannot be true because all minors need to be accompanied by an adult or a security guard to access the parking area, to avoid any accident.

I couldn't help it and snorted, then giggled when Mr. Dad added that whole bit about kids trying to steal cars, cuz as we all know, kids are into that kind of stuff. Carol began to ask what was so funny and why I thought that ""gang"" activity was funny, when I could be the next one to be attacked.

1mdifn8,AITA for not inviting a stranger our pastor told us to invite over for Christmas Eve with just my husband and I?,"So, this a throwback and the people involved besides my husband are no longer a part of my life at all. But therapy is weird and while working through something else entirely the memory of this situation popped out from wherever it was laying dormant in my brain and hasn't gone away since. So, I shall ask you, oh dear citizens of Reddit, AITA here or was the pastor out of pocket?

Let me set the scene: It is Christmas eve early 2000s. It is below freezing outside and snow is blowing lightly around. My husband and I are alone, but will be going to visit family the next day. We used to have our celebration on Christmas eve just us, then go to the big family event the next day. 

There was a guy our pastor was helping out, around 20 years old. My spouse and I were early 20s as well. The only thing the pastor new for certain about us was we didn't have kids and we didn't have plans for Christmas eve that involved other people. Or maybe he didn't know the second part and just assumed? Unclear. 

Anyway, hubs and I went out for our annual Chinese food meal and to hang out looking at Christmas lights then planned to watch a movie or something at home. While out at dinner husband got a call from our pastor telling him that he'd sent the guy we didn't know (we'll call him Brian) to our house because we weren't doing anything and thought we should be kind and share our Christmas eve with the man. Let me be so clear that this was never discussed prior. 

Well, he sent the guy to our house on a dang bicycle in freezing temperatures and was irate when we didn't leave our food to go visit with Brian. We were lectured about Christian love and how we were not being good Christians by not inviting Brian along. What? 

So, we eventually go home, Brian is on our couch (presumably he was told to just go in? We lived way out in the country so the doors weren't locked.) I'm shaking with anger. I tersely said goodnight and went to bed because I was not dealing with a relative stranger when my little introverted heart had been promised one night of peace out of the week of chaos.  All of this was reported back to the pastor by Brian who was so hurt and put out by us not being there when he arrived. 

I thought nothing of it honestly until months later I asked the pastor for a letter of recommendation which he willingly gave only to find out he wrote horrible things about my character and my uncharitable nature. Based, I can only assume, on that event since I served regularly at the church and helped quite a lot of people if I'm being honest. Which this pastor would have known. So. Am I the Asshole?

1mdk6fa,WIBTAH if I don’t tell my spouse the latest information I received about his biological parents ?,"
UPDATE:


I told him last night and all is well. I let him know there was an update and that he could decide if he wanted the information or not. He ultimately chose to read the email. He was understandably disappointed and hurt by the information. I told him that I had struggled with whether or not I should tell him. I asked him if he would’ve felt better if I hadn’t told him and he said he wasn’t sure. He wasn’t angry with me for considering withholding the information and he wasn’t upset that I told him either. He said he could see why I struggled. I am glad I left it up to him because I don’t think I could or would have been able to keep it from him anyway. For those of you saying I withheld this from him by coming here first - he was literally informed 10 minutes after returning home from work. I told him as soon as he was available.  







My (34F) husband (40M) was adopted as an infant. It was an international adoption with limited information regarding the circumstances of his adoption and his birth parents. His mom (adoptive mother) tragically passed away years ago and he does not have a relationship with his adoptive father. When we met, he had no interest in reaching out to his biological parents. He expressed disdain for his birth mother “abandoning,” him and was quite angry. After his adoptive mom passed away he started to toy with the idea of reaching out to the adoption agency. For years he mulled over the idea. He then expressed fear of rejection and stopped talking about it again. He went back and forth on the subject for a few more years. Each time he showed interest, I began learning more about how we could get information if he did decide he wanted to move forward. Late last year he finally decided he was ready. I submitted the necessary documentation for him at his request. The agency informed us that due to changes in adoption processes in his birth country, they may not be able to process his request and we might have to wait until September of this year to request directly from the government in his home country. We were pretty disappointed but decided to proceed and see what happened. In April they reached out again and said they could not fulfill our request. He was upset and a few days later he said he didn’t want to even bother trying to search again in September. 


Today I received an unexpected email from the agency. They HAD been able to move forward. His birth mother returned the first letter to sender, a family member received the second letter and the third letter was hand delivered to his birth mother in May and she never reached out. We can assume she does not want to contact him at this point. His birth father (not married to the birth mother and living in a different city) did initially seem open to contact. He exchanged a few text messages with the agency social worker. Unfortunately he decided that he “felt bad but did not wish to continue communication.” 


I know this will hurt him to know. At this moment in time, he believes we gave up on contact. WIBTAH if I just don’t tell him? I am torn. I feel he has the right to know but I fear what the rejection will do to him. I am so disappointed and upset. I knew this was a possibility but I had hoped they’d at least be willing to exchange a letter or two.

1mefijb,AITA for telling my dad if he wants me to not move he has to help me buy a home?,"I am a baby millennial who is trying to buy a home in this economy. I make a decent salary but apparently not enough to afford a home with the going prices nowadays. I’m not even wanting anything crazy big or extravagant. I’d be content with a 900 square feet condo. The average cost of a home in my town is $650k. I was aiming for $250k max. All housing is expensive where I live in the Midwest. 

I told my parents I may be moving soon as I was searching for a home in low cost of living states such as Alabama or Tennessee and they are opposed to me moving. They said they’re getting up in age and need their children around in case of an emergency (yes I have siblings but I’m the only female child). I help my parents the most. One of my parents is also terminally ill and I’m a part-time caregiver. 

I told them I needed somewhere to live. Moving home isn’t an option since I left years ago due to emotional abus3 that has since been resolved. I told myself I’d never move back with my parents though because of that. 

My parents told me to just keep renting. I don’t want to keep renting forever. I’ve been renting for 7 years. They told me I should not move far from them because they need my help and I help them the most. I told him I didn’t really have any other options. My dad said I can move back home and I declined. I told him if he wants me to live near him then he should help chip in to make that possible for a down payment and he said no. He said that’s my responsibility to buy my own home since I’m an adult and I need to manage my money and not move until I can afford to. So I told him I will move to a cheaper place then so my money will work in my favor to afford a home. I have saved up, I just cannot specifically afford a half a million dollar home. He said I’m being neglectful of them in their old age and how they’ve done so much for me already that I shouldn’t be selfish and move far away from them.

1meghvb,"AITA for telling my roommate no, she can’t have the larger bedroom, put her desk in the living room, and use extra common storage for only $50/month more than me?","I’m moving into a new apartment in a few weeks with a roommate. The apartment has two bedrooms and the rent is $2,600. One room is a little bigger and has more closet space, and my roommate and I are trying to figure out who gets which room and how to split rent in a way that feels fair.

She’s saying she wants the bigger room, but she also wants to put her desk in the living room to work there. I already told her I’m not comfortable with that because I would feel like I’m disturbing her if I needed to cook or j relax in the shared space while she needs quiet or is in a meeting. I also told her I think the bigger room should cost $100 more because it has more space and a larger closet.

She came back and said she thinks the rent should only be a $50 difference and she still wants to have her desk in the living room, and maybe use more of the shared hallway storage than me too. To me that just feels really unbalanced and is way more than I would try and ask for personally - she’s getting the bigger room, an extra separate work space outside of her room and taking over more of the shared space, all for barely more rent.

My two biggest priorities are (1) having a decent-sized room where I can study privately since I’m starting an intense dental hygiene program, or (2) feeling like I can use the shared spaces without walking on eggshells or constantly worrying about being too loud.

I suggested two options that I think are fair:

Option 1:
She takes the smaller room, we split rent evenly, and she can use the hallway storage to make up for the closet size difference and put her desk in the living room.

Option 2:
She takes the larger room, pays $100 more (or $50 more if I get the single parking lot spot), and the shared spaces stay neutral, no desk, we split the hallway storage equally, and everyone can use the space whenever.

I’m not being stubborn about the money and I honestly would be happy to pay $1400 and $1200 if the common spaces were shared evenly and I had the larger room. I just don’t want to end up in a situation where I feel resentful or like I don’t have space to breathe. I’ve tried to compromise, but it feels like she’s pushing for everything she wants without really taking my needs into account.

1mf7grf,AITA for telling my sister to stop feeding her baby junk food?,"Feeling increasingly guilty about this, help me feel better or worse! 

My sister has a baby boy who turned one in June. I’ve recently been helping her out by looking after him why she and her partner move house. I’ve been increasingly shocked by what she sends him to my house with for lunch. 
This is now: a sausage roll (either Greggs or a Tesco mystery meat from a multipack), 2 bags of crisps (I am not talking about lentil crisps/veg stick brands for babies, I am talking about actual crisps), chocolate biscuits, cake bars and most recently Jaffa cakes. There’s always a yoghurt thank heavens, but that’s it in the way of any form of nutrients. 

At first I tried the jokey approach, telling her my three-year-old would start to get jealous of all these treats, that I was worried I couldn’t cope with my nephews sugar highs etc. After several weeks I’ve snapped and told her she is going to have a poorly child who looses all his teeth by age 5 if all she feeds him is junk, and she became upset and said she can’t help it if her child is a fussy eater. She is now mortified, said I’ve accused her of being a crap parent and now things aren’t the same between us.

1mg2mmf,AITA for not co-signing a mortgage agreement for my parents?,"I (21f) have been asked by my parents to cosign a home mortgage worth 200k with my brother (22m). For context, my dad and brother lives 3 hours away from my mom and my other siblings because of work. I live in another province for military posting reasons.

My dad and brother are currently paying rent, and they’re looking to buy a house. However, my dad has filed for bankruptcy and my brother has only been working for 3 months at his new job so he might not get approved. That’s why they need me to co-sign for my name and ID. They told me I won’t be paying anything because I wont need to put my banking information. That my brother and dad will pay it and i just have to act as a cosigner. 

This is my first time doing something like this, especially taking in a big commitment such as a home that I won’t even be living in. So naturally I started researching about it. I learnt that if my brother fails to pay it off on time and what not, I am financially responsible for it. I asked my mom questions of what it would mean for me to co-sign. I’m pretty hesitant because of my dad’s past history of being in debt.

She did not take it well. She said why am i thinking negatively of things, if i really loved my Dad i wouldn’t even think in this way and just say yes. I told her it’s because i want to think of things realistically and don’t want to be in debt in case my brother can’t pay things off. 

She said that my distrust in my dad is unfair. And that this is the only help i’ll be giving towards my family and I can’t even do it. (mind you, im paying for my mom and siblings’ house insurance, my mom’s phone bill, and other miscellaneous things that they need money for).

1mguwxz,AITAH for suggesting to my husband that we put his mother in a home?,"I (45f) and my husband (56m) are going through a rough patch. Recently, his mother’s (78f) health issues have been getting worse and the doctor has recommended she receive full time care. Previously, she lived alone, but nurses would come every other day to check on her. My husband thinks the best course of action in moving her into our home. 

My issue is that I do not want my mother in law living with us. She’s always been very rude to me and my daughter (11f). She was originally against me marrying my husband because we come from two different faiths (he’s Morman, I’m raised Lutheran but personally agnostic), and because I’m not as “traditional” as she would like me to be. She is a very traditional woman who believes in rigid gender roles for women. She’s attempted to push this belief on my daughter by making comments about what my daughter wears and does. 

She has made comments to my daughter like, “wear leggings with your dress, or else you make God upset. And when God’s upset, he sends people to bad places.” This has made my daughter feel very ashamed and paranoid. She has also expressed disdain for when my daughter said she wanted to become a veterinarian. My mother in law said, “A proper lady should not work outside the home. Focus on raising a family.” (She also hates me because I work, and was very against this.) 

She does not hold the same sentiment towards my son (8m). She shows clear favoritism towards my son while consistently criticizing everything my daughter does. 

While my husband typically defends me in front of his mom, he is adamant we move her into our house. His reasoning is that she is too sick to take care of herself, and his only other brother is ill fit to take care of her (he’s in rehab). 

I suggested, “Then put her in a retirement home,” which made him incredible angry. He says that at the end of the day this is his mother, and he has a duty towards her. He promised that if she moves in, he will talk to her about her attitude towards me and our daughter. However, I don’t want to raise my kids anywhere near her. She has been shaming my daughter, and I barely get along with her. 

Last night, out of anger, my husband said, “You can move out of the house, but I’m not moving my mother into a retirement home!”

1mjfh6g,AITA for refusing the sell the crystal I got from my grandmother,"My grandmother collected stones and crystals for decades. About 50 years ago, her brother gifted her a 25 kg crystal (clear quartz geode) he found. (I don't know the exact story).

My grandmother's love for crystals and stones is the reason I started collecting them too. For the last couple of years before she passed away, she would gift me a couple of items from her collection every time I saw her.

She had the giant crystal displayed in her house, and she knew how much I loved it, often telling me if I still collected crystals when she passed away, I would get it. Unfortunately, she passed from cancer when I was 9. Since she had promised me the crystal, my dad got it for safekeeping. I didn't have the space for it in my bedroom, and I have been moving around finishing my degree since I moved out of my parents' house, so the crystal has been at my parents' house since she passed.

I bought my first home earlier this year and got the keys on August 1, so I am in the process of fully moving in. When I started moving into my home, I was offered the crystal, since my grandmother wanted me to have it, and I would finally have space for it, and won't be moving anytime soon.

When I got the crystal, I also got some paperwork from when my grandmother had it valued back in the 90s. It was valued at around 5000 euros (I have no clue if this estimate is even remotely correct today, and don't care since I don't plan on selling it). When my siblings found out the price of the crystal, they got mad that I got something so expensive and wanted me to sell it and split the value between us. I have refused to do so; my grandmother wanted me to have it because she didn't want someone to just sell it. My siblings feel this is unfair since they only got some sentimental items, but nothing worth real money. So AITA for refusing to sell the crystal I got from my grandmother?

1mmxfgn,AITA for not playing video games for my brother who has a nerve disorder? and not playing games in front of him at all anymore?,"# 

Reposting because I barely got any comments on my other post

My (f17) brother (m16) has a nerve disorder that's gotten worse. He used to like playing video games a lot, but now he can't play video games anymore. He's tried a bunch of adaptive controllers and assistive settings, but they don't really work anymore.

So a few times he's had me play video games for him. Basically, it's me controlling the character, but my brother makes all the decisions for things like skill points, customization, any in game decisions, which direction to go, what quest/mission to do, and stuff like that. He tried doing it with our parents too, but our mom doesn't like violence at all, so she won't, and our dad isn't very good with tech stuff and every single time he needs every little thing reexplained even a lot of the times during the same game session. Then he just keeps on dying, so it doesn't really work.

He enjoys it and keeps asking me to play for him more, but I said no because it's a very unenjoyable activity for me. There's nothing fun about basically just being a verbal input machine for him. Plus, if it's a game I've played before it's so boring and if it's a game I haven't played before it ruins the experience for me.

Also, it takes up a lot of time and makes me not like playing video games so much. I do like playing video games by myself, but I also don't always want to be in front of a screen. So, if I play games for him it takes up my mental capacity for screen time and I don't get to play games for myself.

Still, he wants me to play for him because it's his only way he sort of gets to play and feel like he is involved in the game. I kept refusing though so he started bothering me whenever I was playing video games. He will come in the room and sort of back seat game by telling me what I should do or should have done which is very annoying and also ruins it for me because it's distracting. Even if he is quiet for like a minute its annoying having someone silently judge everything you do and makes me second guess everything I'm doing. Kind of like in school and a teacher just stops and stands over you and looks at what you're writing.

So now I've started only playing games on my steam deck or switch because then I can play in my bed or right against a wall so my brother can't look over my shoulder or I can at least move away if he tries to. He gets mad at me when I do this because he said he just wants to watch me play and it's not fair that I won't let him when he can't even play anymore. I told him he should just watch streamers play then, but he says it's not the same because he doesn't get to feel involved because they never read his comments.",FunMammoth6910,1916,0.9300000071525574,325,1754868442,2025-08-10 18:27:22,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mmxfgn/aita_for_not_playing_video_games_for_my_brother/,8,2025
1mnsbjr,AITAH my roommate says I can't move out until after her wedding,"I (34f) have been living in hotels and with an ex partner for the last 4 months because my apartment tested positive for mold, which I'm highly reactive/allergic to. At the same time, my 5 year old dog suddenly became severely ill. Her x-rays showed alarming inflammation in her lungs and overnight she was struggling to breathe. I packed a suitcase and left immediately thinking the mold was affecting her also. My plan was to find another place to stay while our landlord remediated the house. 

Devastatingly, only 2.5 weeks later my dog passed away. Her passing was extremely traumatic for me, but I will omit those details. I was in a very, very dark place. Not only did I lose my bestfriend and was living out of a suitcase, I also found out some unfortunate news regarding my own health, all the while being unemployed and living on savings and some generous help from my ex partner.

The night my girl passed away, my ex insisted I move into the extra bedroom of his apartment so I wouldn't grieve alone. He assured me that I could stay for as long as I needed to get back on my feet as well my house to be safe again. We get along super well, and I'm so grateful for his help. 

The whole time I've been here, both of my roommates have been constantly asking when I was coming back. Mind you, I've been paying my $2,200 rent plus utilities this whole time. (I live in SF, lol.) My answer has always been the same: I'm not coming back until the house is remediated. Unfortunately something was delaying the process of it all. 

Last week, I finally decided that I no longer wanted to pay rent for a place that I wasn't living in, especially because I was still unemployed. I knew the timing of my notice was less than ideal because my roommate ""Kate"" (46f), who is the master tenant and responsible for finding a replacement tenant, is in the throws of planning her wedding, amongst other things like talking to a surrogacy agency and immigration for her fiance, and I feel awful. I knew that she wasn't going to take the news well, but her reaction was far more unexpected than I thought.

When I told her I was moving out (7 week notice) she said that the timing didn't work for her and that I was being unkind. She threatened to keep my deposit if I didn't push my move out date by another month. When I told her that was illegal she started to freak out and told me that our friendship would be over. I was in shock. She said ""you knew about the wedding for months!"", but I honestly didn't have the mental clarity to make that big of a decision until very recently. I told her as soon as I knew. 

I can't help but feel horrible and guilty, but all my friends are telling me 7 weeks is more than fair and she is the one being a bad friend. I just have no idea because they are obviously biased. I'm just so tired of being a people pleaser and I would essentially lose over $2k to make it convenient for her.

1mpfvtl,AITA for not paying for a wedding I’m not attending?,"I (30f) started a relationship with Joe (31m) in the middle of May of this year. Shortly after we started going out, he asked me to be a plus-one to his friend Meg’s wedding. i have never met Meg, but I agreed to go. We RSVPed, and Joe booked plane tickets and a hotel room.

A couple days ago, I ended the relationship with Joe. It’s important to note that while money was not the main reason for the breakup, it was one of the things we argued about most. I am very frugal (perhaps to a fault), and Joe likes to spend money on creature comforts and trips, and often expects me to do the same. Joe lives at home rent free, while I have my own apartment. I live pretty much paycheck to paycheck, with a small stash set aside in savings.

There’s still about five weeks left to the wedding. I ended the relationship when I did partly because I didn’t want to be in the pictures from the wedding and cause people to feel bad when they looked back at those pictures. I am returning everything Joe left in my apartment, save a few things he was okay with me keeping. I also offered to pay for my plane ticket and my half of the hotel stay as a good-faith gesture. It comes to over $400, which is just about everything I have in savings.

Today, Joe contacted me and asked if I could pay another $125 on top of all of that to offset Meg’s costs for my plate and everything at the reception. He says it’s so close to the wedding and since deposits have gone to vendors, I should pay my portion. I think that more than a month’s notice is ample time for Meg to either fill the seat or for Joe to find another plus-one, who would also be benefitting from my paying half of the hotel stay. I also think that since I wouldn’t pay that money if I was attending, then I shouldn’t have to pay now that I’m not. It’s my understanding that people not going to weddings after they RSVP is just one of those costs that’s inevitable, and I’m at least doing Meg the courtesy of giving over a month’s notice.

1mrd44z,WIBTA if I tell my friend I don't like being around her kid,"I (32m) have a female friend (29f) that has a kid.

I am at the point where I want to tell her to not bring her kid around me. This will be difficult because the kid has grown really fond of me. 


The child is four years old, but I don’t like how she’s allowed to behave. She is still breastfeeding at that age, and she isn’t properly potty trained. To clarify, she can sometimes use the bathroom on her own, but other times she just soils herself. She doesn’t have any mental challenges. On top of that, she has a cellphone that she’s glued to constantly. All of this annoys me, but since she’s not my child, I don’t comment. I mind my own business. 

The bigger problem is that this child cannot take no for an answer. When she’s with her mother, she bullies her by crying hysterically until her mom gives in to whatever she wants. You might wonder how this affects me.

Well, the child often cries hysterically for my laptop or smartwatch. I’m not rich, and I can’t afford for a kid to break my things. Once, her mom left her with me briefly while she went to grab something from the car. During that short time, the child reached for my prescription glasses. When I refused to give them to her, she threw such a hysterical tantrum. The cries were so loud and gut wrenching that people thought I had spanked her.

1ms1x4k,AITA for refusing to give up our only bedroom for my mother in law to stay?,"My husband's parents separated 6 weeks ago - dad left mum for someone else. Obviously she is very upset about it and we have been supporting her as much as we can. She is in her 70s, lives 1.5 hours away and has never driven, so getting her to come to us has always been dependent on her and her husband travelling together. As husband and I are starting work again soon, we are wanting to encourage her to come to us more often by public transport, and her staying over would make things easier.

Our house is small. We have one bedroom and no sofa bed. We suggested to her that we could swap our sofa in the living room for a sofa bed so that she could spend more time here. She was hesitant, so we suggested that we have a really good double air mattress that she could stay on in the living room, but again she was hesitant. She is healthy and fit, so there are no medical reasons why she couldn't sleep on it. 

My husband has now asked me whether we could give up our bed and bedroom for her when she stays and we sleep on the air mattress. He said it'll only be once or twice.

1msal50,AITA for refusing to clean out my grandpa’s house 25 yrs post death.,"AITA for refusing to clean out my dead grandpa’s house? Here’s the story. My grandpa died when I was 15 years old, I am now 40 years old. My grandpa left his house to my aunt. His house is more of a permanent trailer, in a retirement community. My aunt has never been married, never had a serious boyfriend and has no kids. She is very sentimental. She has always made excuses as to why she won’t clean out or sell his house. Her excuses have been: too busy at work, too busy hanging out with friends and she hasn’t figured out what she wants to do with it. In the last 25 years, she has let the house rot. She’s never slept in it, doesn’t keep it up, but does pay the taxes and HOA. About 15 years ago, I offered over and over again to help her clean it out or fix it up. I didn’t want money for it, just wanted to help her so that she could use the place. I am independently successful, so I don’t want the money from the house. My aunt always refused to have me help her with the house. My husband even offered too, she said no. Since the house has been abandoned for so long, she mentioned to me about 5 years ago that animals have gotten into the house and there’s animal poop throughout the home. She has done nothing to clean it up and now there’s years and years of animal feces and maybe even dead animals inside. Fast forward to 2025, my mom passed away and I spent a grueling 3 weeks cleaning out my mom’s house. It was rough! I have 3 kids and had to leave my family to clean out my mom’s house.

I told my aunt that I can clean out her house when she passes, but asked her to please take care of my grandpa’s house herself. He’s been dead for 25 years and I feel like it’s unfair to have me clean that out too. Especially to have to clean out both her home and my grandpa’s house while juggling my own family of 5. My aunt told me, “Oh don’t worry about that. It will be so easy for you and you probably will only have to move out a mattress or two.” This is false, as his house is full of his possessions. It also upset me that she seems to have always expected me to do the work. I did love my grandpa. But his house literally is a hazmat situation with the animal feces, broken pipes, nonfunctional AC and more. She hung up on me when I told her the house would require hazmat suits to clean it out.

A week later, I texted my aunt and told her that it is her responsibility to take care of her father’s house and not mine. That was 5 months ago and she has not replied to me. She normally texts me every week. I’ve been ghosted. My concern is near Thanksgiving and Christmas she is going to show up to my house and pretend everything is fine. What do I do? This aunt has been very controlling and manipulative my entire life. This is the only time I’ve ever stood up to her. Part of me just wants her out of my life forever.

1mt0mqm,AITA for telling my roommate’s boyfriend he has to pay £100 toward utilities or move out after his “one-week” stay hit five weeks?,"I (F27) share a 2-bed flat with a roommate (F26). Her boyfriend “stayed for a week” after his lease ended. We’re on week five. In that time he’s been showering twice a day, cooking with my pots/spices, pouring my milk/using my eggs, and my shampoo keeps magically shrinking. Our smart meter’s been climbing and the water bill’s up; the living room has basically turned into his office/gaming den.

Last week I asked for a totally reasonable contribution: £100 toward utilities and to stop treating my food/toiletries as communal. He laughed and said it’s “temporary” and I’m being “transactional.” Roommate says I’m “making her choose,” that he’s “basically family,” and I should show “compassion.” I actually like him fine, but compassion doesn’t pay the bill when the meter’s spinning.

So I set a boundary: **by Friday**, either (1) he transfers £100 and agrees to stop using my groceries/personal items, or (2) he finds somewhere else to sleep. Now I’m the villain for “setting ultimatums.” For context, when we moved in we agreed that guests are a few nights, not a third roommate by stealth. This isn’t a guest anymore - it’s an unpaid tenant with opinions.

I’m not trying to ban him; I just don’t want to subsidize soeone who isn’t on the lease. If he chipped in and respected basic house rules, great. But right now it feels like I’m sponsoring a staycation.

Hi, and thanks a lot for all the comments and verdicts in my first post, far more than I had anticipated, enough that my husband came across it too. First, I do want to clarify that my husband never said I was an AH, he said he agreed with the facts, that our daughter's name had had nothing to do with MIL, just the timing of it. But like a lot of the comments had said, perhaps setting the record clear in the moment had been the right thing to do.

My MIL had been bringing up the encounter to him in passing repeatedly since then, and she was also emphasizing the way and place and time that I corrected her, she was not claiming to have recommended the name any longer.

Yesterday, because my husband was having to deal with the bitterness of the situation, I had a call with my MIL. She said she was in shock at the way I had gone about it, that its not what she'd expected of me, how fond she was of my daughter, and that decisions like these are family decisions in spirit, doesn't matter the origin of the thought. I said I understand and deeply regretted the unpleasantness but it was a name close to my heart since I was young and had read the books so that's why this was different to me than any other decision, like the choice of stroller for instance. My MIL brought up that I had sent her a link of how it was a very popular name back when I had told her about it the first time. I said that yes but I'd done that after the fact, just to show it wasn't a completely out there name, and that I didn't even know what the result of the popularity of the name would be when I'd searched for it, but this name was from my heart. She said she understands and again reiterated how much she loves our daughter and I thanked her and told her how much I appreciated it. 

I think I've handled the situation well. My husband too seems content after my call.

1mt5yg2,AITA for ignoring my friend’s work messages while I’m on maternity leave?,"I’m currently on maternity leave from my job as a social media manager at a small start-up. When I went on leave, my friend actually took over my position (she only joined the company because of me).

Since then, she’s been messaging me constantly. Every other day it’s either questions about work, venting about colleagues, or sending me the content she posts so I’ll like or engage with it. She messages me through both the company account (which I’ve muted) and her personal one.

On top of that, she often asks to come over and “help”; cooking, cleaning, walking the dog, whatever I need. It’s really generous of her, but the problem is that whenever she’s over, the conversation turns into work. The last time she came, she stayed for FIVE hours, and 80% of what we talked about was her job. I even ended up helping her do work because she was stressed, and she straight up asked me to join a meeting with her.

I feel so stuck. I don’t want to hurt our friendship, and I know she’s just trying her best, but this is supposed to be my maternity leave. I’ve already had to tell other coworkers to respect my time, and she even backed me up on that… yet she doesn’t seem to realize she’s doing the same thing.

So lately I’ve just been ignoring the work-related messages (she doesn't seem to get the message). I’ll still reply if it’s something personal, but if it’s about work I don’t answer. Now I’m worried I’m being rude or unsupportive, since she’s obviously struggling and looking for reassurance.

* Save-the-dates already sent
* Amy's dreamed of this venue since high school
* Everything else is booked or 3x the price

I told Carol I can't lose $20K and crush Amy's dreams because Mark is trash. Carol says I'm choosing money over her mental health. That I'm forcing her to relive the worst betrayal of her life for ""pretty pictures.""

I also talked to Amy about it and she does not want a venue change. That it's not her fault Mark -- who has been out of all out lives for the last 5 years -- ruined that place for Carol. Carol called Amy a ""spoiled brat who wouldn't understand real pain.""

Now Carol's skipping Thanksgiving. Half the family says I'm heartless. The place is cursed anyway, why should we host Amy's big day there.

The other half says Carol doesn't get to hijack Amy's wedding because her husband's a cheater.

1mvt8vs,AITA for leaving work an hour and a half late and not informing my husband?,"A couple days ago I left work an hour and a half late. Due to the nature of my work, I am not able to have my cellphone on me and I am not able to leave without someone replacing me. My replacement was late due to a personal emergency. So I was not able to let him know I’d be late. Once I was able to use my phone, I let him know what happened, apologized, and told him I’d be home soon. 

When I was finally home, he was being short with me for the rest of the night. After the kids went to bed, I told him he needs to talk. I knew it was about me getting home late, and I apologized again and told him I would have warned him if I was able to. 

He told me I should have left at my scheduled time no matter what. He had plans with people and had to miss them because I was late and he was home with the kids. He said it’s also not the first time, which is true, it’s happened a few times over the last couple years, but never this long. He said in the future, I need to leave on time or text him and ask if I am able to stay late.

1mvtfit,"AITAH for kicking out my friend's neurodivergent friend, for what I felt was ignoring boundaries and touching my most personal stuff?","I'm just super annoyed that I'm made to be the bad guy but in case I'm missing something, here it is. 

My friends have a buddy (uses pronouns they/them), they bring along who is on the spectrum and high-functioning. They can drive, live independently, clearly make friends, and hold down a job - so personally, I think they can understand and respect boundaries. 

They have this annoying and disgusting habit of burping really hard, effortfully, so it is loud. And I have a sensitive nose and it smells. I don't care they do that but when it's in my literal personal space, less than three feet, that's an issue. 

I told them several times not to do that when they are literally facing me and talking to me, facing me, or eating right next to me, with an entire plate of food being passed around. 

The end of my patience was then met when I had a gathering and they invited them. They (their friend), came in and I was warm to them, then when I go to the bathroom, I come back looking for them to tell them we are eating dinner. Lo and behold they are playing with my hearing aids I put in a device to dry them out since it was raining.  (My friends just speak louder around me when they are off)

I literally need those for work and my safety, and other people playing with, let alone wearing them, is unsanitary. 

I flipped out and told them to put those down and he burped in my face, laughing, saying they was sorry and tried to hug me. They drop one of my hearing aids on the floor and almost spill their drink on it, the puddle barely touching it as I grabbed it. 

These are $3000 each...

I told them to let go and my friends were trying to get me to understand that they has trouble with these social cues. My response was:

  
""I'm allowed to decide what I put up with in my personal space and who handles my medical devces. Anybody who can hold down a job, make friends, and live alone should be able to respect boundaries. I don't care if they're on the spectrum, that doesn't mean anything on this.""

1mwp6wp,AITA for not canceling plans to be there for the birth of a “friend’s” baby?,"So I (27F) reconnected with a childhood acquaintance (29F) recently when she moved to my city. My dad and her mom used to work together. We weren’t close growing up, but when she moved to my city around 5 months pregnant, she reached out. I know how lonely it can be to move somewhere new, so I agreed to hang out and tried to help her settle in. When I moved here, I didn’t know anyone either. And now I’m the only one she knows. 

At first it was fine, I did little things like I drove her to look at apartments (she didn’t have a car), helped her run errands, and my dad even built her furniture when she got an apartment. My dad came to visit me for the weekend and we spent it helping her settle in. She has no support system, the baby’s dad is out of the picture, and she’s unemployed (not sure how she’s funding everything). I genuinely wanted to be kind and supportive. I even introduced her to some of my friends and she was so rude to them and then wouldn’t stop talking poorly about them. 

But then things escalated. She started demanding I go with her everywhere.. doctor’s appointments, grocery shopping, even to do nails. She started jokingly calling the baby “our baby” because I’ve been around so much. She’ll say things like “our baby is craving fries from McDonalds” and beg me to get them for her. She even offers to pay me. She refuses to use meal delivery apps because she doesn’t trust that they won’t do something to the food, she says. 

This has been going on FOR MONTHS. 

Fast forward: I’m a bridesmaid in my best friend’s wedding and flying home (Puerto Rico) for 4 weeks to help with the shower, rehearsal, wedding, and even organizing her closet in her husband’s apartment while she’s on her honeymoon (they don’t live together until after the wedding). When my acquaintance came over and saw me packing, she lost it. She said I never told her about my trip. She said she was counting on me to be there for the birth (which will definitely happen while I’m away, I leave tomorrow and she’s ready to pop any minute), and even expected me to MOVE IN with her for the first month after the baby was born to “help out,” since I have nanny experience. She also told me she was planning on me watching the baby on the days I work from home (2 days of the week). 

I told her I wasn’t canceling my flight or shortening my trip, and now she’s furious, saying I’m abandoning her and the baby. That I’m all they have. She’s posting about me on social media saying I betrayed her. Her mom, who lives in our state just 4.5 hours away, is commenting and encouraging her. 

I told my mother about this and she also said I was a bad friend to leave her and her baby when they need me, that she agrees moving in is a lot but I should be there during birth, only travel for the wedding, and then come back to help with meals, etc. and told me she won’t be picking me up at the airport tomorrow because she knows I’ll do the right thing. 

So.. AITA? ",Desperate_Donkey2212,4786,0.949999988079071,957,1755815031,2025-08-21 17:23:51,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mwp6wp/aita_for_not_canceling_plans_to_be_there_for_the/,8,2025
1mxfetz,AITA for not letting my daughters boyfriend propose at my vow renewal?,"I (50M) have been married to my wife for almost 25 years, we plan on throwing a huge vow renewal in December,it's basically going to be like a 2nd wedding. The whole shebang. We have 7 kids together and this regards our baby girl LaLa.(20F)

Her boyfriend came to me a little over a month ago and asked me for her hand and also asked if he could propose at the vow renewal. Hes a great guy ans we get along super well and i genuinley like him for my daughter. I, said yes to both originally and was super excited. A few weeks pass ans he asks can he also invite a few family members of his, i was expecting maybe his parents and siblings, but he instead sends me a list of 25 family members he wants to add. I have a few problems with this. 

1. His family does NOT like my daughter. Thwy are Asian and do not like that their son is with a black woman. And considering nearly everyone else there will be black...
2. He expects us to fund these people.like regular guest. As I mentioned this would be just like a wedding. So 25 extra people is a LOT of money 

I told him i couldn't accommodate that many people, he got angry and said I wss ruining his special moment and that I ""don't really care about Lala"" and said I can't do anything if thwy just show up. I said they absolutely will not show up. I then told him he still had my hand/permission to marry my daughter, but he was not allowed to propose at the vow renewal.

Now him, his family, and my 2 sons both say i was being an asshole and should just suck it up. But my other kids and my wife say that im not an asshole and that hes crazy.

1mxfls7,AITA for not inviting my sister in law to an event I know she would have enjoyed because she’s too judgy?,"I’ve always wanted to like my SIL Macey but she’s judgy about weird shit, like oh it’s superficial to get a designer bag when you should just go to the thrift store and get a $2 bag. But spending $600 on collectibles is okay. (They’re BOTH fine). Sadly this makes her the perfect partner for my brother. You can imagine the kind of personality he has lol.

The best example was when my sister Bee and her wife and a bunch of their friends were going to the Eras tour a few years ago. They’re all queer women too so they love Taylor. Macey thought that because I didn’t go I would be “on her side” and shit talk them, call them vapid and stupid cult members. I said I didn’t go because I’m just.. not a fan. I said she was behaving like a mean girl and to stop. She took offense because SHE was the victim of bullying as a kid. I said well I guess you didn’t learn from it because look at who you’ve become. She wouldn’t talk to me for months. 

Well a few weeks ago I got a ton of free tickets to the renaissance festival. I invited Bee and some other friends. Macey has said in the past she loves Ren Fests. She loves to get dressed up in period accurate costumes. I asked Bee if we should invite Macey and Bee said no, Macey would inevitably make some snarky comments about costumes not being accurate or something and ruin the mood for everyone. I thought about it and in the end agreed. Bee posted pics, Macey saw and asked us why we didn’t invite her. In the end, I told her that it was because I never know what she’s going to judge next. She said that we were bullying her. Bee brought up the Eras tour thing and how nasty Macey was about it and Macey defended herself by saying she never said that stuff TO her and I was wrong for telling her in the first place. 

My brother thinks we should have invited Macey and that we’ve gone out of our way to not be supportive and make her part of the family. I’ve literally had her over for baking Xmas cookies, movies, brunch. She’s never returned the favor. I just did not want to have a day where the mood was soured because of someone being judgy. He did not care about Macey ragging on Bee, either.

1mxl5wu,AITA for fencing off my property,"We bought the house we’re currently in about 6 months ago and we recently has a surveyor come to our property to figure out exactly where our property line is so we can put up a fence. The old fence was kind of a hodgepodge of different types of fences that were falling apart. We wanted to have something more uniform and you know, not falling apart. While the surveyor was here, the old lady living next door (noseybody) came out to see what we were doing and we let her know we were planning on putting up a fence. 

Here’s where it goes left but I don’t understand what the issue is. She said that we weren’t allowed to put up a fence and when we asked why, she said her dog was used to having all of not only her backyard but our backyard too because the old owners were okay with it. I don’t have anything against the dog but I also want a fence around our house because we have small children and it makes me feel better to know that we have a fence because there is a small forresty area and a small creek behind our property. 

She started ranting and raving about how young people today are selfish and that I’m an animal hater because I don’t want her dog to have space to roam. I told her that it had nothing to do with her and everything to do with us. She’s now trying to rally other people in the neighborhood to try and pressure us into not putting up a fence because her dog is “grandfathered in”. Not sure into what but reddit AITA?

If they don’t make it I get charged $10 per person and the restaurant's policy states everyone must be there or we won’t get seated. So I could be charged upwards of $60 because they decided not to communicate like an adult. I don’t really want to take that risk on someone who is a grown adult and can’t communicate so am I being an asshole?

It’s a once-in-a-lifetime type of vacation,15 days on the other side of the world, over 27 hours of flights each way. We’ve been planning and saving for it for over 6 months. Both of us work very stressful jobs and very rarely get the chance to take any time off like this.(never did on the last 12years) 

  


My MIL (70) has several health problems. She recently scheduled a complicated surgery for exactly the same time we’ll be away. (She knew we were away) We were not consulted about the timing. There’s almost no other family around, and the few relatives who live about 40 minutes away either don’t drive, have jobs, or simply can’t/won’t help her during recovery.

  


We don’t have the option to reschedule our trip without losing a significant amount of money, and honestly, we suspect she chose these dates partly for attention or to create conflict, there were other possible dates.

  


Now there’s pressure on us to cancel and be there for her, but we feel that after all the time, money, and energy we put into this trip, and how rarely we get breaks, it’s unfair to expect us to change our plans.

1mzb4ru,AITA For Stealing Back Pokémon Cards My Fiancé's Nephews Took (And Possibly Taking Extras)?,"Hello all, I'm keeping this off my main as my family members know my acct and I don't want them asking me about it just yet. 

To set the background, I'm (29F), my fiancé is (31M), and I have three children (8F, 7F, 5M). Sometime last year my daughter Summer (the 8F) started collecting Pokémon cards that her bio-dad would gift her during visitation. I haven't kept up with the fandom as I aged but collected coins as a kid and loved the idea of helping my daughter grow her collection. I have also supplemented the collection from lucky Goodwill finds. It is about 5 binders worth of cards, with cards from between 1995 to 2018 generally and some are very rare. 

My SIL asked my fiancé if we could babysit her two sons Peter (8M) and Paul (7M) while out of town for the weekend as she has to pick up her husband's nephew for something. I was not keen on this for a few reasons, being:

1) Peter has to attend an alternative school for anger issues and outbursts, and though they have become less frequent I wouldn't know how to handle it if something happens.  
2) Peter has had issues in the past with stealing money from my fiancé and I when we would leave cash out in our room. His mom would get defensive about it but $10 was never something I'd die on a hill for, so I'd usually drop it.   
3) Peter has also tried stealing my daughter's Pokémon cards in the past or my DBZ cards. I took them back but it blemished my relationship with my SIL a tad. 

Despite all this I hoped the weekend could go smoothly as she needed the help, so me and fiancé agreed.

However, last night while I was at work Summer called me and asked if she could 'give her Pokémon cards to Peter'. I could hear Peter whispering in the background. I was very clear in saying NO because I couldn't advise if there would be a fair trade or if he would take the more valuable cards. Later I asked my daughter if she really wanted to give him the cards and she said no. 

This morning while tidying my daughter's room I saw all the Pokémon binders out. I had a bad feeling, opened them up, and discovered HALF THE COLLECTION missing. The binders were full but now there were empty pages and scattered cards missing. I was pissed. I went to Peter's backpack and found some of my DBZ cards, my other daughter's full rock collection, and a massive plastic bag with a bunch of Pokémon cards dumped in. I took everything back and sorted my daughter's cards from Peter's, though I was just going by the card's print dates as Peter only had cards from 2022 and beyond (so I thought). I put the sorted cards in a lunch box.  
  
I told my fiancé at the time this, but Peter and Paul have noticed their card stash is much lighter and started whining in saying that their aunt gifted them some older cards that are missing. I'm sick and tired of them thinking they can just steal whatever they want from our house. AITA for not giving them any cards back, even if some are actually theirs? I'm worried they'll complain to my SIL.

1n03to6,AITA if I don’t clarify that I am a type 2 diabetic?,"I (30F) was diagnosed with TYpe 2 diabetes last year. Thru a program at my job, I can get Dexcom continuous monitors for free as long as I participate. So why not? 

Occasionally, someone will notice it and ask me what it is (because I cover it with a cute patch) and I’ll tell them it’s a Dexcom CGM. 

The people I don’t have to tell? Old people who have Dexcoms and Type 1 diabetics of any age. They see it and know immediately what it is. 

The old people typically don’t know there’s a difference between T1D and T2D but the T1D usually assume I’m also T1D because of my age. 

I recently had someone I see regularly notice my Dexcom and I noticed they seemed more interested in me afterwards. Talking About different things, fav snacks and CGMs, late lunches and feeling shaky, etc. Eventually they asked something about my insulin pump. I clarified that I didn’t have one, they seemed shocked and asked what I do then? I told them I’m pretty well controlled with diet (I made massive changes) and Mounjaro. They then got snide and accused me of being an ahole by misleading them and pretending I was a type 1 diabetic and that I should have clarified that i have the diabetes that I did to myself, which is different than having diabetes done to you like a type 1 diabetic. They are avoiding me now and also pointing out to people that I am type TWO diabetic, not type ONE. 


Now I’m questioning if I’m suppose to explain that I’m type 2 diabetic specifically so that I don’t accidentally end up masquerading as a type 1 diabetic??

For the past couple years, I have been having some health issues where I randomly come close to passing out while standing. I’ve been trying to figure out the cause but doctors have been dismissive so far. When I feel an episode coming on, I need to sit down. 

When he was looking at something at the store, I felt an episode coming on. Sometimes it will pass and I’ll be fine, but this one didn’t and I knew I had to sit down. I told him I didn’t feel well and was going to find a place to sit. I pushed it too far and couldn’t find a chair before I HAD to sit down. I felt like I didn’t have a choice but to sit on the floor. I was in a less populated part of the store, so I wasn’t in the way. 

I texted him that I had to sit down and he later came to find me and saw me sitting on the floor drinking my water. He told me in a whisper yell to get off the floor because it was gross and embarrassing but I told him I will as soon as I can, I really need to sit because I felt very unwell. 

I sat on the floor for a total of 10 minutes. After that I was well enough to go find a bench to sit on while I waited for him to finish shopping and then we went home. 

He keeps saying there was no reason I had to sit on the floor in a store and that it was embarrassing for him. He told his parents about it and they agreed that it was weird and that I should’ve sucked it up and I was being dramatic.

When the check came, I told the server I had a military discount. My brother’s fiancée immediately jumped in and said ""Oh just put it all under his bill so we all get the discount"" 

I could tell the waitress felt uncomfortable because she was about to say no so I told her that’s not how it works and the discount only covers me, and if I’m paying my own tab, fine, but I’m not about to cover a table of six just so everyone can save a few bucks. She called me selfish and said “you didn’t even pay full price to serve, so why hoard the perks now?” That honestly stung. 

I calmly told her that if she wants a military discount, she can enlist. My brother said I was being an ass and making her feel unwelcome in the family. I pointed out that she was the one being disrespectful, but now my mom says I should’ve just “kept the peace” and paid for the table because it wasn’t worth the drama.

So, Reddit…........am I in the wrong here for not giving up my discount and clapping back? She's a lot younger so I could have been nicer I guess.",WaveAway4358,3520,0.9399999976158142,740,1756241936,2025-08-26 15:58:56,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1n0xptd/aita_for_refusing_to_give_up_my_military_discount/,8,2025
1n10ium,AITA for not wanting the puppy my bf bought for my birthday present?,"For context: I (27F) have always had pets dogs, cats, even birds that fell from their nests I also rescued and re-home tons of animals But I’ve never kept a male pet. My mom didn’t like them because of the whole “peeing everywhere” thing, and I guess I just got used to only having girl pets. Plus, I love using my dogs like pillows, and I’ll admit the doggy boy parts that are always a little too present makes me uncomfortable.

Anyway, I’ve had my dog let's call her luna since I was 17. She’s my baby and she 100% rules my life. She’s not really friendly with kids, other dogs, or most men, but she at least kinda likes my boyfriend (31M) of two years.
So, my birthday was a couple weeks ago. My boyfriend told me he had a “surprise” but it wasn’t ready yet. Last Friday, I came home from work and found him in my apartment with a two month old-ish German Shepherd male puppy that he Bought, complete with a balloon tied to its collar that said “Happy Birthday.” He smiled and said, “Do you like him? He’s our new son.”

I was shock the only words that came out were: Where’s luna?
He had locked MY dog in the bathroom because she growled at the puppy. I was furious.
We argued for about two hours. I told him to take the puppy back with him and not to come back he yell some more and called me a “misandrist” before leaving because apparently not wanting male pets = hating men. He also said I was “weird” for being uncomfortable around dog peepees. 

When I told my friends and family, everyone sided with me however my boyfriend keeps sending me videos of the puppy, saying he doesn’t know what to do with it since his apartment doesn’t allow pets especially one that would grow so much and begging me to take it “just until he finds accommodations.” He says I owe him because he spent so much money on the puppy and was planning the puppy to live with me anyway.

But I don’t want the puppy, my current dog definitely wouldn’t accept him, and in the videos I can already see how destructive he's becoming in the other hand the poor puppy is innocent in all this should I just suck it up and keep him with me until my boyfriend (we technically didn't broke up yet) finds somewhere else to take him?
 Also the puppy represent everything I don't want in a pet, I feel like he just bought himself a dog but don't really want to take care of it so he acted like the puppy was my birthday present.

So, AITA for refusing to accept the puppy? Should I just take him in for a while?",cicada_supremacy,2101,0.9300000071525574,723,1756248739,2025-08-26 17:52:19,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1n10ium/aita_for_not_wanting_the_puppy_my_bf_bought_for/,8,2025

FIL refuses to do anything himself. Literally whine-screams from the guest room, ""I'M! HUN!GRY!"" and expects MIL to fix him a plate at any hour. He's refused every outing and bonding experience we've tried to make. I got tired of hearing him scream at her from behind closed doors. This time I heard him say, ""No, move that over there. No, put it there. You're so fucking stupid, (MIL's name)!"" He's so used to getting his way and I have HAD IT with his attitude. He's used to throwing his weight around because he's tall and loud. But now he's too old to be loud and he went full Hank-Hill-ass anyway because he almost never gets out of bed (by choice, not because of being disabled, he's just lazy)

  
So I stormed in and yelled at him that he does not treat his wife like this in my house. He tried to say it wasn't my business, but it is my business whenever I can hear it because I'm half-deaf, so it takes a lot.

 He tried to say they've been married for 50 years and ""we work it out our own way"" and I said, ""well you're in my house so its my way or the highway. You do not talk to the person you love like that in my fking house!"" 

  
I was full banshee-screeching at him and frequently over him as he struggled and stumbled with excuses.

  
He'd say shit like he ""didn't say anything wrong"" - ""yes you did, you called her mean names. A good man doesn't call his wife names!"" 

He said ""she WAS being stupid so (he) HAD to"" -, ""no, you made a choice, the WRONG CHOICE IN MY FKING HOUSE!"" 

He would backtrack and lie.  So I asked, ""did you or did you not call her stupid?"" he went off on another ramble about how long they've been married, so I screamed over him, ""YES! OR! NO!"" Until he finally admitted yes. 

I told him that he needed to apologize to her. He said he would ""Talk to her"" privately. I refused and said I needed to hear it because I know behind closed doors he's going to continue disrespecting her. 

He called me a bitch. I told him that if he wants to have a relationship where we all cuss and hurl names at eachother, then he's a fucking pussy who can't man up to his own actions when he's in the wrong. My wife got home and broke it up, then she took a turn screaming vs him too (because she did not like that he called me a bitch for refusing to back down against him).

  
My wife and I sat down with MIL. We told her that if she doesn't actively make steps towards getting home healthcare for FIL that I will be calling APS, assuming adult custodianship of both of them, and sending them to separate care homes. We gave her the choice of whether to divorce or not, but we made it clear we expect her to stop taking care of him herself.

She's concerned that he has too much money in his account to qualify for Medicaid, because it's been building up over the past few months.   I suggested that she pay for their cell phone bill, or that she meet with our local funeral director and start planning for their funerals, because it would be considerate to us.  My daughter told me that I was being mean.  I told her that my own grandmother had done just that, and we enjoyed a lovely luncheon at a restaurant afterward with family.

1n2odkk,AITA - Do not want a service dog to participate in my wedding.,"Throwaway

I'm (28F) am getting married in the spring.  I've asked one of my best friends to be one of my bridesmaids.  She has a service dog for PTSD.  I respect her dog and glad she has it in her life.  My Fiance and I don't particularly care for dogs, and we've decided we don't want her service dog in our photos or in the ceremony.  

When I asked her she got excited and immediately said her dog could wear something to match the rest of the bridesmaids.  Thats when I explained that the dog could come to the wedding, but wouldn't be an active participant in the day.  We don't want it in photos or in the ceremony.  It could go to photos, but not be in them.  It'll be off to the side for the 10-15 minute ceremony.  In preliminary discussions with our photographer we've brought this up. 

She did not take it well.  Called me an asshole and ableist and it was not a constructive conversation after the ask.  She hasn't accepted my offer to be a bridesmaid, but also hasn't declined formally.  AITA?

1n2pul2,AITA for telling my husband to wipe better after pooping?,"My husband (39m) & I (39f) are in a days-long fight about his toilet habits.

We’ve been married for 13 years. It has not been all rainbows & sunshine, so we’ve been going to couples counseling for a few months now.

The argument:

Sometimes when I go to the bathroom, I see that my husband pooped, but forgot to flush. I didn’t say anything at first bc he works hard & he’s a busy man. However, it started happening more frequently the past couple months (once/twice a week I’d find his poo in the toilet), so I finally brought it up. Just like “Hey, [this scenario] has been happening more lately. Not a big deal. Please try to remember to flush.” He was apologetic, & said he would make an effort. Cool.

Less than a week later, I went to the bathroom and got another brown peekaboo. No poop, but a bunch of toilet paper streaked with poop was sitting in the toilet. So I told my husband, “you forgot to flush again”. He replied “oh, yeah, I guess I did leave a bunch of toilet paper in the toilet. Sorry about that, it won’t happen again.” I replied, “No, it wasn’t just toilet paper. It was a bunch of *poopy* toilet paper.” I wanted to be clear about what the problem was, I didn’t want him to think I was just nagging about some lingering *plain clean* TP in the toilet. I feel like he has a history of downplaying or invalidating concerns that I voice to him, and I didn’t want that happening in this situation.

He got defensive after I clarified that. It seemed like he wanted to explain why there was poopy TP, but no poop. Personally, I didn’t really think much about that until *he* brought up that point. He shouted “DO I HAVE TO SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU?!?!” I was like, “ummmm, I guess so. I don’t think there’s a super obvious reason for a bunch of poopy TP hanging out on its lonesome. And I don’t like the condescending aggressive tone you’re speaking to me with.” He continued yelling about how sometimes he doesn’t get fully clean after pooping & initial wiping, so his butthole ends up feeling itchy later in the day, and so he’ll wipe it before getting in the shower. Hence, the poopy TP that he forgot to flush.

From there, it totally blew up into a screaming match. I told him that he should just properly wipe his butt immediately after pooping. At some point in the yelling, he accused me of trying to shame and embarrass him. I said “Well that’s not my intent, but yeah, a grown adult SHOULD be properly wiping after going to the bathroom!!!!! And I know I would certainly be embarrassed if I was you rn! wtf??”

We haven’t really been speaking for a few days. He said he’s sorry, but also thinks I should apologize, & he’s being aggressive about it.

It was never my intent to make him feel badly. But I’m unwilling to apologize when he’s being so aggressive and accusatory. Yesterday, he told me in anger that I need individual therapy for my behavior.

Considering our current work in couples counseling, I think we both could’ve been nicer during this exchange.

1n3gj1x,AITA for changing my mind about my wife being a SAHM since she changed the terms?,"I (35m) have been with my wife Allie (37f) for two years, married for one and we are expecting our first child together in a few months. I also have two children (8m and 6f) from a previous relationship with Alex (32f), and we have 50/50 custody, however, Alex travels a lot for work so we have the kids more than that most of the time, so we get child support from her. 

Before we got married, Allie and I spoke extensively about what we wanted, and she was adamant about being a stay at home mom. I was upfront with her that I was fine with that, we’d be able to afford it, but she would need to be a SAHM for all of the kids to be able to make it work. She agreed happily. 

So as you can probably predict, she sat me down the other day and told me that she wants, at minimum, her first year as a mom to only be a SAHM to our shared baby. She said after that she can help out more with the other kids, but wants to protect her first time motherhood and said it’s her number one boundary. 

I told her that would no longer work, then, I couldn’t support a family of five on just my salary without help with all of the kids. She said I needed to figure it out and respect her boundaries, but this simply won’t be possible. We have family to help for sure but she’s saying she doesn’t want to be responsible for the older kids at all the first year. Also, we want at least one more child and I’m now worried she’ll try to extend the year with another baby. She’s incredibly hurt and angry, but I don’t think it would even be possible to respect her boundaries.

1n3k5l2,AITA for canceling a visit with my mom after she put being a landlord first?,"Situation is a bit complex emotionally, but maybe not legally. 1-2 years ago I have moved to a new city and began renting an apartment from my mom and her husband. They own a couple of units in a semi-popular city. They charged me market rent or slightly above market rent (it was not cheap), we signed a lease, whatever. After a year, it went to month to month. They were typical landlords to us in the sense that they ignored us half of the time, but we always paid rent on time, were good neighbors to the other tenants, etc. Additionally, I had helped them with their business multiple times for free, offering services that would probably have totaled up to 1k-1.5k. Plus helping them out with like house sitting, pet sitting, airport rides, etc. Things normal family members should do for one another.

I got a job offer in another state, so we formally ended the lease and began to move out. A major complication during this is that my dog (originally my mom's, but the dog picked me as 'her' person), went into congestive heart failure. This took an overwhelming toll on my mental health and financials. The dog is stable-ish now. My mom knows about this and how distraught I've been and when moving, I told her I'm going to need my entire(or as much as I can get) deposit back to help with the bills from the dog and move. She agreed so long as the apartment was clean, which is fair. My partner and I with the help of a friend deep cleaned the apartment, aside from the walls which she told me not to worry about since she's going to repaint them regardless. She saw the apartment and agreed it was good to go and we're all settled. 

The issue came when they sent our deposit back and she went back on her word. They took $500 for ""cleaning and painting fees"" even when they assured us they were not going to do that. When I asked her why, she accused me of not deep cleaning the house. I requested photos of what was needed to be clean(which she refused to provide) and why she still charged us for painting when she said not to worry about it. At first, she said those conversations never happened and when I sent proof of those conversations her argument shifted to ""You're lucky we didn't change you more, you should be grateful it was only $500."" She knows we needed that money for an upcoming surgery for my dog (left atrial decompression) and I was in total shock.

She was supposed to come visit us in our new apartment in mid-September, but I ended up canceling the visit. She's always been kind of selfish and never there for me, but even this surprised me. She knows the depths of how hard we're struggling and still took the money when they're plenty wealthy. $500 is a lot of money, but it feels more than just the money for me. She went back on her word and put being a greedy landlord first over being my mom.

1n52g0q,AITA for refusing to give my sister her “dream wedding” dress even though I own it?,"When my grandmother passed away two years ago, she left me her wedding dress. It’s vintage and hand made. She left it to me specifically because I was the oldest granddaughter and was always close to her.

my younger sister is getting married. She asked if she could wear Grandma’s dress. At first, I was open to it. But when I said I’d want it back afterward (since it’s an heirloom and very sentimental to me), she blew up. She said she wants it because its her wedding, which includes cutting it to be shorter

I told her no. If she wants to borrow it that's fine, But if she wants to basically destroy it, then no. Now my entire family is calling me selfish and saying I’m ruining her “dream wedding” just because I want to hoard a dress I’ll “probably never wear.”

I don’t plan to wear it anytime soon, and it will mostly sit preserved in a box. But I also don’t want to lose something so important to me just because my sister wants it.

My parents are telling me that since it’s a wedding dress, it should be passed around and used for weddings, not hoarded. My fiancé says I’m right to keep it.

1n53gml,AITA For reporting the girls that broke into my room?,"Hi, I'm pretty sure I'm not the ass hole in this situation but the girls made me feel really guilty.

On Friday, at around 10pm, two girls knocked on me and my sister's door. I thought that someone might need help or it was our RA so I told my sister to open the door. That's when these girls pushed their way into our room and started filming a room tour of our room for a Tiktok. 

For extra information: 
1. my room was hoarder level messy. Me and my sister have depression and it's really hard for us to keep a room clean + my sister has a chronic illness. We're trying to be better though but this night our room was really messy
2. Me and my sister are obese to put it bluntly. I really didn't want any bullying to come my sister's way. 
3. I was wearing night clothes and I didn't have a wig on and they filmed my wig that was on the table. 

So after they filmed the Tiktok, they left and I was in shock. I told them to not post it anywhere and they said they wouldn't and Left. My sister and I tried to laugh it off but I was really worried that we were going to be posted on the Internet so I got dressed and told a RA.

We found the girls and two RA's made sure that the video wasn't in their camera roll or tiktok drafts. The RAs asked why would they burst into our room without asking to film and they said that they ""Did it to everyone and nobody else had a problem with it"". The RAs said that they could be fined which made me feel really bad because I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't posted anywhere and I'm pretty sure they're athletes and I don't want their chances to be ruined. 

I called a couple of family members because I was traumatized and they agreed that it was wrong but they said if our room was clean, it wouldn't be an issue. It still would've been a problem though because I don't want to be on the Internet looking like that.
