1jzb2tl,AITA - told mom she can bill me using the tuition money she stole from me,"When I (m33) was preparing to go to uni, my mom confessed that there was no tuition money for me. Through the years my dad would give her cash to deposit but she only did the first one. She spent the rest. TBH I wasn't even surprised. I was used to being disappointed by her. She promised that she would ""pay me back"" and asked that I never tell me dad. So for four years I thanked them for the tuition money while I took out loans.

For reasons to do with her narcissism, I have an arms length relationship with her, but she would say we're pretty close as she assumes my smiling and nodding while she drones on about the same stories is a relationship.

We have a family cottage that she puts above everything else. She lives there about 90 days of the year. I've been going there with my gf for about 4 days for a couple summers which she begrudges as it takes away from her time. My dad supports my going which is how I pull it off. 

She recently told me that it was time for me to start paying for some of the maintenance on the cottage since I use it. She actually suggested 1k which is wildly disproportionate. I told her she could take it out of the tuition IOU and we could negotiate the amount with dad.

She was speechless. She texted me later to say that it manipulative to bring up the tuition and to threaten to tell dad. It went on and on. 

I've been thinking about it and First, I'm hurt/offended that she can't just do a nice thing for me, she has to get something for it. 
Second, I guess I'm not really over the whole tuition thing. 

WITAH for bringing up ancient history and not paying her for use of the cottage?

Edited to add: at the time, it never occurred to me that I should have told him. I thought I was doing the right thing by protecting both of them. That pretty much summarizes my childhood.

1k9g8wn,AITA for not taking down my yard flamingos after neighbors complained?,"I bought a house a couple years ago and I have been working on making it look nicer. I spent a lot of time redoing the front gardens, trying to make it neat and nice. 

I a few weeks ago was at a greenhouse buying some plants for the garden and I saw two yard flamingos marked down on clearance. I knew they belonged in my garden. They‚Äôre not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but I think they‚Äôre a lot of fun. 

I set them up when I got home and a couple days later my neighbor was knocking on my door. She was demanding I take down my flamingos because they‚Äôre ‚Äúextremely gauche‚Äù and ‚Äúlowering the property value of the neighborhood‚Äù. I told her I am not taking them down because I like them, and the property value isn‚Äôt going to be hurt by two yard flamingos. I also don‚Äôt live in an HOA and as far as I am aware, there are no town ordinances about yard flamingos lol

She has posted pictures of my house, the street I live on, and a close up of my flamingos in our towns Facebook group to complain about them. Some people agreed I should take them down. After that, another neighbor came over to tell me to get rid of them. My mom also agreed I should take them down to keep the peace with my neighbor. 

I like them, I smile when I see them when I pull into my driveway. I have no plans to take them down. 

AITA for not taking down my yard flamingos after some neighbors complained?

1k5jzjb,AITA for refusing to cover my tattoos for my boyfriend‚Äôs family dinner?,"I‚Äôm (21F) a girl who has several tattoos (some big and quite visible), my boyfriend (26M) met me like that and I hadn't had any problem with it.  
He invited me to go to dinner with his family and I accepted, but he casually mentioned, ‚ÄúMaybe you could wear something with sleeves? Just so we don‚Äôt start any drama.‚Äù I asked what he meant, and he said his grandparents are very old-school and might not react well to my tattoos. He said he didn‚Äôt want the night to be awkward.  
I told him I wasn‚Äôt going to hide part of myself to make his family more comfortable. He said it‚Äôs not about hiding, it‚Äôs about respect. I told him respect goes both ways, and I shouldn‚Äôt have to pretend to be someone I‚Äôm not.  
He got upset and said I was overreacting and making it a bigger deal than it is. I told him that I would go to the dinner but that I wouldn't cover my tattoos. But then he asked me to please not attend, that if I was only going to be difficult, it would be better not to be there.  
That really rubbed me the wrong way and made me feel confused, because I think maybe I did behave badly and I shouldn't have reacted so vehemently against the idea. I don't want to cause drama with his family, but I have had a hard time feeling comfortable in my skin and learning to deal with the stigma people have towards me because of my tattoos... and I don't want to go back and hide again, plus I don't think I would be honest with his family either if I show myself as I am not.

1k6aqqe,AITA for sitting on a woman‚Äôs purse on the train?,"I live in a metropolitan city and the train I take home from work is crowded since everyone is also getting off work. There have been many occasions where other passengers on the train will occupy the empty seat next to them with their bag. There are people standing during the ride when there are available seats. 

I walked multiple cars to try to find an empty seat (without a bag) but couldn‚Äôt. The last car I went to I asked this woman if I could sit there and she pretended to not hear me. I didn‚Äôt want to tap her shoulder because you never know how people would react so I waved a bit to get her attention and she said she didn‚Äôt want to hold her bag (which was a no). I told her I couldn‚Äôt find any other empty seat and I had already walked the entire train and it‚Äôs leaving soon. She ignored me again. I asked if she could move her bag and she still ignored me. I ended up just sitting in the seat on her purse. 

She began yelling at me telling me I‚Äôm a b!tch and told me to move because she never said I could sit there. I told her that there was no other seat and the train was departing. She began pushing me to move and the conductor luckily came by them and told her to relax. She told him that I touched her purse and he asked if it was occupying a seat and she didn‚Äôt reply. He ended up telling her to be considerate and left to check tickets. 

When the train stop came she said she‚Äôs going to report me to the police for touching her belongings and said I‚Äôm inconsiderate for invaliding her personal space because she had a rough day at work and wanted personal space. I told her that it was still inconsiderate when many people are looking for seats. She said they should‚Äôve been there early enough go get empty seats (this was 9 minutes before departure). 

I‚Äôm a woman for reference so it‚Äôs not like she was simply uncomfortable sitting next to a man. ",CyclingSkater,6663,0.9399999976158142,728,1745443190,2025-04-23 16:19:50,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k6aqqe/aita_for_sitting_on_a_womans_purse_on_the_train/,4,2025
1jyksrp,AITA for yelling at a 19 year old and asking for him to be fired?,"Throwaway account. I (37M) and my husband (39M) have been together 11 years. My husband owns a small bookshop and recently has hired a boy to help him. This lad (I'll call him Joe) is gay and while me and my husband very obviously have no issue with this, Joe seems to do things a lot differently to us. For context both me and my husband are Irish immigrants to London. We grew up a 20 minutes away from each other and went to the same, very Catholic, school. We aren't exactly flamboyant or outwardly 'gay' and don't exactly do PDA since that's how we were raised. On my lunch break from work I like to visit my husband bringing him records I think he might like and his coffee. Recently however Joe has started making comments. It started small with him saying things about'queer joy' and how he loves gay couples which we didn't mind at all, in all fairness it's a fairly scary world for queer people right now and I understand seeing a happy married gay couple means a lot for a kid. But then he started getting a little too comfortable for my liking. He started asking things like 'whose the top' and calling us the f slur jokingly. I think it's entirely inappropriate to be making those comments to his boss but my husband told me to let it go. Joe calls us the f slur a lot which I had brought up a few times telling him calmly to not do that but when he continued I learnt to let go despite my distaste for it since it didnt seem to bother my husband too much but last Wednesday I lost it. 
I was up by the counter when Joe came in. He immediately started blathering on about how f---y we are and while my husband chuckled awkwardly,I did not. Joe noticed this and said I was a stick in the mud and repressed. I was trying to keep my cool until he called me 'a fenian f---t' and I lost it. For anyone who doesn't know the term 'Fenian' isnt exactly a slur or anything but it isn't exactly nice either. Me and my husband jokingly call each other fenians or paddy's from time to time if weve something particularly 'Irish' and I've never exactly viewed as a very offensive word to me but something about this English boy made me snap. I asked him if he thought that was an appropriate thing to say to his boss's partner and started shouting. Telling him hes way out of play and if he wants to keep his job he should buck up. I left to cool down a bit and 30 minutes later got a call from my husband berating me saying that Joe was crying and that hes just a kid. I do feel really bad since hes only young but I still think he needed to be knocked down a step or two, am I the asshole?

Edit: I see a lot of people making comments about the nature of the relationship between Joe and my husband, my husband has asked Joe to stop on my behalf before but this isn't something that really bothers my husband and to be fair it's his workplace not mine.


Update: Joe is my husbands son.
I won't go too much into the details for both my and their privacy but I had a major fight with my husband about why he was being so lenient with him and why we didn't have my back in this. We were shouting back and forth until he shouted something about 'blood being thicker than water' I shout back about him being just some boy and he stopped suddenly. Then he told me. Joe is from an ex girlfriend of his whose now unable to take care of him so my husband picked up. He's been playing child support for years. We each have our separate bank account so I didn't even notice. I'm contemplating separation and divorce. Someone I've known for 25 years became a stranger in 10 seconds. 
I physically got sick thinking back on those sexual remarks that he made to his FATHER. My husband alsways went white as a ghost when he said those kinds of things and that was possibly the only thung he actually gave out to him for but it makes me feel sick all the same",Adventurous-Dog-5299,6544,0.8999999761581421,962,1744586124,2025-04-13 18:15:24,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jyksrp/aita_for_yelling_at_a_19_year_old_and_asking_for/,4,2025
1jvjdip,AITA for refusing to be my sister‚Äôs bridesmaid because she chose ‚Äúugly friends‚Äù to make herself look better?,"My sister (27F) is getting married and asked me (24F) to be one of her bridesmaids. I was excited ‚Äî until I found out who the rest of the bridal party was. Every single one of them is someone she‚Äôs either not that close to, or has made fun of before for being ‚Äúawkward‚Äù or ‚Äúnot photogenic.‚Äù Some of her actual best friends ‚Äî the ones who she sees all the time ‚Äî weren‚Äôt even asked.

It felt weird, so I asked her why she picked this group. She kind of laughed and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand when it‚Äôs your wedding. You don‚Äôt want people who‚Äôll outshine you in your own pictures.‚Äù

I just stared at her. I asked, ‚ÄúSo you picked them because you think they‚Äôll make you look better?‚Äù She rolled her eyes and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that deep. I just want to feel confident that day, and I‚Äôm allowed to be a little selfish for my wedding.‚Äù

That rubbed me the wrong way. I told her I didn‚Äôt want to be part of a bridal party built on tearing other people down ‚Äî even subtly ‚Äî and that she should‚Äôve picked people she actually cares about.

Now she‚Äôs calling me judgmental and sensitive, and our mom says I‚Äôm being ‚Äútoo idealistic‚Äù and should just support her. But I feel like going along with it makes me complicit.

1k8ox5z,AITA for not picking the restaurant my cousin wanted?,"I (25f) just recently received a great promotion at work and I‚Äôm really excited about it. Because of this I decided to invite some family out to dinner to celebrate. I chose a steakhouse and when my cousin, Aria (32f) found out it was a steakhouse called me to let me know that I had to pick a different restaurant. When I asked why she explained it was because she was vegan, gluten-free, and also has a few allergies and couldn‚Äôt trust that they wouldn‚Äôt cross-contaminate her food. I explained to her that there were vegan and gluten free options and we could let the restaurant know of her allergies so everything would be fine. She refused saying it doesn‚Äôt make a difference and told me if I don‚Äôt pick a different restaurant she wouldn‚Äôt attend and hung up.


This has happened in the past as well, whenever I want to go out to a restaurant whether it‚Äôs for an event or a birthday she has an issue with it and has been doing this since I was younger. I remember when I turned 16 she told my parents that I had picked a restaurant she couldn‚Äôt eat at. Because of this my parents let her pick where we went for my birthday and she picked one of my least favourite restaurants and I had no fun. 

To be honest, I don‚Äôt really care if she attends or not so I texted her and let her know that I wouldn‚Äôt be changing the restaurant. Because of this shes been going absolutely feral and texting others to not attend because I‚Äôm being inconsiderate. I‚Äôve been asked if maybe I can change the restaurant for her preferences but I denied.

1k7znn0,AITA for not inviting my nephew to my sons birthday party?,"I (35f) have a son, Cillian (14m) who just recently had a birthday. The issue stems from his birthday from last year, where we invited all his cousins and his friends to celebrate him. The party went great for the first half, but when it came time to cut the cake I went over to fridge to go get it and saw it was half eaten. I was obviously upset about this because this had been a cake that I had made by a professional baker that cost me around $140 and my son really loved the design.

I asked who ate the cake and my sister (44f) laughed it off when her son, Robbie, (16m) told her that he ate the cake because he was hungry. To be clear the cake wasn‚Äôt the only food at the party, throughout the party we served many different dishes such as wings, veggie platters, pizzas, chips, and sodas. I was obviously angry that my son couldn‚Äôt have his cake and had to quickly go out and by one from Walmart. I‚Äôm honestly still shocked that with all the food at the party Robbie still managed to clear half of a huge cake, it was enough to produce about 20 slices.

I called my sister later to tell her I wasn‚Äôt happy with what her son had done and since I had spent so much money on the cake I expected it back. She then accused me of being fat phobic which absolutely is not true, I have never once discriminated against Robbie at any time, this was just a false accusation. To explain, Robbie has a weight problem and has been having issues with binging since he was around 13 which is why he is about 250 pounds and my sister has never failed to let anyone know of that and expects for everyone to bend over backwards for Robbie since he has it hard. 

This year Cillian wanted to have a friends only party with the exception of 2 cousins, one that only his friends and closest cousins could come to since he hated his party from last year. I asked why and he explained to me that he was embarrassed of Robbie since all he did was poke fun at his friends and him, bring his own uninvited plus one, and obviously he ate some of the cake. 

I complied and only invited his friends and allowed 2 of his cousins to join as well. Luckily some of my siblings were understanding, the only one who had an issue with this was my sister. She called me to ask why Robbie wasn‚Äôt invited and I explained to her that Cillian doesn‚Äôt want him there because of what he did last year, my sister was infuriated and said she knew we had an issue with her sons weight. Since then she has been ranting all over Facebook and I‚Äôve been getting calls from relatives and this entire situation has been stressing me out.

1k9gy15,AITA for not eating the birthday cake my boyfriend got me?,"  Alright so my birthday was a couple days ago and I asked my boyfriend like a week before to get me a carrot cake. While I know its not a popular choice for a birthday cake, it's my favourite and practically the only flavour of cake I like (besides red velvet but I wasnt feeling it tbh.) Keeping in mind that I was gonna have a birthday party with my friends, my boyfriend suggested that I get a ""flavour that people like"", which I'd understand maybe if it was a huge party with tons of people, but I know my friends and I know they wouldn't  mind carrot cake at all. 

  Anyways fast forward to my birthday, my boyfriend goes and gets the cake from the shop in the afternoon and I dont get to see it since im getting ready, but he doesn't mention anything to me about it, so i think nothing of it since i like a surprise. My friends arrive and everything's going great until its time for the cake to be served. We gather around the table and everyone sings happy birthday while my boyfriend brings out the cake, and to my horror, i see this big chocolate cake in his hands. I hate chocolate cake. It makes me sick. He KNOWS I hate chocolate cake. 

  My face fell when I saw it but I obvs didnt say anything at the time. However, I did give my bf a glare or two, which he clearly picked up on since he kept insisting I eat the cake infront of everyone as we were serving it out. Something about that made me angry in the moment and I refused to try the cake at all. I cut it, i blew out the candles, I handed it out to eberyone, but i didn't try it myself. 

  I dont think the others took huge notice but once the party ended i started getting unready when my boyfriend comes into our room and is lile ""why do you have to act like a child all the time??"" And im like what the hell and hes like ""you have to make a scene just cos i didn't get your fucking carrot cake"" and he went on about how nobody likes carrot cake and how im spoiled and selfish and looked stupid not eating cake at my own birthday and then claimed he couldnt find carrot cake which is crazy cos 1. Ive never not gone to that shop and NOT seen carrot cake, and 2. even if there wasnt any he coulda picked ANY other flavour, besides the only one I hate. 

 I told him that and he just got really upset like I was the one who started the fight and started going on abt how I was overreacting over cake and how he tried his best to make this bday good for me (which in fairness is true since he put a lot of effort into organising it for me) but honestly I was just livid then. Now we're still kinda off about it and neither of us have lile apologised or anything but im starting to think i did overreact over cake and I probably shoulda just eaten it and then talked tochim later but idk üò≠

1kbt483,AITA for winning my mom‚Äôs storage unit at auction instead of giving her the money to save it herself?,"I (24F) was in and out of the foster care system. My mom would lose custody of me and my three siblings, only to do the bare minimum to get us back, just for the cycle to repeat. I eventually aged out of foster care, went to college, and moved to another state. I still check in with my mom every week. She was diagnosed with heart failure. (which came on from other terrible decisions). I offer support when she reaches out, whether it's with money, food etc. Most of the time I don't hear back. And when I do, it's usually because she wants something. She has a long history of lying to and stealing from all of us. She's currently homeless. We have offered her a place to stay if she gets clean and she wont. After we turned 18, we reconnected with our extended family, grandparents, and cousins, and those relationships have become important to us. A couple of months ago, she called me in a panic at 2:00 in the morning. She said her storage units were about to be auctioned off, that she wasn't even behind on payments, and that the owners were trying to scam her.
She needed $1,000 immediately because there were only 15 hours left before the auction. I told her l'd check in the morning once I got to work and see what I could do. The next day, I did some digging and looked at the contents of the storage units. What was listed broke my heart: family photos, vases from great-grandparents, personal documents (birth certificates, Social Security cards, my mom's clothing and tools, and everything from my grandmother's house (she passed away just last year). I decided to bid on the unit myself and ended up spending nearly $1,200 for it. Afterward, I spoke to the owners, who told me they'd been trying to help my mom for months: discounts, payment extensions etc. But eventually, she just stopped answering them. They said they had no other option but to auction it. I was devastated. My siblings said that if I hadn't stepped in, all of those memories and important documents would've ended up in a stranger's hands. My siblings were relieved and grateful... but my mom? She accused me of violating her trust, told me l ""emotionally robbed her"" , that I stole from her, and said I was a mistake. She even claimed our grandparents would be ashamed of me. I ended up taking a few days off work, drove out of state to the unit, and went through everything. I only kept what belonged to me and my siblings-photos, documents, anything tied to our family history. I didn't throw away a single item of hers. Instead, I rented a new storage unit just down the road, moved all her belongings there, and paid three months in advance. I gave her all the info. Now I'm stuck with this heavy feeling. I can't shake the guilt, like l crossed a line or sank to her level somehow. But at the same time, I couldn't bear to see everything important to us vanish, especially knowing it would probably happen again in six months.

""Make sure Josh to go to the dentist for his cracked tooth."" or ""Make sure Josh updates his passport."" or ""Make sure Josh changes his pet food for his cat. We don't like the brand."" Or ""Make sure Josh does his taxes. You may need to sit with him and help."" The most recent has been convincing Josh to get a new job in an entirely unrelated field because Josh's parents don't feel like he makes enough money. (Josh makes 70k, I make 110k so we are doing fine.)  

Typically I respond with some variation of ""I'm fully capable Josh can figure it out himself, and if not, it will be a good learning experience for him."" but that hasn't stopped Josh's parents. Now I'm planning on being a little harsher and telling them I'm not Josh's babysitter and to leave me out of these concerns.

1jzd7j8,AITA for listening to music in the car my husband doesn't like after a concert?,"This weekend, my teen daughter and I went to see Megan Moroney. My husband wanted to come along even though I told him it could be just a girls night with my daughter and I. He insisted on going because he didn't want us to be out late by ourselves, even though he does not care for Megan's music.

So my daughter and I enjoy the concert so much! She was so excited she almost cried from pure joy. Everything was great, concert ended, we go to our vehicle.

My daughter and I are still having a good time, kind of on a post-concert high. I turn one of Megan moroney's songs on and we start singing along. My husband abruptly turns it off. At first I thought, ok maybe he just wants some peace as he drives but he says ""turn it on something else!"" I said ""why, we were listening to that?"" He said ""well I don't want to"" or someone like that and starts complaining about how awful megan moroney is and how her songs are all man-bashing, etc. I said ""whoa buddy we told you that it could just be a girls night like you insisted on coming!"" So we ride home in silence and my daughter is really disappointing. One of our favorite things to do is turn the music on and sing along in the car.

1k6bxmx,AITA for snapping at my mom after she tried to force me to learn sign language?,"My (13M) mom (35F) has been dating with her now fianc√© (38M) (let‚Äôs call him Jeremy) for two years. Five months ago he proposed her and they got engaged, and moved in together, and now they are planning their wedding. I am cool with this. I really like Jeremy, they were friends before they started dating, so I met and got close to him before he started dating my mom. I think he‚Äôs really cool and I am happy for my mom. 

My issue is with his annoying and arrogant son, he is only 2 years older than me but acts like he‚Äôs too cool to hang out with me. He treats me like a little kid but there‚Äôs only 2 years between us.

I will call him Dean. Dean is deaf, and has to use a device (it‚Äôs called cochlear implants) to hear. But he can‚Äôt wear his device all the time because apparently hearing can be exhausting for him. Tbh I think this is an excuse he uses to avoid hanging out with us. But that‚Äôs what he claims. 

Anyway he and Jeremy both know sign language but my mom and I don‚Äôt. My mom has started learning after she got engaged with Jeremy and she‚Äôs pressuring me to learn too but I‚Äôm refusing because i don‚Äôt want to spend my time learning a whole language for him when he clearly doesn‚Äôt even like me. 

My mom says I am being disrespectful because we now basically live semi together. (He comes to stay with Jeremy on the weekends. I live with my mom full time. So unfortunately I have to stay with Dean on weekends) 

Two days ago my mom (in front of Jeremy btw) started telling me about this great ASL tutor she found online and how she‚Äôs thinking sign me up for her classes. I lost my temper, yelled and told her I don‚Äôt want to and just stop fking pressuring me. I was told to go to my room for yelling at her, and was grounded for a day for using that word.

1jxqsks,"AITA for not inviting my dad‚Äôs partner to my micro ‚Äúwedding‚Äù dinner, and for not reaching out to her first to explain why?","Using a throwaway to not connect this to my main.

My partner and I are getting married this summer, and we‚Äôve decided to essentially elope. We‚Äôre going to have a private ceremony just the two of us during our honeymoon. Not only does this align very much with who we are, so no one in our life is very surprised by this, but we‚Äôre also doing it because: 1. our families live scattered across the world and a larger event would mean leaving a lot of people out, and 2. We want to avoid drama.

However, what we do want to do is get dressed up, take photos, and have a dinner together with our immediate families. So essentially, a micro non-wedding celebration. This is where the issues start.

So I told my parents I wanted to have this small event with just them, my partner, and my sister (not including their ‚Äúnew‚Äù partners). My parents went through a nasty divorce when I was in my teens, and for several reasons that I explained to them I wanted an intimate event just the five of us. My mom was fully supportive, saying she can understand why this would be so meaningful for me.

My dad understood too. But he wanted me to be the one to break the news to his partner (54F). I didn‚Äôt think I had to, because it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm calling everyone single other family member who isn‚Äôt invited to explain this decision. But I said that if she‚Äôs upset she‚Äôs more than welcome to call me and we can talk about it. His partner is very sensitive, and we‚Äôve clashed a lot over the years because I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ever been fully willing to understand the nuances of coming into a family after a divorce. Their relationship started shortly after the divorce, and she tried to parent both my sister and I (who were teens/pre-teens) from the get-go. But even though we‚Äôre not close, I‚Äôve done my best to otherwise be welcoming and kind.

Well, now he‚Äôs told her and all hell has broken lose. She‚Äôs completely beside herself, and he wants me to mitigate the issue and reach out. I‚Äôve reiterated that she‚Äôs free to call me - if she can‚Äôt possibly understand why this is about me and not her (and I can understand she‚Äôs disappointed, but so is, I assume, everyone else) then she should reach out to me.

AITA for not inviting her, and for not breaking the news to her, and for refusing to be the first person to reach out here to resolve this? I can kind of see my dad's point, who says I should be extra mindful of her since she is a sensitive person who has had a hard time accepting we're not very close and takes this personally. However, at the same time, I don't think I'm responsible for her feelings or for cleaning up this 'mess.' I also believe in the idea of ‚Äúmy wedding, my choice.‚Äù",Powerful-Bug-7639,3636,0.9200000166893005,905,1744490260,2025-04-12 15:37:40,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jxqsks/aita_for_not_inviting_my_dads_partner_to_my_micro/,4,2025
1k73ok5,AITA for taking my daughter out of school for a week for a vacation,"I (m39) have a daughter (10) ‚ÄúK‚Äù from my previous relationship, I also have a daughter (18 months) with my wife now. My wife is mom to K, I don't want to get into it but K‚Äôs  bio mom is not a part of her Life. 

I go on business trips for work around 3-4 times a year. In a week I'm going to Florida. My wife and I decided to make this one a trip for our family, we figured it would be perfect staying in a resort with pools and things to do for my wife and Daughter‚Äôs while I work then in the evening we can do stuff together. Of course K will have to miss a week of school, we are getting her school work for the week so she can work on it while gone. 

Yesterday I was talking on the phone with my mom. I had told her about my business trip and how I my wife and daughter‚Äôs were going. She mentioned something about K staying with her. I asked what she was talking about. She said K has to stay with her since we‚Äôll be gone for a week. I told her no, K is coming with. She argued that she has school I told her its a trip and memories, she‚Äôll always remember. Unlike a 4th grade spelling test. My mom got really upset with me, said It's not good to let K miss so much school. The only other time she missed school this year was 2 sick days. I don't think its smart to constantly let her miss school but going on a trip with her family and missing a little school isn't the end of the world. 

My mom said I'm setting K  up for failure, I told her its the 4th grade. Plus she  would feel so left out If everyone went but her. My mom called me an AH and said I'm not the son she raised.

1k9i2j5,AITA for not letting my brother's girlfriend have one of my cupcakes??,"ok so like last weekend my mom threw a little family get together at our house cause it was her bday. nothing crazy, just cousins and stuff. i decided to bake cupcakes the night before (i'm not a professional baker or anything but they came out super good tbh).

anyways i made like 24 cupcakes and put them out on a tray on the counter. i specifically told everyone that they were for after dinner because my mom wanted to do a candle thing with them instead of a regular cake.

so my brother (he‚Äôs 22) shows up with his girlfriend, who nobody really knows that well cause they been dating for like 2 months? she‚Äôs nice i guess but a little pushy. like she acts like she‚Äôs already part of the family or whatever. idk.

fast forward, we're all just hanging out and i see her just straight up grabbing a cupcake off the tray. i go over and i‚Äôm like ""hey can you pls wait till after dinner? my mom wants to do candles with them"" and she kinda just stares at me like im crazy and goes ‚Äúit‚Äôs just one.‚Äù

i said ""yeah but they're for later"" and she literally rolled her eyes at me and put it back... after taking a BITE. so now that one‚Äôs ruined obviously.

my brother got mad and pulled me aside later saying i was rude and made her feel unwelcome and ""it‚Äôs not a big deal"" but like?? it wasnt just about the cupcake, it was about the whole plan.

my mom said i didn‚Äôt do anything wrong but some of my cousins said i shoulda just let it go cause ""family first"" and now my brother‚Äôs still being weird with me.

1jx3t03,AITA for going out to eat when my husband is working late shifts?,"My husband and I work different shifts. I worked first shift and he works a late second shift. So we don‚Äôt often eat dinner together because he leaves for work right before I get home and he gets home from work after I am asleep. 

We also have very different tastes in foods. He has a more basic, American food based diet and he also loves seafood. I love foods from other cultures, but I don‚Äôt like seafood. Because of this, when we are home together we cook different meals and eat it together. If I make something he likes, I‚Äôll ask if he wants some. If he makes something I like, he does the same. But we always eat together on our days off, whether it be eating out on a date or eating cooked food at home. We‚Äôve been doing this for years and it‚Äôs worked. 

But since we work different shifts, 5 to 6 days per week, I am eating dinner alone. I usually cook, but a couple times per month, I go out to a restaurant that serves food he doesn‚Äôt like to have dinner. When we are talking later, I usually tell him how I had something from a restaurant and he asks how it was and I tell him. No biggie. 

The other day I was out trying a Peruvian restaurant recommended by a coworker. My husband and I had looked at the menu and he didn‚Äôt see anything he was particularly looking forward to on it, so I added it to my list of places to go when he works. And I went that day. He got out of work early and called me and I told him where I was. And he got mad. 

I finished up and went home and he was upset and asked how long this has been going on for. I was confused because he knows I do this. But apparently he thought I did pickup or delivery. I tend to eat in because I don‚Äôt want dishes at home. He also can‚Äôt really explain why he is so mad, but it seems he‚Äôs mad I‚Äôm out dining alone? I just go out, get food, and read while I wait and eat. Then I come home. It‚Äôs always food he won‚Äôt like as well, so I go alone so I can have it. 

He hasn‚Äôt been really talking to me since it happened. The conversations are short and cold and it makes me feel like I did something wrong by doing this for years and not specifying I eat in the restaurant to do it. He has never acted this way about anything else, he has always been very kind and willing to work through any issues we have. So I am not sure what‚Äôs different with this.

1k1q1zp,AITA for setting boundaries with my sister during her pregnancy?,"
Hi all,
I (19s, F) have a older sister who is pregnant with her second child. She has a 1.5-year-old son. During her first pregnancy, I supported her a lot because her husband was working full-time. I was happy to do it at the time.

This time, her husband is studying from home and is present all day. Still, she frequently asks me for help‚Äîrunning errands, watching her toddler after I finish work, etc. I‚Äôve suggested they consider part-time daycare to give her a break, but she insists her son is too young and that I should help.

Recently, she told me she expects me to care for her toddler for the entire first month after the baby is born, so she and her husband can focus on the newborn. I told her I‚Äôm exhausted after work and that since her husband is home, he should be more involved.

What‚Äôs been hard is that when I do help, she often tells our mom that I‚Äôm not doing enough. Then I get scolded by our mom, which makes me feel unappreciated and guilty.

I care about my sister, but I feel like she‚Äôs assuming I‚Äôll always be available, without considering my own limits. I‚Äôm starting to feel emotionally drained and like my efforts aren‚Äôt respected.

So, AITA for saying no and establishing limits even though she‚Äôs pregnant?",Internal_Path8845,2326,0.9700000286102295,346,1744930250,2025-04-17 17:50:50,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k1q1zp/aita_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_sister_during/,4,2025
1jpa51m,AITA for forbidding my girlfriend from doing household chores?,"A few years ago while putting together furniture, my (26m) girlfriend (27f) injured her wrists from using the screwdriver. We ended up getting her some wrist braces until the pain went away. We eventually checked with a doctor who said it was no big deal.

Since then, I've slowly forbidden her from doing chores around the house. I noticed that doing these chores (sweeping, scrubbing, cleaning dishes, etc.) would consistently agitated her wrists and she wouldn't be able to work on her actual job (small handmade crafts that require a lot of wrist usage.) I kept seeing the pattern of her straining her wrist on chores > bail out on her job after an hour or two and have to wear her wrist brace until the next day. She does love her job and when things go well can happily work up to 6 hours a day on her crafts, so since I can't do her job for her I want her to be able to focus on it.

I have no problem doing these chores, but today I caught her scrubbing a pan when I'd just reminded her yesterday to leave them alone and told her to call me if I'd missed one (and I would have hustled over to do it.)

She told me I'm being overbearing and that she's fine to scrub a pan, but I don't want her getting injured or develop worse long term damage.

AITA for insisting on doing the household chores?

Edit: Some clarifications.

- I should have put ""forbidding"" in quotes. I can't really stop her from doing anything besides maybe chiding her afterwards. I'm not her dad lol.

- I have shown her this thread and she agrees my version of events is more or less accurate but she still feels she's right.

Edit 2: Hello everyone. I stopped responding yesterday because I basically had the answer I needed 10 comments in (I was being the asshole lol) and then this post ended up getting almost 300. I actually got chided myself for spending so much time responding to messages that I ended up slacking on my work.

- I've gotten her a little jig to open soda cans with. I didn't know these things existed until yesterday.

- A lot of people are trying to diagnose her in the comments. We'll keep your ideas in mind the next time we go to the doctor/specialist (and I'll accompany her (if she wants) since people have let me know doctors don't always take women seriously.)

- I appreciate the level headed comments that aimed to help me understand her perspective more (which is why I posted.) To the people voting ESH she says: ""Why am I catching strays here? I just want to do the dishes!""

- Some of you are very angry lol

1k6cvh7,AITA for leaving to have my break in another room when someone else walked into the one I was already in?,"Apologies for any grammer mistakes, writing this in a waiting room and I think im being called up next so im not really spell checking anything. 

Okay so for some context my workplace has 4 small break rooms. We're allowed to take our breaks whenever we want and because we dont have alot of employees at the moment most of the time when I take my break no one else is present in any of the rooms. 

I prefer the quiet since being yelled at by customers constantly gives me quite the headache, and im pretty introverted normally so I quite enjoy break time. The break room I prefer to use is labled as ""room A"" and its where my and a few others lockers are located. 

Okay now, I was enjoying my break as normal and my co-worker Selly walked in to grab something from their locker, shortly after their phone rang and they took the call. They were in this call for only about 2 minutes, and it didn't sound like they were gonna end it anytime soon, so I moved to break room B. This wasnt out of malice or anything, I just like my peace and quiet.  

The next day I noticed the stickynote that labled my locker was missing, I assumed it fell off, put a new one on it, and went to start my day. Break time hits and theres someone in room A so I go to room B and thats when I found my old stickynote on a random unused locker. I was confused and asked the guy that was in room A if he knew who moved it and why. He said ""Oh Selly moved it because he thought you were going to move lockers anyway."" This answer was very confusing so I went and found Selly to ask him myself if he was the one who moved it and why. 

After I asked he said ""Oh I thought you wanted a room to yourself since you so rudely left room A when I walked in for only a moment"". I told him that me leaving had nothing to do with him, and that I just liked the quiet, but his response was something like ""well now you can have all the peace and quiet you want"" and got into his car before I could respond.  

He seemed really mad, and honestly I just want to know if I really did do something wrong. I dont always catch if im being rude so maybe I really am the asshole here, thus I wrote this post to find out. 

Edit: I didn't expect this post to blow up, hahah... thank you for your comments everyone! I will be talking to HR tomorrow about the situation.

1k0uoqa,AITA for cancelling on my friend after she wouldn‚Äôt pay for our lunch?," I 16F and my friend 17F (let‚Äôs call her D) have been friends for about 3 years. We are very close and hang out outside of school very frequently. We agreed to meet each other for a couple hours to study for our ap test. For context: every month my parents give me 100-200 dollars on a credit card so I can budget out what i‚Äôm going to spend for the month and D has been asking me almost every. single. day if I can get her coffee before school as I go very frequently. I‚Äôm going to be honest it does bother me that she asks all the time considering she has a bigger amount of money than me and she could easily just go get one herself before school and she never offers to pay me back. So knowing this, I asked her if she could pay for the food at our hang out since I got her about 5 coffees this month without being payed back. She agreed at first and then said she couldn‚Äôt anymore because she needs to buy a different friend a birthday present. I told her that my monthly allowance had run out and that I couldn‚Äôt go anymore. She seemed annoyed but I didn‚Äôt want to ask if she was upset or bring up that I was upset. I feel like it‚Äôs very selfish that she asks me for coffee almost every day but then won‚Äôt pay for our most likely 20 dollar meal. She also asks other people for coffee when I say no and I feel really used just because I drive to school and she has a license and a car but her dad drives her. 


UPDATE: she reluctantly agreed to pay after I told her I couldn‚Äôt go if she wasn‚Äôt paying and to answer some questions: the coffees are about 7 dollars each and I do get myself one too when I get her one and to be clear she has had my back in the past and payed for  big expensive meals once or twice when I really had no money she hasn‚Äôt been asking for the coffees for very long only about a month or so .

1jt7ogm,AITA for not buying my stepdaughter a new car after she's repeatedly gotten into accidents?,"My step daughter is not a good driver. She was not a good driver when she was a teen and certainly not as an adult. When she was first learning to drive, she did very fast hard breaks, she repeatedly left her car's lights on or left her car unlocked.

When she first got her permit at 16, we gave her two rules. We would help buy her first car but she'd be on her own for car insurance, gas, and up keep. If she wanted a car, she needed to be the sole caretaker of it and it was on her to ensure she was taking good care of it. Her brothers had the same rules.

3 months into her being 17, she got in her first accident. It was her first time driving in the ice and she slid. Her car hit another car. It was not a serious accident, but it caused roughly 1k in damages. Her car drove for another 2 months, but the transmission went out eventually. She bought it at 160-ishk miles so none of us were surprised it didn't last very long.

When she was 19, she was in another car accident. While on the highway, a semi-truck tried to merge wile riding next to her, she sped up and during it, another car tried to merge right as she sped up. The car was totaled. Outside of wiplash and minor wrist injuries, she was okay. Because of this accident, we made her get her own insurance because our payment went up.

Three weeks ago, she was involved in another accident. Again on the highway, she was passing an on ramp and a car coming on hydroplanned and lost control of a ladder in the back of it's pick up truck. It again totaled her car: it could not leave the scene and we had to get her to bring her back to her college. The other driver broke his collarbone and she has wiplash, a shoulder injury, and some facial damage that should heal in the next bit. The police officer told her that it was not her fault, but obviously we have to wait for the insurance to make that call.

Once she got home from the ER, she asked for us to help her purchase a new car. She said that it's not practical for her to constantly walk everywhere until she could afford a new car. She makes $21 an hour as a CMA at a nursing home so it won't take her long to buy a cheap car. From her apartment, she is about 1.5 miles from college, .25 miles from a grocery store, and 4 miles from her job. I think for the time being, she can walk, ask for rides from friends, or use an app. We don't have public transportation, but lots of side walks. She can walk the entirety from her apartment to class, most to a store, and on and off from her job.

My husband wants us to purchase a new car and have her pay us back. I don't think this is the right move. To date, the only time we have ever helped buy a car is when they all started driving, and we only paid half. She only saved 2k for her first car, so we only gave 4k for a new car. One of her brothers saved up 10k, so we gave 10k. If we start doing this now, we will walk down a very expensive walk.

I have gotten mixed reactions from others.

1jzavfx,AITA for changing reservations over something my sister said?,"Throwaway. I (20F) turned 20 last week. I made reservations at a restaurant for the evening of my birthday and planned for me, my mum, my stepdad, my best friend and my younger sister (18) to go. Two days before my birthday, me and my sister had an argument because I wasn't able to pick her up because my friend had a medical emergency and I was the only one with him at the time so stayed with him. I was able to leave when the ambulance arrived due to his sister getting there. I was panicking at the time and forgot to text her that I wasn't able to pick her up. I completely forgot I was supposed to pick her up and then went home. I apologised profusely and she was still furious. We were both shouting because the argument got heated. She then said ""You're acting just like our dad"". Our dad was neglectful and emotionally abusive to us growing up, we often argued with him and he frequently forgot to pick us up from school. This comment devastated me, I still have a lot of trauma I am working through because of our dad and she knows very well these type of comments hurt.

She kept repeating that I was acting like our dad and told me that I'm no better than him. I left and she tried to call me but I didn't answer.  I decided to change the birthday dinner reservations from 5 to 4 and texted her that she was no longer invited. I received no reply. I had a good birthday overall but my sister made no effort to contact me and didn't acknowledge the text I had sent her. When it came time for the dinner, she called me and was screaming that I needed to change the reservations again to include her because she wanted to come. I hung up on her. I had told everyone coming to the dinner what was happening beforehand and they seemed fine with it until we got to the restaurant and my mum told me she was disappointed I couldn't be the bigger person. I was shocked and asked what she meant and she told me what she said ""wasn't that bad"". All throughout dinner, she kept saying that I needed to get over ""silly disagreements"". I left after paying and haven't spoken to my mums since. I keep thinking about what happened and I don't know if my mum was right, I don't know if should have been the bigger person.

1jq0f1m,AITA for leaving the house when I found out my wife invited her mom on our vacation?,"I (28M) have always had a rocky relationship with my wife's mom. She‚Äôs overbearing, constantly inserting herself into our lives, and doesn‚Äôt respect boundaries. Any time I try to set limits, she either ignores them or acts like I‚Äôm being unfair.

My wife and I planned a two week vacation just the two of us. I saved up and handled all the planning, while she was in charge of booking the flights. Her mom caught wind of the trip and immediately started pushing to come along. I told my wife no I wanted this to be a trip for us, not a family getaway. Her mom threw a tantrum, called, texted, and even got other relatives to pressure me. My wife tried to convince me to let her come, but I refused. She eventually agreed and said she wouldn‚Äôt invite her.

The night before we were supposed to leave, I was double-checking our travel plans when I noticed an extra ticket on the reservation‚Äîher mom‚Äôs name was on it. I confronted my wife, and she admitted she booked it behind my back, hoping I‚Äôd ""just go along with it"" once it was already done.

I was furious. Instead of arguing, I packed a bag‚Äînot for the trip, but to leave. I told her if she wanted to vacation with her mom so badly, she could, but I wasn‚Äôt going. She started crying, saying I was ""ruining everything"" and that since the ticket was already bought, I should just deal with it. I walked out and went to stay at a friend‚Äôs place for a few days to clear my head.

Now, she‚Äôs been calling me nonstop, saying I overreacted and made her look bad. She even told our families, and some of them think I should‚Äôve just gone and ""made the best of it"" instead of ""wasting money"" and causing drama.

1k3yc8d,AITA for not cleaning before guests came over because I was tired?,"I usually do a majority of chores in the house. My husband helps with laundry and sometimes vacuums, but that‚Äôs pretty much it. I usually don‚Äôt mind because things get done at my pace, if something bothers him, he cleans it, and he is generally appreciative of what I do. And if I ask for help, he will help. 

Lately he has been having friends over after work. He works second shift, so I am asleep by the time this happens. In the past, if he mentioned having people over, I would clean. 
But a couple days ago he mentioned people would be coming over and it was a couple hours before I was going to sleep. 

The last few weeks have been very stressful for me and I haven‚Äôt been cleaning as much as I usually do. I just didn‚Äôt have it in me to clean much before they came over. I was tired. I just cleaned up the dishes from dinner and took out the trash but didn‚Äôt have energy to do more. Then I went to sleep. 

I woke up and he was not in bed. I had some text messages from him saying how it was embarrassing having people over the house because it wasn‚Äôt cleaned. He says it was disrespectful to him and his friends because I knew they were coming but didn‚Äôt fully clean up. 

I talked to him about it later that day and he said the same points again. He said I had a couple hours before bed and I should‚Äôve at least vacuumed, mopped, and picked things up. I told him I was too tired to do that and if he wants to have me do all the cleaning, then he needs to accept it will be done at my pace and depending on what time, energy, and motivation I have. I don‚Äôt mind doing it, but it‚Äôs on my schedule. That‚Äôs the price of the arrangement. 

He thinks I was being spiteful by not cleaning more and that I am being rude by my comment on our arrangement. But I just didn‚Äôt have the energy for more cleaning.

1k76rc2,AITA for telling my friend that the things that happen to aren‚Äôt bad luck and they are her fault?,"I am 22f and my friend is 23f.

She quit a job she had for about a year because she had a disagreement with a colleague, she ended up reporting this colleague even though the disagreement was about the best way to complete a task. She reports every person who dares disagree with her or gives her negative criticism.

Four of her pets have died in the past year because she doesn‚Äôt look after them properly, and everyone gives her sympathy. She goes into depressive episodes because a fish died. I lose a close friend and I need support, but she cannot be there for me because her fish died.

She quit another job this week because they provided feedback for her performance, she reported the entire company and is now job hunting. I have given her hundreds of job recommendations for companies hiring, yet she doesn‚Äôt want to apply for any of them for various reasons, then complains that she doesn‚Äôt have a job.

Every single thing is about her in my friendship group. If she plans something and no one is free, then it‚Äôs because none of us want to hang out with her. If I propose a certain activity, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm selfish. If I don‚Äôt want to go out one weekend, it‚Äôs because I think I‚Äôm better than her.

She also tries to frame every single man as being a creep, even if he has done nothing. She harassed my boyfriend at the time, yet she accused him of being a creep for staying in a hotel with me. She also accused him of being a creep for worrying about what my friends thought of him, as they have a history of labelling men as creeps even if they are innocent.

She has a view that everyone is evil. She wouldn‚Äôt speak to me for a week because she found out I watched a film that starred a problematic man who was cancelled for being accused of SA, even though I did not know he had been accused of that before I watched it. She accused me of being obsessed with her when I bought the same top as her unknowingly and when I got my belly button pierced after she did.

I told her that these negative things are happening to her, not because she has bad luck or has been cursed, it‚Äôs because she doesn‚Äôt care enough about her life to even try and because she is used to the world bending over backwards for her. I said that she is the issue and she lives in a fantasy world.

I think I am the AH because I spoke to her in a very harsh and cruel way when I know she struggles with criticism and feedback.

1k4rt8k,AITA for agreeing to help a woman beggar at the grocery store and then bailing on her?,"I was going into my local grocery store to get a few things and a woman outside stopped me and asked if I would get something for her kids. I would prefer to buy something from a store than give out money because I know exactly what it‚Äôs being used for (not drugs or alcohol) so I agreed. She insisted on  coming into the store with me. We go in and she bee-lines it to the laundry aisle and picks out the most expensive detergent (around $30-40). She tells me she needs to wash her daughter‚Äôs clothes. I reluctantly agreed and started walking her towards the check out. Then she starts saying she hasn‚Äôt washed her hair and picks out a shampoo, soap, and conditioner. Not the grocery store brand either that‚Äôs fairly cheap but the name brand stuff. It seemed like she was intentionally picking out the most expensive items in the aisle. 

I get in line and she joins me with like 7 or 8 things now in her arms probably adding up to $80-100. I froze for a minute not knowing what to do. It was a long line that day so I had a few minutes to process. Finally I just told her I was sorry and walked out with her standing in line holding the items. I walked a few streets over to a smaller grocery store and got everything I needed. 

My gut tells me she was trying to rip me off but I also felt awful thinking about the look on her face as I turned to leave and how embarrassing it must have been for her to be stood in line after that or putting the items back.

1jvfln7,AITA for getting frustrated that my girlfriend always falls asleep on the couch?,"We‚Äôve been dating for over 2.5 years. She always falls asleep when we watch TV or relax on the couch. Initially, this was adorable as someone was willing to trust me enough to consistently fall asleep on me. I was patient and gently woke her up and put her to bed. After a year, I became impatient because I knew her well enough to be able to tell she was getting comfortable and about to sleep. So, I pause what we‚Äôre watching and ask if she wants to go to bed. She always says she wants to stay on my lap. At first, I found this heartwarming and finished the remaining chores in the house, even though I didn‚Äôt appreciate she didn‚Äôt want to do it before falling asleep. And when i woke her back up to move to the bedroom she always wakes up confused and agitated. This makes me uncomfortable, and I‚Äôve never liked waking anyone up. I also started feeling a bit parental which is not the kind of relationship i want to have. 

Last night she was falling asleep on the couch again and i needed to go shower. I asked her if she wants to stay up or go to bed because I am going to shower. She said she will stay up until i am back. When i returned from the shower i found her sleeping and all of her homework left out on the table (she needs to pack up so she can leave to work tomorrow). We had a major fight because i woke her up but in an openly annoyed and agitated way and told her to start ‚Äúacting like an adult and sleep on the bed‚Äù.

1k7yr8k,AITA for holding SO responsible for kid eating food meant to be shared,"SO has 2 teen boys. They're going through puberty and rapidly growing, I get it. My problem is one of them consistently - about once a week - eats ALL of something that was bought for everyone to share. Sometimes it's all in one sitting, sometimes he takes it to his room and munches over 1-2 days until it's gone before anyone notices. In the past I've never complained because he's a teen (try to be understanding) and not my kid....

But a few days ago I get groceries including Costco size bags of tortilla chips and chocolate chips. Next day I'm looking to eat some chips and salsa, chips gone. I know what happened. Annoyed but don't. A few hours later I go down to bake with the chocolate chips and they're gone too, an entire 48 oz bag disappeared, emptied.

SO is out to dinner so I wait until it's supposed to be over then text him simply saying all the chips and chocolate chips I bought yesterday got eaten, buy more on the way home. Which he does. But then gets home fuming for making him do it. I tell him I think his anger is misplaced because I shouldn't have even had to ask, that stuff shouldn't be gone already. He's like what do you expect me to do about it? I tell him I just expect him to be responsible for his kid's actions. Then he said he will tell the teens not to touch anything I buy ever again. I replied you know that's not what I'm saying, you can allow whatever behavior you want but if it's inconsiderateness you should be still responsible for making right when it affects other people. He still thinks I'm being ridiculous, that it's no big deal.

They were already older when we got married, their mom is actively involved, and SO and I agreed that I should stay out of parenting and punishment.

I'll also add that if I see this kind of stuff happening I do say something politely just being the adult, like hey how about take a bowl of chips to your room instead of the whole bag, you can always get more but somebody else might want some... or like hey before you eat that last slice of pizza maybe you should see if your brother wants it since we got it for yall to share. I just don't lecture or reprimand after the fact, because it seems to cross into more punishment territory... besides that, SO allows it and it seems to mostly just happen behind my back at this point.

Also I could not go to the store myself because we have a baby who was already asleep for the night.

1jt74ox,AITA for how I explained to SIL that she wouldn't be my son's godmother?,"My wife and I aren‚Äôt practicing Catholics per se but we do follow certain traditions such as christening ceremonies for our children. Some people choose a married couple to be godparents; when I was a baby, my parents chose my uncle and his then-wife, and they divorced when I was still a child and I lost all contact with my former-aunt and basically grew up ‚Äòwithout‚Äô a godmother.

So my wife and I always thought it was best to choose one of our relatives, and one from each side of our family. For our second son, I chose my brother as godfather, and my wife chose a cousin of hers as godmother. When I called my brother to invite him, he assumed I was asking both him and his wife, and there was this awkward moment when I had to explain to him my SIL wouldn‚Äôt be the godmother. He seemed fine with it, but my SIL didn‚Äôt attend the ceremony and my brother later told me she was a bit upset.

So I called her later that day just so there wouldn‚Äôt be any ill feelings, and I briefly explained our reasoning, including my own personal history with my uncle's divorce. And then she got really mad, as if I was implying I believe she and my brother will get divorced down the road, which was not my point AT ALL. She also said just as couples might get divorced, anyone can also lose touch with a blood-relative, which is objectively truth, but again, not the point we were making here.

1junjqs,AITA for keeping a relationship with my brothers ex wife when they have two kids together?,"
My brother was married to his wife for 14 years and has two boys together (10 and 12). Their marriage struggled a lot, but they made it last for that long. I became super close with his wife and she was a wonderful wife and mother to him.

I know for a fact my brother cheated on her in the past even though he won‚Äôt admit it to me. I‚Äôm also 99% sure he left his wife for his current girlfriend although he won‚Äôt admit that either.

The divorce has been nasty and restraining orders against him have been in place and everything. They can only speak about the boys.

Recently myself (aunt of the boys) and my mother (grandmother of the boys) made plans to get together with the children and the ex-wife. These plans included staying the night at our house because they live out of town.  My brother found out and blew up, was super pissed off but we were firm that this was not fair for the children and the kids deserve to see everyone get along for their sake. My brother talks shit about their mother often, even infront of them, and we always vowed to not take sides for the sake of the kids.

Of course everything escalated. Our other sibling called me basically telling me we were terrible, how it was selfish to do this to our brother and how dare we pick the ex over family. Basically I was told we were pieces of shit for choosing the children over everything else and neither of my siblings see it as compassion for the kids.

At this the family is split and my brother wants nothing to do with us and neither does my other siblings apparently. 

AITA for this letting my brothers ex wife stay at our house with the kids? Should we not have any sort of relationship with her? In my mind it‚Äôs best for the kids to see each side of the family get along and not hate eachother. The divorce has been very traumatizing for both of them. 


ETA: I want to thank everyone who commented on this and gave me reassurance that we did the right thing here and severing ties with my brother isn‚Äôt the end of the world. I‚Äôm so disappointed at the behavior of him and our other sibling. Unfortunately, they will only associate themselves with people that are on their side 100% of the time and support them to the bitter end. This happens with all of their friendships and everything. However, I‚Äôm the person that will tell you when I feel like you may be leaning on the wrong side a bit, and urge people to see the other point of view, and it‚Äôs always out of pure love. Regardless, it‚Äôs okay if we‚Äôre the bad guys here.

Children always come first no matter what and I‚Äôll be their ride or die forever. One day kids will figure it out and I hope when that happens, they know we were always on their side, because they matter the most.

1kb0w6d,AITAH for telling my grandma she can‚Äôt wear blue at my wedding?,"PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE THING!

My (24F) fiance (25M) are getting married in June and we‚Äôve invited our families, obviously. The colors we chose are light blue, tan, and navy blue. For a little bit of context, my parents went through a horrible divorce when I was 13. My dad‚Äôs mom (the grandma I‚Äôm talking about) was VERY hateful to my mom and just outright disrespectful to her so I‚Äôm not her biggest fan. She‚Äôs always gone against the rules and done whatever she‚Äôs wanted to with no repercussions. She enables my dad who is an addict and she knows it‚Äôs wrong (not important but just trying to set the scene). It‚Äôs a little awkward going to family gatherings on my dad‚Äôs side because I feel like the black sheep of the family. My sister (33F) is my half sister on my dad‚Äôs side, we‚Äôve become closer through the years. 
My grandma called me about 2pm today and we talked about wedding stuff and she asked me what I wanted her to wear. I told her I wasn‚Äôt picky, just no white and no light blue. 

Later today, my sister and my grandma went to JCPenny to shop. My sister found a dress she loved, it‚Äôs also important to note my sister is a bridesmaid in my wedding. They are wearing light blue. My grandma sees the dress and loves it as well saying it would be perfect for the wedding. However, she meant for herself. Not for my sister. My grandma bought a light blue (almost white) dress to wear to our wedding. My sister told me about it, as she thought my grandma had bought the dress for her and didn‚Äôt realize that she bought it for herself (my sister is not the brightest bulb in the box), and my grandma picked the dress when my sister walked away from it because it was too expensive for her to buy for herself. I know this is my grandma, it‚Äôs not that deep, but it does upset me she chose a color I specifically asked her to not wear as my wedding party is wearing that color. Since she has a habit of going against the rules and wearing whatever she wants, this doesn‚Äôt surprise me. We have recently thought she has been having some memory problems, but I‚Äôm not sure. I haven‚Äôt confronted her yet but I plan to. I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being an asshole by confronting her. TIA!

1k9hce1,AITAH for leaving my sister‚Äôs wedding early after she wore my ‚Äúrevenge dress‚Äù without asking?,"hi everyone, i really need some outside perspective because i am feeling super conflicted and my family is making me feel like i am being unreasonable

for some background, i am 24f and my sister is 27f. she just got married this past weekend. i was genuinely excited for her. we have our ups and downs like any siblings but i love her and i wanted her wedding to be special. i helped her plan, went to the showers, picked out decorations, and tried to be as supportive as possible

about a year ago, i went through a really rough breakup. my ex, 25m, cheated on me in a really humiliating way. everyone else knew before i did and it crushed me. after a lot of crying and long nights with friends, they convinced me to go buy a ""revenge dress"" ‚Äî something that made me feel powerful again.  
i found this black silk dress that fit me perfectly. it was not expensive but it made me feel strong. i wore it to a few events where i needed confidence. it was a symbol of healing for me, not just a piece of clothing. i kept it in a garment bag in the back of my closet

fast forward to my sister‚Äôs wedding. she had a strict dress code and asked for no black dresses because she thought it was bad luck. fair enough, her day her rules. i wore a light blue dress that was not really my style but i wanted to be respectful

during the reception, my sister did an outfit change, which she had planned.  
when she walked out, i realized immediately she was wearing my black dress.  
not a copy. not something similar. my actual revenge dress

at first i thought maybe i was crazy but then i saw the little hand-stitched seam on the side. it was mine

i pulled her aside and quietly asked her about it. she laughed and said i was being dramatic and that i was not using it. i reminded her she had asked to borrow it months ago and i had politely said no. she said she thought i would get over it and needed a second dress

i felt completely blindsided. it was not about the dress. it was what it meant to me.  
i told her quietly that i felt hurt and she rolled her eyes and said i was making her wedding about myself

i did not want to cause a scene so i told my mom i was not feeling well and left quietly before the cake cutting

now my family is saying i ruined the wedding because my sister cried after i left and that i should have just smiled through it. they are calling me selfish and dramatic

i honestly feel awful. i did not want to hurt her or ruin anything. i did not yell, make a scene, or tell any guests. i just left because i could not sit there pretending i was okay

so AITAH for leaving instead of just pretending everything was fine?

thank you to anyone who reads this",Ok_Negotiation_3931,1189,0.9399999976158142,268,1745795785,2025-04-27 18:16:25,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k9hce1/aitah_for_leaving_my_sisters_wedding_early_after/,4,2025
