1eh4u8e,"CMV: The word ""weird"" is going to destroy Trump's campaign","For those who haven't been following the election and the memes, basically the Democrats, mainstream media, and social media are attacking Trump's campaign by calling Trump / Vance and their supporters ""weird."" It's a similar tactic that Trump has used (i.e. Low Energy Jeb, Lyin Ted, Crooked Hillary, etc.). While this might sound like silly playground tactics, we've seen how well this works if the label actually sticks.

Well in this case, ""weird"" has really struck a nerve with the right wing and it's really sticking. The right wing Trump supporters have been getting really mad and angry about being called weird, like it's very tangible that it gets under their skin. Even Trump himself is not handling it very well.

In my opinion, there's 2 reasons why the word ""weird"" is making them so mad

(1) Because, let's be honest, it's true. Trump and his supporters are weird. The whole world outside of the US thinks they are weird. People in the US who aren't part of the core MAGA fanbase thinks these people are weird. Trump himself is weird. 

(2) Conservatives hate the idea of not being normal. This label doesn't work against progressives, because progressives generally embrace people who don't fit into traditional social norms. Conservatives are all about following traditional social norms, so when people start to call out that Trump and the MAGA core are abnormal oddballs, it really hits their ego.

Ok so why is this attack going to destroy Trump's campaign? Because nobody wants to sit at the lunch table with the social outcasts. Obviously the die hard Trump voters are going to vote for Trump no matter what, but basically the election is now framed as Kamala being the option for normal people and Trump being the choice for weirdos. Obviously this is whole thing is very silly and you could argue it's just name calling, but if I'm being honest, it's about time the Democrats started getting mean with their election strategies. I also think Trump and his supporters have acted like bullies for the last 8 years, so it's pretty satisfying to give them a taste of their own medicine. Call it petty, but it's an effective strategy. I might be biassed, but I really think the Democrats have found a banger political strategy with this, all it took was using Trump's own tactics against him ",CanuckP,5144,0.7300000190734863,3017,1722477159,2024-07-31 20:52:39,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eh4u8e/cmv_the_word_weird_is_going_to_destroy_trumps/,8,2024
1f2pjou,CMV:  Democrats are getting overconfident about the possible debate between Kamala and Trump. ,"I wanted to make this post for quite a while but couldn’t find time to respond to people who will respond to my post.

Before the first debate, I read a lot of left-wing blogs which kept saying Biden would trounce Trump in the debate.  At that time itself, I felt that he should not debate Trump because there is no benefit for him and nothing that Trump says will hurt him with his base. In other words Biden has all to lose and Trump has nothing to lose.

The debate went magnitudes worse than I had ever feared and it culminated with Biden, eventually, dropping out. 

 I now see the same thing with people eager for a Kamala vs Trump debate. I stand by my position that Trump has nothing to lose in this and Kamala has everything to lose. Trump could get on stage, crap his pants, and sling his poo at the audience and he would still not lose a single supporter. Granted, he won’t gain any supporters from such behavior either . Kamala on the other hand could make a mistake like she did against Tulsi in 2020 and could destroy the campaign as it is. 

So there you have it. That’s my view. Change it.

Especially since a close election resulting in a win still may not be enough to actually win it.

1epa315,CMV: Most Muslims only care about Islamophobia when it’s done by “the West” or by “the Jews”,"Islam, despite the fact that the most populous Muslim nation on the planet is in Southeast Asia, is still haunted by a profound thread of arab chauvinism. It’s been this way since the beginning when you see conflicts in North Africa between the indigenous Amazigh and the invading Arabs that conquered the land. Arabs were given preferential treatment, their Islam was more pure, their language more civilized. 

The Amazigh were barbarians being rescued by the Arabs and the Prophet and raised to civilization. 

Today not much as changes. Arabic is still used in almost every mosque on the planet, regardless of the languages of the region, most imams are Arabic and the Muslim world is still generally oriented around Muslims. It’s why whenever there’s any news about injustice being done to Muslims in America or in Gaza you’ll see massive protests among Arab Muslims in those same western countries or even, despot the dangers, the repressive theocracies of the Middle East. 

Yet notice how they never make a peep over the blatantly anti-Muslim tactics of China or the Rohingya in Myanmar? That’s because they’re just some Asians to them that happen to be go to a mosque.

1evrkc0,CMV: I don't really understand why people care so much about Israel-Palestine ,"I want to begin by saying I am asking this in good faith - I like to think that I'm a fairly reasonable, well-informed person and I would genuinely like to understand why I seem to feel so different about this issue than almost all of my friends, as well as most people online who share an ideological framework to me.

I genuinely do not understand why people seem so emotionally invested in the outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian Crisis. I have given the topic a tremendous amount of thought and I haven't been able to come up with an answer.

Now, I don't want to sound callous - I wholeheartedly acknowledge that what is happening in Gaza is horrifying and a genocide. I condemn the actions of the IDF in devastating a civilian population - what has happened in Gaza amounts to a war crime, as defined by international law under the UN Charter and other treaties.

However - I can say that about a huge number of ongoing global conflicts. Hundreds of of thousands have died in Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Ethiopia, Myanmar and other conflicts in this year. Tens of thousands have died in Ukraine alone. I am sad about the civilian deaths in all these states, but to a degree I have had to acknowledge that this is simply what happens in the world. I am also sad and outraged by any number of global injustices. Millions of women and girls suffer from sex trafficking networks, an issue my country (Canada) is overtly complicit in failing to stop (Toronto being a major hub for trafficking). Children continued to be forced into labour under modern slavery conditions to make the products which prop up the Western world. Resource exploitation in Africa has poisoned local water supplies and resulted in the deaths of infants and pregnant women all so that Nestle and the Coca Cola Company can continue exporting sugary bullshit to Europe and North America.

All this to say, while the Israel-Palestinian Crisis is tragic, all these other issues are also tragic, and while I've occasionally donated to a cause or even raised money and organized fundraisers for certain issues like gender equality in Canada or whatnot, I have mostly had to simply get on with my life, and I think that's how most people deal with the doomscrolling that is consuming news media in this day and age.

Now, I know that for some people they feel they have a more personal stake in the Israel-Palestine Crisis because their country or institution plays an active role in supporting the aggressor. But even on that front, I struggle to see how this particular situation is different than others - the United States and by proxy the rest of the Western world has been a principal actor in destabilizing most of the current ongoing global crises for the purpose of geopolitical gain. If anyone has ever studied any history of the United States and its allies in the last hundred years, they should know that we're not usually on the side of the good guys, and frankly if anyone has ever studied international relations they should know that in most conflicts all combatants are essentially equally terrible to civilian populations. The active sale of weapons and military support to Israel is also not particularly unique - the United States and its allies fund war pretty much everywhere, either directly or through proxies. Also, in terms of active responsibility, purchasing any good in a Western country essentially actively contributes to most of the global inequality and exploitation in the world.

Now, to be clear, I am absolutely not saying ""everything sucks so we shouldn't try to fix anything."" Activism is enormously important and I have engaged in a lot of it in my life in various causes that I care about. It's just that for me, I focus on causes that are actively influenced by my country's public policy decisions like gender equality or labour rights or climate change - international conflicts are a matter of foreign policy, and aside from great powers like the United States, most state actors simply don't have that much sway. That's even more true when it comes to institutions like universities and whatnot.

In summary, I suppose by what I'm really asking is why people who seem so passionate in their support for Palestine or simply concern for the situation in Gaza don't seem as concerned about any of these other global crises? Like, I'm absolutely not saying ""just because you care about one global conflict means you need to care about all of them equally,"" but I'm curious why Israel-Palestine is the issue that made you say ""no more watching on the side lines, I'm going to march and protest.""

Like, I also choose to support certain causes more strongly than others, but I have reasons - gender equality fundamentally affects the entire population, labour rights affects every working person and by extension the sustainability and effective operation of society at large, and climate change will kill everyone if left unchecked. I think these problems are the most pressing and my activism makes the largest impact in these areas, and so I devote what little time I have for activism after work and life to them. **I'm just curious why others have chosen the Israel-Palestine Crisis as their hill to die on, when to me it seems 1. similar in scope and horrifyingness to any number of other terrible global crises and 2. not something my own government or institutions can really affect (particularly true of countries outside the United States).**

Please be civil in the comments, this is a genuine question. **I am not saying people shouldn't care about this issue or that it isn't important that people are dying** - I just want to understand and see what I'm missing about all this.",wellthatspeculiar,1500,0.6700000166893005,2278,1724036641,2024-08-18 22:04:01,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1evrkc0/cmv_i_dont_really_understand_why_people_care_so/,8,2024

1emk4vd,"CMV: Saying ""Tax the rich"" and then discussing income tax is a misinformative bait and switch.","As far as I know there is not a single person who became a billionaire primarily through income. Every billionaire became a billionaire by buying or inheriting some asset (property, land, stock, etc.) that increased in value to a billion+ dollars. 

I suspect this is also true for the majority of millionaires, saving up a million dollars through income is doable, but there are loads of people who just bought homes in CA or in big cities in the 70s and are now millionaires through housing inflation. 

Also this is tangential to my main view, but I think someone who made a million in income has 'earned' their wealth way more than someone who just got into an asset market at the right time or is snowballing generational family wealth. 

I understand that there are practical problems with taxing asset wealth

* Evaluating how much an asset is worth isn't easy. 
* Taxing someone based on their asset might force them to sell the asset, which might drive its value down and create a lot of other problems.
* People with a lot of asset wealth would probably just move somewhere else to avoid the taxes. 

(I also think [land value taxes](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-progress-and-poverty) solve a lot of these problems in an elegant way.) 

However instead of discussing any of this, what I see a lot of people in political discussions do instead is just fall back on income taxes as if they're a real way of combating wealth inequality. When I see politicians go ""We need to address wealth inequality, here's my proposal to increase income taxes on people making over <X> a year"" it just feels like a sleazy way to give the appearance of doing something to people who are angry about wealth inequality but don't know much about it. Maybe this is overly cynical but at best it seems like a way for old money to keep out new money. 

IMO any discussion about wealth inequality should focus on how to practically implement wealth taxes, or on ways to limit asset bubbles/speculation cycles that come about from QE / increasing money supply. Discussing income taxes seems like a total red herring.",aahdin,1319,0.8799999952316284,517,1723056979,2024-08-07 13:56:19,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1emk4vd/cmv_saying_tax_the_rich_and_then_discussing/,8,2024

You're now forcing other people to listen to whatever music you want. In my experience, it's too loud for me to enjoy what I'm listening to because it's competing with both you and the noise of traffic.

1enf4mh,CMV: Kamala's shutdown of hecklers at her Detroit rally can't reasonably be interpreted as a stance on Palestine,"The timeline as I understand it: 

* Kamala met with the protest group and talked to them prior to the speech.
* The protesters get rowdy and disruptive during the speech and Kamala reminds them that, while they have a voice, it's her time to speak.
* They persist and she shuts them down more harshly
* People who didn't think it through, didn't know the context, or just don't care make a big deal out of it and try to shame her and everyone else as being ""pro genocide"" as if those were related.

So basically, I want to know what possible perspective or information I missed that makes this wrong. There certainly seem to be a lot of people (bots?) who are just going nuts over this issue turning all their frustration and hostility about the middle east against Kamala and anyone who points out that this was about interruptions, not anything else.

What would change my view - information that changes the context of what happened, some other reasoning that what she said could reasonably be interpreted the way some people are taking it.

1ex7bwp,"CMV: There is no justification for the October 7th attack by Hamas, it was a terrorist attack, committed by a terrorist organisation and should be condemned ","I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not supporting what Israel and the IDF are doing and I condemn all the war crimes that they commit, however this seems to be causing people to overlook the other side of the conflict.

While I am sure that a lot of the pro Palestinian protestors don't support Hamas, or the 7th October attack and are just supporting the innocent civilians who are caught and killed in the crossfire of the Israel/Palestine war, however there seems to be a growing number that do, and it should be a security concern in all countries, that there is growing support for Hamas which is a recognised terrorist organisation.

From my view, the October 7th attack is one of the worst terrorist attacks in history, it was an attack on civilians, and if the population size between the US and Israel are scaled equally, it is many times worse than the 9/11 attacks (and not just in death toll).

A lot of pro Palestinian protestors seem to always fail to answer (yes/no) if they are asked if they condemn the October 7th attack or Hamas and usually do one of the following:

1.  Start talking about what Israel has done and the civilians they have killed to deflect the question 

As I mentioned at the start, I absolutely condemn and am against what Israel has done to civilians, however this should never justify any attack on civilians, when this argument is used this is often spun as an ""oppressed people fighting back"" narrative, and while I agree that the Palestinian people have definitely been oppressed, the October 7th attack is not how oppressed people fight back, oppressed people do not brutally attack civilians, victims of the Nazi's holocaust did not start brutally attacking German civilians, and I think most can agree that German civilians did not deserve to suffer after WW2 because of what the Nazi's did.

2. Outright denial the attack ever took place/claims no civilians were killed 

I don't really have anything to say that people who genuinely think the attack never happened other than that Hamas recorded themselves doing this attack for the world to see, has made their intentions clear that this attack is what they wanted, and that they will do it again. (Very few genuinely believe the attacks never happened, but there are some)

3. Israel knew about the attack / let it happen / didn't respond to it to use it as justification for the war

I am not certain about the truth of Israel's knowledge of the attack, and I don't think we could ever be certain of it and I don't deny that the above could be true. Regardless, this can't justify the killing of innocent civilians who certainly did not know they would be killed that day, this is like saying the Nazi's were justified in killing civilians in France and Poland when they invaded, because the French and Polish governments could've easily known that Hitler intended to invade and commit genocide many years before. 

Overall, I think Hamas must absolutely be eliminated and destroyed once and for all, and Israel has a right to defend itself from Hamas, but Israel and the IDF needs to also be held accountable for war crimes against civilians, and there needs to be a clear distinction between pro Palestine supporters who only want to support the innocent civilians vs the Hamas supporters who are supporting a terrorist organisation, otherwise we could reach a very scary point where extremism on all sides of all conflicts is already rising, where a large number on both sides will support/justify the killing of civilians.",Le_Corporal,1076,0.6499999761581421,2399,1724188682,2024-08-20 16:18:02,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ex7bwp/cmv_there_is_no_justification_for_the_october_7th/,8,2024

1ep65eu,"CMV: Pansexual is the same as bisexual, so the label is unnecessary and makes things more complicated.","I want to start off by saying that I'm bisexual myself, so I have personal experience with this. I will use the Wikipedia definitions of bisexual and pansexual.

> Pansexuality is sexual, romantic, or emotional attraction towards people of all genders, or regardless of their sex or gender identity.

""Bisexual"" is more simple and is the word that was always used.

I have heard people who identify as pansexual say things like, ""I care about what's in your heart, not what's in your pants"" and, ""Hearts, not parts.""

1exwwiv,CMV: gifted programs should not be removed from any STATE. ,"The Seattle school district and many other left-leaning states are planning to remove gifted programs for children due to a lack of racial representation in these programs. I believe this is unjustified and doesn’t make sense. It would be like making professional athletes go back to playing in an academy.

As someone who was part of a gifted program in high school, I found that regular schoolwork wasn’t challenging or engaging. It made me dread going to school, as it felt like placing an adult in a kindergarten class to learn 1+1 and expecting them to be excited about it for the next three years.

It’s also unfair to teachers and administrators, who are expected to adapt and create convoluted curricula for each individual when students are not separated by performance. They’re already underpaid and are being further burdened by the government to do extra work.

What happened to academic meritocracy? Why are we equating racial segregation with intellectual segregation?

Imagine if sports teams had similar policies, where instead of always picking the best players, they had to meet a racial quota.

Some might argue that gifted students have greater access to resources, which allows them to perform better in school, making it unfair for them to access better education and opportunities. But that same logic could be applied in reverse to any aspiring athlete: If someone had better access to equipment, nutrition, and trainers, should they also be excluded from gifted athlete programs?

There are several cases where pets outright killed people or other pets because the owner could not defeat them. Sometimes the owner themselves are killed by their own pets because they could not take them down. 

And such attacks come unexpectedly, maybe when you are strolling in a park with your dog unarmed or watching tv with giant snake on your lap where they suddenly attack you for whatever reason. You would not be prepared nor have a weapon, so you should be able to defeat them in unarmed combat to prevent your life from being taken by them or others peoples lives.

1f4aebw,CMV: The 'both sides are do nothing corporate stooges' attitude that many far leftists hold is wrong and dangerous,"I've seen a lot of people on the far left saying that Democrats and Republicans are very similar and both doing the bidding of their corporate masters. 

As a Democrat, I vehemently disagree. I do acknowledge that large corporations contribute a significant amount to Democrat campaigns, but Democrats have also passed-and tried to pass- policies that limit corporate power. 

For example, reducing the cost of insulin. Big pharma doesn't want those limits.

Democrats attempted to pass build back better but a now independent and another now independent allowed it to fail. That was major legislation that would have helped a lot of people and Democrats fought tooth and nail to pass it. 

Democrats have also implemented additional regulations around things like food safety. This does not help big corporations in the slightest. 

That's why I think the attitude is wrong. I think it's dangerous because of two far more critical differences. 

First one side is trying to undermine Democracy while the other is trying to protect it. And the idea that at the end of the day both parties are do nothing corporate stooges completely misses the very real threat of somebody who will not concede even when it appears they know they've lost. 

Second, one side is going to great lengths to fight a major existential threat-climate change- and the other seems to still be dragging their feet. And while I think Democrats need to do way more to fight climate change, at least they have passed policies to help with that. 

To be clear, my view isn't that the far left thinks the two parties are identical. My concern is that they're being grouped and this makes it seem like what's happening right now is normal politics. The GOP is its own nightmarish thing right now, something highly unprecedented and dangerous. If dangerous individuals are seen as just more corrupt candidates in a two party system, then that makes it seem like they're a reasonable but not great choice. Not an aspiring dictator.

1ehn4hl,cmv: Calling adults pedophiles for dating other adults have always been crazy to me.,"I just witnessed this man get called a pedophile because he’s 27 years old dating and 21 year old. I also witnessed another man get called a pedophile for dating a 26 year old at the age of 35.

Pedophiles are a group of individuals who are adults or older adolescent that experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children.

This misapplication not only misrepresents the nature of these relationships but also dilutes the gravity of actual pedophilia, potentially undermining efforts to protect children from sexual abuse.

The age gap police need to calm down. It's understandable to want to protect younger partners from being taken advantage of, but labeling someone a predator just because their relationship doesn't fit your narrow view of what an age gap should be is unreasonable. This kind of reaction is excessive and unfair.

Two people of the same age can be at different stages of life due to various factors such as career paths, educational pursuits, personal choices, and life experiences. For instance, one 25-year-old might be advancing in a corporate career and contemplating home ownership, while another might still be in school, exploring different job opportunities, or traveling the world. 

Conversely, two individuals aged 21 and 29 can be in the same stage of life if their circumstances and life choices align. Both might be recent graduates starting their first full-time jobs, exploring new cities, or beginning to establish their independence and build their careers.

1f0aj6r,"CMV: In the ""would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck"" question, picking one horse-sized duck is a strikingly stupid choice","I know I'm like 8 years late on this meme, but I feel like it faded away without reaching much of a consensus and it made me feel like an insane person because the answer seemed so incredibly obvious. So here I am dredging it up again, like an insane person. First, some priors about the hypothetical I'm addressing: 

* Let's discount the oft-cited cube square law which posits that a horse-sized duck would immediately collapse under its own weight. In the spirit of the hypothetical, let's assume physically viable animals whose strength and bone strength etc. has scaled linearly with their mass to allow for normal function. 
* Let's assume we have no weapons, or at least no sophisticated, pre-made weapons. I'm working from an assumption that we're totally unarmed, but if you want to argue a situation where we could pick up a stick or a rock or something I'm happy to engage with that as well. 
* You are allowed to wear normal clothing, e.g. let's say you are given 10 minutes in a normal department store to pick out an outfit. I'd be okay entertaining a scenario where you're naked, too. My main point is that you don't have access to armor or anything (though i think having armor would make the answer even more obvious.) 
* The animals in question fully understand that they are in a fight to the death against you. 
* The question is very specifically about who you think you are most likely to defeat; any questions about gaining glory or other social consequences are outside the scope of this argument. 

Okay so on to my position: 

**Picking a horse-sized duck is not only obviously wrong, it's downright foolish.** 

Let's start by focusing on the horse-sized duck and (an incomplete list of) the opportunities it has to kill us vs. how we could kill it:

* The duck would be *much* stronger than you - strong enough to break your bones with a peck or claw attack. Strong enough to kill you outright with a properly-landed blow. 
* The duck's beak is huge, rigid, and would be capable of devastating bludgeoning damage. 
* The duck's beak would be plenty big enough to grab you by the head, a limb, even your torso. 
* The duck's beak would likewise be able to bite you with great force, possibly enough to break your bones. 
* The duck has claws on its feet that it could use to rip you open. 
* The duck can *fucking fly*. And even if we agree for some reason that it can't, it's still a massive animal that can kill you in a single blow. 
* You have basically no method to kill the duck unarmed. Maaaybe you could get lucky and break one of its legs, but you're still left with an extremely large, angry animal that can easily break your bones by just flailing around. The duck's neck is too large and strong to be choked out. Possibly you could stuff yourself or objects down its throat until it chokes? But even then, you are attempting a precise maneuver against a massive animal that is also trying to kill you. 

Now to contrast let's examine the duck-sized horses:

* The horses would be *much* weaker than you - any individual horse would be unable to do much more than lightly push you a bit. 
* The horses' mouths, while formidable in a horse-sized animal, would be too small to even gain purchase on most of your body. When naked, you'd run the risk of maybe getting the tip of a toe or finger bit off, or maybe a light pinch on your shinbone or something. If you were could dress yourself, wearing basically any clothes at all would render you nigh-invulnerable to this attack. 
* That leaves their kicks, which would be an annoyance but unlikely to do any real harm besides light scratches and bruises. Their hooves are not particularly sharp and are certainly not designed to puncture or rip skin. The blunt-force damage that makes a normal horse so dangerous would be rendered basically moot by their relatively small size and lack of strength. 
* Horses are not particularly intelligent animals and are not capable of any kind of meaningful tactical collaboration. This massively mitigates the potential problem posed by the large number of horses. 
* Similarly, horses cannot climb or grapple you, so your exposure would be limited to a few horses at any given time. This fact, combined with the previous point, means that there is very little threat of being overwhelmed and dragged down. At least until you have already worn yourself out to the point of exhaustion. 
* Horse legs are notoriously spindly and fragile. While scaling them down would reduce the risk of broken legs, it would still be pretty easy to break their limbs and incapacitate them. 
* You could kill or at least incapacitate the horses with normal kicks and stomps. You could easily pick up a horse and snap its neck, especially given the extra leverage offered by their long heads. A hundred is a pretty big number, but every individual horse would be trivially easy to defeat. The main challenge here is cardio, not fighting skill. 

Please note: I am NOT saying that I, or anyone, would obviously defeat 100 duck-sized horses every time. I am very specifically talking about the choice between 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck: on this question, I think the average human has about a 99% better chance of defeating the horses than they do the duck and I seriously question the judgment of anyone who picks the alternative.",tsaihi,630,0.8799999952316284,433,1724520014,2024-08-24 12:20:14,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1f0aj6r/cmv_in_the_would_you_rather_fight_100_ducksized/,8,2024
1ew7ow3,"CMV: If You Vape Indoors in Public, You're a Dick","I feel like this should be common sense, but I still see a lot of people doing this and I want to hear the other side of the argument: why do you think it's okay to vape indoors in a public place?

I've seen this a number of times near me: a patron at a bar or restaurant sneaks a puff from their vape as soon as the bartender or server turns their back. It's easier to do, since it's quicker than lighting a cigarette and the vape pen can dispense just one puff unlike a cigarette. Clearly they know it's not allowed, or they wouldn't take measures to hide it too. 

The only argument I've heard is that ""it's just water vapor"", but that's just not true. The vape smoke has nicotine in it (that's sort of the point), as well as other chemicals to give it it's flavor/scent.

It may not be common knowledge, but the chemicals themselves have harmful effects on the lungs. If the smoker isn't aware of that, that might be (comparatively) understandable. However, they should be well-aware of the second-hand nicotine smoke they're blowing at people. Ignoring this seems selfish, and therefore dickish.

1f2jm73,CMV: Overfeeding your child is a form of abuse,"I don't know if this comes from a place of bias or personal experience, but I feel like there is a huge issue with young kids being way too fat. I'm not talking about a little baby fat that leans out later on in life, I mean morbidly obese children with heart conditions at the ripe young age of ten.

When I was a child my parents never cared to learn about healthy eating. They both have been obese for the entirety of my life. All I ate as a kid was McDonald's, meatloaf and boiled vegetables (un-seasoned). We always had ice cream in the fridge and loads of sugary things throughout the house. I drank so much coke that I had withdrawal symptoms so sever I was bedridden for days. I had body image issues, problems with my stomach and effectively had to educate myself on what being ""healthy"" means. Now, I myself wasn't obese (even though I was definitely fat) and I don't think my parents hit that threshold of food abuse that I've laid out in the title, but I definitely believe that if I was indulged more as a kid I could have easily hit that point. I also recently have found out that I have an auto immune disease that was exasperated due to my poor diet as a child. 

I've read so many stories of kids who have gone past that point. There was one where they're height was stunted due to the excessive body weight putting pressure on their thyroid and heart. I read another where a child was given candies by every member in her family due to their cultural views on how giving food is the equivalence of love.

It can physically harm the kids (like it has me), or it can cause mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and body dysmorphia. 

Maybe I'm being too harsh on parents who they themselves don't know any better, but I just feel like negligence isn't an acceptable excuse for putting your kid's health at risk. Am I being too harsh?

1eugkeu,"CMV: ""States' Rights"" has never been an argument for freedom; instead, it has been used to oppress people.","##The Founding.  


In the US, the phrase ""states' rights"" has been used at times to call for a limitation on the power of the federal government. For those outside the US, our government is comprised of ""states"" which are supposed to be sovereign entities united under a ""federal"" government.  

In theory, this distinction was supposed to ensure that each U.S. state could operate as its own territory with its own government. The ""federal"" government was envisioned as some kind of entity which could both serve to unite the states and protect them on a more continental or global scale, and to bind them together locally so that each US state could consider its neighbors as allies and fellow citizens of some kind. 

This has, of course, *always* been a messy, imprecise concept. From the very beginning, the framers and anyone knowledgeable about governments disagreed on what the roles of these entities was supposed to be. We started, of course, with a failed concept known as ""The Articles of Confederation"" which was supposed to serve the same role as above but was entirely too weak to accomplish anything at all. The framers of the US constitution, it turned out, realized that any government entity **needed** to have enough power to actually assert its will over the people and territories, otherwise it simply couldn't. 

So the Articles of Confederation were a failure. It was an attempt to ensure the sovereignty of the states by limiting the power of a federal government, but that limitation proved to be its demise as absolutely nothing of meaning could be accomplished, rendering the system pointless.

##States' Rights and Slavery.  


So the state delegates got together to change them, but instead scrapped them entirely and wrote the US Constituion. This established the current United States of America. Among the debates and disagreements at that time was the issue of slavery. And what did they do? They ""compromised"" in the spirit of ""states' rights."" 

It was argued that the southern states had ""a right"" to practice slavery if those in control of those state governments wanted to do so. And those in charge of those state govenments were white slaveowning men. So of course, *they* decided what their ""states' rights"" were to be. 

#The concept of ""States' Rights"" has never been used - nor has it ever been needed - to expand human rights; instead, it has been used primarily to divide humanity and oppress marginalized groups.  

##States' Rights and Abortion.  


The phrase has been used in countless political debates, but few as conspicuously as the question of slavery. Most recently, it has been used on the question of abortions. 

 *Roe v Wade* was a Supreme Court case decided in 1973 which established that a person has an inherent right to privacy in their medical treatment to Due Process under the 14th Amendment. In general, this is the case which prevented US states from passing laws that restricted abortion. 

Come to *Dobbs v Women's Health*, the 2022 Supreme Court decision, and *Roe* is completely overturned. And on what basis? In large part, that the question of abortion *should be decided by the states.* This notion of ""states' rights"" was in the majority opinion, it was in the oral arguments, and it was flung around by media pundits and repeated by the casual conservatives celebrating the decision. 

***""States' Rights.""***

But what interest does ""a state"" have to ""rights?"" A state is nothing more than an abstract entity comprised of people making decisions ""as a state."" Why should ""a state"" have more authority to make decisions than a ""federal government?"" Why is that intrinsically more just than either a federal government or an individual? 

In short, it isn't. Pushing abortion to the states means pushing abortion to many legislatures that are interested in oppressing women, just as pushing ""slavery"" to the states was nothing more than pushing slavery to legislatures interested in oppressing people with African ancestry. It's a cushion; a dodge; an abdication of responsibility for deciding what is just in this country. 

If the federal government is infringing on ""states' rights"" by restricting abortions, how in the ever-loving ***fuck*** is a state not infringing on women's rights by restricting abortions? 

##States' Rights and the Electoral College.  

The Electoral College (EC) is another example of asserting that ""states"" should.have power, but not individuals. It was established in the US constitution in conjunction with the 3/5 compromise, which determined that enslaved people would count ""as 3/5 of a person"" in the state for the purposes of population count, representation in Congress, and therefore, in the Electoral College for presidential elections.  

Modern arguments in favor of the EC often say that the states with smaller populations would be forgotten and their interests ignored if it were abolished. This ensures ""the states"" all have their interests heard. But that is what *Congress* is for. The states with smaller populations *already have* representation in both the House of Representatives *and* the Senate. Both of which give greater weight to less densely populated (and, coincidentally, conservative) areas.  

Why should ""the states"" have more interest in the vote for president than *the people?* 

Why should ""the states"" have more interest in governing abortion than the people who can get pregnant?  

Why should ""the states"" have more interest in protecting slavery than the people who are being enslaved?

The answer is that the logic is unsound, because the question of ""states' rights"" has always been a messy and logically inconsistent affair. 

If you want to make a case for limiting government, do so without permitting lower-level governments to oppress people.

1erlpti,"CMV: A lot of incels have standards for a partner that are not in-line with their own value. They could date people, they just don't want to date the people that they could reasonably attract. ","My post is going to focus specifically on male incels FYI. 

So if there's a man out there that in general women would perceive as low value on the dating market, I do believe that they're generally not going to be able to attract a partner that is higher value than them. 

However, there are also women that are perceived as low value by men and many of these women would like to have a long-term partner, potentially get married, have kids, etc. 

Who do incels think these women are marrying if not men that are equally perceived as low value on the dating market? 

I think a common thought amongst incels is that these low value women are able to date ""out of their league"" because higher value men are most willing to do that. I think that's probably true but I think that most of the time those relationships are short-term in nature which leads me back to my original question, who are these women marrying? They're marrying other people that are of a similar value or slightly higher as them.

What is preventing incels from just lowering their standards? Lower them, give it a try, if you don't have any success then guess what your standards are probably still too high. 

If I have a car that I want to sell for $X amount and I attract no potential buyers then I'm not involuntary unable to sell my car, my expectations are just not in-line with the reality of the market. 

I think it's pretty certain that a lot of incels would have to lower their standards to such a point where they would no longer be interested in dating the people they could reasonably attract. However, does that make you involuntary celibate? That sounds voluntary to me because you would be making the choice that you are not interested in dating the people that it's possible for you to date. 

TLDR: Incels need to lower their standards. There are plenty of women out there that are also perceived as low value out there that are looking for long-term relationships and they generally will end up with a partner of a similar value to many incels.

1ej4fvu,CMV: China peaked in 2019 and it is all downhill from here.,"There are so many crash circles happening in China. One really important thing to remember is that in 1990, almost 95% of the land in China was owned by the provinces. For 35 years now, the provinces have provided almost all social services and infrastructure projects by selling off land to developers. Now that developers are bankrupt and not buying land anymore, the provinces have no real income. They have no system set up to bring in taxes like a normal regional or state gov't can do... and as they do find ways to tax residents directly, that is putting pressure on consumer spending.

The other real death cycle is the number of middle class people who are paying a mortgage for a home that was never finished. You have a huge amount of people being forced to pay a mortgage and rent at the same time. In some cases it is even worse because the people got multiple mortgages thinking they could rent out their other homes. Having to pay double housing costs means people have far less money to spend in the economy on other things. Which leads to deflation.

Deflation is bad, even inflation under 2% is bad, because it means if you are a consumer, there is no reason for you to buy items today, because you know that in a month the item will be the same price or cheaper. This is why the USA and most EU countries have an inflation goal of 2%. It is low enough that it doesn't really hurt anyone, but it is high enough that it encourages consumer purchases. This keeps the economy churning. Deflation is also terrible for businesses, especially retail items like food, because if you buy an item for your store today, it might sit in your store for a month and have a lower price when you can actually sell it. This is crushing for low-margin businesses like supermarkets and retail stores.

This is all terrible, but equally bad is the covert ' decoupling ' by western companies, which have similar effects on the economy, and the current President Xi Jinping is doing all the wrong moves to save the economy. It's now even more censorsious, and even more authoritarian. 

Youth unemployment is nearly 40 percent, and number of desperate homeless people litter in every street. China's economic miracle is over and it'd be lucky if it can even be in Japan's lost decades, because at the rate things are going, it's going to turn into North Korea's lost decade.

You only care about large issues because you know that you have, and will always have, exactly zero impact on the outcome. As long as that’s true, you can skirt any sense of responsibility when it comes to making a difference. You get to have all the emotional feel-goods of being part of a cause, without ever having to contribute any effort. You avoid smaller-scale issues because you could actually do something about them. This would create a sense of responsibility that spoils any and all appeal. Since you have no ability to impact the outcome of far-reaching policies, your opinions and ideas have no need to be based in reality either, since they’ll never be tried. Your ideas don’t have to actually make any sense or have any chance in hell or working. All they have to do is come with some sort of virtuous vibe to get you the sense of moral superiority you crave.

For the vast majority of people (99.999%) your ideas are not novel. In fact, someone more powerful than you probably told you what to think, so you’re not a free-thinking genius either just because you hold some radical, contrarian opinion.

This is not to say that you are not allowed to have opinions on national / global issues. You absolutely can. What you cannot do though, is paint yourself as this bastion of human decency, focusing only on abstract bullshit you have no control over, all the while ignoring the parts of our flawed society that you can influence.

At the end of the day, it does not matter one fucking bit to the average person who is president. Your personal life will be impacted much more directly by the mayor of your town, your county’s board members, and the president of your local school board.

Until you’ve done your part to make a deference in those areas, shut the FUCK up about Ukraine, Israel, China, the military-industrial complex, Wall Street, gas prices, inflation, “capitalism,” “communism,” “socialism,” and UBI.",statisticalmean,499,0.6700000166893005,485,1722523157,2024-08-01 09:39:17,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ehibx3/cmv_if_you_dont_even_vote_in_your_local_elections/,8,2024
1exoky4,CMV: Pansexuality is the same as bisexuality ,"Admittedly I'm biased because I'm a bisexual, and have been out and proud for 16ish years, but there is literally no real distinction between the two as used today. I fully accept the original description of pansexuality was someone who was interested in literally everything (not just multiple genders but also all fetishes and kinks), but it is used today to mean someone who is attracted to all genders. Imo this is kinda biphobic, bc as far back as the 90s bisexual organisations have been very clear that many bisexuals are attracted to people outside the gender binary, I myself have always been attracted to all genders. I have once seen the distinction explained as pan people are attracted to trans people, and bi people aren't, but not only is that hideously transphobic, but also patently untrue. I have no issue with people calling themselves pan, omnisexual, or whatever, but afaic all these sexualities are literally just bisexuality with a different name. I will concede that in settings with aliens pansexuality does make sense, I think describing Jack harkness from torchwood as pan is fair (same for iron bull in dragon age), and if someone in real life actually does fit the original Freudian definition, that's fair too, but the vast majority of modern irl pan people could reasonably be described as bi.",69Whomst,494,0.6800000071525574,748,1724244012,2024-08-21 07:40:12,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1exoky4/cmv_pansexuality_is_the_same_as_bisexuality/,8,2024
1em1vh4,CMV: There is no good solution to the birth rate problem,"Every single nation that reaches a certain standard of living experiences a drop in fertility rate below the replacement rate (2.1 children per woman). This is a good thing because it stems from increased education, healthcare, and access to contraceptives for women. Most rich countries have been maintained population stability/growth through immigration, but countries like Japan and South are unfortunately headed for a slow decline and demise. Immigration isn’t a long term solution to this problem though, since the entire world’s fertility rate is projected to drop below 2.1 by the end of the century, and there will be very few countries left with fertility rates above 2.1. 

Eventually the world economy will go the way of Japan and South Korea, and there’s really no good solution that can prevent this. People simply don’t want to have more than 2 kids once they are rich enough to decide that for themselves, no kinds of monetary incentives or generous parental leave policies have succeeded at reviving fertility rates to replacement level.

1ehpzqp,CMV: The way some popular Anime/Manga sexualize women and children is wrong,"Let me be preface this by saying, I love anime. I'm a big proponent of manga and I have read hundreds of completed works. I love the grittiness and emotional complexity that these works can express. Some mangaka are so incredibly talented that every panel they produce is a masterpiece. I don't want anyone to think that I'm coming from a place of ""anti-anime"" because that is not true. I'm making an observation and want an outsider's perspective.

Now that I've made that clear, the crux of today's cmv, sex. For as long as I can remember, sexually explicit material has been synonymous with anime. Big Booba and pornographic material is so prevalent in Japan that many famous mangaka have at one point previously worked as Hentai artists. It seems almost like a right of passage for artists to draw explicit stuff. Anime like, ""Rent a Girlfriend"" or ""My First Girlfriend is a Gal"" are literally just Hentai plots without the sex. Now, that wouldn't inherently be an issue as I am a proponent for sex positivity and sexually explicit material... BUT... the sheer amount of large breasted sexualized women and middle/high school girls is questionable at worst, and abhorrent at best. 

Let's break this down into a couple of digestible points to help make my argument clear.

* Sexualizing Minors is Wrong

As mentioned above, the act of making middle/highschool kids sexually appealing by altering their appearance through large breasts, school uniforms, swimsuits or the like, is just pedophilic. There are plenty of average looking kids in anime that aren't overtly sexualized, but when you see it, you know it. It's not even uncommon to allow these types of physical ""youthful"" appearances to transcend into fantasy canon. ""It's ok for her to be a loli because she's 700 years old."" or ""she isn't actually young, she just LOOKS young"" are common arguments to defend the act of sexualizing characters with the physical appearance of a minor. If you've been on TikTok you might have seen the popular title, ""If my Wife becomes an Elementary School Student"".... this is just a story device to allow the main character to form an intimate connection with a child. Inversely some characters have the body of an adult, but the mental capacity of a child. Llulu and Kanna from ""Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid"" are both excellent examples of almost ALL of these super problematic tropes. Llulu with her loli body, giant breasts, and childlike brain and Kanna with her physical appearance allowing an overtly inappropriate relationship with Riko (who is a child). Let's not forget the fact that Lucoa is canonically a PREDATOR, who is taking care of a child called Shouta... need I say more? It's almost like the show want's you to support groomers. All of these tropes are common place and popular in the current anime landscape.

* Women are inaccurately portrayed

The amount of large breasted ""skinny thicc"" women in anime is staggering. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that we should be leaning heavily in the opposite direction either. I see alot of left leaning people who like to ""fix"" art by adding weight or fixing proportions, and I don't think this is necessarily the correct approach to these issues. Obviously in an Anime setting where everyone works for a secret government organization and have super soldier serum running through their veins, then yeah, they're gonna be ripped. But why does every single person have the exact same body type? Look at Fairy Tail for example, every single main female protagonist is a skinny thicc, massive booba, revealing bikini type character. It's completely fine to have sexual material in moderation, but to have every single female character be subjected to the ""my eyes are up here"" treatment makes them feel cheap and not well written. Not only that, but the characters (lets use One Piece as an example) usually lean towards the male gaze. The main male protagonists (that aren't obviously weird AF) all have rippling muscles and powerful tools to engage with the enemies, even Usopp post time skip is shredded! But the main female characters like Nami are just skinny, big booba, low impact side characters who don't have their time in the spotlight outside of being saved by Luffy. 

There are so many posts in r/badwomensanatomy with anime girls as the subject you'd think they should rebrand it to r/dorealwomenliveinJapan?

* Saturation and Media

Let's be real here for a second. Most of the women in ""Fairy Tail"" and ""One Piece"" (to name a few) have a pornstar body. There's plenty of anime that I start watching where I feel strongly that there won't be any major sex appeal, and then two seconds later we get hit with an unnecessary amount of cleavage. Demon Slayer, one of my favorite animes in recent years, gave Nezuko (14 yrs old) massive tits, as well as Mitsuri and Daki (Daki makes more sense because shes a prostitute but honestly, her outfit was 100% just for sex appeal not historical accuracy to what prostitutes wore during that era). Fire Force had senseless amounts of fan service to the point where they wrote it into the plot as a character flaw so that they could do it more often.

It's not the fact that these character archetypes exist, but that they find their way into EVERY anime. Why does every popular anime in recent years require women to have pornstar bodies? Anime isn't just some small thing in Japan, it's everywhere over there. It's a cultural staple to watch and digest anime. How do you think young girls/women feel about their own bodies when every female character looks like a pornstar? It's no wonder that the rate of plastic surgery in Japan has skyrocketed in recent years. Japan has the 3rd most plastic surgeries in the world while less than half the population of the U.S. The same thing can be seen in Korea due to influences such as Manwha and K-Pop stars. There's obviously a market for it, but that doesn't mean it's right.

There's so much toxicity in anime because it degrades women/children into sexual objects.

1ej4z31,CMV: Men and women can have friendships that are purely platonic.,"(I'm not sure if NSFW is really needed here, but I do think this is sort of an adult issue).

Ok, this debate has been had online over and over, and I just saw another instance of it today. It blows my mind that people seem to think men and women cannot have platonic relationships. I personally am friends with multiple women in a purely platonic way. Several of them have gotten married in the last few years, and I've attended at least three of their weddings on my own, and a couple more with my wife. My wife did not know any of these women before dating me, and she has expressed zero concern over me maintaining these friendships. 

I'm not a kid - I understand that men and women usually aren't close enough to be called ""friends"" unless there's some level of attraction going on, and it can be anxiety-inducing for women especially, if their man hangs out one on one with other women. I'll say this to clarify: I avoid putting myself in situations where I'm by myself with another woman other than my wife, as I think there's something to be said about being respectful, both of my wife and of other women. I wouldn't want to put someone in a situation where there's an implicit suggestiveness, even if I know I would never act on anything.

So basically what I'm saying is: I think platonic relationships are good and healthy, but those platonic relationships should come with boundaries. One of those boundaries is a self-imposed rule to not hangout with a woman one on one in an environment that isn't public. I'm fine with the idea of grabbing breakfast with a woman other than my wife, as long as my wife is fine with it. Any hint of not being fine with that, even if not stated explicitly, and I absolutely would respect that. I think there's stricter rules you can impose when your wife is pregnant or was just recently pregnant, as that's obviously a vulnerable period of time when we know that men sometimes cheat.

The other aspect that I'll mention about this topic is that I believe it doesn't matter whether you're a man or a woman - most people choose all of their friends, regardless of sex, based on some level of admiration. So when people say men can't have platonic friendships with women, I think what they really mean is that there isn't zero attraction involved. And I think that's probably true if you think deeply about peoples' feelings. But I also think that's not really any different than how I choose my guy friends. I like hanging out with dudes who are talented, skilled, smart, kind, have clout, etc. I don't like being friends with guys who aren't bringing something to the table. But I'm as straight as can be and never had any sexual interest with my guy friends. For my women friends, the traits that lead to platonic friendship definitely overlap the traits that I see in my wife, but that doesn't mean my wife is replaceable by platonic friends. That's a totally different thing.

I wouldn't have married my wife if that weren't the case. Replacing your wife by another woman only makes sense if you see women as physical objects rather than as people, which is terrible in and of itself. I don't view my wife that way.

Also, I will say that I think it's good that if people think men can't have platonic friendships with women, they aren't friends with women. Different people have different boundaries and levels of self control. Some people are by nature very sexual, and it might be harder to control themselves in the presence of attractive women who aren't their SO. So anyone who recognizes that in themselves, great. I just think it definitely IS possible to have platonic relationships with the opposite sex (if you're straight), and I have a lot of evidence in my life proving that.",GenerativeAdversary,428,0.7799999713897705,263,1722696188,2024-08-03 09:43:08,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ej4z31/cmv_men_and_women_can_have_friendships_that_are/,8,2024

I'm a gay guy in my 20s and consider myself open minded and left-leaning. I believe that we all should be treated with respect and dignity. There is an internal conflict in me. I see many progressive people complaining about islamophobia and I just find it contradictory and hypocritical. Most Muslims interpret Islam in a very traditional way, it seems more strict to me than most Christians (I am also against other religions that suppress human rights and freedoms). But for some reason many people think that it's cool to defend Islam. Almost all Muslims discussing i have seen on the internet and in real time say that homosexuality is a sin and are very intolerant of it.

1et5esf,"CMV: The concept of ""You don't owe anyone an explanation"" is stupid. ","I've been increasingly hearing this over and over for the past few years from people who are overly entitled and sensitive, and it's really getting on my nerves.

Yes, if you leave your partner of 5 years, you owe them an explanation. You just took 5 years of their life, you don't just get to ghost after all that time.

Yes, if you've been friends with someone and you want to stop being friends over life/philosophical/political differences, you DO owe them an explanation and a chance to talk it through.

Yes, if you're quitting your job with no notice and no consideration for your coworkers, you owe them an explanation.

The exception is obviously abuse, if they're mistreating you, you should leave - although the definition of abuse has been so diluted it no longer holds much meaning.

1epkubq,CMV: Dance and performative events like 'Breaking' shouldn't be in the Olympics,"With all the Raygun crap and discussion around Breaking in the Olympics, I don't understand how creative/subjective performative events like Dance and Dressage are part of the Olympics. They don't seem like sports. 

I heard that Ballroom dance has been petitioning for a long time to be considered an Olympic 'sport' but not been successful and then pivoted to champion Breaking but that competition seemed vague and out of place. Even the staging seemed odd and out of place with MC's trying to hype an Olympic crowd. 

I don't get these 'sports' as sports - they are dancing with atheletic elements. I would argue Dressage, Synchronised swimming shouldn't be part of the Olympics either. I'd rather see Darts or Shuffleboard!  

Now the obvious counterpoint is Gymnastics as there is some performative element but the presentation of these events highlights difficult moves and then grades them against execution. It is presented with judges and there seems to be a process for quantifying clear cut winners and losers and has mutliple judges to iron out subjectivity. The same could be said of diving.

1excrxx,CMV: The semaglutide craze is going to evetually lead to an opioid-like health crisis,"This has been bothering me for a while and I want to know if I'm missing something here.  Right now though, no matter how I look at I'm convinced that the push of Ozempic/Wegovy and similar GLP1 drugs is going to end in a public health crisis in the vein of opioid.

Everything I see about these drugs is overwhelmingly positive to the point of feeling delusional.  The claimed benefits not only include weight loss, but apparently decreasing cardiovascular risk, treating addiction, reducing arthritis, cutting diabetes risk, etc.  It reads like an advertisement for scam supplement at times, as it can apparently cure everything.  I don't think I've ever seen anything regarding potential long term risks, or the consequences of suddenly ceasing use of it.  This is a drug that works on a core metabolic process and the body really likes to try and maintaining homeostasis by up- and down-regulating things.  As these drugs stimulate the release of insulin and suppress glucagon by imitating the GLP1 peptide, it seems logical to think the body might reduce it's response to this compound over time to maintain it's idea of homeostasis.  So if someone were to suddenly lose access to it?  It seems reasonable to think this would lead to a lack of insulin and overproduction of glucagon - a diabetes-like metabolic problem.

Also disturbing to me is the way the drug is being marketed as an option for everyone and being offered outside of doctor's offices.  This is an expensive monthly injection that's meant to be taken for life, yet it's being advertised for weight loss of around 30 lbs (by the pharma company itself no less) and is being made available to people through places like Weight Watchers.  What are people supposed to do once they reach their target weight?  Studies show that many people regain the lost weight after stopping, so what's next once the target is hit?  And I don't believe places like WW really care about using ""lifestyle changes"" with it, otherwise they wouldn't be offering it as a primary option vs other methods failing first.

At the root of all my concern is the absolutely insane financial incentive that pharma companies have to get as many people on the medication as quickly as possible, regardless of consequences.  At $3000 a month and intended to be permanent, every new patient represents tens or possible hundreds of thousands of future revenue.  Multiply that by tens of thousands of patients, and it's enough money to make Bezos jealous.  And with how we saw Purdue get off scot free from the opioid crisis, what incentive is there for these companies to care about the consequences?  It's free money and at worst they'll pay a fine that dwarves the profit these drugs are making them.  Instead, they have every incentive to hide any negative outcomes related to these drugs and push positive narratives at every turn.

Every one of these details leads me to believe this semeglutide craze will lead to a massive public health crisis on the level of opioid.   The hallmarks are all there:  a supposed miracle drug that makes huge profit for their manufacturers with no risk for consequences, being pushed on as many people as possible regardless of their needs, and potentially disastrous consequence if the medication is stopped which is a huge risk due to it's price and the lack of coverage by many insurance plan.  If this medication were to suddenly become unavailable to many people for whatever reason, there could be massive public health consequences that, per usual, the common citizen would bear the brunt of through suffering for those who are affected, and high costs for those who are not.

I'm more than open to hearing different perspectives, as I'm sure I might be missing something here.",shiningdialga13,398,0.7799999713897705,277,1724203043,2024-08-20 20:17:23,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1excrxx/cmv_the_semaglutide_craze_is_going_to_evetually/,8,2024
1er6clk,CMV: The USA are a Plutocracy (a form of Oligarchy),"To demonstrate my point, I will start first by underlining the undemocratic nature of the US. 

First of all, in any democracy as it is defined each person’s vote must be equal to any other.
This is false for the US for several reasons:

## a) The electoral college system: 

39.5 million Californians translate to 55 electoral votes, while a combined total of 20 other states with the same population translate to 102 electoral votes. 

As it is clear, the vote of a Californian person has less intrinsic value than that of any other state in those 20. 

Furthermore, if say Republicans win in a certain state even by just 51%, they get ALL the electoral votes, meaning the other 49% amounts to a grand total of 0 political power. This is entirely and irrefutably undemocratic.

## b) The two party system:

This system, by itself, is undemocratic.

In an ideal democracy, all citizen with democratic beliefs should be represented. 

While this tends to be false even for multi-party systems, in those systems the large majority of people is represented in their ideas by a combination of parties: someone who is conservative in terms of immigration but progressive in terms of climate change might not be represented entirely by a single party but their beliefs are in fact represented. 

This of course doesn’t happen in the US. 

There’s no representation for socialized healthcare.

No representation for a ban on weapon carrying with. 

No representation for an electoral system change or for a constitutional revision.

And I could go on.

## c) The nationalistic zeal: 

USA are nationalistic. I think we can all agree with that. What that translates to, is a significant trend of passing the blame to outside forces, alongside the rivaling party. This is particularly in the case Donald Trump’s way of politics.

“The economy isn’t working? It’s because our allies are trading with china (and it’s the other party’s fault)”
 
“Covid struck too hard? It’s because of our border policies (and it’s the other party’s fault”

“We lost the election? Well Russia must have had something to do with it, with the other party’s approval” 

What this really means for a democratic society is the lack of self criticism and self improvement, at least at the federal level. Despite all the debates online and in court about what party supports what policies, the actual reality is much more “conservative” in regards to changes and reforms.

Regardless of who wins, it’s unlikely that truly deep reforms will get passed. However this is only a recent trend, and only true in terms of domestic policies. The true changes will be seen in terms of international politics, but that’s off topic for this discussion.

## d) Money talks:

Lobbying is legal in the US. Let that sink in. 

In terms of domestic policies (although this reflects in international policies as well), politicians are very much encouraged to accept financial support from national and multi-national level corporations, in exchange for support.

What this means is: you are not getting what you voted for. 

The Military industrial complex will still receive support.

Pharmaceutical companies will still be allowed astronomical prices for otherwise cheap medications.

X, Meta, Google and other tech companies will still be able to sell illegally retrieved customer data.

No. Matter. Who. You. Vote.

So, to recap, the USA are

1) a democracy only in name
2) nationalistic and stagnant
3) sheltering powerful companies

There’s a name for a form of government with those characteristic a *Plutocracy*.

1ejeap5,CMV: American Politics Alienate Moderates,"I live in a swing state so maybe this issue isn't relatable to non-swing states. I consider myself politicly moderate and the I have never felt more alienated. Political ideologies between democrat and republican are more polarizing than ever, and if I make the mistake of speaking of anything remotely political during an election year to someone who affiliates themselves with either party as soon as I express a viewpoint that is contrary to theirs's they act like I may as well be burning down the capitol. Most political ads focus on tearing down their opposition instead of their plans or policies. I know some of this is a result of first past the post voting, and it's a combination of this and the electoral college that makes my vote and viewpoint in politics feel alienated. I also can empathize with the fact that being blue or red in a non-swing state that is the opposite color can make voting feel even more pointless. I believe in democracy, but I feel like the nature of politics is driving a wedge between people that's hurting us as a whole.

1esttpx,CMV: Elon Musk is willfully dishonest and deceitful to the public / investors,"He has lost track of whatever dreams he has ever stood for. Perhaps he was never a man of science to begin with, which would mean that I was wrong all along and had a biased opinion of the ""electric cars are the future"" engineer. But it is my opinion the guy has completely lost track of whatever dreams he stood for. I was shocked, utterly disappointed, when I heard him respond to statements like ""
the ocean is going to rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years … and you’ll have more oceanfront property"" with a nod and a ""right"". Like, even if you have arguments against how fast the sea level raises, completely legitimate, the hypothetical scenario where they have rose, and that that would mean more space where to build on the coastline is a concept so dumb that a 12 years old could disprove. Lately he has been hiding behind the ""free speech absolutist"" excuse, but if that means not challenging dumb points to not hurt the other person's feelings what he really means by free speech is actually lazy, passive and just pointless speech. There has been a turning point and he just looks like he has lost his mind, engaging in petty and troll social media attitudes like a child, the dubious Twitter acquisition and its disastrous management, the Tesla mess, going full political with all the disinformation...

1eu2xg6,"Cmv: A proposed $25K first time homebuyer subsidy ultimately only serves to enrich the current property owning class, as well as spike current home prices through artificial demand.","The effects are obvious. 

1) home prices will raise directly commensurate with any subsidy. Sellers know there's excess free cash and will seek to capture.

2) Subsidies will flow directly to current homeowners offloading property or to developers who were sitting on property and seeing land prices skyrocket. 

3) tax payers are ultimately footing the bill of government expenses via direct tax payments or through resultant inflation... Effectively, we have a direct payment from the government to homeowners.

4) This policy is liable to create runaway demand for housing which outpaces the $25K due to people leveraging that money into a loan. This will in turn create another round of house price increase, and as a result, the property owning class is further enriched.

Edit: this post is not a commentary on affordability. I have no idea what affordability will shake out to because I cannot predict what interest rates will do, D2I ratios, or median income.

1exu442,CMV: Obesity being treated as a mental health issue is the best course of action,"Obesity, as I currently understand it is mostly a mental health/distress tolerance problem. Think about how snappy you get when you get ""hangry"" that is what someone on a calorie deficit is going to feel like every day (for the most part). Ozempic I would even consider a mental health medication because it essentially removes the ability to experience the negative emotions we experience when our bodies start freaking out about perceived food scarcity (hunger).

One of the best indicators of adulthood obesity is having an ACE (adverse childhood experience) score of over three. The beginning of our current understanding of childhood trauma literally started at weight loss clinics.

With this in mind I present the following.

1.) Psychiatrists and Psychologists should be allowed to prescribe obesity managing medications. 

2.) Obesity should be a valid reason for mental healthcare to be covered by whatever system you get services from, wether the one we have in America (gross) or one run by your countries healthcare service

3.) Obesity should have talk therapy as a primary intervention. 

4.) Obese patients should be taught DBT ( Dialitetcal Behavioral Therapy) skills and management strategies  to increase their ability to deal with the negative emotions that come with being in a calorie deficit

5.) Obesity needs to be reframed to the public, it's not just that someone needs to eat less. It's someone needing to find a way to intake less calories (generally this is the cause of obesity), without the restriction becoming to miserable to be sustained.

 Managing obesity is something that is going to take trial and error and open communication between patient and provider, that happens way more often with a therapist than any other healthcare worker. 

Additionally there are ties to hunger levels and stress levels. Moving to a less taxing and stressful society also needs to happen if we want obesity rates to fall. It's real hard to sustain changes that make you feel bad when your material conditions also make you feel bad.

1f22vku,"CMV: Socialist societies are doomed to fail because they are built on the premise that those in charge and the general population are fundamentally good, honest people ","I'm not a big fan of socialism, and I'm not likely to change my views about socialism in general, but this view concerns something specific that I am not sure about. 

When I listen to socialists talk about socialist societies and how they work, it seems that there is a built in assumption that leaders (and everyone else) in socialist societies will act morally with good intentions.

For example, the idea that an immoral CEO will be voted out of power. It seems to me that an immoral CEO will use their power to influence/interfere with the vote. The idea that they're going to play fair seems bizarre to me

Also, the idea that the leader of the socialist society- typically whoever led the rebellion- is going to do the right thing. This is even stranger to me, because they have already showed their inhumanity by murdering people ""for the greater good."" I'm not aware of anybody with this deeply problematic mindset who is a good or even decent person. 

That's my view, curious to hear others.

1eusfr9,CMV: Being ABLE to work hard is a privilege which the average (able-bodied) person isn't aware of  ,"Before you come @ me about how it's a privilege to be able to not work (and I agree that there are certainly many circumstances where this is the case) please hear my perspective out...

I have been on both spectrums of being physically healthy/able-bodied, and being extremely chronically ill/disabled. When I was younger, I was an athlete (working out 5-6 days a week, 2-3hrs/day), able to do school full-time, and get straight-A's, and had multiple jobs. Basically, I was a type-A extremely hard-working, productive, and efficient member of society.

When I developed multiple chronic illnesses and health conditions in my early 20's, I went from being a superwoman who could do it all to basically completely bedridden. For a period of time my hands were disabled, I had 10/10 pain throughout my body 24/7, searing migraines, and I was physically incapable of walking. Needless to say, I could not work *any* type of job (blue-collared, white-collared, or otherwise) in that condition. At the worst of my health problems, it was literally impossible for me to work and I did end up living in my car for a period of time (in the beginning my family didn't believe my chronic illness was real and kicked me out because they thought I was mentally ill/lazy). Even jobs that could be done 100% online (which are already extremely limited for many career paths, particularly 10 years ago when I was in my 20's) were not possible for me due to the hand paralysis, migraines, and extreme neurological conditions (including light sensitivity to screens and very bad cognitive issues/brain fog).

After being told it's all in my head and that I'm just lazy/don't want to work (despite me being an extremely hard-working person for my entire life prior to my diagnosis) by virtually all of society, almost a decade later I finally have several diagnoses that validate my disabilities. I am also fortunate to have improved to some degree where I can still work (but not nearly to the extent that I used to be able to) with certain accommodations but I am still very limited by severe chronic pain and daily symptoms. I had to chance my entire career path and life around my disability, because the path I was taking was simply not accessible to me.

My chronic illness/disabilities essentially ruined my 20's, destroyed my bank account (medical bills leaving me with no savings, so I am nowhere near being able to save for things like a home or retirement). Coming from this perspective, it irks me sometimes when people deny that health/ability privilege is a real thing and act as if they do not have privilege to be able to work. I understand the plight of the lower-class/middle-class working person who needs to work very hard, sometimes in multiple jobs, to have a roof over their head and put food on the table. But for some people with severe disabilities/chronic illnesses, no matter how hard they want to or try, this is quite literally not possible or accessible. Many of those people end up losing everything and becoming homeless, then being further blamed and stigmatized for their situation.",anonykitcat,353,0.6800000071525574,414,1723929838,2024-08-17 16:23:58,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eusfr9/cmv_being_able_to_work_hard_is_a_privilege_which/,8,2024
1et0lpa,"CMV: most criticism of ""incels"" is useless/unproductive because it relies too heavily on a just world fallacy. ","To start off. When I say ""Incel"" I mean the dictionary definition ""involuntary celibate"" somebody who wants a sexual relationship but for whatever reason is struggling or incapable of finding one. 

And the fact that I have to place a clear definition here is part of my view. Most of the conversations I see regarding incels turn into semantic arguments because people have a very specific stereotype in mind of a ""misogynistic overweight neckbeard who doesn't bathe and hates women because they don't want to sleep with him"" 

This I feel relies too heavily on a just world fallacy that dictates that these people must inherently be struggling due to personal/moral failings. Because if they weren't misogynistic/unhygienic/antisocial they wouldn't be having difficulties. 

I feel as though the world is not so just. And that there is a silent majority of incels who are struggling to find partners due to issues like neurodivergence and unhealthy or unrealistic standards placed on men (aka, toxic masculinity) in the realm of dating. 

As such, the advice most frequently given to this group to ""shower more"" and ""treat women like people"" is redundant and not at all helpful. Because it comes from a place of presumption based in the aforementioned just world fallacy. Because society at large isn't really willing to admit that mens success in dating is still predicated on successfully performing the same outdated male gender roles as 50 years ago.

1eox0xr,"CMV: The 2024 election will be quite similar to the 2016 election, just with the roles reversed.","If you look at it: For the first time in Trump's political career, he's had to put up with an opponent who draws comparable amounts of enthusiasm as him and one who's stolen much of his media thunder. I honestly don't think Trump knows what to do and I'm not convinced he'll figure it out before the election. What is funny, is that other Republican candidates had an idea that this would happen and yet Trump seems to have been caught completely and utterly off guard by Biden deciding to pass the torch. I won't deny there is always time for Trump to turn it around, but based on what's gone on so far it's not looking good, and we haven't even gotten to the DNC yet. I believe Harris will win every state Biden won in 2020, as well as North Carolina and will make Trump uncomfortable in Texas, Florida and Ohio. I also believe she'll carry Democrats over the finish line in both the Senate and the House. The reason I say this is similar to the 2016 election is because this election comes at a time of uncertainty. Trump represents what Clinton represented in 2016. A product of a political system that most Americans think needs washing. Harris now is what Trump was in 2016. This isn't like 2020 where Democrats were of course happy to vote Biden in but weren't all that enthused about him. Democrats are fired up for Harris this time around and I really do not know if there's much Trump can do to stop or try to counter it. For the first time in his political career: Trump has taken a backseat in terms of enthusiasm and media coverage. Of course, I'll listen to any opposing arguments and will award a !delta to those who provide compelling arguments to the contrary.",BloonsFan-1306,334,0.6899999976158142,482,1723307089,2024-08-10 11:24:49,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eox0xr/cmv_the_2024_election_will_be_quite_similar_to/,8,2024
