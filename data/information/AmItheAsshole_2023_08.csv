161filb,"AITA Job pays $100k, wife complains I need a different job because I “don’t make enough money to support our family” I told her that’s ridiculous","Hi Reddit!

My wife has been telling me for multiple years to get a job that actually pays a living wage. My job pays me $100k/yr. I have 4 kids and we are late on paying bills almost every month.

Today, my daughter got a huge glass of milk and I had asked her not to drink milk since it’s expensive and we need it for the meals we have ingredients for. My wife got mad and told me that she can drink as much milk as she likes and that it’s ridiculous that I still work at the same place that cannot support a family of 4.

I yelled back. I told her the only problem we actually have is how much she spends on selfish garbage and she has no self-control and just buys whatever she wants and that it is HER that is not supporting this family and it is HER that doesn’t have a job. She says she will never respect me because I won’t do what needs to be done like a “real husband and father” would (aka quit my job and find one that makes what she considers a livable wage, $250k+)

I told her she’s out of her mind, that $100k is a lot of money and way more than most people will ever make. She told me to hire a CPA. When I said I can’t afford that she said “hmmmm” with snark followed by a “whatever dude”

Am I the asshole??",beef-ox,17200,0.8700000047683716,7795,1693007992,2023-08-25 18:59:52,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161filb/aita_job_pays_100k_wife_complains_i_need_a/,8,2023
166r41q,AITA for leaving the table after what my FIL’s said?,"My (26F) husband (29M) and I were invited at my ILs for dinner yesterday.

Everything’s was going great until my MIL brought up my husband’s ""player"" phase in high school.

My MIL was just jokingly being like ""Honestly, him in High school, I’d never thought he’d actually settle down with somebody"" and my FIL was like ""Yeah, even less with someone like you"". I asked him what he meant by that

Both my MIL and husband were then like ""Please, no"" in a ""oh he’s gonna fuck up"" way. 

My FIL said ""Well you weren’t exactly his type in high school, you know?"". My husband tried to make him stop after that but my FIL added ""Not saying you weren’t pretty enough or anything like that, you just wouldn’t have caught his eyes"" 

I got up the table and went to the bathroom. I was not even in there for 5 minutes that my husband knocked and told me we were leaving. 

Once we were home, my husband received a text from his mom saying that my reaction was childish and disrespectful and that we wouldn’t be invited again until i apologized. 
My husband replied that I’d only apologize if my FIL apologize first.

16362zh,AITA for peeing in my friend's shower?,"I (22FtM) was staying at a friend's place a few months ago over my spring break. Let's call her Natalie (23F). Natalie and I have been friends for a while, but we haven't been able to hang out as much since she graduated last year and has been working. This was my first time seeing her new place, and our first time spending the night together (before anyone gets the wrong idea, there are absolutely no romantic or sexual feelings between us). 

Now, as a guy without a penis I am unable to enjoy the wonders of pissing standing up most of the time. STPs scare me and so I simply sit. However, when I shower I can pee however I'd like and it just goes down the drain and washes off my leg if I aim badly! I shower every night before bed and I basically always pee, it's just really satisfying for me. I don't really talk to my friends about my peeing habits, but my whole family pees in the shower as well and I just assumed it was normal.

Last week, me and Natalie were hanging out with some of our friends. Somehow, we started talking about peeing, and so of course peeing in the shower came up. Many of my penisless friends agreed with me that it's so nice to be able to stand for once, and many of my penis-having friends even agreed as well. However, not everyone felt that way, and there was a bit of an awkward silence afterwards.

Natalie approached me later and nervously asked me if I had peed in her shower, and I said yes. She got really quiet and the whole thing got really awkward. She kinda shuffled away and we sort of avoided each other the rest of the evening. Later, one of our mutual friends texted me to tell me Natalie was really uncomfortable to learn that I peed in her shower, and she was reconsidering whether she would ever let me stay with her again. I texted her about it directly and apologized, but she hasn't replied yet.

So AITA for peeing in her shower?",AITAShowerPee,10269,0.800000011920929,6666,1693179913,2023-08-27 18:45:13,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16362zh/aita_for_peeing_in_my_friends_shower/,8,2023
1629gnq,AITA for exposing my friend’s plastic surgery in front of her husband?,"  
So I have a friend who when we were in college got some work done. It was known to everyone and she never had a problem sharing with people and giving them tips on who to go to, the aftermath and everything.   
We are now 30 and the whole friend group knows and whenever she meets new people she tells them (or so she told me). Yesterday she invited me to her and her husband’s and we were playing some old video tapes and pictures of our memories and we were reminiscing the past and everything. Until a photo of her pre surgery appeared and her husband was like “oh she look so different” so I was like “oh it must’ve been pre surgery”. He was like “what surgery?” I looked at him then at her then she tried to deflect the situation but the setting was awkward for the rest of the night.  
Apparently she dated him and married him but she lied about getting work done and he believed her. After I left he Ig demanded answers which forced her to say the truth. She called me today saying I am the AH for exposing her but I was like “how could’ve known you lied to him when you are always upfront about it” like if she doesn’t mention it herself she expects me to mention it on her behalf to other people we meet…except her husband. I also told her she invited me to view our old photos why didn’t she just give me heads up about it like she knew old photos pre surgery would appear.   
She hung up on me saying she doesn’t wanna know me anymore and that I am terrible secret keeper.",Early_Elevator_2311,8799,0.9599999785423279,496,1693090623,2023-08-26 17:57:03,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1629gnq/aita_for_exposing_my_friends_plastic_surgery_in/,8,2023
15qe79r,AITA for telling my daughter that she is smart and hardworking but not gifted.,"My wife and I both have electrical engineering degrees but I no longer work in the field and am a manager.

We have a daughter (15F) and a son (17M) and both will be headed to university next month. My son is doing a BA and has not yet picked his major and my daughter will be studying physics and computer science. My son is also very smart and is a history and language nerd.

My daughter is smart and hardworking and is attending at an earlier age than usual. She was in a school program for gifted kids. We were having a conversation at dinner the other day and my wife mentioned how proud she was of our daughter and how lucky we were to have gifted children going to good university programs and how not many people can do what our daughter did.

I was also very happy but I said that while (daughter) is really hardworking and smart, I would not say that she is actually gifted and others can't do it if they put in the same amount of work. 

Her school does a lot to try to admit girls into her program, and my wife helped teach her advanced college level math and physics from an earlier age, she didn't naturally pick it up on her own. If anything being a younger applicant with the same credentials probably helped her stand out more for the admissions committee.

I have seen how people can ruin their lives over thinking they are 'gifted' and it going to their head so I just wanted to caution her about that. 

Both my wife and daughter are upset at me now, my wife thinks I was trying to put her down which is not true and says she is gifted, while my daughter actually agrees with me but says I should not have said it as she already knows.

AITA here? It might not come across in the post but I am genuinely proud and happy for my kids and beyond what I described here, there was a lot of complimenting and celebration on my part.",notgiftedbutsmart,8424,0.8100000023841858,4033,1691970413,2023-08-13 18:46:53,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qe79r/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_she_is_smart/,8,2023

I was so confused so I asked her more questions she told me how my sister had been saying I cheated on their father and more bs. I had called the rest of my daughters down stairs and asked them to tell me what their stepmom had been saying they proceeded to tell me everything . So I had told my daughters the truth I could tell they didn’t believe me at first until I told them to ask their grandparents and father what had really happened .

15onuwl,AITA For giving my mom the silent treatment after I found out she was pregnant?,"I will try to be as direct as possible.   
I (20F) always had a complicated relationship with my mother. Throughout my childhood, she always had problems with addiction. Basically, what I remember from my childhood with her is living with her until things got so bad that our family had to step in, moving in with them, my mom getting better, then moving back in with her only for her to get worse and the cycle to start all over again.   
However, since I was 13 I live with my uncles, they are incredible and they have always been the parents I needed, but since then my mother has not asked me to stay with her again. My uncles always explained that she had a disease and her leaving me with them was proof of her love for me.  
You can imagine that my relationship with her has always been complicated, but I've always tried to understand that this is something that is out of her control. In the last months, she's been on a good streak again, stopping all that shit, she's moved in with a new boyfriend and he seems to be someone that wants to help her out. We don't see each other much but I try to call her at least every 15 days, and my parents always try to report to me about her improvements.  
However, last week, after a long time, she was the one that called me and asked me to go out. I tried not to get too excited because I already know what she's like, but at the same time, I was happy. When we met, she explained how her boyfriend has helped her to cut 100% contact with anyone who influences her to go back to addiction, and how she wants to be a better person. She even started therapy and went to rehab for a while. I said I was very happy and asked what finally motivated her to make that decision.  
And then she told me that he helped her but that the big motivator that gave her strength is that they decided to start a family and that she wanted to meet me in person to let me know that she is pregnant. She said she needed to be better, to be present, and that is what is helping her focus on recovery.  
It hurt me, you know? That they were worth it, but I wasn't. I decided to leave before our lunch was even over and ignored all forms of contact from her thereafter. As people say, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.  
However, yesterday her boyfriend called me (I answered because I didn't have his number saved) and he started yelling at me, he said I was an asshole, that for him I would never have contact with his family, because apparently no one knows where my mom is and what hindered her improvement was my attitude. My grandparents are also angry with me and said that I am very irresponsible and that I didn't have emotional responsibility with someone very vulnerable. My parents said I didn't do anything wrong but I have my doubts.

15k3geq,"AITA for not waiting to redecorate, even if it upsets my trans cousin?","I (f 20) currently live in the house left to me by my paternal grandmother. Since moving in at 18, I have wanted to change the decor pretty dramatically. My grandmother was a very “coastal grandmother” and the entire house reflects that. The main color palette is white, navy and some hints of other dark colors. I want to change it into bright pinks, oranges, and yellows.  
  
For my birthday in May, my dad surprised me by hiring an interior decorator and gave me a pretty large budget, so it basically became a renovation too. We have slowly been working together to create ideas for the whole house and on friday, she finally came with paint, wallpaper, and fabric swatches. She pinned all the fabric swatches to the correct pieces (the living room has a conversion pit that we are upholstering), plus painted the wall to pick the right color for the wallpaper.   
  
My (maternal) cousin (ftm 23) and boyfriend (m 19) are both currently living with me. My boyfriend knows of my renovations and told me that I own the house so he just wants me to do what I like. My cousin lives on the opposite side of the house and uses a bar as their kitchen, so I rarely see him. Well, yesterday he came into the kitchen and asked about the redecorating, as he can see stuff in the bar and bathroom. I explained what I was doing.  
  
He FREAKED out on me, saying that i'm trying to force him back into being a girl by painting everything so feminine. We went back and forth for over an hour, with the conversation ending with me telling him that he can either suck it up or move out and pay rent somewhere. My dad also made him sign a renter’s contract, even though he wasn't paying rent. I made sure to bring this up, saying that if he wanted to fight about it then I can give him his 30 day notice.   
  
FYI- his areas are not being turned pink, except the bar he uses as a kitchen. The bar and kitchen will look the same, with the same cabinets and countertop. His bathroom is staying white, but we are replacing the toilet and shower.   
  
He still is currently in my house, but I have gotten multiple calls about the situation. My mom’s side believes that I am being transphobic for not waiting to decorate until he leaves (he said before that it's not for at least 2 years). My dad’s side believes that my grandma left me the house because I always loved it and she knew my pink dream for it, so I shouldn't have to wait because someone doesn't even pay rent on it. 

The house is in my name, was left to me, and I just really really want to decorate it. I love how every room comes together and it's exactly how I wanted it. I’m going to be disappointed if I don’t go through with it. And my dad has spent so much on it already. I feel bad to make him uncomfortable though. So AITA for going through with redecorating?

15xogbt,AITA for giving my dad the ultimatum of wearing diapers or going to a nursing home?,"I’m 19 and my dad is 56. his biggest fear is ending up in a nursing home. he’s also had an issue controlling his bowels for over a year now and i suspect it’s because he will regularly refuse to eat and will drink beer all day until dinner. ive brought this up to him and he said it’s “fasting” and that it’s good for him. i told him it’s not fasting, it’s just drinking on an empty stomach, and he got upset and just said his bowel problem is old age, but i don’t think he’s quite old enough for that to be the issue. 

there’s stains in the carpet all over the house from times he hasn’t made it. it’s disgusting and i can’t afford new carpet and neither can he. i just ran the carpet cleaner over it after getting up all the big stuff and that’s the best i can do for now. 

today i was in the kitchen cooking dinner and he was sitting at the table. he stood up and said “i have to go shit. actually, i’m shitting right now”. i thought he was joking at first until i started hearing it hit the floor. he stripped down, dripped it all over the floor, and smeared it around with paper towels in an attempt to clean it up. i was pissed at this point because he knows he has this problem and refuses to wear diapers and now i’m playing hop scotch trying not to burn anything. 

i ended up having to shut the stove off and clean it up myself and at this point i had no appetite left so i just made a plate for him and my brother and started getting ready to put it away. whenever he got down from the shower, i told him he needs to work with me on this to get it figured out because i’m not going to keep dealing with this and i’ll pay someone else to if i have to. i told him he needs to at least wear diapers or he’s ending up in the nursing home. 

i know this was harsh, but i have just been so fed up with it. he tried to blame me by saying i made him come in the kitchen for dinner and it took him farther away from the bathroom. i never made him sit there, and he didn’t even make it out of the kitchen so i know he wouldn’t have made it from anywhere else in the house either. he was really embarrassed and started crying though and said he’s not happy about it either and when i came to apologize later for making him so upset, he just kept saying “whatever” and saying he didn’t want to hear it. 

i know im not wrong for expecting him to at least try to work with me, but was i the asshole for threatening him with the nursing home over it?",Far_Injury4287,5088,0.949999988079071,2245,1692661725,2023-08-21 18:48:45,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xogbt/aita_for_giving_my_dad_the_ultimatum_of_wearing/,8,2023
15zk55y,"AITA for turning off my girlfriend's alarm clock after she hit snooze too many times, causing her to oversleep and be late to work?","  
My girlfriend and I love together. She wakes up at 6am to get to work at 7am. Every morning, her alarm starts going off at 5am and she hits snooze over and over before she finally crawls out of bed at 6am to be in the bathroom getting ready for 45 minutes before she leaves. I work from home and don't need to wake up until about 8:30am. I enjoy sleeping in until then. 

It fucking maddens me that her alarm goes off constantly from 5am-6am and destroys my sleep and my morning. I've brought this up with her and she's defended the habit and refused to quit because (1) she says it's the only way she can get up in the morning, and (2)  she has to drive to work for a job that starts much earlier than mine, and I work from home, so I should be accommodating to her and empathetic that she has to wake up so early and drive. After months of this I told her that the next time her snooze went off, I'd turn off her alarm on her phone. 

This morning, I did that at 5am and reached over and just turned off the alarm on her phone after she hit snooze the first time. She slept through to about 6:40am, woke up, freaked out, and ended up about 10 minutes late to work. She is furious at me. But I insist I am right and I will do the same thing tomorrow. She needs to just set her alarm for 6am when she actually gets up and forget that the ""snooze"" feature exists.

15go2jh,AITA for rude and dismissive about all of my wife’s baby name ideas?,"My wife and I are expecting our first child in the coming months and we have chosen not to find out the sex until the baby is born. Things are starting to feel very real now so we’ve started to properly discuss names, but we’ve realised we both have vastly different tastes in name style and we are having a hard time finding the right one. 

My wife likes names that are out there and unique but I find these names tacky and silly and would prefer a better known, more traditional name. 

Last night she showed me a short list she had put together and thought I might like. The names on the list were:

Girl:
Fern, Fennix, Rhodes, Faun, Brixtyn, and Kinley

Boy:
Spark, Diesel, Quincy, Phoenix, Buck, and Fox

These names are tamer than what she’s suggested before, but I told her they didn’t feel right. I suggested ideas like Rose instead of Rhodes, Felix instead of Phoenix, and Buchanan instead of Buck.  

I finally snapped when she suggested Zoomer. I asked if she was serious and said it was a stupid name. She asked what my problem was and why I was so dismissive of all her ideas and shooting down all the names she likes. I told her we were naming a child and not a dog, and that names can have a huge impact on the child. I said I don’t want my child to be bullied or taken less seriously because they have a ridiculous name. She told my I was rude and that I was the bully for making her feel unsupported. She started crying and went to bed. I decided to give her some time and space so waited till she was sleeping to go to bed.

I feel bad about coming at her the way I did, but I also feel it needed to be said.

EDIT:
When she got back I explained my concerns and apologised for how I reacted previously. She explained that she has a very common name and there were always multiples in school, and she doesn’t want that for our child. I very rarely experienced this so can’t really comment on how it feels. 

We’ve decided to look into the app everyone is talking about, and to explore our family tree to see if there are any names we both like. Thank you all for your suggestions! 

Many people have asked to see some of the names that I like, so here goes

Our bathroom is weirdly long so I’ll have to get out of the shower walk to the light switch turn it back on then get back to the shower. It also leaves a mess of water for me to clean up after wards. And I can’t keep her out because the lock is broken.  My parents gave her a verbal warning once but when she continued to do it there was no real punishment. They just told me to just put up with it and she’ll eventually get bored and stop. 

Well that didn’t work because she continued this for three weeks. One day as I was getting out the shower to turn the lights back on, I almost slipped and fell. This gave me an idea, I waited until the next time she tried to pull this prank again. When she came to turn the lights off I knocked all the stuff off the shower caddy, the bottles on the tub edge and the towel rack. I also pulled the shower curtain down and quickly laid on the ground. My mother burst in turned the lights on and saw the mess plus me on the ground. She ran up to me and asked if I was ok, I said no I slipped in the dark and hurt myself pretty bad. 

After mom and dad helped me get settled they turned on my sister. They yelled at her, took her phone and grounded her for the rest of the week. She was also forced to apologize to me and promise to never do it again. When I told my boyfriend about this he said what i did was cruel. Not only did i unnecessarily scare my parents my sister got punished for something that didn’t happen. He says I could have just gotten a doorstop for the bathroom or a lamp so it’s not as dark.

A few days ago we get a call, from my husbands ex mistress. She says her job wanted her to fly out of state this weekend for an opportunity but it is in possible with her son and asked us if we would be willing to take him in so short notice. Usually my husband gets a hotel and stays with his son when she flies out, but she said this time would be a longer term stay. I told my husband absolutely not, that wasn’t happening. He said I was being unfair, and that he cares for my daughter (who’s from my late partner) like his own, and I should do the same. I screamed at him and said “my daughter isn’t the product of my affair, absolutely no way is he staying here.” He got angry and said that I was being ridiculous and a b*tch, because the child is innocent. In my eyes it hurts me too much to look at that boy.

15xn0sn,"AITA for telling my father that I would not babysit for him anymore until he and his wife replaced my computer, apologized, and promised me that I would not be expected to share my property with her children.","I (F17) am starting school in the fall. I worked very hard to graduate early and get into college. I'm trying to get out of my house as fast as I possibly can. 

We live in a multigenerational house. My paternal grandparents own the house and my dad and his brother both live there with their families as well. My mom divorced my dad and he remarried a few years later. I was living with her until her new husband transferred overseas for work last year. 

I am the oldest kid in the house and all the adults work. So I got stuck babysitting my nephews, niece, and half brother and sister. I don't mind, they are well behaved and I get paid. Not a lot but I do. 

For college I had a plan. I have my laptop at home but I don't want to lug it around. So I got myself a handheld gaming computer. It runs windows and I have a small folding Bluetooth keyboard. 

My half brother saw it when I brought it home and he wanted to play games on it because it looks sort of like a switch. 

I said he couldn't because it was my computer for school. He is ten and on the spectrum so he loses his temper very easily. He had a tantrum and his mother insisted I let him play with it.  I said no and took it and went to see my grandmother. I was showing her all the stuff I could do on it when my dad came home. 

His wife convinced him that I was taunting my had brother by not letting him play with my ""toy computer"". 

My dad said to let him play and that he will be careful. I said it wasn't a toy and that I got it for school. He insisted that I needed to share when I was in his house. My grandmother gave him side eye but didn't say anything. 

Surprise surprise, the little asshole couldn't play Diablo on it so he got upset and smashed it. 

I said I told you so and gave the ultimatum from my title. 

It was Monday today and I took my uncle's kids with me to the zoo. I left my father's children at home. His wife had to take the day off. They tried texting and calling me for an hour until they figured out I wasn't going to back down. 

He tried to ground me when I got home but my grandmother told him I was right. So now I am in my room setting up my second brand new computer in a week. But my father and his wife are upset with me because they had to spend money replacing a toy. They said I should just use my laptop for school. Cheaper than her losing her job though I guess.",Abject-Ebb9415,4235,0.9599999785423279,264,1692658381,2023-08-21 17:53:01,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xn0sn/aita_for_telling_my_father_that_i_would_not/,8,2023
166pxro,AITA for saying my son in law needs medication?,"My daughters husband has ADHD. I am aware of ADHD and the nuances and symptoms since my daughter has it as well. But, at least from my point of view, he does nothing to cope or combat it in any way. As a result, I have witnessed him acting extremely negligent to his duties as an adult partner. I don’t mean emotionally or anything, because they can be very sweet together, I mean he’s 100% the type of guy who has to be asked 5x to take the trash out and still doesn’t do it. Every house chore falls onto my daughter, even right after she gave birth, he didn’t do a single load of laundry, a single dish, walk the dog or change a diaper. He works full time to support them while my daughter takes care of the baby,  which is nice, but outside of that, he does nothing to contribute to their life from what I’ve seen. He is oblivious to the fact that she’s speaking to him half of the time and she ends up just sitting there talking to herself while he stares at his phone or spaces out.  All of which, he attributes to his ADHD claiming he has “executive dysfunction”, or that he gets sidetracked, overwhelmed by multiple chores and starts to get frustrated. She has to call his name over and over again, repeatedly say “hello? I’m speaking to you?” For him to even glance up from his phone when she’s sitting 2 feet away from him. He’s so not in tune with his surroundings that if the baby cries and she asks him to pitch in and help, he expects to be told what’s wrong with the baby, how to help, where to find everything, because he wasn’t paying any attention. So if she needs him to help with the baby, she’s still not getting whatever else she needs to get done finished, because she’s standing there and walking him through step by step, repeating herself, and still doing 100% of the mental load. 

I watched this happen on countless visits and I just had enough of it this time. I watched for a week while my daughter did everything, cooked every meal, cleaned everything, did every feeding, changed every diaper. She did it or I did it, and not once, did her husband even offer to help or notice. When we did things all together he was constantly talking over my daughter, zoning out, or completely not even paying attention, and she has to repeat herself over and over again. Finally I snapped, cleared my throat and asked “why are you ignoring your wife when she’s talking to you?”. He started scrambling and trying to explain that it’s just that he has ADHD and can’t help it, and I told him that having ADHD doesn’t give him an excuse to treat my daughter like she’s invisible, and if that’s the extent to which it affects him he needs to see a doctor and get medication. His face got really red and he looked like he was about to cry, and I have to admit that I do feel bad for that, but at the same time, I think he needed to know. My daughter is saying she agrees but says that I owe him an apology for my tone or I won’t be invited back to visit.

166po8j,AITA for calling the hotel,"I had to create an anonymous username because people know my regular username. 

I will try to keep this short and sweet.

I have a MIL that has been a thorn in my side for over 20 years. From the second I started dating her son, she was an actual pain and boundary stomped nonstop. An example- my first child was an emergency csection and I was released a day earlier than normal and she thought it was acceptable to call my ob/gyn to have him make me stay at the hospital longer. She also made sure to tell me on multiple occasions that I will never have a strong bond because I couldn’t breastfeed. When my husband and I confronted her, she lied and played the victim. 

I recently started going to therapy and have really begun to understand that she is absolutely insane. I always knew, but I never wanted to put my husband in a weird position. He is, by all means, a great husband. Very supportive and caring.

Heres the issue- we have a family wedding this weekend out of town for my husband’s side. My children are in the wedding and we are very excited. My husband informed me that his mother called the hotel to request that we have an adjoining room with his parents. She did not discuss it with us, she just made the call to the hotel. To say that I am feeling violated is a gross understatement. I told him that I am NOT ok with this. He said he didn’t want to create any problems or drama and didnt want anyone to be upset. He also said it’s probably because she wants to spend time with our children, but I feel as if this type of thing should be discussed first. We did say we are fine with being on the same floor for this reason, but she took it upon herself to call and request that our rooms be adjoining. 

I took matters into my own hands and called the hotel myself to request that we do not have adjoining rooms. My husband is worried this will create a bigger issue, but I am really upset that his mom thinks this is acceptable. We are near 40 and I don’t want to be treated like a child.

15vveji,AITA for lying about my baby name and making my sister name her kid after my dad's affair partner,"Me(31F) and my sister (38F) never had a good relationship. She always hated me, the shit went so bad she had to go to therapy from 9 until she was 15. After that she started to ignore me, honestly it was a good outcome. She went to college and we started having a more polite relationship.

My father had an affair during the time she was in college and me and my mom found them in the house. She was a neighbor so I knew her name. My parents went to therapy and my mom forgave my father, but still hated the neighbor.

I discovered from my cousins that my sister was planning to steal my baby name because I was pregnant at the same time as her. She was acting like my pregnancy was some sort of evil plan against her. She spent around one month in my ass trying to convince me to give her the name. In an angry moment after receiving 12 calls from her the same day I told her the name of my dad's ex mistress as if it was the name we planned.

Her baby was born 2 weeks ago, she only let the family visit today. When she told our parents the name my mom got choleric with her choice. That's when it came out I was the one who told her. My parents are a little mad at me but much more with her. My sister is pissed, they already have her birth certificate and will have to spend around a thousand dollars to change the name.

I (28m) am married to my wife (27f, ""Lucy""). We have a one and a half year old daughter. Lucy's mom (56f, ""Sarah"") came to visit for the weekend. 

Lucy made dinner for everyone. She also spent a decent amount of the day looking after the baby as I had errands I had to run today. So after dinner, I decided I would take care of bathtime and bedtime, so she could have some downtime and also spend time with her mom. However, Sarah had a problem with this and followed me to tell me it was inappropriate for me to bathe my daughter. I was confused, and she said a man shouldn't bathe his daughter as it is inappropriate and could result in ""temptation.""  

Now, I know she's religious, so maybe that's where this comes from, but I was disgusted. What she was implying was horrible. I told Lucy, and she got very upset with her mother.

15frpwi,AITA telling my brother to pay me back everything he stole from me if he needs an uncle for his kids.,"My brother was an addict when we were growing up. 

My parents did everything to try and save him from himself including ignoring me and my sister to dedicate themselves to him. 

I guess it worked. They got him into rehab and he is clean and sober now. 

That is great for him. I, however, have a shattered relationship with my parents. 

He stole them from me. 

He also stole thousands of dollars worth of my belongings. 

His wife recently passed away and he isn't doing well. 

Our parents passed away during the pandemic. 

He reached out to me and asked if I would take his son if he died. 

I said no. 

Our sister refuses to speak with him so I am his only choice really. 

He is begging me so that his son won't end up in foster care. 

I said I would take his son if he paid me back for everything he ever stole from me. 

I told him only the monetary stuff would count. 

So my 1999 Jeep that I paid for myself and he stole and crashed. And that my parents begged me not to report stolen so he wouldn't go to jail.

That sort of thing. 

I said he could never pay me back our parents missing my wedding because they were dealing with his bullshit.

AITA for not letting her have more fries? My argument is that I asked her previously if she wanted her own order, which she declined. Her argument is that it is standard wife tax.

15japbc,AITA for telling my girlfriend a wedding was child free even tho it wasn’t ?,"My (25M) girlfriend (25F) and I went to my sister’s wedding last week and I told her it was child free even though it wasn’t

Context: my girlfriend has a kid, a little girl who’s 3yo and she takes her EVERYWHERE. We rarely have private moment as a couple 

Now, don’t get me wrong, I love my girlfriend’s daughter, but it gets exhausting to never have moments between just me and my girlfriend 

So, when I told my girlfriend about my sister’s wedding, I told her that it was child free and I asked if she could have someone babysit her daughter. She asked her mom, who agreed.

At the wedding, there was obviously children, a detail I’d forgotten, and when my girlfriend confusingly asked me why were there kids if it was a child free wedding, I simply told her I had no idea

She went to the bathroom during the dinner but i noticed she wasn’t coming back so I went to look for her and I encountered my sister who looked very angry 

My sister called me an asshole and a coward. Apparently, she ran into my girlfriend who was upset with her because my gf thought my sister had only applied the child free rule to her. She told my girlfriend that her wedding was never child free, which made my girlfriend even madder, but at me, and she left

I called my girlfriend but she didn’t answered and when I came home her things and her daughter’s weren’t there anymore 

My sister is also not talking to me anymore because she thinks I ""threw her under the bus"" even though I never told my girlfriend it was my sister’s idea to only apply the child free rule to her

She says she loves have armpit hair and it makes her feel more womanly and sexy and herself. I don’t have an issue with this most of the time (although I’m not really used to this and would probably prefer she shaves). And she’s really clean and never smells bad or anything. 

But recently I invited her to a family function where she’ll meet a lot of my family and some family friends for the first time. She said she’s going to wear a strappy summer dress. I asked her if she’ll shave her armpits and she said she wasn’t planning to. I asked her if she could do it for me as I don’t want my family or family friends to judge her or think she’s weird. She got really offended and said that was really harsh of me and that now she doesn’t even want to come. I don’t think I’m being unreasonable asking her to shave.

I got to be bored because they didn't plan ahead. So this year I planned ahead. My dad gives me money so I can buy souvenirs and do my own thing. I asked him if he could upgrade my seat for me. He looked it up and saw that it was on sort of an auction system. If there better seats to be had then if you win your bid you get the seat. He checked with my mom and asked her if she was okay with it. She said she was. We put in of $55 for an upgrade to coach+ or something. More legroom and closer to the front of the plane. I got it. It was great. I sat by the window up front instead of in a middle row in the back. And I had my own plug in for charging my switch. When we landed my stepfather said I was rude to not want to sit with the family. I said that I had permission from my mom and dad to sit there. Now he is arguing with my mom because he said that it should have been discussed with him since he paid for the original ticket.

That is not what the church ended up using the furniture for. In fact, they didn't use it for anything; they didn't even donate it to a family in need, as you may expect.

15qcye1,AITA for not warning my mom that I put cheese in the food that I made?,"I (24F) made shepherd's pie recently from a recipe online, which said to mix about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese in the mashed potato topping that goes on top of the meat. My mom (63F) has rarely put cheese in her mouth and claims she despises cheese and that it disgusts her, and that she can't stand the sight, smell, taste, etc., of it. She does love other forms of dairy like yogurt, butter, etc. On occasion, she has accidentally ingested some in some of her favorite foods, including garlic bread which she did not know could possibly include cheese.

She had some of the shepherd's pie I made because she loves anything with beef and potatoes, and she ended up absolutely loving it and went for seconds. She wanted to make some herself and I told her the recipe but I omitted the 1/4 cup parmesan because it looked like she was really excited to make it so I felt bad and didn't want to crush her spirit by telling her there's cheese in the original recipe.

She ended up making it without the parmesan, she said it was really good, but she did tell me that the potato topping tasted a bit ""off"" or ""different"" and I told her the original one I made, the one she ate, had parmesan in it. She immediately tilted over, losing balance and grabbed the kitchen counter and put her hand on her forehead as if about to lose consciousness and she got extremely disgusted.

Edit: someone suggested i post an edit. Someone asked if I served it to her, I didn't, I walking in on her already having some with my dad who most likely offered her some. He probably saw the dish on the counter cooling down and served himself some if he thought it looked good, he doesnt care too much about the ingredients and probably couldnt figure right away that there was any obvious cheese in there, as she couldnt seem to tell either.

1635gwu,AITA for not tipping well because my hairdresser brought her baby to the appointment?,"I (30f) been going to Lindsey for years now, and she always does a really good job. She's a very kind girl and I had not had a bad experience with her until yesterday. I hadn't had my hair done in about 6 months so I was quite overdue for cut/color. Keep in mind that Lindsey does specialty haircuts and her rates are not cheap.

So, I walk in for my appointment yesterday and I noticed that Lindsey had her 3 month old with her. She apologized and explained that her babysitter canceled last minute and she was in a bind. She gave me the option of rescheduling but to be honest I didn't think much at the time as the baby was sleeping, plus I really needed my hair done. So I went ahead with the appointment as planned.

The problem started once her baby woke up and was fussy and cried throughout the session, making it hard for me to relax. Furthermore, she had to step out a few times, once to calm the baby down and another to change a diaper, she even left me sitting alone in the chair for about 20 minutes so that she could go feed her daughter. She wasn't nearly as focused as she usually is.

By the end of the appointment I was feeling irritated by all of the disruptions and extra noises that happened that even though I was happy with how my hair turned out I left a small tip. Mind you, the tip is on top of her usual (expensive) rate. When I gave her the tip, she asked if something was wrong and I explained that I felt like the baby was a distraction and that even though I didn't have to pay for the extra time (roughly an hour) I was unhappy with how long it took. She said that she was disappointed because she gave me the option to reschedule. I apologized and left.

Not being a parent myself, I don't want to be dismissive or unsympathetic to Lindsey's situation, however, I really felt like I didn't get the experience with her that I usually pay for. It felt chaotic and unorganized not to mention that I am not the biggest fan of children.

Whenever I'm going to a new restaurant, I always research the menu beforehand to mentally prepare myself for what I'll eat. Unexpected changes can be really hard for me.

My friend ""Lily"" is vegan and celebrated her birthday yesterday. She decided to invite our friend group dine at a health-focused restaurant that, while offering many vegetarian/vegan options, also serves chicken and fish dishes. Before going, I checked the menu and decided on grilled salmon with mashed potatoes (planning to ignore the side salad).

When we arrived, Lily requested that we all choose to eat vegetarian for the night for her birthday. I apologized and explained that there wasn’t a vegetarian option I liked in the menu. Everyone else agreed to her request, and she persisted with me. I expressed that had I known this beforehand, I would've eaten at home and just ordered a vegetarian appetizer. I was genuinely hungry by that point. After some back and forth, I asked if I should leave and she allowed me to stay, but the atmosphere was tense.

The rest of the evening was awkward, with Lily avoiding conversation with me. Today I texted her and asked if everything was ok between us, but she responded by saying I'm too spoiled, and an asshole for not even doing the one thing she asked for her birthday I'm not confrontational by nature, so I apologized again and responded by asking her to inform me in advance next time. She hasn’t replied yet. Now I am wondering if I was the asshole in this situation",DeliciousFudge7755,1815,0.8799999952316284,1169,1693090377,2023-08-26 17:52:57,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1629d74/aita_for_ordering_salmon_at_a_vegan_friends/,8,2023
15j9hlu,AITA for telling my mom she's not financially gaining from my dad's death?,"My (41F) parents divorced in 1991 when I was 10. My father remarried in the midst '90's, as did my mother. The 2 rarely spoke when I was growing up & most communication was relayed thru me (lovely parentin, huh?).

In April 2021, my dad contracted Covid & passed away a month later, essentially destroying my whole life...that's a story for another time though. My step mother receives his survivors benefits. 

In February of 2023, my step dad passed away from various health issues. Since they were married over 10 years, my mother would receive his survivors benefits. Makes sense, right?

Cue to 2 months after he has passed, my mother asks me to borrow my dad's death certificate. When I ask why, she states she could get more from my dad's survivors benefits than from my step dad's. She also claims to need it for a passport in the future (absolute horseshit). 

I told her no, she's not getting my dad's death certificate. The woman hated my father, to the point that she didn't even recognize him when she saw him when I was grown. I really don't want her benefiting from my dad's death at all. They've been divorced over 30 years & she has never been anything more than an asshole to me & my kids.

15t5wzf,AITA for telling my parents I'll no longer keep my brother on track in school?,"I (17F) am a twin with my brother, C (17M). Starting in middle school and throughout high school, it was left to me to keep him on track. C struggles with academic environments, stress, deadlines, etc, and this results in him becoming apathetic throughout the school year. Every end of the quarter it's a cycle. His grades range from Fs to Ds, and I'm left to pick up the pieces and get his average high enough to passing. And I do, each time. Even if he barely passes, he's never missed a credit, been held back, or delayed in any way when he would have otherwise.

This would be me pulling him into the dining room to sit and work on assignments while I was there as an accountability partner. He would complain, yell, and just be rude the entire time. Other times, it would be me having to log into his school computer and do them for him. When he knows I did them, it was seldom acknowledged, and sometimes even complained about how I went about doing them when they'd lose points. My parents, especially mom, always told me this was just what my job was since I'm his sister. That I have to keep him on track and make sure he passes every time, even barely. It's been expected of me for years. 

It's our senior year now. After high school, he plans on attending a police academy to become an officer, and I want to major in education. I'm struggling with balancing work, my extra-curriculars, and an eating disorder. We're in the process of trying to pursue treatment for anorexia. With this, I decided to tell my parents that while I want to help him be on track, I'm not going to go out of my way nearly as much. In my mind, he needs to be able to hold himself accountable, especially in the real world, and he can gradually learn that over the course of this year. My mom was absolutely furious, telling me that I can't abandon my job to keep him on track, and that he'll come around when he's older.

I do want to preface I'm not completely giving up. I'll still happily tutor him and study buddy when needed. But I don't want to drag him to the dining room anymore, or do his assignments on my own time. But I do see how this can look selfish, especially during the last year. AITA?

15j9pw2,AITA for not paying for my siblings college after my college was paid for,"
My parents wanted to save for college however they had 4 kids  and didn’t make enough to be able to save enough money for each kids. 

By the time I was leaving for college they had 100k saved up for us,  25k each however that wouldn’t be enough for me and they wanted me to not have to take out loans so we had an agreement that they would use all the money had to help pay for my college

By the time my younger siblings started college, I would have a job and since I used their money, I would be expected to pay what ever my parents couldn’t afford  of their tuition up to 6k a school year, which would equal 25k per kid

I didn’t want to go into debt and so I agreed,  
My parents continued to save,  and for the next kid they were able to save enough each year that I didn’t need to contribute 

This year I now have 2 siblings in college, and my parents are missing 5k this year to cover my siblings schooling 

They came to me asking for the 5k,  while i have a job and earn enough, I’m now married and my partner and I both have plans for our future and kids, and since our finances are shared we both couldn’t come to an agreement therefore we’re choosing not to give my siblings the 5k

When I told my family this, they were mad, saying that it’s what I agreed to and they are now calling me selfish and entitled as well as other things, I told them that I didn’t make them give me the money and that the siblings could easily work or take out a loan. 

My parents are still mad but my siblings took it to an extreme. They are refusing to talk to me. They blocked me and my partners number and social media and want nothing to do with us,  they’ve even managed to turn my youngest sibling against

15l0uuu,AITA for Not Inviting My Sister to My Wedding After She Insulted My Fiancé?,"Hey Reddit, I (28F) recently found myself in a tough situation regarding my upcoming wedding and my sister (25F). To give you some context, my sister and I have always had a complicated relationship. We used to be close growing up, but as we got older, we started to drift apart due to our differing personalities and lifestyles.

My fiancé (30M) and I have been together for seven years, and he's honestly the love of my life. We got engaged six months ago, and the wedding planning has been in full swing. Now, the issue arose during a family dinner a few weeks ago. My fiancé was there, and he was telling a story about a recent hiking trip he took. He's really into outdoor activities, and he was excitedly talking about climbing a challenging trail.

Out of nowhere, my sister made a snide comment, saying, ""It's surprising you actually did something that requires physical effort."" She said that and looked directly into my eyes. Ever since, I started dating him, she made fun of me, for being with a more chubby man. Everyone at the table went silent, and I could see the hurt on my fiancé's face. He brushed it off, but I could tell he was hurt by her comment.

After the dinner, I confronted my sister privately about her hurtful remark. She dismissed it, saying it was just a joke and that my fiancé shouldn't be so sensitive. This really upset me, as her comment felt like a direct attack on the person I love. I explained to her how important my fiancé is to me and how her words were hurtful.

Fast forward to a few days ago, I sent out wedding invitations to all our close family and friends. When my sister received her invitation, she texted me, asking if she could bring her new boyfriend of two months as her plus-one. I thought about it and decided that, given the strained relationship between us, I would prefer to keep the wedding a more intimate affair with people who genuinely support our relationship.

I told my sister that we were having a small wedding and couldn't accommodate plus-ones for people we didn't know well. She didn't take it well. She accused me of bad things, like not being happy for her, not wanting her to enjoy the day as much as I will. After a while, I was full of her and told her she’s not invited anymore. I brought up the hurtful comment she made about my fiancé and how that played a role in my decision and that she doesn’t respect my boundaries. She got defensive and said I was overreacting.

Now she's been telling other family members that I'm being unreasonable and that I'm using her comment as an excuse to keep her out of the wedding. Some family members have reached out to me, saying I should be the bigger person and invite her, regardless of the past drama.

So Reddit, AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding after she insulted my fiancé, or should I put the past aside and include her for the sake of family harmony?",Miiyaka,1619,0.9599999785423279,445,1691451062,2023-08-07 18:31:02,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l0uuu/aita_for_not_inviting_my_sister_to_my_wedding/,8,2023
15rbm8a,AITA for refusing to treat my step grandkids the same way as my bio grandkids,"My daughter said I should post here.

Me and my husband are retired, we have two kids that both have families. We worked really hard to have a stable retirement. Our kids are all grown up and have their own kids. Now my youngest got remarried and the guy had two kids from a previous marriage. All of our grandkids have money from us to there names it’s about 50,000 each. Before this we only had three grandkids in total. 

Now my daughter wants us to give the new grandkids the same money and I said no. One reason is that they are 14 and 15. Two they have their own grandparents to spoil them. Three my daughter is on her third marriage and I am not throwing money at kids that may be out of my life in a few years. Seriously one marriage lasted for 1.5 years, I don’t have much hope in this one.

15rbgge,AITA for criticizing my boyfriend for staging a fake deportation scenario to test if I’d marry him?,"The other day, I (26M) was out of town attending a wedding with friends from college when I got a call from my boyfriend (29M). He told me he received a letter in the mail and that he was going to be deported. I’ve been with him for 5 months, but until now, his immigration status wasn’t something we had discussed, so this was one million percent out of the blue. He told me that he was basically hoping I could come back to town and marry him ASAP. 

I was freaking out. We’ve told each other we looked forward to getting married and having kids in the future, but I indicated on several occasions that I did not want to get married for at least a few years until I was finished with grad school. Furthermore, I’m 2 weeks away from moving overseas (without my bf) to begin a 10-month program, so I’m already in an emotionally fragile state. So I didn’t give him a hard no, but I told him I just wanted to discuss it later when I could process what was happening and be in a better frame of mind.

So basically, now I’m at this wedding shitting myself. For the next hour, he’s texting me saying that it’s fine and that maybe we should just part ways since he didn’t want to put me in that situation. Once I found a spot outside to hide, I called my boyfriend back and immediately breaking into hysterics. I didn’t know what to do as I wanted to support him, but this was a huge shock to me as I wasn’t even aware his immigration status was a thing at risk. 

That’s when he told me he made the whole thing up. While he did immigrate several years back, his citizenship status was already finalized, and there was no real risk of deportation. It was all basically a test of my loyalty and commitment to see if I would drop anything in an emergency to support him. He also criticized me for expecting him to let me know if his immigration status was in danger in the first place. 

So I was in a state of shock. Apart from the fact that I was meant to be off on a relaxing weekend seeing my friends for one last time before moving halfway across the world for the next year, I also had literally just come out to my mom and my sister the day before and told her about me and my boyfriend’s relationship, so as far as “loyalty” goes, I really felt I had just made a huge step in legitimizing our relationship. I continued to be hysterical and miserable, feeling like I got played but also that I was simultaneously a garbage boyfriend for “failing the test,” and so I basically had a miserable time the rest of the wedding with my friends.

But now, I’m wondering, AITA for criticizing my boyfriend on the scenario here? I do feel shitty for hesitating when he asked me to marry him. I really do feel I love him a lot, but I was not ready to jump in and save the day in such a scenario without question, and I’m now questioning whether I’m a bad boyfriend.",jdawg077,1490,0.9399999976158142,1018,1692057068,2023-08-14 18:51:08,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rbgge/aita_for_criticizing_my_boyfriend_for_staging_a/,8,2023
15pjld3,AITA for asking my girlfriend to use different body wash,"The main thrust of this post is, I am allergic to nuts and my girlfriends bodywash contains almond oil. It isn't life threatening for me to come in contact with it but it does cause hives. I asked my girlfriend (Jess) to change the body wash she uses as I am getting hives from residue of her body wash in the shower. 

Jess was initially fine with it after a small back and forth but has since spoken to friends and believes that I am being too controlling, as do her friends. My friends are mostly neutral with a couple saying that I need to ""nut up"" and let her use whatever she wants. 

A little bit of added context is that we recently decided we wanted to move in together and decided to do a ""trial run"" as Jess still lives with her parents and I rent my own place. So it's easy enough for her to move in with me for a few months to see if living together full time works for us. 

It's never been a problem before now as I've never had a reaction from touching Jess after she uses it, but I am having a reaction from the residue that is left in the shower, usually on the removable shower head which I need to use to get clean because I'm a big dude and just leaving it up there doesn't reach everywhere.

Jess has always been aware of my allergies, she doesn't eat nuts if she knows we're going to do anything together and the few times when she has, she thoroughly brushes her teeth before seeing me.

15onm0m,AITA for not going to a friend's wedding after getting kicked out of the bridal party?,"This happened a couple months ago. I miss my friend and wonder if I could have done something different.  

Sarah (31F) and I (26F) met when we were in undergrad. She was funny and we had a lot in common. Even after school ended, we stayed friends. We'd share memes, vent after bad days, stay at each other's houses. I'd say we were best friends. 

She met a guy, fell in love and got engaged. I was ecstatic for her, and happy when she asked me to be in her bridal party. I'm kind of a dork and had never been to a wedding, let alone played an important part in one. 

Ultimately the bulk of the planning and the wedding itself was to happen during my last year of law school. 

The final year of law school sucks. I had to do my highest level classes while preparing for the bar the toughest-to-pass state. I let it consume my life and was working on bar prep from 6am to 10pm at least six days a week. I wasn't the best friend during that time. I didn't respond to messages as fast as I should have, and I'd turn down some, not all, bridal hangouts because I had to study. 

Towards the summer, things fell apart. She was supposed to get married in September and her venue cancelled in June. She started calling late at night and saying really worrying stuff about her mental health. The first few times this happened I freaked out and talked her down the best I could. I suggested postponing the wedding if it was hurting her this much, or at the very least talking to a professional about all the stress. By the end of the call, we'd both be laughing and everything would be ""fine."" 

However these calls kept happening more frequently and I started to dread seeing her name on the phone. Spending a couple hours a night playing therapist then getting up early and studying the minutiae of state vs. federal class action certification was miserable and I got tired of it. She wasn't looking for any solution, just to use me as a therapist. I told her I can't keep taking these calls where she threatens herself, and if she made specific, credible threats to her well-being again, I'd just call 911 since I'm genuinely worried and live 100+ miles away. 

She got incredibly upset, started crying and hung up. A week later, Sarah asked if I could come over to talk. I understood that she was hurt, and really wanted to make things better between us. When I got there, all the bridesmaids were there like it was an intervention. Sarah told me that she had rethought me being in her wedding. She said it felt ""disingenuous"" to have someone there that doesn't really care about her enough to support her, plus I was ""soooo busy.""  She also told me that I was still welcome to attend the wedding as a guest with no plus 1. I told her I appreciated her telling me in person, but I wouldn't want anything ""disingenuous"" on her big day even as a guest, and she can invite someone else. 


That was the last time we spoke.

15l0ydg,AITA for wanting to move out over lemonade?,"I (22F) moved back home to live with my parents two years ago. My family has always been very close, and my parents actually initiated my moving in so I could focus on building my savings. 

Everything’s been great: the house is huge, so no one’s living on top of each other, and my mom has been ecstatic over all her kids being home. I take care of my space as well as shared spaces, doing chores, etc. They’ve refused any rent or grocery money I’ve ever offered, insisting I save most of the money I make. My mom grocery shops for the house, and always asks each family member what they need from the store for the week. I always ask for a 12 pack of canned lemonade. They’re my weak spot, I have one or two a day. My mom has never had a problem getting it for me before.

Recently though, she’s been resistant. Thinking it was about the money, I offered to give her the $5, and when that didn’t help I just started getting it myself, but she still glares at me when I drink it. I’ve kept asking what the issue is, but she just walks away and the next time I see her she’s changed the subject entirely. Things came to a head yesterday when I came home from work with some of my personal groceries, including lemonade. My mom lost it, crying and carrying on about how I don’t care about how anyone else feels. I’m at a COMPLETE loss, trying to calm her down, when she tells me if I’m going to continue with these habits I won’t do it under her roof. 

Hearing that, I admit I did snap a bit. I was hurt that she would threaten to kick me out for any reason, considering how close we’ve always been, but especially since I don’t think I’ve done anything even remotely wrong. We got in a huge back n forth, mainly with me demanding she tell me what’s so wrong with me drinking some damn lemonade and her sneering at me saying “you know!”. I eventually stormed off to my room, feeling torn. My brother came in shortly after to talk. He says he understands completely where I’m coming from, but is suggesting I do what she’s asking and just stop drinking the lemonade. 

I absolutely could, but at this point it’s sort of the principle. I know I’m living with my parents, but I’m an adult and feel I should be allowed to drink my preferred beverage whenever I please, especially if I’m now paying for it and going out to purchase it myself. It is just lemonade, but it goes both ways; my mom shouldn’t care about it either, because it’s JUST LEMONADE. If she’s insisting I stop drinking it or else I’m getting kicked out, I kinda want to take the initiative and just leave. I have plenty saved at this point. I feel bad because she’s my mom, she’s been so good to me and has given me the chance to gather the savings I now want to use to get away from her. I also feel bad for yelling at her; me getting worked up didn’t help the situation.

166rclm,WIBTA for not attending dinners at my inlaws house while pregnant?,"I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes.  Pre-preganancy, we would go to my inlaws house every month or so. Just the 4 of us, so not large family gatherings.

When I was diagnosed my hubby told tell his mom so that she was aware and to ask if we should bring something for me to eat and to let her know that we were doing our best to not have sweets around to reduce temptation. She insisted that she would provide all the food and that there would be lots of options for me.

Problem was my MIL served food that i couldn't eat. I had a small tossed salad and a side of veggies. She also served a dessert of fresh strawberries which she macerated with sugar covered with whip cream and an apple pie with ice cream.

After the visit I cried during the whole drive home. I was hungry, upset and hormonal.  My hubby spoke with his mom, but she thought it was reasonable for me to eat what i could from what was served. She didn't seem to understand why everyone else needed to refrain just because of me. 

I skipped the next dinner saying I wasn't feeling well, but I've decided that I won't attend any more dinners until I give birth.  My inlaws can come to our house so that I can control the food served.  My hubby knows how important this is for the health of our baby, but he's concerned about my MIL making things very difficult.  He's asking me to consider letting my MIL host us but we just bring some food.  Eliminating sugar is very difficult for me, so I prefer to not be around such temptation.  I wouldn't take such a hard stance, but she doesn't seem to think gestational diabetes is something serious and has even said I need to think moderation.  The complications for baby can be very severe and I want to be careful.

15u37kh,AITA for maybe being insensitive to my friend’s miscarriage?,"To preface, I am almost 27 weeks pregnant with my first and have suffered 2 miscarriages in the last 2 years. I totally understand the emotional pain and all the other feelings that come with a miscarriage.

There is a women, Anna, at our “sister office” (think same company, different buildings doing different things) who had the same due date as me. We really bonded over that, but sadly she miscarried at 12 weeks. It was her first pregnancy, first miscarriage.

When I discovered she miscarried from a social media post, I sent her a simple message telling her my heart is with her and she’s in my prayers. She responded with “Thank you ♥️” and we haven’t talked since. I also hid my Instagram posts and stories from her just so she wouldn’t be triggered by anything baby related that I would post (not blocked, she could still see them if she manually visited my profile, but they won’t pop up while she’s casually scrolling). It’s been about 3 1/2 months since then.

Well, another friend at this same office, Sarah, had a miscarriage 2 weeks ago. She sent me a message a week ago asking for my advice knowing I’ve had two. She wanted to know the details and my experience with them. In this conversation, she mentioned how her office, the office Anna is a part of, is throwing her a bridal shower soon and that she would love for me to come.

The bridal shower was today, and I went. As a buffet lunch was served, Anna and I walked past each other and made eye contact. I smiled and said hi and that her new haircut was super cute. She said thank you, put her food down on the table and went to the bathroom. She was in there for 20 minutes and came out crying with other women (and mutual friends) surrounding her and consoling her. 

One person who happens to be Anna’s sister came up to me and told me it wasn’t very “girl-code” of me to show up with my “belly” and that I don’t understand how she feels and how hurtful I’m being. All I could say was “I’m so sorry.” 

Sarah didn’t let any of this bother her or interrupt the party which I am very glad for her sake, since it was her bridal shower.

I stayed for the rest of the party and had a few people come up to me and tell me not to feel bad. Someone asked me if I knew about Anna’s miscarriage, I said yes and they responded with “Interesting.” I stayed after it was over talking with Sarah about our miscarriage experiences.

But I feel awful and so guilty. I regret going, and i hate how i made Anna uncomfortable and cry. I don’t know if Anna knows I’ve had two miscarriages, not that that would help.

I’m in such a funk now and don’t know what to do or how to feel. AITA?",blacktwosugarsplease,1129,0.9599999785423279,366,1692314345,2023-08-17 18:19:05,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15u37kh/aita_for_maybe_being_insensitive_to_my_friends/,8,2023
15qdiw2,AITA for telling my boyfriend he couldn’t beat a professional athlete in a cage fight?,"I think this is so beyond ridiculous, but my boyfriend is pissed off and I need some neutral opinions.  
My boyfriend of almost a year (24m) was staying at my (22f) house last night after going out with his friends, and was a bit tipsy. We were having a conversation about a tennis tournament (I’m a huge tennis fan), and he randomly asked me if I thought he could beat Rafael Nadal in a cage fight.   
I honestly thought he was joking, laughed, and said no. I thought he was messing around, like those surveys that say 20% of Americans think they can fight a bear or something. My boyfriend’s a strong guy and goes to the gym regularly, but Nadal’s one of the greatest athletes of all time and is obviously going to be ridiculously fit, even if he’s a bit older now.  
My boyfriend took HUGE offence to this. He said I was undermining him as a man by saying a 30-something year old could beat him in a fight, and it’s like if he told me another girl was prettier than me. I clarified that I think my boyfriend is a strong, handsome, guy and is very very fit, but I don’t think he could beat a professional tennis player in a cage fight, just like I don’t think I look like a professional model. This discussion went on for 5 minutes until I realised he wasn’t joking, and I just told him that I thought he would win the fight to put an end to it.  
We watched a movie and I thought he had forgotten about, it , but then he went to sleep in the living room, refused to speak to me, and was still pissed in the morning after he sobered up. He told me I was an asshole, rude, and he needed time to himself, then just left after eating breakfast. He hasn’t responded to my texts since other than yes or no answers, and to tell me that I need to ""seriously reconsider how I spoke to him.""  
This just seems blown well out of proportion and we’ve never had an argument like this before. Is there some dating rule about this that I’ve never heard of??

15mv2dm,"AITA (25f) for telling my sister (29f) that if she wants to come visit me, her children need to follow my rules?","So this is an ongoing problem for the last couple years. My sister has two kids, and she likes to come visit and basically use my house as a hotel so she can take her kids to various theme parks in San Diego. I'm fine with that for the most part.

My problem is that my sister has very different parenting ideas than I would like in my home. She isn't big on discipline, and has gotten upset with me when I tell her kids to stop doing things. For example, I have glass doors in my house going into the laundry room, and on one visit, my nephew (then 6m, now 7m) was slamming the glass doors as hard as he could, and I was worried they would break. I admittedly freaked out a little and snapped at him not to play with the doors, and my sister got upset and told me he was fine. 

Her kids were better behaved when they came to visit last week, but her son has one habit that annoys me. Her son (who btw is not neurodivergent, they've taken him to multiple doctors and been told he is neurotypical) refuses to eat multiple things on the same plate. For example, say we made spaghetti, and had a side salad and bread, he would demand a plate for each thing, so three plates. He'd also demand two different forks for the spaghetti and salad, as well as a seperate plate and fork for dessert. I always buy paper and plastic dishes when they visit, and after four days they'd used up all the paper plates because of his little quirk, and so when we were having cheesecake amd he demanded another plate especially for the cake, there wasn't another paper plate for him. Personally I'm uncomfortable with the kids using real dishes, and so I said he'd just have to use one of his other plates, or not have dessert, which made my sister shoot me a dirty look, say it's fine, and go get him a real plate. She said I was the same way when I was his age (I really don't think that is true, at least to this extent).

I do not feel like my sister should be the one making these rules in my home. Yes it's her kid, but I'm the one paying for the food, the dishes, and to live here. 

Aita if I tell my sister I don't want them visiting anymore unless her children follow the rules I set for my home?

Editing to add that the kids use kidware at home as well (everything plastic or paper), so this isn't just a me thing, it's very common in my family. Even my 9yo nephew still uses plastic from my understanding. 

There are other problems I had while they stayed here, but I listed these two because they were the ones that had the most contention between my sister and I. There are other issues involving wasting food, and not helping to clean up their messes before they left.",garlicknots12,1038,0.9399999976158142,513,1691623199,2023-08-09 18:19:59,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mv2dm/aita_25f_for_telling_my_sister_29f_that_if_she/,8,2023
1635kea,AITA for not letting my brother blow out my candles on my birthday,"All throughout my childhood my little brother has always got all of the attention. My mom always called him “her little angel” since he was always her favorite. To get straight to the story, I (15f) haven’t had a birthday party in about 5 years, while my little brother (who’s now 10) has always had one each year. My uncle (we’ll call him bob for privacy reasons) started questioning why my little brother has always had a birthday party and I didn’t, well she wasn’t planning on celebrating my 15th birthday anyway. But when my uncle (bob) started telling the rest of my family rumors started going around and since she didn’t want to sound like a “bad mom” she decided to let me have a birthday party. We were hosting it at a local playground near where I live. 3 of my friends and some of my family was invited and came. All day my brother has made up lies to get attention from people, and when me and my 3 friends were on the swings my mom made me get off so my brother could swing. (There was another set of swings right next to the one I was on) while most my birthday my brother got all the attention, it was finally time to sing and have cake. While everyone was gathering around my brother started crying and screaming because he wasn’t going to be able to blow the candles out, so my mom told me to let him blow the candles out and then she’ll relight them for me to blow out after. I was getting fed up with all this so when everyone was getting to the end of my birthday song I kind of moved my brother away and blew my own candles out. My brother was not happy about that. He started screaming and crying. My mom got really mad at me and she scolded me for not letting my brother blow the candles out. The rest of the family agreed on my part. My aunt and uncle started yelling at my mom for treating my brother way better than me. The rest of the family just started leaving in shame of my mom. After we got home my mom just kind of sat in her room in silence while my brother played his brand new ps5.

15ly0u9,AITA for not inviting my aunt to my wedding?,"


I'm (31F)  getting married in the fall. I had stated from the start that I would strongly prefer if my aunt didn't attend. She has severe developmental delays (she's about the age of a 5 year old inside), gets overwhelmed easily and generally doesn't enjoy crowds. She didn't attend my parents wedding either.. I feel strongly that my wedding will not be a fun time for her, as there will be a lot going on and there won't be any food She enjoys (she likes hot dogs and pepperoni pizza- the food at the wedding is all going to be vegetarian).

I offered to do our own party with her and get all the food she likes, I said she could come to bridal shower if she wanted, the rehearsal dinner, brunch after etc. I feel like those events would still be a lot for her but they're much shorter events. All of these options were rejected. Instead they want her to attend the wedding- with two people they're going to hire to watch her. I said if she needs two people to watch her is this something she's even going to have fun with? They also did not offer to cover the extra people I didn't budget for (my partner and I are paying 100 percent of wedding costs).

When I entertained the idea, I asked what the plan would be because my grandmother(86) and my mother (57) both felt she was incapable of staying the entire event. I got multiple responses to the same question ""she will come for the ceremony and leave"" ""she will come for just dinner"" ""she will come for the ceremony and dinner"" ""she will get her hair done with you (??)"". I tried explaining that coming in the middle of the event (likely during speeches or the first dance) was not okay and I expressed concern that there wouldn't be almost any food She would enjoy (food is a huge factor for keeping her chill)  and she would have to sit around for 2 hours before anything was served that she would enjoy. Knowing her that would make her anxious and uncomfortable. My grandmother yelled at me that she could have cheese and crackers. I tried telling them there's no cheese and crackers on the menu.

With all of the above I made the hard decision to just say ""no"".  Since then my mother has called my partner and his mother to try and convince them that we needed to let her come. When this didn't work, they started saying that my partner had told my aunt she could come and how dare he lie to her (this didn't happen). My grandmother then also proceeded to tell my future MIL that my partner was a huge jerk for lying. My mother has also accused me of making my grandmother ill over this. Now I'm being told my mother too is sick over this too.

Well tldr my family minus my sister and another aunt think I'm a huge asshole. My grandmother declined my wedding invitation after attending my bridal shower and not acknowledging me.

15l08qx,"AITA for posting ""receipts"" of my psychologically abusive bf on my social media?","My (38f) bf (39M) of almost 4 years is constantly psychologically/mentally/emotionally abusive to me and has become even more so after I was diagnosed with cancer in 2021. Since then he has mocked my illness (yeah, CANCER), gaslit me, manipulated me, called me every name in the book, called me drug abuser-related slurs because I am on pain medication, etc. I reached out to family and friends, and they all dismissed me, citing what a charming, charismatic person he is. So, after dealing with it for 2 years while going through and recovering from DA-REPOCH inpatient chemo, not being able to leave due to my illness and lack of funding or support, I finally broke and started posting his abusive texts and audio recordings from our security cameras on my social media stories. Since then, I've received a number of messages that are basically like, ""How dare you embarrass him like that?"", and ""You're acting so childish."" So, AITA? Or is he TAH that got what he deserved?

  
Now we're both about to be evicted and I have nowhere to go (still), I'm still unable to work, and I have no idea what to do. I already filed for Social Security Disability as Unemployment and State Disability have both been exhausted, but that could take months, if not years. The reason we're being evicted in the first place is that instead of paying the rent, he decided to pour money into his project car for the past 3 months because he ""deserved it"". Then when I was sick and asked him to reply to the eviction summons within 5 days, he didn't so the court entered an automatic ruling in favor of the landlord. Now I'm just waiting for that 5-day notice from the sheriff. Ugh god please help me.

15uziv4,AITA for wanting my mom to stop touching me?,"So I (19M) am very much the type of person who isn't a fan of physical contact, and basically everyone in my family knows this. However, once I started growing out my hair when I turned 17 my mom started touching it out of nowhere with no permission or warning, and I've told her on countless occasions to stop, and admittedly after awhile I stopped being nice about it. I asked her if she'd do this to a stranger at the store and She says it's fine because ""we're family""

And it doesn't stop at my hair, if it's super hot out and I don't wear a shirt she'll without warning look for stuff on my back such as blackheads or zits to pick at. I told her she has a problem and she said ""No I don't, lots of people do this"" to which I just got fed up and replied ""you're literally touching me without consent, and I think you know what other types of people do that"" she went silent for a second then just said ""that's different""

It's at the point I can't take my pills in the morning (I have Epilepsy) without either waking up before her super early, or physically pushing her away and telling her to stop so I can take my damn medicine, which my older brother gets upset at me for doing whenever he witnesses it. My family tells me it's not a big a deal and I overreact, but I stated I'm literally being touched without consent and they know I don't like being touched in general. Is this really not a big deal?

15zjgi2,"AITA for convincing my husband not to go to his ""best friends"" wedding?","For a little bit of background; my husband's best friend never liked me since I had a ""tiff"" with his ex girlfriend. I had made a post on Facebook that I was looking for donations to help a friend get on her feet after escaping from a very abusive relationship. She felt the need to comment something negative about me ""asking for handouts"". 

Fast forward to when he had a new girlfriend. After I helped that friend through her hardship and breakup... I decided every Christmas season I was going to pick a friend and do a ""cheer"" hamper for them. So I would post online again. I did this for like three years in a row before my hubby's friend got the new girlfriend. We got acquainted.

She saw my Facebook post and did the SAME THING his ex did! But she got worse. She went to every possible Facebook group she could...just to blast me. Where she got completely roasted because people thought I was doing a beautiful thing. My husband's friend completely blew up at him and told him that he and his girlfriend refused to come to our wedding because he could not support such a person like me. ( of course he called me every name in the book) 
He then tells my husband "" her or me, because I'm not going to be your friend anymore.""

Fast forward a year later. We are happily married, etc. His friend literally didn't talk to him for that entire year, ghosted him even. He then messages him late November and invites him to his wedding. My hubby and I assumed it was both of us as an invite. so i got him to ask about plus ones. He said we are doing plus ones but your wife cannot come! 
I said.."".if you go to that wedding you are disrespecting me, our entire marriage and even yourself for how he treated you. He refused to come to our wedding and completely dissed our marriage and was vocal about the refusal of support if it were me you were marrying. It would be like a slap to the face if you go. I dont think you should. "" 

The dude also invited him unofficially on facebook like two weeks before the wedding. My husband took a little bit to decide. But went with what I told him. And didn't go. 
For the record; i wouldnt have wanted him to go/ us to go even if i was allowed. To go...and feel hated by the bride and groom. Weird. Awkward.

I feel guilty because even my hubby's mom and brother went to the wedding, and didn't understand why he didn't go, and of course i got blamed and told i was controlling when all i feel i did was give my husband insight to feelings that were already there...AITA?",x-Sevenie-x,736,0.8700000047683716,186,1692830729,2023-08-23 17:45:29,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zjgi2/aita_for_convincing_my_husband_not_to_go_to_his/,8,2023
