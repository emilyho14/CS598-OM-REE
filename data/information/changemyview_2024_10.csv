1fzi81j,CMV: All transportation should be free out of evacuation zones. ,"Currently there is a massive problem with price gouging by airlines (supposedly now capped...) and it made me think...

If you are under a mandatory evacuation, you should not have to pay to evacuate. You are already likely going to lose your home. You may have no work to return to. You are limited in the possessions you can bring. And now you must also spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars just to leave? 

If an area falls under a mandatory evacuation and you live in that area, the government should be funding all of that. That should be part of FEMA to ensure everyone who has to evacuate doesn't need to worry about how. It would be easier and avoid fraud as well if we just did this up front instead of reimbursing people later. 

You tell the airlines ""there's a major hurricane how many people can you transport out of the area within X time"". Figure out how much it would cost. Create the guidelines for that many people. Do the same with trains and busses. If people are driving out (which should be a last resort because the more people who drive the more people who get trapped) the gas should be freely available. 

Any amount of ""fraud"" in a situation like this would be minimal. People will either pay to travel back or call it lost and stay put or travel somewhere else. You can coordinate with multiple airports/train/bus stations so that people get out of the hurricane zone to designated spots and they can either stay there or they can pay to travel somewhere else.

But they shouldn't have to worry about if they can afford to get out of the initial area. ",adhesivepants,5963,0.9300000071525574,610,1728444000,2024-10-08 22:20:00,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fzi81j/cmv_all_transportation_should_be_free_out_of/,10,2024
1fz8a7x,"CMV: Western right wingers and islamists would get along great, if it wasn't for ethnic and religious hatred.","They both tend to believe:

* That women should be subservient to men and can't be left to their own devices
* In strict gender roles that everyone must adhere to, or else
* That queer people are the scum of the earth
* That children should have an authoritarian upbringing
* In corporal and capital punishment
* That jews are evil

Because of this, I think the pretty much only reason why we don't see large numbers of radicalized muslim immigrants at, for example, MAGA rallies in the US, or at AfD rallies in Germany, is that western right wingers tend to view everyone from the Middle East and Central Asia as a barabaric idiot with terroristic aspirations, and islamists tend to view everyone who isn't a Muslim as an untrustworthy, degenerate heathen.",Fraeddi,4573,0.7200000286102295,1621,1728415606,2024-10-08 14:26:46,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fz8a7x/cmv_western_right_wingers_and_islamists_would_get/,10,2024
1fxdrrv,CMV: Elon Musk speaking at a Trump Rally in PA is the greatest gift you could possibly give to the Democratic Party. ,"As the title states. 

Just finished watching the Trump rally in Butler PA… and I am astounded by how out of touch and disconnected it was. 

Obviously, Elon Musk speaking at the event is going to be taking up most of the headlines covering this event. If I were a member of Kamala Harris’ team however, I would be ecstatic about this. 

A major narrative that her team has been trying to create is that a Trump presidency would mean more tax cuts and deferential policy directed towards the wealthiest members of society, all at the expense of everyday, working people. 

Based on this fact, it seems really counter-intuitive for the Trump campaign to openly play into this obvious talking point that the Harris team has created. Musk has been outspoken about his support on Twitter… but speaking at a Trump campaign rally is a MASSIVE change. 

What would be the rationalization to justify making this decision, which I view to be a complete mistake… Obviously Musk didn’t just show up, this was a coordinated campaign event. Seems really strange for both Musk (who’s car business has always been heavily dependent on Democratic support for electric vehicles) and Trump to make this decision so close to the election.

1g8zgxy,CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal.,"I am not a conservative or a Trump supporter, I am simply tired of liberals now being seen as some kinf of ultimate good compared to the devils on the conservative side.

Malcolm x said that the White American who identifies as a liberal is the most ‘dangerous’ and ‘deceitful’ thing in the Western Hemisphere. He said that the issues concerning black Americans were raised by white liberals as part of a vicious power politics to get back at the white conservatives. In his own words, the liberals do so in order to gain power or retain power. 

This is fully seen in how the liberal of today talks about social justice and moral issues especially on Reddit. Issues that would traditionally be seen as important to liberals causes that affect minorities, and other contentious issues are thrown out the window as soon as it seems it may hurt the chances of a Democrat winning the election.

Malcolm said that conservatives are like wolves who make their intention to destroy you plain and compared liberals to foxes that hide their hand and plot when attempting to eat you. Many liberals on Reddit say things like if you even question Whether the democratic option is a good choice or matches your policies than you are aligned with fascism or don’t care about women/whichever other vulnerable demographic they can use as a card. This is manipulative and is reflective of Malcolm’s argument.

“The American negro is nothing but a political football and the white liberals control this ball. Through tricks, tokenism, and false promises of integration and civil rights…,” he remarked. Although he is talking about black people it applies to women, LGBTQ people, and more recently Arab communities. When it’s in fashion and low stakes, then it’s okay to criticize Israel for their crimes but when it’s election time we have to ignore all of their faults and behave as their #1 supporter.

This is the same behavior that Susan b Anthony behaved in when she joined white conservatives to lift up women at the cost of the allyship with enslaved people and abolitionists.",Expert-Diver7144,2485,0.7200000286102295,1582,1729541461,2024-10-21 15:11:01,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g8zgxy/cmv_malcolm_x_was_correct_about_the_white/,10,2024
1fz67ym,CMV: Haiti is not a failed state but a victim of colonization and revenge,"With the recent tragedies going on in Haiti due to gang violence and the assassination of the i president many people on this site have referred to the country as a failed nation and asked what could’ve happened to bring them to this state. I think this is an ignorant position that makes light of history.

Haiti was a slave nation where people who were stolen from Africa were traded and made to work under threat of violence rape castration lynching and murder. When they orchestrated one of the first major successful slave rebellion, pushing back the French, and allowing for the Louisiana purchase to occur they were not only not welcomed into the rest of the world but brutally punished and forced to pay back “reparations” to the French. 

The enslaved people of Haiti were forced to pay money to the people who killed, raped, and enslaved them and this debt was not paid off for 122 years. Under threat of warship they were told to pay back more than 10x the cost of the Louisiana purchase. The equivalent of 20-30 billion dollars.

Thomas jefferson worked to isolate Haiti diplomatically and strangle it economically, fearing that the success of Haiti would inspire slave revolts back home. Haitian success was perceived as a threat to slavery in America for decades, and the United States didn't officially recognize Haiti until 1862, as slavery began being abolished.

The United States  worked to isolate a newly independent Haiti during the early 19th century and violently occupied the island nation for 19 years in the early 20th century. While the U.S. officially left Haiti in 1934, it continued to control Haiti's public finances until 1947, siphoning away around 40% of Haiti's national income to service debt repayments to the U.S. and France.

This means that while other countries were taking advantage of the various and exponentially quick technological revolutions, Haiti was trying to pay its way out of a fictional and racist debt “owed” to slave holders at gunpoint. 

If you add on the effects of natural disasters and the earthquake as well as the fact their president was murdered by foreign mercenaries. It makes sense that they would be in this position, and they deserve empathy not the designation of a failed state.

1gehf05,CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries,"Before saying anything else, I'm going to tell you that most of my viewpoints are based on empirical evidence that I and those around me have collected over the past years and not on looking deeper into muslim culture and reading the Qu'ran, which I'm planing to do at a later point.

I live in Germany, in a city that has both a very large support for homosexuality and the lgbtq community, as well as a large amount of muslims. An overwhelmingly large amount of the muslims I met in my life have increadibly aggressive views on especially the lbtq-community and jewish people, constantly using their religion as reasoning for their hatred. I know that this problem isn't exclusive to Islam, but christians tend to have a much less aggressive approach to these topics because of principles like charity and taking a hit to the other cheek. Muslims on the other hand oftenly take a much more aggressive approach, presumably because of their principles of an eye for an eye and the high importance of the jihad. 

Furthermore, people from muslim countries tend to be harder to immigrate than almost all other cultures, because of their (depending on the school) strict religious legislation on the behavior of women, going as far as women not being allowed to talk to any people outside, leading to generations of people not even learning our language and never socialising with the native germans at all, in spite of many (free) possibilities to do so. Many also oppose the legitimacy of a secular state and even oppose democracy in general, because it doesn't follow the ruling of their religion, which emphasizes that only muslim scholars should rule the state. 

While I tried to stay open to most cultures throughout my life, I feel like muslims especially attempt to never comprimise with other cultures and political systems. Not based on statistics, but simply my own experience in clubs and bars in cologne (the city I live in), the vast majority of fights I've seen happen, have been started by turkish or arab people. I've seen lots of domestic violence in muslim families too and parents straight up abondening and abusing their children if they turned out to be homosexual or didn't follow religious rulings.

I know that this problem isn't exclusive to Islam, but barely any other culture is so fierce about their views. I'm having a hard time accepting and not opposing them on that premise.

Nonetheless, I feel like generalization is rarely a good view to have, so I hope some of you can give me some insight. Is it really the culture, or did I just meet the wrong people?",RetepExplainsJokes,1890,0.75,800,1730160592,2024-10-28 19:09:52,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gehf05/cmv_muslims_and_the_quran_itself_have_too_many/,10,2024
1g016fw,CMV: Being pro-Palestine is not antisemitic,"I suppose most of this line of thinking is caused by the people who want to erase Israel from the map entirely along with its Jewish inhabitants which is as antisemitic as it gets, so to clear up, I mean pro-Palestine as in: against having innocent Palestinians barely surviving in apartheid conditions and horrified by 40 000 people (and other 100 000 injured) being killed and it being justified by many / most of the world as rightful protection of the state. I am not pro-Hamas, I can understand a degree of frustration from being in a blockade for years, but what happened on October 7 was no doubt inhumane... but even calling what's been happening over the past year a war feels for how one-sided is the conflict really feels laughable (as shown by the death toll).  
  
I browsed the Jewish community briefly to try to see another point of view but I didn't expect to see the majority of posts just talking about how every pro-Palestinian is uneducated, stupid, suspectible to propaganda and antisemitic. Without explaining why that would be, it either felt like a) everyone in the community was on the same wave-length so there was no need to explain or b) they just said that to hate on anyone who didn't share their values. As an outsider, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that it's possible that I hold my current views because I'm ""uneducated"", I have admittedly spent only a relatively short amount of time trying to understand the conflict and I'm not very good with keeping historical facts without having them written somewhere... but again, I reserve my right to identify what goes against basic human principles because it shouldn't ever be gatekept, so I doubt any amount of information would be able to make me switch 180 degrees suddenly, but there is room for some nuance. 

Anyway, I'm assuming the basic gist is: being pro-Palestine > being anti-Israel > being anti-Zionist > being antisemitic (as most Jews are in fact Zionists). I find this assessment to having made a lapse of judgement somewhere along the way. Similarly to how I'm pro-Palestinian civilians trapped in Gaza, I'm not anti-Israel / Jewish people, I am against (at least morally, as I'm not a part of the conflict) what the Israel government is doing and against people who agree with their actions. I'm sorry that Jewish people have to expect antisemitism coming from any corner nowadays, as someone who is a part of another marginalized community I know the feeling well, but assuming everyone wants me dead just fuels the ""us vs them"" mentality.

1fz6425,CMV: Presidential Debates should have LIVE Fact Checking,"I think that truth has played a significant role in the current political climate, especially with the amount of 'fake news' and lies entering the media sphere. Last month, I watched President Trump and Vice President Harris debate and was shocked at the comments made by the former president.

For example, I knew that there were no states allowing for termination of pregnancies after 9 months, and that there were no Haitian Immigrants eating dogs in Springfield Ohio, but the fact that it was it was presented and has since claimed so much attention is scary. The moderators thankfully stepped in and fact checked these claims, but they were out there doing damage.

In the most recent VP Debate between Walz and Vance, no fact checking was a requirement made by the republican party, and Vance even jumped on the moderators for fact checking his claims, which begs the question, would having LIVE fact checking of our presidential debates be such a bad thing? Wouldn't it be better to make sure that wild claims made on the campaign trail not hold the value as facts in these debates?

I am looking for the pros/cons of requiring the moderators to maintain a sense of honesty among our political candidates(As far as that is possible lol), and fact check their claims to provide viewers with an informative understanding of their choices.

I will update the question to try and answer any clarification required.

1gdi4gm,CMV: Allowing children to become morbidly obese is child abuse. ,"As the title states, parents that allow their children to become morbidly obese are abusing them and should be treated as abusive parents. That includes CPS involvement and possibly loss of custody. 

In regards to the type of abuse, I believe that allowing a child to be some obese falls under “neglect.” Neglect occurs when a person responsible for the care of another person does not provide needed care or leaves them without care. In this instance, the parents are not providing the needed care, which I believe is a healthy diet/exercise regiment needed to maintain a healthy weight. 


While I think that enabling obesity could also be categorized as physical abuse because it causes bodily injures, I think that this falls short of the definition of physical abuse because there is a lack of direct physical contact by the abuser. With that said, I am open to a different opinion on this point as it could be argued that the physical symptoms of allowing a child to become obese is still physical abuse even if the abuser doesn’t inflict the injury with direct bodily contact. 

So how should this abuse be addressed by officials? First, CPS should be involved and allowed to investigate the reasons behind a child’s morbid obesity. If it does result from neglect, then the parents should have to work with professionals to address the issue. The cost of this care would be dependent upon the families financial situation. Failure to do so, and or failure to improve the child’s weight would result in a loss of custody. 

Maybe this is just crazy? Change my view.

1g5ebf6,CMV: States shouldn’t simultaneously have no-knock warrants and a castle doctrine,"No-knock warrants allow law enforcement to enter a property without prior notification (knocking or announcing their presence).

Castle doctrine laws give individuals the right to use force, including deadly force, to defend themselves in their home without the duty to retreat.

Many states have some nuance with these laws but a lot of states have an overlap where they allow both of these to simultaneously exist. Texas for example has both.

This post is NOT arguing for one or the other but rather the fact that they both shouldn’t coexist.

If they coexist, it introduces a potential deadly threat to both law enforcement and the person defending their home and bystanders. In a scenario where law-enforcement gets a no-knock warrant and attempts to go through, the person can defend their home to this unknown intruder. This can of course lead to a gun fight.

Maybe this is a popular opinion but the fact that 30+ states have this overlap is mind boggling.",bernful,1333,0.949999988079071,550,1729124755,2024-10-16 19:25:55,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g5ebf6/cmv_states_shouldnt_simultaneously_have_noknock/,10,2024

1gdcgv6,CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round. They are mistaken. ,"Two years ago in the UK, a new front in the culture wars opened up when large posters exclaiming [""Hey straight white men; pass the power!""](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYiLQixX0AEUK03?format=jpg&name=900x900) were spotted in various locations around its cities, as part of a taxpayer funded outdoor arts exhibition ran by an organisation by the name of 'Artichoke' - a vaguely progressive body aimed at making art more accessible to the public at large.

Evidently, the art was designed to generate discussion, and due to its front page news level controversy, on that level at least it was an astounding success: with the intended message clearly being that 'straight white men' have too much power, and they need to hand it over to people who are not 'straight white men', in order to, according to Artichoke's own mission statement at least, ""Change the world for the better"". 

Now this kind of sentiment - that 'straight white men' (however they are defined) are currently in power, and they need to step aside and let 'other people' (again, however they are defined) run the show for a while - is one that seems, to my mind at least, alarmingly common in liberal circles. 

See for example [this article](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/lily-allens-right-white-males-9562356#ICID=sharebar_twitter), which among other things,  claims:

\>""It's white men who run the world. It's white men who prosecute the crimes, hand down the jail sentences, [decide how little to pay female staff,](http://www.mirror.co.uk/money/women-20s-paid-less-men-9560167) and tell the lies that keep everybody else blaming each other for the world's problems""

\>""It's white males, worldwide, who are causing themselves and the rest of the planet the most problems. It was white males over 45 with an income of $100,000 or more who [voted for tiny-fingered Donald Trump to run the free world](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/donald-trump-followed-emergency-kittens-9549099)""

Before finally concluding:

\>""Let me ask you this: if all the statistics show you're running the world, and all the evidence shows you're not running it very well, how long do you think you'll be in the job? If all the white men who aren't sex offenders tried being a little less idiotic, the world would be a much better place"".

And this, at last, brings us to the crux of my issue with such thinking. Because to the kinds of liberals who make these arguments - that it's white men who run the world, and are causing everyone else all the problems - could you please explain to me:

How many straight white men currently sit among the ranks of the Taliban, who don't merely decide ""How little to pay female staff"", but [simply ban them from working entirely,](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-07-07/an-afghan-woman-wanted-to-be-a-doctor-now-she-makes-pickles-as-the-taliban-restricts-womens-roles) among [various](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/26/taliban-bar-on-afghan-women-speaking-in-public-un-afghanistan) [other](https://amu.tv/129066/) [restrictions](https://medicamondiale.org/en/where-we-empower-women/afghanistan) ? 

How many straight white men currently govern countries such as Pakistan, Iran, and Thailand, where the kinds of crimes prosecuted involve [blasphemy (which carries the death penalty), ](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68511557) [not wearing the hijab (which again, basically carries the death penalty)](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/sep/16/iranian-woman-dies-after-being-beaten-by-morality-police-over-hijab-law), and [criticising the monarchy (no death penalty at least, but still 15 years in prison)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/08/thailands-lese-majesty-laws-explained-in-30-seconds#:~:text=Under%20article%20112%20of%20the,majesty%20%E2%80%93%20anywhere%20in%20the%20world) ? 

Or how many straight white men were responsible for ""blaming someone else"" for the problems of any of those [various countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_cleansing_campaigns#2000s) in which acts of ethnic cleansing have taken place, on the orders of governments in which not a straight white man sat? 

Indeed, the article preaches against the thousands of white men who voted for Trump -  ignoring the fact that more [Indians ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_2019_Indian_general_election)voted for Modi's [far right](https://jacobin.com/2024/03/bjp-far-right-modi-india) BJP, than there are white men in America \*at all\*!

Now; again, I must stress. NONE of the above is to say that straight white men have never restricted the rights of women, passed overbearing laws, or persecuted minorities. Of course they have; but surely it is more than enough evidence to show that NONE of those behaviours are exclusive to straight white men, and so simply demanding straight white men step down and ""Pass the power!"" is no guarantee of a progressive utopia-  when so many countries not run by straight white men are \*far\* from such? Moreover; does it not also suggest that ideology is NOT dictated by race, and therefore asserting that we can judge how progressive -or regressive- one's politics are simply by skin tone is ludicrous? 

Indeed, the whole idea that 'straight white men' exisit as a political collective at all seems frankly baffling to me; many liberals ironically seem to know the difference between Bernie Sanders/Jeremy Corbyn and Donald Trump/Boris Johnson (delete as nationally applicable) very well, and if straight white men do act in such a collevtive spirit, as liberals often allege, then how in high heaven did England have a series of [vicious civil wars, driven in part by religious sectarianism,](https://www.britannica.com/event/English-Civil-Wars) at a time when nearly every politician in the country was straight, white and male?!

Indeed; while we're back with the UK - even if all such people did step down, and hand over their power, we would still find a great deal of conservatism in the ranks of our politics; we may even find non white MPs standing up and demanding the [recriminalisation of homosexuality](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law), or even [persecution for apostasy.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34357047) Yes, many ethnic minorities are more likely to vote for ""progressive"" parties (Labour in the UK, the Democrats in the US), but this clearly does not translate to political progressivism on their own individual part. 

Now, a counter argument to my view here may be; ""But are you not cherry-picking the worst examples? Why do you not look at those non-white societies which, presently or historically, have been more progressive?"".

And I concede; ancient India may have been more accepting of homosexuality and gender fluidity than was the norm in (white) Europe - as were several Native American nations. But this too ignores the fact that, as today, non white societies in the past also ran on a spectrum of progressive to conservative: certain Native American societies might well have been gender egalitarian, even matriarchies - but many of the Confucian states in East Asia (particularly China) were perhaps even more patriarchal than was the norm in Europe. Indeed, they were certainly as apt at [warfare](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/atrocity-and-genocide-in-japans-invasion-of-korea-15921598/7EFEAB40BC9D61D2F9E92CF8C506FB70), [genocide, ](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/qing-extermination-of-the-zunghars/6D038CADD0F808459451175C1CAD6DC5)and [ethnic persecution.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/viet-nam-and-the-genocide-of-champa-14701509/6E8490A4C5670883A94DAD24BF5C899A)

All of which is to say, finally reaching my conclusion, in which (I hope!), I have effectively stated my case:

History, foreign politics, and even the attitudes of minorities within 'white' majority countries all suggest that there is no correlation between skin tone and political belief - and it is FAR MORE important to listen to what people actually believe, rather than lazily assume ""Oh, you have X skin tone, therefore you must believe Y, and surrender your power to Z who will make the world a better place than you"". 

Again, the argument I am making here is NOT that there should be \*only\* straight white men in politics, or that non white men are inherently \*worse\* at politics - I am well aware that there are many extremely progressive POC, as there are many extremely progressive white men. 

Rather, I argue exactly the opposite; that liberal identity essentialism is entirely in the wrong, and no one group of people are any inherently more progressive or conservative than any other - thus, simply removing one group from power is no guarantee of achieving progressive causes.

1gac58g,CMV: Censorship within /r/WorldNews is dangerous,"/r/WorldNews is the largest subreddit on reddit, and controlling the narrative with permabans for widely supported views is dangerous and promotes a one sided story. It creates a self perpetuating echo chamber. 

I was permabanned instantly for saying that Israel is enforcing an apartheid. Something many extensive United Nations reports have concluded, along with the top respected humanitarian aid organizations, and the government of the country for whom the word was literally invented, South Africa. 

Being instantly permabanned for just agreeing and sharing a view with these organizations undermines any credibility for the largest subreddit, yet they are the dominant voice for international news on reddit. 

Whether you agree that for example Israel is upholding an apartheid is not the issue, it is the complete lockdown on what is able to be discussed on that subreddit.

1g1hrt5,CMV: Wearing hairstyles from other cultures isn’t cultural appropriation ,"Cultural appropriation: the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society

I think the key word there is *inappropriate*. If someone is mocking or making fun of another culture, that’s cultural appropriation. But I don’t see anything wrong with adopting the practices of another culture because you genuinely enjoy them.

The argument seems to be that, because *X* people were historically oppressed for this hairstyle, you cannot wear it because it’s unfair.

And I completely understand that it IS unfair. I hate that it’s unfair, but it is. However, unfair doesn’t translate to being offensive. 

It’s very materialistic and unhealthy to try and control the actions of other people as a projection of your frustration about a systemic issue. I’m very interested to hear what others have to say, especially people of color and different cultures. I’m very open to change my mind.

1g76j7o,CMV: “From the river to the sea” inherently supports a Palestinian one-state solution,"In Arabic there are THREE versions of the slogan. TWO of which call for the “decolonization” of the Israeli state. These two slogans were infamous during the First Intifada: min il-ṃayye la-l-ṃayye / Falasṭīn ʿarabiyye (من المية للمية / فلسطين عربية, ""from the water to the water / Palestine is Arab"" and min il-ṃayye la-l-ṃayye / Falasṭīn islāmiyye (من المية للمية / فلسطين إسلامية, ""from the water to the water / Palestine is Islamic"")

The THIRD is the one that made it’s way into English, because it rhymes, and because it is the only reasonable one—it doesnt call for the recolonization of a Palestinian state: From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free""—the translation of min an-nahr ʾilā l-baḥr / Filasṭīn sa-tatḥarrar

So there are three slogans used by entirely different demographic geographically, culturally, and ideologically. Israelis are connected to western media, but also the immediate Palestinian sentiments surrounding them. They hear all three of these slogans. This is the true disconnect between all of these peoples.

My problem with this is that it incentivises schools to lie about grades and force students to graduate even if they are not ready simply to avoid state sanctions and possibly takeovers. This means the students themselves care less about their education because there are no consequences for performing poorly or not at all. The teachers will be forced by their admin to give them passing grades so that the school continues to look just good enough to avoid intervention. If students don't care to learn, they never will. There *must* be consequences for the students for performing poorly. I understand the idea that schools should simply do better and teach their students properly to avoid punishment, but it's much easier for them to just lie, and so only the schools who are honest are being punished for actually trying to help while dishonest schools are popping out uneducated children who simply got C's and a diploma so admin could keep their jobs",GoodGorilla4471,745,0.9300000071525574,237,1729174974,2024-10-17 09:22:54,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g5s219/cmv_the_no_child_left_behind_and_every_student/,10,2024
1g0rxgr,"CMV: Iran is not the greatest adversary of the United States, and saying so is a pretty brazen absurdity that demonstrates Israel's outsized influence on the country.","Iran being the ""greatest"" enemy of the United States was a statement Kamala Harris made to the press when asked about who the United States greatest adversary was, for some context, but its a statement that could just as easily of come from a Republican's mouth. 

Russia and China both have stronger militaries and stronger espionage capabilities that are currently in use in the United States. Russia in particular has strong influence over US elections in a way that Iran just doesn't. Russia's attack of Ukraine is also more of an existential threat to the West and the United States alliances and strategic interests, but China's threat to Taiwan is also important, and even a conventional war with China would be disastrous for all parties involved. 

Iran doesn't have these kinds of capabilities, and is in part propped up by Russia, so even if we pretended that the US' most vital interests were in the Middle East (Which they aren't, and both Biden and Obama has wanted to get out of the region and refocus towards Asia), Iran is still largely a Russia proxy, indicating that the real threat is Russia. Iran has less than a fourth of the GDP of Russia and around half the population. Iranian proxies limited to the region, whereas Russia has proxies all around the globe and their influence extends into South America, putting them far more into the US' sphere of influence. What Iran is, is the greatest adversary of Israel, as it and its proxies operates primarily within Israel's sphere of influence while having a solely negative relationship with Israel (Whereas Russia, Iran's backer, has a more complicated relationship with Israel where they are not adversaries).

Naming Iran as the US greatest adversary is a conflation of the US interests with the interests of Israel.

1ftufds,"CMV: CMV: Within legally recognized marriages, adultery should have clear, civil legal consequences, unless expressly agreed between spouses.","The legal concept of marriage, where spouses act as partners, is almost always built on mutual trust that certain aspects of the relationship, such as sex, are to be exclusive to the relationship unless agreed upon otherwise. Legally and financially rewarding spouses for betraying the trust of their spouse by allowing a cheating spouse to come out ahead in divorce undermines one of the key relationship dynamics in our society.

For the vast majority of people, entering into marriage is an explicit agreement that unless divorced or otherwise agreed upon, the people in the marriage will not have sex with or develop romantic relationships with other people. This should apply evenly to all genders, and if you view this as benefitting one over the other, it says a lot about your view on who may or may not be more likely to cheat.

Before I'm accused of being some kind of conservative or traditionalist: I have zero issue with any form of LGBTQ+ relationship or poly setup. I'm speaking strictly to traditional, legally recognized, monogamous marriages, which comprise the bulk of those in our society. I'm also not religious or socially conservative.

Heading off a few arguments:

1. ""The government shouldn't be involved in marriage""

Too late for that. Marriage is a legally binding agreement that affects debt, assets, legal liability, taxes, homebuying, and other fundamental aspects of our lives. The end of marriage has profound, legally enforceable consequences on both parties. It is also included in a pre-existing legal doctrine of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation\_of\_affections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation_of_affections).

2) ""But what if the spouses want to open their marriage?""

Totally fine. My post is in reference to the most common form of marriage, which is monogamous.

3) ""Adultery doesn't have a clear definition""

It does. ""voluntary sexual [intercourse](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=05826a3c56c67289&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1127US1127&q=intercourse&si=ACC90nwZrNcJVJVL0KSmGGq5Ka2Y_LZNCuz-rXf3RWbWGZD0YFuvQ0gck8iv_I-vXEsPMmDpeldPlTyUN0FJ6k9nx2_KAjj_QmEabPxsAQcdvs4E9R8NkyU%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_k-r92u2IAxVAMdAFHaqNGncQyecJegQIOhAO) between a married person and a person who is not his or her spouse."" ""Sexual intercourse"" would include all the commonly recognized forms of sex. This would have to be proven via the typical preponderance standard, which is greater than 50% odds, via typical evidence used to evidence behaviors - depositions/testimony under oath, any written or photographic evidence, circumstantial evidence, etc.

4) ""What should the legal consequences be?""

At the very least, immediate forfeiture of any rights to alimony or spousal support. Shifts in the default assumption of a 50/50 split of marital assets are another route to explore. Certainly not enough to leave anyone destitute, though.

5) ""What about children?""

Child support is a separate issue, as it affects the child, who has no say in one of their parents cheating on the other.",insect_ligaments,654,0.6800000071525574,1145,1727805246,2024-10-01 12:54:06,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ftufds/cmv_cmv_within_legally_recognized_marriages/,10,2024

1fzrumy,CMV: The UN resolution calling for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories in 12 months shows the UN has no real interest in peace,"Just to preface: I'm an Israeli, I fully believe that a two state solution is the only way for peace and that eventually Israel will have to withdraw from the west bank.

Last month the UN general assembly passed a resolution calling for the complete withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories in 12 months, among other things. This is obviously completely impossible for 2 main reasons -

1. Currently there are around 700K Israelis living in the west bank and transfering all of them out of there in a year is simply not doable. It's not like Israel has cities, houses and jobs ready to accommodate these people. The toll such a massive transfer of civilians would take on the economy and probably military is just too high for such a move to be realistic.

2. Israel cannot withdraw from the west bank before it is stable enough to not be threat to Israeli security. Pulling the army out of the west bank would leave Israel's heartland completely exposed to attacks from militants within the territory, something Israel simply can't allow to happen as it would majorly compromise the country's security. This is obviously the main reason why such a hasty, one sided withdrawal is impossible. 

This makes this resolution, in my opinion, detrimental to peace and not the opposite. 

This is because it's a resolution that Israel simply cannot accept. The consequences of this will be that many around the world and in Palestine will have the idea that Israel continuously ignores UN resolutions reinforced and Israel will garner even more hate for it. And in Israel it feeds straight into the ""UN and everyone is anti - semitic and can't be trusted"" narrative, which only strengths and emboldens the nationalists and drives people away from peace. 
I also thinks this leads the the UN becoming less credible as what's it's point if it is pushing out unrealistic resolutions? 

In my opinion if the UN truely cared about achieving peace they would adopt a resolution calling for Israel and the PA to restart earnest talks about adopting a 2 state solution, and the fact they instead adopted this one shows their interest isn't peace, but rather virtue signaling and optics. 

Now I know some might say that the UN general assembly resolutions are non binding and it's more about sending a message and reinforcing international law, but I would still say that sending an unrealistic message is useless and causes more harm than good.

1g9o244,CMV: An abortion ban will only create more human suffering,"Banning abortion is going to create a lot more suffering, especially for kids who end up in foster care. Right now, only about 20% of foster kids ever get adopted, which means the rest are stuck in the system until they either go back to their biological families or age out at 18. For the 20% who age out without a permanent family, life gets really tough. About 50% end up addicted to drugs, and 1 in 5 becomes homeless. For the boys, more than half end up in jail, and for the girls, about 70% are pregnant by age 21.

That’s a huge problem, and banning abortion is only going to flood the foster care system with more kids, which is already struggling to keep up. The system’s broken, and we know that kids who grow up in foster care are way more likely to end up in trouble—about 80% of people in prison spent time in foster care as kids.

So really, banning abortion isn’t just about babies being born—it’s about putting more kids into a system that can’t handle them and setting them up for a hard life.

There's already an expectation to tip plastic surgeons. These large tips on expensive procedures being tax free will just continue us down the rabbit hole

This just perpetuates the cycle of businesses relying on the government instead of actually providing for their employees.

1g5y5nf,CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters ,"I was inspired to write this by an exchange I had regarding this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/s/E2Mj2dgkA8. As you can see the OP made a big hit. Over 1000 upvotes at the time I write this.

But take a second to consider the implications of that meme: it suggests that there are only two groups that exist in the American electorate —people who have decided to vote for Harris, and MAGA authoritarians. That’s it.

Now, I realize this was just a silly bit of fun, but I raised a question to other users on that heavily Democratic-leaning sub: is it wise to shame and ridicule people who still might vote for Kamala, especially considering that the election will almost certainly be decided by a extremely narrow segment  of the electorate? Does it make sense to mock undecided voters under these circumstances?

My concerns were met with scorn.

“I’m tired of swing voters! If they can’t figure out who to vote for, they should just stay home!”, said one.

“Swing voters don’t actually exist. They know they’re going to vote for Trump and just pretend to be undecided for attention.”, claimed another.

“I would hate to deny a person their right to vote but if a person can’t figure out why voting for Trump is bad…”

I am paraphrasing here, but only a little. What’s worse, I hear similar ideas from my progressive friends and I believe these opinions are common in left-of-center circles.

For example there was a post not too long ago right here on this sub where the OP expressed concern that Harris was not getting enough support from labor unions. I commented that the Democrats are increasingly becoming the party of the university educated managerial class and that they are losing wage earning workers in the process and I suggested that this was lamentable. Lots of people responded that the working class is mostly composed of bigots anyway so progressives shouldn’t seek their votes at all.

Now, that point of view is totally unhinged for a variety of reasons but I do want to say that I get why people are frustrated with swing voters.

Like, how can you be “not sure” about voting for or against a convicted criminal with authoritarian tendencies who endorses dictators and threatens civil rights? What kind of person would struggle with that decision?

But getting impatient is still not the appropriate response because despite what some Reddit users may believe swing voters are real.

There are people who voted for Obama, then Trump and then Biden and who have not made their mind yet about the 2024 election at this time. The key point for me is no matter how exasperating this kind of behavior might be, we need to try to coax these people to vote for our candidate and cannot afford to scoff at them publicly.

Statistically, swing voters are less educated and less politically engaged than hardcore supporters of either party, but they will decide the election. If a person does not want another Trump presidency, it is necessary to appeal to undecided voters. There simply aren’t enough Subaru Outback-driving, NPR-listening progressives (describing myself here) in the country—or in swing states—to carry the day for Kamala alone.

And like it or not, fair or not, there does exist a perception that Democrats are elitist college students and professors with nothing but sneering contempt for those without higher education. We can count on Trump and the Republicans to exploit that feeling to their advantage.

Making posts like the I referenced above exacerbates the problem. Even if it is at a micro level, the sentiment that undecided voters are stupid is widely spread and widely disseminated in progressive circles. And perception and feelings are more important than policy or facts right now, particularly for those “low information” voters who are going to decide whether or not Trump goes back to the Oval Office.

Under these conditions, I think a little tolerance and goodwill toward undecided voters makes strategic sense right now and I’m speaking to all of us who plan to vote for Kamala Harris.

Or maybe I’m wrong. Does it make sense to be openly scornful of swing voters right now?

I just want to say off the bat. Responses that say something to effect of, “What the Republicans do is even worse!” will not change my view. I don’t want the GOP to win so if they shoot themselves in the foot, I’m happy.

And if you do support Trump, I’m glad for you. I don’t. We can discuss him somewhere else.",BluePillUprising,568,0.7099999785423279,1010,1729190685,2024-10-17 13:44:45,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g5y5nf/cmv_it_is_unwise_for_supporters_of_kamala_harris/,10,2024
1gf1rtc,CMV: Being ugly is really detrimental to your life experience ,"I feel like I’m living life as an outcast. I grew up being bullied and picked on and I used to think it was luck that I used to experience it, but it didn’t stop in my adult life, if anything it got worse. I had big teeth that took years to fix, and very bad acne. This was changeable during my early years. But my facial appearance and my height are not.

I notice how people treat me, especially at work in environments full of people against someone who is very physically attractive, and it’s like night and day. 

It’s much harder to form relationships and much harder to get the opposite sex to be attracted to you. I don’t blame women for feeling unattracted to me either, because I would probably feel the same way.

People who say ‘beauty is within the eye of the beholder,’ have never truly experienced life as an unattractive person. Because if you were unattractive, you wouldn’t say this.

I’ve been alone for most of my life, and jobs have been much harder to hold down, friends have been harder to keep. 

It annoys me that we live in a time of promoting obesity on beauty magazines, especially for women, and especially when this is something within someone’s control. Someone’s height and face are not easily changed without plastic surgery which is extremely expensive and not to mention unnatural and sometimes even dangerous.

 I feel like my life experience would never compare to someone who is physically attractive. It feels like life is a chore rather than something to be enjoyed, all because of genetically factors that are completely outside of my control. No matter how much someone tells me ‘I’m blaming women for why they are not attracted to me’ or ‘you need to love yourself first,’ will ever change what it is like to have an unattractive face and to actually have to live with it.

1g6vuts,"CMV: People who require that food be ""authentic"" to its cultural roots in order for it to be considered good are closed minded and have an unearned and illogical sense of superiority over other people's taste in food.","In my view, the only 3 things that truly matter with regards to food (in 99% of cases) are how the food tastes, how much it costs, and its nutritional value. Obvious exceptions to this general rule would be things like false advertising (restaurant advertises itself as ""authentic"" cuisine, but is obviously very far from being authentic to its cultural roots), or cultural events/festivals that are setup with the express purpose of celebrating a specific traditional culture. 

A classic example of my view is the friend or coworker we all seem to have who is 1/4 Italian, but has never been to Italy, and constantly talks about how terrible Olive Garden is because it isn't ""authentic"" Italian cuisine. This type of person is objectively closed minded, because they automatically write off anything that isn't exactly what they consider ""authentic"", no matter how much better the dish actually tastes compared to the authentic dishes they prefer. 

There is nothing about its proximity to traditional Mexican culture that somehow makes a traditional Mexican meal objectively superior to a San Diego-style Mexican dish or a New Mexican-style Mexican dish. 

If the only thing I knew about someone was that they automatically assume authentic traditional cuisine is better than modernized/Americanized/fusion style cuisine, then I believe they have a much higher statistical probability of being closed minded and having other illogical/nonsensical views, and thus I should automatically trust them less than I would trust another stranger who I know nothing about. I should especially trust them less when it comes to their opinions on art, travel, music, philosophy/ethics, and other endeavors where open mindedness is key to enjoyment and appreciation of said endeavor.

1g7c5b3,CMV: Black Lives Matter has been a failure,"Back in the 2010s, and especially in 2020, it seems like the Black Lives Matter was gaining strength. Videos of police brutality, especially against African Americans, became viral, and millions became outraged that this was so common in America. When George Floyd was murdered, millions justifiably took to the streets to protest against police brutality and racism. Politicians came out in support for police reform, and discussions on how to reform policing (from “how to make the police better” to “defund the police”) were all the rage.

But from 2021, it seems like everything took a complete 180. Crime skyrocketed during COVID (in part of police refusing to do their jobs in protest of BLM), causing the average American to support the police a lot more. Pro-police politicians like Eric Adams were elected while pro-BLM politicians like Chelsea Boudin were ousted from their positions.

Now, absolutely nobody talks about police brutality these days, not politicians nor the general public. But has the problem gone away? No! It has only gotten worse! 2023 has seen a record number of killings by police, and I don’t expect that number to go down in the future.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/08/2023-us-police-violence-increase-record-deadliest-year-decade

Unfortunately, rather than being addressed, police brutality has become like gun control. Someone being killed by police, even on live video, no longer elicits outrage. Instead, people will just give “thoughts and prayers,” shrug, and accept it as a fact of American life.

1gepnua,CMV: There is very little evidence that ethnic diversity is actually economically beneficial for a company,"First a disclaimer, I am not against ethnic diversity. I am neutral/slightly positive towards the diversity campaigns for ethical reasons. However, company trainings provide you with information like ""most diverse companies are 40% more likely to outperform compared to least diverse ones"" and I just don't feel that these claims of massive economic benefits actually hold water.

Vast majority of these claims seem to stem from the famous McKinsey diversity reports. However, these reports  are documented to have [issues with reverse causality and they have proven to be very difficult to replicate](https://econjwatch.org/File+download/1296/GreenHandMar2024.pdf?mimetype=pdf).

Scrolling Scopus or Google Scholar actually reveals a lot of fairly recent articles, in more reputable journals than the one linked above, which do not find any correlation whatsoever apart from rather localized areas or find a negative one (examples: [1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292113001670?casa_token=9_YjMecwRV0AAAAA:hBP-bZf8z1T8v4DR_3UOy4Yh9oJuMNfjYovgaWPXHzjEgb09g1Zu0zledGJYYQraWlBpRA0YB1E), [2](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/103/3/521/97644/Ethnic-Diversity-and-Growth-Revisiting-the)).

This is simply not how a consensus in a field looks like. I am a layman, so I am not going to go as far as taking my stance on which side is right. But the evidence about positive economic impact of ethnic diversity seems quite doubtful and highly contested to say the least.

Hence, I find it quite insulting to be fed this on company trainings. Why don't they rather tell me that they want diversity, because they believe it is right? Trying to sell it on a tentative indication that it is good for business looks bad.

1g9zjx6,CMV: Women who require men to pay/support them when dating are inherently going against feminism and equality movement and is extremely harmful to dating culture,"As the title states, I believe women that require the men to pay for them if they want to be in a relationship are inherently against the equal rights movement for women. I want to first clarify what I mean by ""paying for them"". A large notion of dating culture is that men are supposed to pay for dates, rents, bills, and financially support the women in order to be seen as a romantic partner and a real man. This belief directly goes against the idea of equal rights between genders as it infantilizes women. It also feeds into the stigma held by men against all forms of feminism that women only want equal rights when it benefits them as they want to have all the positive aspects of an equal relationship while also having the upside of having your entire life financed by your partner. I also believe that it is hypocritical to believe that you are in an equal relationship if you are being completely supported by your male partner. This belief also severely impacts dating for any men who are not in a financial state to be fully paying for another person. For example any low income groups, college students. It basically makes it seem like you have to be rich enough to ""buy"" a date and a relationship. I have heard the counter argument that feminism is about being able to choose to be in this type of relationship. Before I address this I want to be clear, if you want to be in a trad relationship, go for it, however you both people have to take the traditional roles. However, choosing to be financially supported while being in an equal rights relationship and while having your own career is essentially infantilizing yourself in the relationship. You are basically stating you want a ""father"" not a partner. This is the same version as men who make their partner do all the housework while the wife also has a career. In summary, I believe that women who want to be in a modern and equal relationship while having the men to support you financially are hypocrites. An equal relationship is one that splits finances, housework, and all other aspects of the relationship according to what makes sense to that relationship. This unequal relationship causes a lot of negative effects to overall dating culture",lordamir008,392,0.6800000071525574,669,1729649376,2024-10-22 21:09:36,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g9zjx6/cmv_women_who_require_men_to_paysupport_them_when/,10,2024

1ga8yqr,CMV: MLKs true message has been distorted in American history ,"Martin Luther king jrs true message and struggles have been flanderized into the equivalent of love thy neighbor, nonviolence, and I have a dream. These elements only describe a small part of who he was as a man and why his message still rings true today. 

Although people love to lampoon our modern activists as not being as good as MLK and being disruptive and engaging in criminal activity, this was the bulk of the civil rights movement and particularly MLKs strategy. He was a jailbird who was arrested numerous times and encouraged others to be jailed as well.

He didn’t just wish for the benefit of blacks and whites but for the allyship and solidarity of working class people of all colors as he recognized that we would never be free without being economically free, something that has still not come to pass and perhaps gotten even worse.

Recently protestors on college campuses were criticized for having outside agitators but MLK already spoke against this in the letter to Birmingham. 

“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial ""outside agitator"" idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.”

BLM protestors were criticized for being disruptive and rowdy, saying MLK only protested peacefully, but his protests were considered negatively as well. 

“You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue.”

Malcolm X was criticized for speaking negatively on white liberals but MLK spoke on this as well in the same letter just replacing liberal with moderate.

“I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice”

He was a complex man and detractors against him want to say his message shouldn’t be accepted as he cheated on his wife with white women. These same people refuse to admit that this information was given to us by the corrupt FBI who followed and threatened him for years, tracking his every move and almost every word as if he was a terrorist. They even sent him letters pretending to be black people asking him to kill himself.

He was a believer in shutting down convenience even if he had to shut down a highway. He was an agitator and scholar and not just the I have a dream guy and now every street that bears his name is in the worst part of whichever city it’s in as the governments  honor to him.

1g4khwz,CMV: The Israeli government and army are truly behaving like monsters right now,"Sources from the BBC state that there have been 3 hospitals bombed in the last couple of months, as well as schools being targeted in Gaza. A house has been struck with mainly women and children killed. 

There has even been (yet unverified) reports of a man being burnt alive due to a fire caused by secondary explosions and no evidence of any close by Hamas base. Even doctors without borders has verified this.

In Lebanon, buildings with babies and children are being destroyed and countless innocent lives are lost.

In the guardian, there have been reported of a 'very relaxed' approach to specific targeting - in order to bomb an area with a suspected low level Hamas operative, an exceptionally high level of 'collateral damage' is permitted. This is far different to Israel's previous strategies.

There have been, of course, many terrorists who have been killed. However, I do not believe this justifies the enormous amount of civilian casualties. If anything, this will achieve the opposite of their goals - any Gazan or Lebanese, after seeing their loved ones killed, will be radicalised against Israel even more.

Even the US, Israel's biggest ally, has been alarmed by the amount of aid being restricted in Israel and has even threatened to suspend some arms sales. The situation looks really bad, and it is becoming increasingly harder to be able to even attempt to justify Israels options.

1gangu3,CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party,"The word ""fascism"" gets thrown around as a slur nowadays, but it was a mainstream, popular movement for a good chunk of the last century. 

* Donald Trump's former chief of staff (Mark Kelly), along with the highest-ranked military officer who served under Trump (Mark Milley), have both said on-record that the leader of the Republican party [is a fascist](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/john-kelly-swinging-trump/story?id=115061457).
* A leading historian of fascism, [Robert Paxton](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/magazine/robert-paxton-facism.html) (paywall, sorry), recently adopted this view and said it goes beyond the party's leader: ""It's bubbling up from below in very worrisome ways, and that's very much like the original fascisms. It's the real thing. It really is.""
* Umberto Eco, who lived in fascist Spain, defined ""[Ur-Fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur-Fascism)"" in a 1995 essay as a collection of attributes that pretty much match the modern Republican party. 

I don't personally know anyone who *self-identifies* as ""fascist"" in real life. But they are not hard to find on the internet. If you go to the largest neo-nazi site on the internet, which I won't link to for obvious reasons, you will see news stories that mostly resemble mainstream Republican talking points about how immigrants and Democrats are ruining America. While some self-identified fascists are sitting out the election, most seem to be voting Republican (and as far as I can tell exactly zero are voting for Democrats). 

One big difference seems to be that the Republican party isn't antisemitic while most self-identified fascists are. But I don't think the specific identity of the fascists' scapegoat group is vital to the definition.

1fwyycs,"CMV: Trump and MAGA Didn't Drain the Swamp, they Became the Swamp","In 2016, the rally cry of MAGA was ""DRAIN THE SWAMP."" It was unapologetically anti-establishment and supported by frustrated people from all types of political slants. Whatever your thoughts about it overall, under that banner he won office.

Fast forward to 2020 and 2024, and the ""DRAIN THE SWAMP"" banner has been taken down (and probably burned out back) in favor of quotes from Trump like:

>“I’m for electric cars, I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly” at a rally in Atlanta, GA.

>""You’ve been waiting on a permit for five years; you’ll get it on Day 1"" Trump was quoted when speaking to oil execs in exchange for hefty donations.

These are just a few, flagrant ""quid pro quo"" style corruption scenarios which Trump seems **proud of**. Trump's pledges to take a ""hands on"" approach to interfering with interest rates sound like an antithesis of the 2016 MAGA mission statement. Trump's pledges to impose tariffs on all imports sound like an antithesis of the original 2016 MAGA mission statement. Trump's intention to bring Elon Musk, a silicon valley billionaire and enormous lobbying and dark money proponent, into his administration sound like an antithesis of the original 2016 MAGA movement.

My view is that the original MAGA movement died nearly as it began. It got Trump elected, and proved to be ""too hard"" to actually pursue beyond that. Trump and Co. realized it would be much easier to move into the swamp than try and drain it.

1gewuha,CMV: Dating preferences shouldn’t be considered wrong for people to have ,"This is mostly a social media thing but social media makes it’s way into real life. I’ve noticed over the years people have been against certain preferences, and to me I don’t see a problem with having preferences in your dating life. As long as you aren’t saying people who aren’t your preference are objectively less than, and we can admit that everyone has their own taste. I’ve seen people say if you wouldn’t date someone at all it’s a requirement not a preference, and to that I do agree but preference is kind of a euphemism many times in this case

But if someone only dates white people, let them who cares. It doesn’t affect anyone else, as long as they don’t shit on other races. If someone doesn’t wanna date fat people, then so what? As long as they aren’t insulting people who cares? If someone doesn’t wanna date a person with a high body count or who is a SW, as long as they don’t talk down on those people. I may only like chocolate icecream and never eat vanilla, but that doesn’t mean I’m going around hating vanilla it means I wouldn’t eat it myself.

Also I see a lot of people have an issue with this because they view it as a prejudice, and in a way dating is inherently predjudice but people feel like it shouldn’t be towards things someone can’t change. But this obviously isn’t the case. Plenty of people say they want a “smart” partner, but people can’t change their IQ.

1. You are uneducated/gaslit/brainwashed by propaganda and are ignorant to the threat he poses to the country and the harm he has done and continues to do. Basically morally good but an idiot. A useful idiot who has lost the plot on where reality ends and the MAGA conspiracy universe begins.
2. You are aware of and educated on the threat he poses and the damage he does, but either don't care or actively support the hate/racism/authoritarianism.

1fuof4o,"CMV: Piracy isn't immoral, Nor is the damage from it as big as people make it out to be.","- ""If buying isn't owning, then piracy isn't stealing.""

We've all heard this phrase countless times, and that's what i wanna dive into here. Companies have been and continue to get greedier by the second, and they've started to completely disregard people's conditions when it comes to acquiring a product. Streaming services deliberately serve you ads on their lower tier subscriptions in order to get you to upgrade (giving ads to paying customers is ridiculous), certain game stores have shit regional pricing or don't have it at all, game companies continue to include DRM software that damages the experience of the paying customers (cough cough, denuvo) and completely fucks up the experience of paying customers. Let's not even get into Nintendo and their abuse of the copyright system, i'll leave it for another post.

Not only is piracy these days not immoral, its actually the only way some people can acquire something they want to consume because they don't have a choice. So one could argue it ends up reaching people that would've otherwise just not consumed the product: You're not getting someone who can't buy a product to buy a product. But through pirating it they may become a potential customer. But lets digress a little.

So you, yeah, the person reading the post. Lets say you wanted to buy a game. Perhaps you'd use an online game store like epic games or steam, right? Now you own the game, and you can play it. Simple and convenient right? Except you don't own the game. If you, for any reason, get banned from the platform or lose access to your account you'll end up with either one of two things: an excruciating headache from trying to get it back or no games at all. Oh, you say you're a paying customer and you acquired everything legally? Sucks to be you! (You're also subject to the service's longevity, ToS changes, bugs, online authentication, bullshit DRM integration... I mean at least take me out to dinner before you f-- me like that-)

...Nah, for real though. The difference between getting games these days and lets say, 20 years ago, is that you actually owned the game physically. Unless you were using your CDs to cut bananas or something, you just need the game console and the CD. Nowadays you basically need to have everything online and completely depend on the company and be subject to their online authentication for various games before you can actually play them. Again, making the life of paying customers harder for no reason. 

If these companies are extremely rich and they keep buying out or getting rid of competition (cough cough nintendo), keep flipping the bird to the customers and push us to do exactly what they want once they've monopolized the market, how is piracy immoral? Doing anything about injustices legally will get you slapped around by big time lawyers and legal fees, so it is quite literally the only way that we have to rebel against these companies and make them change the way they behave. Your support ticket #2131321 is not changing shit, but speaking with your wallet surely will, especially if more people do it. Piracy isn't immoral, and it is purely a service issue. Its born out of the greed of streaming services and game companies. I guarantee it'd drop by an astounding 99% if they were to just fix the fucking way they operate, but they refuse to. So i say, sail the high seas and find that One Piece! Okay i need to stop... but anyways, change my view if there's something im missing here.

1g8pqfg,CMV: Doing your own oil change is not worth it,"After doing my own oil change, I have realized it is just not worth it.

I have to get $30 in supplies and save $100 that would have gone to the shop. My net savings is $70. However I have to:

-Go to a auto parts store to buy the oil/filter

-Go home, jack up the car, get underneath the car, risk getting old oil all over your body/clothes/and floor

-Drain the oil from the drain pan into a disposable jug

-Take a shower, clean up because its near impossible to not get anything on you.

-Drive back to the auto parts store to dispose of the jug

  
For $70 or so in savings, its just not worth it.",garmium,292,0.7300000190734863,474,1729517429,2024-10-21 08:30:29,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g8pqfg/cmv_doing_your_own_oil_change_is_not_worth_it/,10,2024
1fzgdl4,CMV: Gerrymandering and the electoral college should be abolished or at least reduced beyond their current capacity ,"Basically title, I’m trying to understand why Gerrymandering is still around and if there is any relevance to it in current politics. 

If it wasn’t for the electoral college there wouldn’t have been a Republican US president at all in the 21st century. In fact the last Republican president to win the popular vote was in 1988 (Bush). 

Gerrymandering at the state level is also a huge issue and needs to be looked at but the people that can change it won’t because otherwise they would lose their power.
