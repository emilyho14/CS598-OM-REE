1lwow5n,"AITA for ""letting"" my sister go thirsty through an entire meal?","My sister does this thing where she'll just say something she wants with the expectation that someone will do it for her. For example, if she wants the AC turned on, instead of asking someone to turn it on for her, she'll keep repeating things like ""Oh, isn't it super warm in here?"", ""Does anyone else feel really hot?"" or ""I heard that today is a super hot day!"" and if someone asks her if she wants the AC on, she'll reply with ""No, no, I'm good! But if *you're* hot then you should turn it on!""   
  
Anyways, last weekend it was my birthday so my family and I went out to celebrate. During the meal, she kept making comments implying that she wanted another cocktail, but wouldn't order it. The waitress even came by and asked if we needed anything, but she didn't order a drink even when we all did. I could tell she was agitated at that point, but it was my birthday so I just ignored her. 

When we all got home, she got really snippy and said that it was super rude that we all got our own drinks and didn't order one for her. My brother and I brought up that she said no when the waitress asked, but she said that wasn't the issue. In her opinion, we should've known to order her a drink too because everyone else got one, and the fact that we ""let"" her go thirsty was inconsiderate. And that in the future we ought to order her drinks too. She also said that she was only saying ""no"" to the waitress because her family should've ""taken care of her"" (her words, not mine). 

The three of us have been kind of arguing back and forth about it, and I'm just tired of fighting, so I wanted to get some more opinions on whether or not I should've ordered her a drink as well.

1lvxapt,AITA for refusing to punish my daughter after she blew up on the classclown that she dint want at her birthday party?,"My daughter is 12 and she goes to a small school. Her grade only has 18 students (10 boys and 8 girls). My daughter also has other friends from the sports she does. We plan to have her go to a much larger high school in the future. Her 13th birthday party was last weekend and I asked who she wanted to invite, she wanted to invite 7 of the girls from her class and 5 from her soccer team. The one girl she doesn't want to invite is name Kelly.

My daughter doesn't like Kelly, she is the class clown in her grade and my daughter hides her annoying and attention seeking. I asked her why she didn't want her there and her response was ""she ruins school for me all the time, I don't want her to ruin my birthday."" I agreed with her list and sent the invites out.

My ex-wife is invited to all her major milestone instead of us doing separate events. I learned an hour beofre the party my ex-wife sent an invte to Kelly since her mom found out about the party. My daughter was not happy to see her (it was a suprise for her), I told her to enjoy the party.

It was going well until the cake came out, my daughter wanted a glitter cake (when you blow out the candles glitter goes everywhere). While everyone was around the cake, Kelly took her fingers and swiped icing off the top layer of the cake. It ruined the cake and my daughter lost it. She yelled at Kelly, basically saying, "" what is wrong with you, this is why I didn't want you her and that you ruin everything."" She ran to her room after and Kelly was crying.

Kelly's parent is wanting an apolgy, my ex-wife wants her to apoligze as well. I am refusing to make her do that or punish her at all. I pointed out that my ex never should have invited her and to the mom that her child ruined the cake, and that at 12 years old should know better.

1m52myo,AITA for telling my roommate's friend about my heritage?,"I 21F am half Mexican and half Chinese. My parents came to the US before I was born, but thought it was very important for me to learn their native languages and participate in both of their cultures. Because of this, I can speak Spanish and Mandarin. Both of my parents also loved cooking, so growing up we ate a lot of traditional Mexican and Chinese dishes as well as some blended fusion meals as well.

A few nights ago, I was cooking dinner at my apartment. I was making one of those fusion dishes, but I got stuck on a particular step, so I called my mom to ask for help and we talked in Spanish. I was on the phone when my roommate, Ann 23F, came home with her friends, who I was not told were coming over.

Later, one of the guys from the group came into the kitchen and asked what I was making because it smelled  good. I explained the dish was created by my parents to blend Mexican and Chinese cuisine. He then asked why I was speaking on the phone in Spanish earlier, so I told him that I’m half Mexican and half Chinese, and that I grew up speaking both Spanish and Mandarin with my parents. He seemed genuinely interested and asked me more about the languages and the cooking, so we ended up talking for a while about my background and how food and language are such a big part of my life.

The next day, I found out through my other roommate that Ann had told her I was showing off and flirting with her friend. This pissed me off because I wasn't trying to flirt with him and he was the one who started the conversation with me. I tried to talk to Ann about this, but she just seemed annoyed and told me that it was obvious how it looked and I should be more mindful when she has her friends over. I told her that I can't be ""mindful"" if she doesn't even warn me about having company over. She said that she doesn't have to get my permission to invite people to the apartment. I was getting irritated by this point so I let the conversation die down after this.

It's been so awkward ever since this happened and every time I see her she's short with me and barely acknowledges me. I'm starting to wonder if I behaved out of line. AITA?

1lu69qb,"AITA for pulling my daughter from soccer camp and telling her that she can't see her ""ghetto"" friends anymore","Throwaway account

My daughter is in soccer camp twice a week since the beginning of the summer, she is 15. She has made two new friends and I do not like them. They have been over my home once and they were rude, loud, and obnoxious. They made a mess of the house, gave me attitude when I asked them to quiet down (one rolled her eyes and started arguing with me), they were blasting music, and money went missing ( I had 40 dollars on the counter and it disappeared). So I am not the biggest fan of them, and after that I didn't allow them to hangout at our home. My daughter was not a fan of this but still saw them at soccer camp.

The soccer camp is next to a plaza and they allow the kids to get food from the fast-food places. I got a call from the coach that my daughter and her two friends caused issues at Arby's. She recorded it on her phone, her two friends were heckling the fast food worker and left after causing a mess (dumped there drink all over the ground and flipped off the worker). My daughter was recording this and laughing along. TBH I found it disgusting.

I informed her that she is being pulled out of soccer camp because she can't behave by herself and that she won't be seeing those friend anymore. She was very unhappy and started an argument. She told me that I don't like them because they are ghetto and I told her she is correct. They are too ghetto, too loud, too rude, too disrespectful and I am not allowing her near them. She hasn't talked to me since. I shared this with my sister and she basically told me I forgot my roots and to let her see the friends.

Edit: for more contexts, I grew up in a horrible neighborhood and yeah that type of behavior was common where I grew up. Yes I do find that behavior  ghetto as hell

Also I am black, my daughter is mixed. Still think it is super ghetto",SoccerProblem3547,11922,0.9300000071525574,944,1751922895,2025-07-07 16:14:55,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lu69qb/aita_for_pulling_my_daughter_from_soccer_camp_and/,7,2025
1ltfwg9,"AITA for telling my family if they don’t like the way something is, they can take care of it themselves?","I am married and have 3 kids, all are teens. My husband and I both work and my kids are in school and do sports or clubs after school. I recently hit a ceiling in my field and in order to continue to grow professionally, I had to get a graduate degree, so I started my masters degree. 

In the past, I usually did most of the chores. My husband does the typical “man” chores” my kids have some of their own chores like doing their own laundry, taking turns sweeping/vacuuming, cleaning their own bathroom, etc. I did a majority of the rest and all of the cooking. 

I am a year into my degree. At the start I was keeping up with the chores I did before, but it quickly wasn’t possible. I asked for help and was told “everything is fine, you’re being too picky”. But over time, my family seems to be getting fed up. 

They’ve been complaining about things a lot lately. From eating frozen meals (I make them myself in a large batch and freeze them for later), to the floors having stains (if you cleaned up skills, they wouldn’t be there!), the stairs have dust and pet fur on them, etc. If they bring it up, I tell them they are capable of handling it, but they just walk away and it doesn’t get done. I’m doing what I can, but between work, school, and everything else at home, it can’t all be done. We aren’t living in squalor, i just can’t get to the finer details like I could before. 

Yesterday my husband came to me while I was doing my homework and said the shower curtain liner in our bathroom was moldy. This pushed me over the edge. 

I had my family come into the living room and told them that if they don’t like how something is, they have able bodies and can deal with it themself. That they have the skills to clean, I have just been taking care of so much they didn’t see. Now I need them to step up. That they don’t like something, they need to step up and take care of it. And how I also plan to redistribute chores. 

My kids were arguing that they shouldn’t have to do more, they’re in school and busy afterwards. I told them that I don’t care, I am busy too! And I can’t do it all. That need to step up or shut up, in nicer terms. That night my husband told me I was too harsh and need to lighten up. He says I was rude and basically telling them their feelings don’t matter and I need to lay off of them. I told him the message wasn’t only for the kids, it was for him too. He needs to step up. 

But afterwards I started to doubt myself and felt too harsh. No one is really talking to me right now. I’m worrying now I was too harsh. I did change up the status quo in the house for my own personal reasons.

1m7m35l,AITA for forcing my diet on my boyfriend?,"I’m from France originally, and I moved to the states almost 2 years ago. Now for some reason, the food here makes me sick. Not in an “Ew, that’s gross.” Kind of way. But actually physically sick. My body seems to struggle to digest it. Whether it’s take out or fancy restaurant food. Either I can’t go to the bathroom for days, or I’m violently vomiting. I tried dealing with it for months and months, but I started losing weight very quickly because I couldn’t eat. I ended up developing a serious aversion to food, and my family recommended I go and speak to a specialist.

I had never had a problem back home, and I was terrified I was seriously ill. So I went to multiple doctors where I was poked and prodded and I had multiple tests done. They have all said nothing is wrong with me physically.

I spoke to a dietitian and he explained that my body is probably not used to the amount of salt and preservatives that is found in the food in the states. (Please don’t think I’m bashing the US! I love it here and it’s a great country.) My dietician recommended fresh and organic produce to see how my body coped, and to my delight, I improved.

I stopped vomiting and I was able to start slowly putting weight back on. I started making meals from scratch and meal prepping to save time throughout the week. My dad is actually a chef back home, so he was more than happy to send me some recipes to keep my diet interesting. I made a delicious vegetarian lasagna from scratch, and put it in the oven to cook. My boyfriend (American) came home after work and asked what was for dinner. I said I was making a veggie lasagna. He rolled his eyes and said he was sick of “that organic crap” and wanted a cheeseburger.

The comment hurt. I made a real effort at meal times to keep it varied so we’re not always eating the same thing. I said I couldn’t make one because I didn’t even have any burger buns. He said it was unfair to “make” him eat my diet. I had never realized he was opposed to it. He benefited from home cooked meals and I had seen that his clothes were fitting him better. He had more energy and he didn’t sleep so much on the weekends. I apologized and said I didn’t mean to make him feel forced.

1m6rvvs,AITA For Pointing out my wife acted similar after my SIL's gender reveal?,"So, my wifes sister is pregnant. She had a gender reveal last Saturday. This is her second baby. Second baby is a boy, first kid is a girl. SIL was kind of disappointed (or surprised, I guess?) about having a boy but, I wouldn't say mad. My wife only has sisters so SIL probably didnt imagine herself raising a boy. 

So anyways right, on the ride back home, my wife was talking about how it was ""Weird""  her sister was so visibly disappointed when the blue came out, but like, she acted the same. She got over it after like a day (or a week) but she still was. We have two daughters, she was hoping for a boy and a girl. She was like, ""We're not talking about me though,"" and I said ""Just pointing it out"" and she responded ""You *always* do that though.""

1lwqser,"AITA for ""embarrassing"" my more fit coworker?","I am a camp counselor (25M) who works with elementary aged boys. To give some context, I am incredibly short and fat. Like, I am under 5 feet tall and around 200 pounds. This does not affect my ability to do my job. I'm just as active as any other counselor, I work with the kids just as much.I have to get blood tests done regularly for unrelated reasons (related to why I'm so short) and there's never really any concern when it comes to my cholesterol or insulin or anything weight related. I'm just saying this so you have some context for my general appearance and the fact that no, my weight doesn't affect my health or my level of activity.

My co-counselor is a guy around my age who is (I think) a baseball player. We could not look more different. He's got more than a foot of height on me and probably about the same weight, so he's obviously more visibly fit. He brags a lot about how even after we spend all day chasing kids in the sun, he still goes to the gym for a couple of hours. 

The issue is when it comes to actually having to use strength practically, I out do him every time. I'm not trying to do it intentionally. But when we have to carry 20 kids backpacks and he can only handle 8 while I have 12, or when he can't open a jar, or when we have to lug heavy equipment and he's huffing and puffing while I'm not having a problem, it becomes pretty evident that I am just stronger than him, at least for stuff like that. I'm sure he could out bench me or whatever proper fitness stuff is, and trust me he crushes me when we play sports with the kids, I'm just talking about that kind of work.

The issue is that the kids have started to pick up on the fact that I am the ""strong counselor"". If they want to be picked up or can't open something in their lunch or want a break from carrying their bag on a hike, they come to me. Apparently, my co-counselor complained to one of the other counselors that I am ""embarrassing"" him because a guy like me shouldn't be able to be stronger than him. That counselor then came to me and told me I should tone it done because it can be hard for someone who prides themself on being an athlete to be worse at something than a guy ""like me"". I said there was no way I was going to do my job worse just to protect hit ego, and the other counselor said I was being a jerk and as the summer goes on the boys might start bullying my co-counselor if they think he's weaker than me, which I don't think is going to happen but I'm not sure.

1mbtusi,AITA for not allowing Airbnb guests to use my patio,"I bought a flat as an immigrant a few years ago in a bad reputation street of a bad reputation city in a bad reputation country in Europe. 

I won't say that it was just luck, but the country became an attractive country to visit, the city developed a lot, and my street, being in the center, became very attractive to visitors. 

Now my street has been fully renovated and so has the façade of my building, because we got public funds for that. But the inside is still prewar grey because we are fine with it. 

My flat is the only one that opens to the courtyard and after speaking to the neighbours they were all enthusiastic for me to turn my corner of the courtyard into something pretty, on whichever way I felt. In this kind of buildings it is defined how much each apartment owns of the land, but not delimited. So I own, let's say, 5% of the land. Usually I would use it for a parking space but it is not like you have a delimited parking space and since I don't drive I asked the neighbours if I could take the corner next to my door as mine. This was a no parking space and everyone enthusiastically agreed to let me make a mini garden/patio. 

After the city and the street blew up with tourism someone did some legal trickery to buy the flats on top of mine that were supposed to be saved for low income people and turn them into Airbnb. We are not happy about it for many reasons, starting with those flats were supposed to be for actual low income people. 

But to the actual conflict: I let my neighbours use my patio, but I've been kicking Airbnb guests out of it. Apparently the Airbnb host posts pictures of my little corner of the courtyard as a public space. I don't think it's a public space since I own part of the land and the Airbnb owner does not, and it has been accepted that this is my portion of the land. 

Now the Airbnb owner is saying that he will sue me for discrimination since I share my little patio with the other neighbours but I don't allow tourists in it and he has had some negative reviews. 

I'm absolutely safe legally, but morally am I the asshole for not allowing tourists in my space when I let neighbours use it?",DisneyWitchyGirl,7453,0.9399999976158142,357,1753740221,2025-07-28 17:03:41,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mbtusi/aita_for_not_allowing_airbnb_guests_to_use_my/,7,2025
1ltdxi1,AITA for telling my friend i don't want to end up like her after she told me to lower my standards?,"I (22F) met Rachel (23F) 3 years ago in university, and we became friends. For context, I have never dated before and I am ok with that, I don't purposefully seek out relationship and I am comfortable being by myself. I have a few close friends and this is enough for me. In contract, Rachel has had a lot of boyfriends, and doesn't like to be single (her words). She met her husband, Max, 2 years ago in one of the uni classes, and they quickly began dating. He isn't the most pleasant guy to be around imo, and they had quite a few big arguments during the relationship. He even tried to flirt with me, and I told Rachel about it, but she dismissed it saying he was probably just trying to butter me up so I help him with homework. He has told some sexist jokes in the past too. Whenever they fought, I always told Rachel she deserves better and to break up with him, but in the end they always made up. He proposed to her after one year, and they got married 4 months ago. However, after they moved in together (in the flat that Rachel's parents pay the rent for) Max became even worse. He never helps out with cleaning or cooking, doesn't really take Rachel out on dates anymore, and whenever she tries to talk to him about it, Max tells her to stop complaining about ""wife's duties"".

So, a few days ago Rachel asked me if I would like to go on a date with one of her friends from high school who is single and is looking for a relationship. I've never been on a date before, so I agreed out of curiosity. We went to a nice restaurant. The guy never asked me a single question about myself back, and after I got tired of coming up with questions about him, we just sat the rest of the meal in awkward silence. We split the bill, and after he walked me to the subway station, he tried to kiss me. I declined as politely as I could and went home.

The next day I met up with Rachel. Apparently she's already heard about how the date went from her friend. She asked me why I rejected him. I told her the reasons I mentioned before, and that I didn't really like the guy. Then she rolled her eyes and said that I need to lower my standards because I'm honestly not that attractive, that I blew maybe my only chance to date, and if I continue like that I'll end up forever alone. Even though she knows I'm fine without a relationship! Also I'm not insecure about my appearance, but hearing my friend say that about me hurt. I got angry and said ""Better to be forever alone than end up like you, with a husband that doesn't respect me"". She started crying and said that I'm being rude when she's just trying to look out for me, and then left. We haven't texted or spoken since.

Honestly I'm not sure if I want to salvage this friendship after finding out this is how Rachel felt about me all this time. However, I feel guilty for saying this to her when I knew it was a sore spot, and also for kinda blaming her for the fact that her husband is awful. So, AITA in this situation?

I posted my info on the site and a couple from California contacted me, as wife did not produce eggs and could not carry baby.

Met him once at a restaurant and spoke for a few minutes.  I have 2 German Shepards, Jameson & Guinness. My house is their house. I chose this property, because it was a good fit for them.   

This friend (32F) dislikes my dogs on a bad day to being tolerant of them on a good day. When they arrived both dogs wanted to say hi, neither my friend or the spouse acknowledged them.    I found that annoying.   Literally everyone else that showed up said hi to my dogs. Like all 20 other people. They sat on the couch when Guinness came up to them.  I see him say something to my friend.  My dogs are the sweetest things ever.  He gently pushed Guinness away and he asked me if I could put the dogs in another room, citing they don't want the dog bothering them during the party.  

I backed up my dogs, told them i'm sorry, but this is Jameson and Guinness's house, you need to deal with it or leave. My dogs live here and they don't get put away for anyone.

1lv3g4z,AITA if I return mail to sender?,"So my spouse has this friend who keeps having mail sent to our house. Idk why, he has a house, but yet he has all his mail sent here. For the first *three months* I didn't have an issue with it but a few weeks ago he had something important sent to the house that he needed asap. He wanted my husband to bring it to him but when my husband when out for drinks he forgot the letter. The next morning (a saturday) this dude calls us over a dozen times at 6am... like my husband didn't answer the first time so his ""friend"" just started calling again and again and again in a super passive aggressive fashion. Eventually my spouse answered the call, grabbed the letter and went to bring it to his ""friend"" like some servant. It was not a pleasant way to be woken up and I told my spouse to tell his friend that we aren't the post office and that he can send his mail elsewhere. Hubby, who is incredibly too kind, thinks I'm over reacting. I dropped the issue but today I found not one but *four* peices of mail including a new bank card and something thick and important looking from the social security office. I haven't told my spouse these letters arrived yet because i know he'll just deliver them and it'll continue the problem. I'm really really tempted to just return the mail to sender. Would I be the AH if I did?

1lpecq5,AITAH for not taking my son’s friend who is our neighbor to events and activities because he’s not potty trained?,"TL;DR:
One of the kids in our neighborhood friend group is 9 and still needs an adult to wipe him after he poops. I don’t think that’s my responsibility, so I don’t include him in activities that take us far from his mom. Other parents apparently have been wiping him, and now I’m being talked about for “excluding” him. AITA for setting this boundary?


I live in a close-knit neighborhood where the kids all play together, go to the same school, and bounce between our homes for meals, sleepovers, and activities. It’s a great dynamic most of the time.

One of the boys (M9) in the group still requires his mother to wipe him after using the bathroom. Again—he’s 9. I’m not here to judge his development, but I am saying this: that is not my responsibility, and I didn’t think it needed to be said out loud.

The kid avoids using the restroom away from home entirely. He’s held it through school days, playdates, even had accidents trying to get back home. If he’s at my place and has to go, he just leaves.

I’m pretty active—I take the kids hiking, camping, geocaching, to hot springs, beaches, golf courses—all-day stuff, far from home. I don’t invite this boy on those kinds of outings because, frankly, I don’t want to be out in the middle of nowhere and have to wipe a 9-year-old kid’s butt. I don’t think that’s a normal expectation to place on anyone outside of his parents.

Recently, another parent vented that they had been wiping this kid, which shocked me. Then I hear that people are saying I’ve been excluding him—and yeah, I have, from situations where it’s absolutely unreasonable to expect me to step in for that kind of care.

So, AITA for not including him in certain activities because I refuse to take on what I consider to be an inappropriate responsibility?",GoDavyGo,4893,0.9599999785423279,712,1751406133,2025-07-01 16:42:13,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lpecq5/aitah_for_not_taking_my_sons_friend_who_is_our/,7,2025
1m47ks1,AITA for not sharing my food with my in-laws,"I (24F) grew up with 2 sisters so of course I was constantly forced to share everything especially food with them. My husband (27M) was an only child. 

We live with his mom for the moment and what bothers me the most every time I bring home fast food or any other food for myself or the both of us, he offers it to his mother. I wouldn’t have an issue picking up something for her as well but when he goes and offers something I bought for myself that I was excited to eat it irks me a little bit. 

Well recently I was really craving Italian food. Stuffed shells to be exact. My husband and I agreed to go pick up something from the local Italian place and bring it home to eat. Well we get home and he instantly offers his mother some of our food but this time I protested and said she can have some of his dish because I wanted mine for myself. He immediately got an attitude with me and said I wasn’t going to eat it all (the dish only had two large stuffed shells??) and told me I was being stingy. His mom I guess kinda read the room and said she would just have some of his. He then doubles down and basically tells her to take the other shell from my plate and puts it on her plate for her. This is was really irritated me because I then ended up still hungry after because half my dinner was given to his mom. He offered some of his to me but he KNEW I didn’t like what I got.

1meghvb,"AITA for telling my roommate no, she can’t have the larger bedroom, put her desk in the living room, and use extra common storage for only $50/month more than me?","I’m moving into a new apartment in a few weeks with a roommate. The apartment has two bedrooms and the rent is $2,600. One room is a little bigger and has more closet space, and my roommate and I are trying to figure out who gets which room and how to split rent in a way that feels fair.

She’s saying she wants the bigger room, but she also wants to put her desk in the living room to work there. I already told her I’m not comfortable with that because I would feel like I’m disturbing her if I needed to cook or j relax in the shared space while she needs quiet or is in a meeting. I also told her I think the bigger room should cost $100 more because it has more space and a larger closet.

She came back and said she thinks the rent should only be a $50 difference and she still wants to have her desk in the living room, and maybe use more of the shared hallway storage than me too. To me that just feels really unbalanced and is way more than I would try and ask for personally - she’s getting the bigger room, an extra separate work space outside of her room and taking over more of the shared space, all for barely more rent.

My two biggest priorities are (1) having a decent-sized room where I can study privately since I’m starting an intense dental hygiene program, or (2) feeling like I can use the shared spaces without walking on eggshells or constantly worrying about being too loud.

I suggested two options that I think are fair:

Option 1:
She takes the smaller room, we split rent evenly, and she can use the hallway storage to make up for the closet size difference and put her desk in the living room.

Option 2:
She takes the larger room, pays $100 more (or $50 more if I get the single parking lot spot), and the shared spaces stay neutral, no desk, we split the hallway storage equally, and everyone can use the space whenever.

I’m not being stubborn about the money and I honestly would be happy to pay $1400 and $1200 if the common spaces were shared evenly and I had the larger room. I just don’t want to end up in a situation where I feel resentful or like I don’t have space to breathe. I’ve tried to compromise, but it feels like she’s pushing for everything she wants without really taking my needs into account.

1m5usmr,AITA for telling my mom she’s not my kids mom?,"
Throwaway because I just want a verdict and to be done with it. So for background I 28f and my husband 30m have two kids. 7m and 4f. My mother is actually a great grandmother. She lives the kids and is very helpful but she has this habit overstepping. 

So both our kids do chores. We give them things to do that they’re capable of doing. Like my son does the dishes sometimes after dinner. My daughter will help set and clean up the table afterwards. Those kinds of things. My mom came to visit us recently and I’ve been noticing she’s being doing this thing. She stops my son from whatever chore he’s doing and does it for him but if she sees my daughter doing something she won’t. At first I thought she just didn’t want her grandkids to do work because she often calls me a cold mother for making them do chores but then I figured out the pattern and it rubbed me the wrong way because I remembered she used to do the same thing to me. My brothers would do nothing while I did everything so I started correcting her and making my son finish his chores himself which made her really agitated. Yesterday we were having dinner and my daughter and husband were clearing up the table because it was my son’s turn to do the dishes. She tried stopping him but I told him to the dishes and took her outside. She told me I’m so cold for making my son wash dishes and why couldn’t I do it, I explained to her that we like to split chores evenly in the house and if he’s capable he should(it was like 5 plates and cups and a few spoons). She kept going and she called me lazy (something she would often do whenever I asked my brothers to help me out with chores). 

Here’s where I may be an asshole. I told her ‘she’s one to talk after making me clean up after everybody my whole life’ . I told her I’m not going to enable my son to be ‘f*cking’ losers like her sons. My little brother literally had to be spoon fed until he was ten because he refused to eat if my mom didn’t feed him. I was apparently ill treating my son by making him do all these chores. I told her ‘I’m teaching him to be independent and that she may have raised two boys but she’s not my kids mom so she should f*ck off when I’m trying not turn my son into an incompetent asshole.’ She left crying. My dad called and told me she’s moping around.  My husband says it was deserved but he really doesn’t like my mother because he’s seen over the years how she treats me compared to how she treats my brothers. Did I go too far and any advice is appreciated.Thank you.

1lye9uj,"AITA for throwing out my friend’s couch after it sat in my garage for 3.5 years, even though I said she could only store it for two weeks?","In 2019, a friend asked if she could store a couch in my garage. It had belonged to her late father, and they were clearing out his house.

I said no.

My garage is small. One car and barely any extra room. It isn’t insulated, it leaks, and squirrels basically have squatter rights. I don’t store anything there on purpose. I also told her that people always say they’ll “pick it up soon,” and then never do. Somehow the person doing the favor becomes the villain.

She kept pushing. I offered options:  
– Rent a storage unit  
– Get a U-Haul, take the couch home, and have her kids drive up and get her car  
– Leave it at her dad’s and take the risk

Her niece even borrowed a trailer to bring it to me. All that, just to keep it out of her siblings’ hands.

I finally said yes, but I was crystal clear. Two weeks. After that, I could do whatever I wanted with it.  
She said absolutely. Her kids would be there that weekend to pick it up.

They never came.

I called a few times that first year.  
“Oh yeah, we’ll come get it.”  
Crickets.  
In one of my “please get your couch” calls, she said, “I’m a Sagittarius. We’re not good at this stuff.”  
I’m still not sure what that has to do with picking up your couch.

I tried again in year two. Same story. After that, I gave up. She never once brought it up on her own.

Around year three and a half, I had construction work happening. The crew backed a trailer into the garage and accidentally crushed the couch. When we looked closer, it was already moldy and torn apart by squirrels. The workers felt bad. I told them not to worry. It had been sitting there for years.

We even discussed whether I should tell her. Everyone agreed there wasn’t much point. She hadn’t mentioned it in over three years.

So I didn’t.

Fast forward to this year — now year six. I mention I’m cleaning out the garage and she casually says, “Oh, I need to come get that couch.”

Me: “It’s gone. The squirrels got it.”  
Her: “What?”  
Me: “Yeah. The garage isn’t insulated. They love it in there.”  
Her: “I had no idea.”  
Me: “You did. You just forgot. And I said two weeks.”

She hasn’t spoken to me since. Unfriended. Full stop.

Meanwhile, I lived around that couch. I broke my toe on it. I had to work around it constantly. I paid to have it hauled away. It took up space I didn’t have for three and a half years. The first time she brought it up was in year six.

So I’m really asking:  
Should I have told her back when it got ruined, even though she hadn’t asked about it in years?  
At year six, should I have just said “sure, come get it” and played along, even though I doubt she would have?  
Or was this always going to end the same way, no matter what I did?

**TL;DR:**  
Friend asked to store her dad’s couch “for two weeks.” I said no, then agreed with a firm limit. She left it for 3.5 years. Couch was destroyed. I tossed it and didn’t tell her. She finally mentioned it in year six. Now she’s upset.

1lsnj7d,AITA for telling off my 'future' sister in law when she didn't want to invite my younger  brother to her wedding,"I 23f have an older brother, Drew, 26m who is getting married at the end of this summer. To say it lightly me and his fiance, Lacy, 25f, do not get along. She's very stuck up and has made some snide comments to me and my younger brother, Max, 16m. For context Max has always been the black sheep of the family. He is very academically and artistically talented but my father and mother are disappointed in his lack of sports (cliche I know), not to mention they've favored my sister, his twin, Caroline, 16f. Max and Lacy were civil for awhile but I guess I haven't seen them speak in a long time for reasons unknown to me. 

The problem occurred last night when I was asking Lacy about the wedding and how the planning was going. She started telling me her seating chart and showing me what she had planned, I was looking at the chart and Max's name  was nowhere to be found. I don't love Lacy but I'm not going to assume the worst of her, so I asked her where Max's name was and she got suddenly quiet. "" He's not going to be there"", she said. ""You mean not in the wedding party?"", I ask. ""No, he's not invited"", she said it so calmly I'd assume she was talking about the weather. I kept asking her why she wouldn't invite him but invited Caroline. She just said that she feels Caroline is more mature because she is a girl.  


This wedding isn't going to be child free, Lacy has stated this multiple times. I have many little cousins who are being invited, since family is very important to us. Not inviting Max makes no sense. He is a very nice kid, and very mature for his age. Much more mature than Caroline. He never causes problems but like I mentioned earlier, there are some big issues with him not following Drew's and my dad's footsteps in football. I know Lacy is very desperate for my family's approval so maybe outlining Max is the way to do it for her but I have a feeling there's something more to it. 

After what Lacy said about not inviting Max, I stood up and started yelling at her for not including Max.She kind of just ignored what I was saying but when I escalated, Drew came over. As he was walking over she started to cry and make a bigger scene about it. Drew knelt down to comfort her and gave me dirty looks. Once she was inside he turned to me and started yelling at me about being rude to her, when she is under so much stress from planning the wedding and trying to get my family to like her. I understand that my family is closed knit and kind of not welcoming to newcomers but that doesn't excuse her behavior and I told my brother so. I asked him why he didn't want to invite Max and he just told me to stay out of it (Classic move of him). He walked out then and we haven't spoken since last night. 

I don't want to fight with Drew, but I'm standing my ground for Max's sake, Max also doesn't know about any of this yet and I'm hesitant to tell him. My parents have stayed out of it so far but Drew is still set on being mad at me AITA?""",Accurate-Damage-7458,4189,0.9599999785423279,855,1751759334,2025-07-05 18:48:54,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lsnj7d/aita_for_telling_off_my_future_sister_in_law_when/,7,2025

One of these times, I had a booking for a group of 7. The group gets here and it's a Mother, 4 Daughters and 2 boyfriends of the Daughters. All of them appear to be at least 20 or older except for the youngest Daughter who, at the oldest, was around 13. I take the family back to the room and explain everything, then let them Start the room. The second I sit down in the control to watch them, I notice only the boyfriends, who have never done an escape room, and the mom seem excited and are looking around. The daughters start looking around eventually and even find one of the puzzles for the room. They start working on it and not even 2 minutes go by and the mom swoops in, takes the puzzle, and makes them go look elsewhere as she worked on it. That was how the rest of the room went, the kids would find the stuff, and the mom would take over and make them leave. The youngest, getting fed up with this, decides to just sit down and wait in the first part of the room, (This escape room had 4 separate rooms for them to go through). After the group gets to the 3rd room, the mom storms into the first room and tells the little girl to stop pouting and come join them, then before she can respond, the mother tells her ""You're ruining this experience for everyone. I wish I didn't bring you""... I was flabbergasted... how could anyone speak to thier daughter that way? Eventually they're nearing the end and all they need is to find a key fob to open the door and escape. In thier haste, they miss it and the mom keeps asking if I can give them a clue to where it is. Here is where I might have been the asshole. They had already used all 3 of thier clues and I was feeling petty, so I told them that unfortunately I wasn't allowed to tell them any clues on its location, even though I totally could and my boss would have preferred I told them... but I was alone so I decided that I wasn't going to help. 30 seconds left and the little girl who had been yelled at by her mother found the key fob they needed, smiled, put it back where she found it, and walked away without a word to her family. The timer goes off and I come back to the room, saying the did a good job but unfortunately weren't able to escape. The mom was pissed and starting blaming the kids but eventually calmed down, thanked me for all the help and left. The kids slowly followed and the last one to leave was the youngest daughter. I asked her why she didn't show them the key she found and she smiled and said "" Well my mom already said I ruined the experience for her, for I made sure she couldn't win"".

When I went over I went to talk to his mom in the kitchen, and we talked for a few minutes and I left my bag there. I went to his room and he was playing games at his desk and I was on his bed.

I started bleeding and went to the bathroom and realized I bled trough my underwear and a little trough my pants.

1ma3zye,AITA for going back on my promise to help my sister pay for her wedding when she wouldn’t move the date?,"Hi Reddit. So I (28M) have an older sister “Tina”(30F). When I was 15, I met a girl in the same grade called “May”(15F). May and I clicked instantly and we started dating a few weeks after. May and I dated through the rest of high school and college and I asked her to marry me when we were 22. We got married at 23 and had our son at 24. May unexpectedly passed away in a car accident when our son was 2, so 2 years ago. I’m still devastated and genuinely don’t think I’ll ever date or get married again. My whole family really liked May and we all took her loss hard. Except for Tina. 

Tina didn’t have a lot of luck with boyfriends during high school or college. Until she met Daniel (32M) she had never even been on a date. I know she felt really jealous that I got married and “started a life” first but other than that we were warm with each other. She was polite and respectful at May’s funeral and I thought she had gotten past the jealousy thing. 

Apparently not. Tina and Daniel started dating about 6 months after May died (1.5 years ago) and I was really happy for her. They got engaged 4 months ago and are planning their wedding for summer 2026. When they first got engaged Tina asked me if I would be willing to help cover some costs. Despite raising my son alone, I work a good job and make a lot more than Tina or Daniel, and I really wanted my sister to be happy so I said yes. Well, they just revealed their wedding date. 

Yes, you guessed it. Tina and Daniel are planning to get married on the same day that May and I were married. She “gave me a heads up” by texting me last week and letting me know. I asked her if she was mental and why would she do this. She said that it was the date they liked, and they had every right to pick it. Her and I went back and forth for a few days where I kind of begged her to reconsider. She did not. She posted it to Facebook yesterday. 

I sent her a text saying that she was in her right to pick the date, but that I would not be in attendance or contributing financially. She freaked out, repeatedly calling and texting. She called our mother who started to call and text me and word spreads fast in family so now everyone knows and it seems like the family is split in three sides.

1mcqd6e,AITA for giggling at a family's problems during an HOA meeting?,"This happened this past Sunday. My dad and stepmom are out in a small trip and I'm pet sitting their cat and staying at their apartment whirl they're out.

My dad asked me to attend the ""HOA"" (not sure how to call it, we live in Mexico and we don't have an HOA in the US sense) meeting due to some points about renovations,and other important issues would be touched upon.

During the meeting, there was an ""open mic"" moment to discuss other matters in a more neutral way. One of the neighbors, a woman that we'll call Carol, raised a concern about the ongoing issue with the ""gang"" that's been terrorizing the complex for a while now, and how nothing had been done to stop this.

The gang in question? a group of kids between 6 to 10 yo

Their ""clear gang activities""? talking about games in the elevator/corridors, playing in the main plaza after school, going from tower A to B to pick some of the other kids, or getting toys out to go play.

I know some of them, they sometimes come to the apartment asking for bandaids or get one of my nephews to go play with them, really good kids imo, most outrageous thing they've done was hit a garden light with a ball and breaking it, which they took full accountability for and told management as soon as it happened.

According Carol, the kids are an issue and they make her feel HIGHLY uncomfortable, because she can tell all of them are ""up to no good""

Her daughter, a mid teens, added that she feels so insecure when she's home alone cuz more than once the kids have come up to her door and tried the door handle, banged on it, and that they've even tried picking the lock.

Mind you, her apartment is across from my dad's, and the kids only knock on his twice a week when my nephew is there. And that she also felt unsafe walking anywhere near the plaza because she felt ""perved on"" by, again a bunch of kids between 6-10yo.

The husband was also very mad cuz according to him, he's seen them running around the underground parking lot, and I quote, ""Keying cars and trying to open them, probably to steal the cara or whatever is inside!"", which cannot be true because all minors need to be accompanied by an adult or a security guard to access the parking area, to avoid any accident.

I couldn't help it and snorted, then giggled when Mr. Dad added that whole bit about kids trying to steal cars, cuz as we all know, kids are into that kind of stuff. Carol began to ask what was so funny and why I thought that ""gang"" activity was funny, when I could be the next one to be attacked. I probably messed up by telling her that, I doubt that a bunch of kids who look for anthills to kick are crime masterminds, which of course got a couple of giggles from other neighbors.

Carol is now mad at me and my dad for raising ""someone who supports gangs"", my dad doesn't give a shit because he hates Carol, and my stepmom is also mad at me for not taking this seriously.

In some way, somehow, am I the asshole?",hot_faced13,3489,0.9599999785423279,161,1753830064,2025-07-29 18:01:04,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mcqd6e/aita_for_giggling_at_a_familys_problems_during_an/,7,2025

1mbu5xt,AITA for yelling at my partner who keeps buying crappy branded food when I’ve asked him not too,"My partner (M37) and I (F38) have two young kids and we are well and truely in the trenches with our newborn at the moment. Both of us are like ships in the night, barely have time to think or do anything and our routine has been shot to bits managing our newborn. 
He has taken on the responsibility of going to the supermarket more these days as he finds the walks enjoyable and takes our toddler out whilst I’m home with the new born. 
I sometimes buy myself a coconut water as a treat as I love this one brand. Recently he’s been buying some coconut water for me because he knows I love it. 
But when he’s at the shops he grabs the cheapest brand coconut water but I cannot stand the taste of it and have asked him calmly several times to not buy that brand and to please spend the extra dollar to buy the other brand one that I really enjoy. (So back note, my husband is the stingiest cheap scape known to man and he’s actually admitted to me his money saving isn’t normal compared to others. We both have seriously well paying jobs and are not financially stressed at all, he just loves a bargain and buys the no name brand everything alllll the time) 


He says he just grabs the one mindlessly and doesn’t mean to upset me but he’s done it 5 or 6 times now, and the last time I didn’t get angry at him I just got him to really focus and explained my frustrations and for him to please stop buying that brand, it tastes gross, its not a treat for me and to please get the other brand that I would occasionally but and he was like yep ofcourse and said he would (like he has every other time, but I thought sortof explaining it more it would sink in) Then today he brought home the shit wee tasting stuff AGAIN and I just lost it. We’ve had a huge weekend, I’m sick and a coconut water would have been the nicest treat for me but bringing home the brand I cannot stand felt like it was the biggest punch in the gut to me. When I saw it, I was literally shook, I just lost it and yelled at him and was like WTF did you buy this shit again and threw the carton in the bin without even opening it. He was like woah woah woah I didn’t do it on purpose. I then yelled what is wrong with you?! Like why do you keep doing this and he just walked out of the room so it ended there. 

He got really upset with me and said I’d made him cry by yelling at him and made our toddler upset (cos he got a bit scared when I yelled). The whole thing felt like a complete set up to me and I don’t know after asking 5-6 times previously patiently and calmly how to not get to a point of just cracking up and yelling for him to stop buying that stuff because it feels like a constant reminder of how much he doesn’t care about me after asking him to stop buying it several times. 
AITA for yelling? Like what’s going on here?? ",Acrobatic-Employ3942,3147,0.9399999976158142,952,1753740983,2025-07-28 17:16:23,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mbu5xt/aita_for_yelling_at_my_partner_who_keeps_buying/,7,2025
1m3e5ty,AITA for telling my nephews no cake after they were told they could have cake?,"This happened a week ago and I have no remorse but my in laws are still upset over it. 

My sister in laws birthday was last week. I spent the day making it special for her, driving her around to her favorite stores and spots around town until eventually her friends had a suprise birthday party for her that was our last stop. 

She had way too much to drink and I had to drag her out of the party when her mom called me multiple times to get home to pick up our kids. It took me an hour and her friends kept booing me but eventually we were on our way home but she kept demanding I take her to other friends houses the whole time. I said no, it's 8:30pm and we need to pick up our kids. She was upset at me but ended up passing out anyway.

We got to my mother in laws house to pick up the kids and while I was in the bathroom, I heard my mother in law talking to my sister in laws sons and telling them that they can have cake at my house (they were going to stay the night at my house so my sister in law can have a peaceful night).

I was already so frustrated and tired and when I heard that, I was done. I walked out and helped everyone get ready. My mother in law was handing me the cake and asked ""Oh, can you take this?"" I just looked at her and said ""No."" And walked away. 

The boys all pouted and the older one started crying. I just didn't care. I got them all packed up and told them that it's bedtime and we aren't having sugar but we can have cake tomorrow. The older one bawled again and had a fit the whole way home. 

The next day, I brought them over, all the kids had cake, everything was fine. But my SIL and MIL think I overreacted, that I was being horrible and mean to the boys. I wanted to tell them so bad that saying no is not a bad thing but I just kept my mouth shut. It's been a week and they are still bothered by it.

So reddit... AITA?

After getting the tickets, I went to buy the drinks. Asked them what they all want. Two Fuze Teas, one slushie and one Coca Cola. Got around to the final kid who looked a bit sad. She said her mom doesn’t let her drink sugary drinks. Then she pointed at a shelf where there are small boxes of unsweetened almond milk, saying that those are okay. So I got one of those for her.

1m9c0n0,AITA for not telling my dad I will not pay for my brothers college?,"Had an argument with my dad the other day, and he told me that my parents will pay for my college fully but I would have to completely pay for my brothers entire university tuition if I want them to pay for my college. If not, I would have to take out a student loan.

I told him no way I can pay for someone's college tuition right out of college. 

A little bit of background, we are pretty well off and have a nice home in a gated community. My parents afford enough to go on nice trips, they pay for all my extracurriculars, I've never had to work for my family, and I can use their money to go out with my friends. I know I am extremely privileged, and I know based on my parents line of work, they could pay for my brother. My brother is a smart kid and definitely aiming for an out-of-state school, I do not think it is feasible for me to have to pay 80k+ a year with my starting salary to pay off his college tuition.

I said I would definitely help out my parents financially in other ways, but I could not do this. I also have been applying to scholarships so my parents don't have to pay for my college fully.

However, my dad said I am being selfish, and the financial burden on them is too high.

I honestly do not know if I'm wrong or not, so AITA???",KittyNoir1,3010,0.9200000166893005,559,1753480269,2025-07-25 16:51:09,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1m9c0n0/aita_for_not_telling_my_dad_i_will_not_pay_for_my/,7,2025
1mcq63z,AITA for leaving work early without telling anyone because it was over 130°F where I work.,"So i (18M) am currently interning at a very prestigious nursery in the Midwest. Its a really big deal for me because the company has government connections, and having this on my resume basically guarantees me future job opportunities. 

But here is the issue. My boss (lets call him MB) has been out of town on vacation for the past week. Normally, he's the one who works alongside me and checks in. But because he is gone his boss (WB), who works out of a completely different office across the state from where I’m stationed, has been “supervising” me remotely using the security cameras in the greenhouses. The greenhouse I work in is about a mile away from mine and my bosses office building, and since MB is gone, I haven’t had access to the air-conditioned office at all. I’ve been stuck at the greenhouses the entire time in the heat. 

Now, the weather has been brutal lately, with highs around 100–105°F. Inside the greenhouse, it's even worse. There’s no fan, no AC, and barely any ventilation. The only way I can cool it down is by opening the roll-up walls about 3 feet, but that doesn’t do much. Even with shade cloth, the temperature inside reached over 130°F today. I was working in those conditions for 6 hours straight before I started feeling lightheaded and got a headache. 

Since I couldn't cool off and had nowhere to rest (again, I had no access to the office), I made the decision to leave about 2 hours early. I didn’t notify WB because I knew she’d be upset, and I don't have any sick leave to use anyway. About 30 minutes after I got home, WB checked the security cameras, saw I was gone, and called me. She asked where I was, and I told her I had gone home because I wasn’t going to keep working in a greenhouse that was 130°F. She told me that if I didn’t return immediately and finish out the day, I’d be suspended with no pay for a week. Problem is, I live about 30 minutes away and can’t work past 5 p.m (it was already 4:30), so there wouldn’t have been enough time to drive back and get anything done. 

So here is where I might be the ass I told her that even if I could make it back in I wouldn't go back in because it was just too hot there and that if she wants to make sure the plants in there are fine she should come out of her nice ac'ed office and try working in there when it is as hot as it is. She then told me her intern isn't having any problem with the heat (she only has one greenhouse to take care of and it actually has ventilation unlike the 6 I have to take care of). So I just gave up on the conversation said I was sorry and hung up. 

So now I might be suspended, and I’m worried it’ll ruin my reputation at this company. I get that I probably should’ve told someone, but I also think I shouldn’t be expected to work in dangerous conditions with no break and no access to AC.

So AITA for going home early without telling my boss?

1lte1fp,AITA for drinking fruit juice when my partner has said he doesn't like it?,"Let me give you some background. I (26F) have been drinking diluted summer fruits juice all my life because I hate drinking water. When I do try drinking water I physically wretch due to the anxiety it gives me trying to drink it. So I stay hydrated by drinking diluted cordial.

When I met my current partner (34M, let's call him Jim) I was drinking 30% cordial 70% water, which I admit now was strong.
About 6 months into my relationship with Jim, he confessed he didn't like me drinking the juice because it made my breath smell bad (of the juice), it stopped me trying new foods and it stopped us from travelling cheap because we would have to pay for baggage just so I can take the juice on holiday. He even compared it to an addiction and how he was able to quit smoking so I can quit this. 

We decided to compromise and 1 year later I had reduced it down to 5% cordial. I was able to take my juice in mini aeroplane bottles and I had to admit I was tasting food better.

However Jim was still not happy and we keep getting into fights about how 'disgusting' it is and it is putting him off wanting to kiss me. I can't even have other fruit flavoured drinks because Jim says it smells and tastes too similar.

So I tried to give it up for him. It has been a month of attempting to drink sugar water. I am getting panic attacks and dehydrated because I'm not drinking enough. I am considering going back to the cordial because of this but I am worried I'd be letting myself and Jim down.

1mco56v,AITA for not being 'present' for a once in a lifetime trip?,"A while ago my family (mom, dad and older sister) and I (19M) went on a trip to Europe. We had been planning it for the better part of a year, watched all the travel vlogs we could, researched places to go, made itineraries, the works. My mom and sister especially put a lot of effort into planning the trip and did a really great job at doing everything.

A few days before the trip I had an appointment with my doctor. Without going into too many details, he referred me to a specialist because he thought it might be cancer. He said that it was probably nothing to worry about, but it was better to be safe than sorry in the case that it was cancer. Unfortunately, I couldn't get an appointment with the specialist until after the trip. My family was great and super supportive, and promised me that everything was going to be okay. I really didn't want it to ruin the trip.

I like to think that I'm a pretty chill guy. I don't let a lot of stuff get to me and I can usually put things to the back of my mind and not think about them. This time, I was worried. Even though the doctor said it was probably nothing, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was really wrong. I was okay when we were busy because I could distract myself, but in any downtime I kind of spiralled.

Whenever we weren't talking and were waiting in a line, or on a bus driving somewhere, or at the hotel or something I couldn't stop spiralling. It started with convincing myself that it absolutely was cancer, then to what treatment would be like, then to that I was probably going to die and before I knew it I was planning my funeral. I know, it was super dramatic, but that's where my mind went.

Here's where I might be the asshole. To distract myself, I downloaded a bunch of books onto my phone and read any time I started to think about it, aka any time I was left to think. My parents noticed I was reading and asked why and I told them, so they left me to it for a little while, but then my mom and sister started to make comments about how I wasn't 'present'. I tried to tone it down, but I couldn't get it out of my head so ended up reading like six books in the couple of weeks we spent in Europe. Eventually, my mom and sister took to clicking their fingers in my face and saying that I was not present again.

I want to stress that I would only do this when we weren't doing anything, so I put the phone away for all of the activities and tours (or when my parents were letting me have a beer because the drinking age is like 18 in Europe) and stuff. I also made sure to put it away when someone was talking to me. It was just when I had enough time to think.

We got back and I had my appointment and it luckily wasn't cancer. My mom drove me to the appointment and on the way home she said something like ""I bet you feel stupid for not being present on our trip"". I told her how scared I was, but we got into an argument and she said I ruined the trip.

1mefijb,AITA for telling my dad if he wants me to not move he has to help me buy a home?,"I am a baby millennial who is trying to buy a home in this economy. I make a decent salary but apparently not enough to afford a home with the going prices nowadays. I’m not even wanting anything crazy big or extravagant. I’d be content with a 900 square feet condo. The average cost of a home in my town is $650k. I was aiming for $250k max. All housing is expensive where I live in the Midwest. 

I told my parents I may be moving soon as I was searching for a home in low cost of living states such as Alabama or Tennessee and they are opposed to me moving. They said they’re getting up in age and need their children around in case of an emergency (yes I have siblings but I’m the only female child). I help my parents the most. One of my parents is also terminally ill and I’m a part-time caregiver. 

I told them I needed somewhere to live. Moving home isn’t an option since I left years ago due to emotional abus3 that has since been resolved. I told myself I’d never move back with my parents though because of that. 

My parents told me to just keep renting. I don’t want to keep renting forever. I’ve been renting for 7 years. They told me I should not move far from them because they need my help and I help them the most. I told him I didn’t really have any other options. My dad said I can move back home and I declined. I told him if he wants me to live near him then he should help chip in to make that possible for a down payment and he said no. He said that’s my responsibility to buy my own home since I’m an adult and I need to manage my money and not move until I can afford to. So I told him I will move to a cheaper place then so my money will work in my favor to afford a home. I have saved up, I just cannot specifically afford a half a million dollar home.

1lzyqp8,AITA for not kashering the kitchen for my son?,"Throwaway blah blah. I grew up Orthodox Jewish but it wasn’t the lifestyle for me and I left while remaining very culturally Jewish. My husband is Jewish and I raised our children to be very in touch with their cultural identity (sent them to Jewish schools and sleepaway camps) but don’t really practice the religion in terms of keeping the Sabbath, following the dietary laws, etc.

Our son is 19 and has, over the past two years, become pretty religious. He spends the Sabbath with friends, which is fine with us. We have tried to compromise on the dietary laws by purchasing kosher meat/poultry for him, not mixing meat and dairy, etc. we live in an area with a large Jewish community and he has cart blanche to use Apple Pay to buy himself whatever food he wants. 

Because I grew up in the community I know the rules and do the best I can for him while not limiting myself to a culture that I chose to leave.

I recently found out from one of my other kids that he is annoyed that we haven’t converted one of our ovens (we have two) into a kosher oven for his use, or purchased separate dishes for him etc.

Sibling was like “Did you ask Mom and Dad to do any of this?”

Son was like “no, mom grew up with all of this so she definitely knows what I need and is choosing not to do it.”

Sibling pointed out he can’t be mad if he doesn’t ask while ALSO pointing out that Son is 19 and that this is our house and if he’s that pressed he can get his own place and do what he wants.

Fact is, I don’t want to. I cook and bake a lot. I like having two ovens. I don’t want to relive the exhaustion of a kosher (semi-kosher) kitchen, though I could.

1m7n3cw,AITA for leaving my mom to drown in work?,"I’ve worked with my mom since 2022. She owns a small business that made \~$60–100k/year when I joined. I helped her grow it to \~$380k last year. I manage most of the business side and also do service work.

About a year in, she offered to make me an equal partner. I said no. I want to move out of state and don’t want to be tied down. Still, she defers to me a lot, especially with things she doesn’t understand.

Recently, she decided to reintroduce a service I strongly disagreed with. I don’t hate the service itself, but when she and her husband offered it years ago, it led to them working past midnight, often needing my help, even when I had school early the next day. It turned me off the whole industry for years, despite being good at it and enjoying the work.

She wanted to add the service again due to recent legal changes that could hurt the business. She sees this as future-proof. I partly agree, but I think it’ll eventually be impacted too. I pushed for a pivot to a related but new area. It’s slower growth, but healthier long term.

I told her the business is already disorganized and overwhelmed, and the new service is fast-paced and deadline-heavy. She agreed in theory, but said my idea wouldn’t scale fast enough. When I kept pushing back, she pulled the “it’s my business” card. I told her that’s her right, but I wouldn’t sacrifice my work-life balance again and would quit if forced to.

We eventually agreed: if the new service required after hours work, she’d handle it herself.

That was six weeks ago. Since then, I’ve already stayed late once because she didn’t know how to use the tech. She also asked me to stay late tomorrow for an unrelated deadline, and I agreed. Today, I finished my work early and said I’d clock out to offset overtime. She was clearly annoyed.

Later, she texted saying she’s overwhelmed (from the new service). I didn’t respond because I didn’t know how to without saying “I told you so.”

I feel bad. But I’ve warned her for years that the business is too disorganized and unsustainable. She always shut down suggestions because they’d require slowing down.

Also, our history is complicated. She made big decisions when I was younger that negatively affected me. I’ve had to deal with trauma from some of them. I’m tired of paying the price for her choices.

I’m exhausted and emotionally drained, and the same issues affecting the business are affecting my mental health too. She even suggested I take an extra day off, but there’s always “something urgent” that comes up.

Now she’s overwhelmed, and I feel guilty. But I knew this would happen, and I don’t want to be the fallback again. If I say yes once, it’ll become the norm.

1lv1o01,AITA for telling my husband to choose between me and his smart home obsession?,"I (33F) have been married to Alex for 5 years. He was always into tech, which was fine, the last couple years have gotten out of control with his obsession with making our house ""smart.""

It started innocently with some smart bulbs and a video doorbell. But now everything in our house needs an app or voice command to work. Every door has a smart lock, every window has smart blinds, every outlet has a smart switch, there are smart sensors on all faucets, and he even got a smart toilet I can't figure out how to flush without my phone. (I'm way past asking)

Yesterday was my breaking point. I left work early with a terrible migraine and my phone almost dead at 2% battery. All I wanted was to get inside, take my meds, and rest in a dark room. But our WiFi was down so the smart lock wouldn't work. My phone died before I could try the backup cellular system he installed.

I had to sit on our front porch in the sun with my migraine for two hours waiting for Alex to return. He had disabled the regular key lock because it was a ""security vulnerability."" I borrowed our neighbor's phone to call him, but he was in meetings with his phone on DND.

When he arrived, instead of apologizing, he got excited about adding more backup systems to prevent this from happening again. He completely missed that I don't want more tech solutions. I just want to enter my house without needing an app.

This morning made things worse. I couldn't make coffee because he replaced our normal coffee maker with a fancy smart one that ""learns our preferences"" but needs WiFi to work (which was still down). Even the microwave was unusable because it's connected to his system.

I snapped. I told him he needs to choose between me or this smart home obsession. I'm done living in a house where I need tech support just to turn on lights or use the bathroom. He got defensive, saying I'm being dramatic and should appreciate how he's ""improving"" our home. He claims I'm ""holding back progress"" and this is how all homes will be soon.

Here's the thing: I'm a software developer myself, so I understand home automation. But this isn't about convenience anymore. It feels obsessive and controlling. He's spent thousands on this system and keeps adding more complicated features.

AITA for giving this ultimatum? ",Organic-Wind2276Aqua,2323,0.9399999976158142,480,1752011980,2025-07-08 16:59:40,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lv1o01/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_choose_between_me/,7,2025
1mdifn8,AITA for not inviting a stranger our pastor told us to invite over for Christmas Eve with just my husband and I?,"So, this a throwback and the people involved besides my husband are no longer a part of my life at all. But therapy is weird and while working through something else entirely the memory of this situation popped out from wherever it was laying dormant in my brain and hasn't gone away since. So, I shall ask you, oh dear citizens of Reddit, AITA here or was the pastor out of pocket?

Let me set the scene: It is Christmas eve early 2000s. It is below freezing outside and snow is blowing lightly around. My husband and I are alone, but will be going to visit family the next day. We used to have our celebration on Christmas eve just us, then go to the big family event the next day. 

There was a guy our pastor was helping out, around 20 years old. My spouse and I were early 20s as well. The only thing the pastor new for certain about us was we didn't have kids and we didn't have plans for Christmas eve that involved other people. Or maybe he didn't know the second part and just assumed? Unclear. 

Anyway, hubs and I went out for our annual Chinese food meal and to hang out looking at Christmas lights then planned to watch a movie or something at home. While out at dinner husband got a call from our pastor telling him that he'd sent the guy we didn't know (we'll call him Brian) to our house because we weren't doing anything and thought we should be kind and share our Christmas eve with the man. Let me be so clear that this was never discussed prior. 

Well, he sent the guy to our house on a dang bicycle in freezing temperatures and was irate when we didn't leave our food to go visit with Brian. We were lectured about Christian love and how we were not being good Christians by not inviting Brian along. What? 

So, we eventually go home, Brian is on our couch (presumably he was told to just go in? We lived way out in the country so the doors weren't locked.) I'm shaking with anger. I tersely said goodnight and went to bed because I was not dealing with a relative stranger when my little introverted heart had been promised one night of peace out of the week of chaos.  All of this was reported back to the pastor by Brian who was so hurt and put out by us not being there when he arrived. 

I thought nothing of it honestly until months later I asked the pastor for a letter of recommendation which he willingly gave only to find out he wrote horrible things about my character and my uncharitable nature. Based, I can only assume, on that event since I served regularly at the church and helped quite a lot of people if I'm being honest. Which this pastor would have known. So. Am I the Asshole?

1lpf3xj,AITA for jokingly saying I don’t allow guests in my house during a family trip?,"I (29F, hijabi) went on a weekend trip with my married cousins/their husbands and their cousins from their mom’s side. We were at a restaurant one evening, they were joking about their motel being terrible, and one cousin joked, “Maybe we’ll just stay at your place instead.”

I just woke up from a nap maybe 10 mins before we got to the restaurant and I jokingly replied, “Sorry, I don’t allow guests in my house. It might be worse than the motel you picked.” I said it sarcastically, thinking we were still joking around.

Later that night, all three sisters pulled me aside and told me to be “more mindful” around their husbands because I might’ve made a bad impression. They said I sounded unaccommodating and told me they were giving advice “as sisters,” even bringing up the loss of my brother.

I felt blindsided. I wasn’t intentionally trying to be rude but I was tired and made a blunt joke. I live alone, I wear hijab, and it’s not appropriate for me to host a mixed group anyway. I thought it was obvious the comment was a joke in response to their joke.

TL;DR: Cousins joked about crashing at my place, I joked back that I don’t allow guests, and later they told me I embarrassed myself in front of their husbands.

1lvuvkt,AITA for shitting down whenever my brother's university plans come up?,"Apologies in advance, this is long — but I feel like I’m going to go crazy if I don’t get some outside perspective.

I (26F) have a younger brother (18M) who’s about to start his undergrad in the US. He’s really excited, and I'm happy for him — but I’m also struggling with a lot of complicated feelings. 

When I finished school, I too had dreams of studying abroad. I went to an international school where almost everyone went on to study in the States. I applied to universities in the US and UK, got a few admits, and was starting to plan my next steps.

Right as everything was coming together, my dad pulled the rug out from under me.

Out of nowhere, he decided I wouldn’t be going abroad — and instead, I’d be going back to our home country. He sent out my applications himself, got me admitted to one of the top engineering schools there, and just told me that’s where I’d be going. End of discussion.

The thing is I never wanted to study engineering. I told him *so many times*, but it didn’t matter. His reasoning was that I needed to “get in touch with my roots.” For context, I’m a third culture kid — spent my entire life abroad, grew up in a different country, and studied in a predominantly American system. His decision felt like exile.

Those four years of university were the worst years of my life. I was stuck in a country I didn’t feel at home in, studying something I had no interest in. I was numb the whole time, and I’ve spent years trying to block it all out. It still fucks me up to this day. My parents know how I feel, but they believe I should be “grateful” to have graduated from such a prestigious university.

After graduating, COVID hit. I was stuck with a degree I didn’t want and no idea what to do. Eventually, I decided I would pursue a Master’s, but this time on my terms. Fast forward three years: I’ve built a life I love, I live in a great country, I have a job I actually care about, and I’m happy.

But now my brother is going to university in the US — the exact path I wanted to take. He said he wanted to study there, and they supported him without hesitation. And I’m finding it impossible to process.

I feel so fucking angry. I feel like I was robbed of a future I could’ve had. Every time someone brings up his college plans, I feel like I’m choking. And so I stay out of family discussions. My parents have noticed, and when I tried to explain why, they called me jealous, fake, and ungrateful. They told me I have no right to be upset since “everything worked out in the end.” They said, I should be supportive and present during this important phase in my brother's life.

But it’s true, I am jealous. Not because I don’t want my brother to have this opportunity — I do. I’m glad he gets to live out his dream. But I’m angry that I didn’t get the same chance. That I was given no choice. I just resent my parents, and the unfairness of it all. And so I stay away.

Question is: AITA for still being upset about this, even though things have worked out for me now?

1mbv5wi,AITA for hiding my baby bump and telling the father that he shouldn't bother showing up for the birth?,"I (24F) have been with my boyfriend (28M) for 5 years now and I am pregnant with my first baby. We've been trying to get pregnant now for about a year so we were both super excited when we found out. I am now 21 weeks pregnant and have a super noticeable bump. I absolutely adored seeing my bump at first, as did my boyfriend, but now it's something that I've become very insecure about.

For context, I have always looked extremely young for my age. Even though I'm 24, I genuinely still look like a teenager. It's never been something that's bothered me especially, but now that my bump visibly shows, I've noticed that I've been receiving very judgemental looks when I'm out in public. It's blatantly obvious that people think I'm a pregnant teen and they don't like or support it. My boyfriend has never noticed these looks so it's something I've kept to myself. But it's become something so bad to me that it makes me not want to go outside. So I'll wear clothing that hides it the best it can.

My boyfriend has recently noticed this and accused me of not wanting the baby. I tried to explain the real reason I'm hiding it but he ended up telling me ""Maybe you weren't ready to be a mam if you're this embarrassed by it"".

We don't usually fight but hormones have been acting crazy so I just snapped at him. I told him that he should support me during this instead of guilt tripping me and that if he can't even support me through this, then maybe he shouldn't even be around when the baby actually actually gets here, as he'll clearly show no support there either. That not only am I dealing with the physical affects of pregnancy, but I'm also dealing with the emotional affects of it. That everywhere I go I'm being judged like I'm a knocked-up teen girl who made a mistake, and the person who should make me feel the safest is the one ridiculing me.

We haven't spoken properly in a few days, and he's telling me that I overreacted and that he's hurt by what I said. I know I went too far but I was just so angry and hurt.

1m527cz,AITA for wanting my parents to pay me the money back that my brother stole from me,"My brother (14) has been stealing cash from my bedroom for almost 2 years now. I rarely have cash but when I do I either put it in my desk or in my wallet. I used to just leave it out but then some of it, or all of it, would randomly disappear and I would get in trouble for loosing it even though I knew it wasn't me. So about a year ago I asked my brother if he really did steal from me the one time almost 2 years ago now and he laughed and confirmed that he did. I still have not got that money back and probably never will.

Because I'm pretty forgetful I always leave my wallet in my purse which is always in my room, I've tried to hide it from him before but then I end up just forgetting about it myself so I went back to just leaving it in my purse. In the last 3 months since I've been home from uni he's stolen over 150 dollars from my wallet, as well as earbuds and full cans of alcohol that I left in the fridge. I'm broke and trying to save money for school, so I work hard for the money I make. Any money or anything that I buy myself is pretty important to me no matter what it is.

My parents say it's my fault because I should be hiding my stuff better but its frustrating to have to hide my own things in my own room. I want to ask them if they could pay me back all the money that he's taken, even though it's not there fault, but every dollar counts for my savings. Idk what I should do.

1m7nrky,"AITA for not giving my nephew food I cooked just for my husband, daughter, and myself, even though we live in the same house?","We live in a multigenerational house, but we have separate households under one roof. My husband, our daughter, and I have our own household – we buy our own groceries, cook our own meals, and take care of ourselves independently. My in-laws (husband’s parents), his sister, and her son (my nephew by marriage) form a separate household within the same house.

One morning, I cooked a small, portioned lunch just for myself, my daughter (1,5 years old), and my husband. I didn’t make extra because I had no idea anyone else would be eating with us. Meanwhile, my father-in-law was cooking a separate meal for his other grandson (my nephew(4 years old), who decided he wanted spinach – which happened to be what I was making.

The spinach dish was specifically prepared for the three of us, but out of courtesy, I gave my nephew a ladle of it. He didn’t even end up eating it.

I felt upset because I had to give up part of my husband’s portion to serve a child who isn't mine – especially when I hadn’t planned for it and had made just enough. I’ve cooked for him many times before, but this time I portioned the food precisely because I didn’t know he and my daughter would be eating together.

After lunch, my mother-in-law told me that “ethically and morally,” I should serve all children the same. I felt judged, as if I’d done something cruel, even though I tried to share what I could.

To my relief, my father-in-law defended me and said I’m not obligated to feed a child who isn’t mine. That set off an all-day argument between him, my mother-in-law, and my sister-in-law once she came home.

1ma53vh,AITA: Did I cross a line by calling the hotel to check on my adult daughter when she wasn’t responding?,"Throwaway account.

I’m (57F) a mom. My daughter (31F) is married, and they live on the East Coast while my husband and I are on the West Coast. We’re close, and she and I mostly communicate by text. We both have iPhones and share our locations through Find My.

Recently, she flew out to a city about an hour from where I live for a job interview. She had been traveling all day and landed around 9 PM local time; which, for her, was midnight. We exchanged a few light texts after she landed. She mentioned she was going to get a burger at In-N-Out.

After that, I sent a few more texts. One wishing her good luck on the interview and another with a picture of our family dog, which she absolutely adores and usually replies to right away.

But I didn’t hear back.

I also texted a reminder to be careful since I know the area where her hotel is located can be a little sketchy. Still no response.


At that point, I started to feel uneasy. I don’t usually check her location, but I opened Find My and saw her phone was showing up at what looked like a residential address: not a hotel. I called her twice. No answer.

Eventually, I noticed there was a hotel next to that location, but she hadn’t told me the name, so I wasn’t sure. I waited about 20 minutes to give her time to settle in, and then I called the front desk. I knew they couldn’t confirm if she was staying there, but they offered to call the room.

My daughter was in bed, asleep, and got startled when the hotel phone rang. She figured it was probably me and told the receptionist she’d call me back.

She did, but was very upset. She told me to never do that again. She said I crossed a line, that I was being “weird” and overbearing, and that she’s 31 and can take care of herself. She added that if anyone should be calling to check in, it should be her husband, not her mom.

Did I cross a line? I really wasn’t trying to overstep, I was just worried when I didn’t hear back and saw what looked like an odd location. But I do understand she’s an adult and wants boundaries. It’s just hard to turn off the mom instinct.",Throwaway_concerned8,1764,0.8100000023841858,1373,1753565995,2025-07-26 16:39:55,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ma53vh/aita_did_i_cross_a_line_by_calling_the_hotel_to/,7,2025
1m6svtc,AITA for not constantly helping my friend with her toddler,"I (29F, childless) have recently had an argument with my friend (33F, one son aged two) because I was not constantly available to help her take care of her son after her husband left. 

We met during college and have known each other for 8 years now. We were very tight during the first years of our friendship but have grown apart after her marriage, because of our busy schedules (we both have very demanding jobs with night shifts) and because our lifestyles became too different, but have remained  in contact. 

She has informed me last summer that her husband was planning to leave the country for an opportunity at his job, for an indefinite period of time. I asked her how she was planning to take care of her infant son on her own, especially during her night shifts. She said that she would « figure it out » and added « you could stay the night at our house when I’m on call, so that if I have to leave, [name of her son] wouldn’t be alone ». I figured that she meant that she would hire a nanny (she and her husband definitely have the means) and ask me to help if she didn’t have any other option, which I would’ve been glad to do. I should also mention that she lives far from my home and my workplace (approximately a 40 minutes drive). 

Cut to this summer, her husband has left and I have received multiple texts asking me to stay the night at her place multiple times a month. I was very confused at first and has since understood that she didn’t make any arrangements and is fully expecting me to babysit her son whenever she is on-call (her family lives far away and she says that she doesn’t have any other friends she can ask). Which is problematic for me since I work multiple late nights each week and have very little free time. I’ve had a burnout a couple of months ago (which she is aware of) and am still trying to recover, mostly by trying to make the most of the few moments when I’m not at work. 

I’ve tried to explain this to her and said that I would help her when I could but that she couldn’t reasonably expect me to be there every single time. It turned into an argument where she called me selfish, said that she was there for me during my darkest moments (which is true, her husband and her helped me during a breakup a few years ago, but I thought it was unfair to bring that up since I’ve also helped her during low times). She said that I would rather « have fun » than be there for her when she desperately needs me to. 

I don’t know what to think anymore, I feel very guilty but at the same time, it seems unfair that I would have to shoulder this responsability, especially when things aren’t going me so well in my own life. I also fear that she would become entirely reliant on me, since her husband is planning to stay abroad for an indefinite period of time.",ExplanationUnited848,1750,0.9700000286102295,179,1753225006,2025-07-22 17:56:46,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1m6svtc/aita_for_not_constantly_helping_my_friend_with/,7,2025
1mdk6fa,WIBTAH if I don’t tell my spouse the latest information I received about his biological parents ?,"
UPDATE:


I told him last night and all is well. I let him know there was an update and that he could decide if he wanted the information or not. He ultimately chose to read the email. He was understandably disappointed and hurt by the information. I told him that I had struggled with whether or not I should tell him. I asked him if he would’ve felt better if I hadn’t told him and he said he wasn’t sure. He wasn’t angry with me for considering withholding the information and he wasn’t upset that I told him either. He said he could see why I struggled. I am glad I left it up to him because I don’t think I could or would have been able to keep it from him anyway. For those of you saying I withheld this from him by coming here first - he was literally informed 10 minutes after returning home from work. I told him as soon as he was available.  







My (34F) husband (40M) was adopted as an infant. It was an international adoption with limited information regarding the circumstances of his adoption and his birth parents. His mom (adoptive mother) tragically passed away years ago and he does not have a relationship with his adoptive father. When we met, he had no interest in reaching out to his biological parents. He expressed disdain for his birth mother “abandoning,” him and was quite angry. After his adoptive mom passed away he started to toy with the idea of reaching out to the adoption agency. For years he mulled over the idea. He then expressed fear of rejection and stopped talking about it again. He went back and forth on the subject for a few more years. Each time he showed interest, I began learning more about how we could get information if he did decide he wanted to move forward. Late last year he finally decided he was ready. I submitted the necessary documentation for him at his request. The agency informed us that due to changes in adoption processes in his birth country, they may not be able to process his request and we might have to wait until September of this year to request directly from the government in his home country. We were pretty disappointed but decided to proceed and see what happened. In April they reached out again and said they could not fulfill our request. He was upset and a few days later he said he didn’t want to even bother trying to search again in September. 


Today I received an unexpected email from the agency. They HAD been able to move forward. His birth mother returned the first letter to sender, a family member received the second letter and the third letter was hand delivered to his birth mother in May and she never reached out. We can assume she does not want to contact him at this point. His birth father (not married to the birth mother and living in a different city) did initially seem open to contact. He exchanged a few text messages with the agency social worker. Unfortunately he decided that he “felt bad but did not wish to continue communication.” 


I know this will hurt him to know. At this moment in time, he believes we gave up on contact. WIBTAH if I just don’t tell him? I am torn. I feel he has the right to know but I fear what the rejection will do to him. I am so disappointed and upset. I knew this was a possibility but I had hoped they’d at least be willing to exchange a letter or two.
