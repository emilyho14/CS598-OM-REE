1gg08k9,"AITA for not being friendly with my partners daughters now that they've ""warmed up"" to me","I'm (42) dating Tim (59), a widower. He's in banking, I'm a bartender. I know what it looks like. His 2 daughters thought the same thing, but he's broke as a joke and I've got a trust fund, so actually no.  
  
He's broke because his late wife got cancer. 3 times. He ran up 6 credit cards, 2^(nd) mortgage on the house, cashed out his retirement, everything and anything to get her the treatment she needed and then to get treatment enough to see both daughters married.  
  
His daughters live 6hrs drive away.  
  
We drove to them for Xmas last year and the year before. They ignored me, dragged Tim away when he tried to include me and prevented their husbands from making even small talk with me by talking over me.  
  
Year 1 Tim chastised them, they apologized (to him, not me) They blamed the pain of seeing their Dad with a woman who wasn't their Mum.  
Year 2, they did it again.  
  
This year I told Tim not again.  
He could go, I would never ask him not to see his daughters for Xmas but I'll stay here.  
  
Tim didn't love the idea because me going with him means we can share the responsibility of driving when his back starts to bother him. (He hates to fly)  
His 2010 deathtrap is starting to go anyway, so I leased him a comfy luxury ride (my brother has a dealership)  
  
He called the girls, super excited that he'd be able to see them more often without having to worry about his back,, who then blew up and accused him of spending their Mothers money on a “bull\*\*\*\* house and car to impress some bimbo bartender and didn't offer them a dime for their weddings”  
  
In the ensuing argument it came out that they assumed there had been a life insurance policy, nor did they have any idea about the credit card debt or the 2^(nd) mortgage that the house was underwater on or that Tim was looking at foreclosure and bankruptcy until he moved in with me.  
  
They did not realize it was my house, that he pays no bills save the water bill (man takes excessive showers) and shared groceries.  
  
Now the girls want my number. They are sorry I “felt lonely” at Xmas.

They want to come visit and stay with us next year! Conveniently in summer, I live near a beach.  
  
I've told Tim absolutely not about giving out my number. I'm happy to be polite if they come to visit Tim but, we're not going to be friends. If they had talked to me for even 2 seconds they'd have understood. I am not shy about admitting the only thing I have ever contributed to my blessed financial state is “not developing a crippling coke addiction” like my cousin Danny did.

  
Tim thinks I'm being too unforgiving. They would have warmed up to me eventually but knowing how generous I am being with their Father has made them warm up quicker.

1fxu5wr,AITA For Ruining A Child's Life?,"Today, I started talking to an American mother while in A&E; her child was interested in the artwork I have on my leather jacket as it's pretty colourful. The mother mentioned that her daughters name was ""Grain"" so I assumed for a while that she was another mother who wanted something ""special"" to call her child. I remarked that it was a unique name and that I'd never met anyone called Grain before.
She told me that she's named after her great-grandmother and that it's an Irish name. At this point, the alarm bells are ringing in my head because I've realised that the kid is called Gráinne (generally pronounced as Gro-nyuh, or there abouts.) 
I tried to be very tactful, and I was like, ""Irish has such an interesting alphabet. How is her name spelled? Irish names can be tricky."" 
The kid is called Gráinne. Not Grain. 
My partner, who has studied Ireland's political history as part of their dissertation and also the Irish diaspora and it's culture around their university city,  is stuck somewhere between stifling a laugh and dying of embarrassment on her behalf so I come up with, what I thought was a very positive reply.
I said ""an old-school name and a more modern pronunciation. I think that's a great way to pick names."" I would like to point out that I do not like the name Grain for a child, nor do I like the way the pronunciation was butchered, but I was trying to be tactful and positive. She asked what I meant, and I said ""well in Ireland, they typically pronounce it like ""gro-nyuh"".""
Her face went red and said that I shouldn't have said that the pronunciation was wrong in front of the kid because now she's going to grow up knowing that her name is wrong and feel bad about it. I apologised for causing offence and restated that it's a lovely name in both ways and a fantastic nod to her heritage. I said that I'm sure her great-grandmother would be thrilled to be honoured by her name being used. I was throwing out just about every positive reinforcement that I could think of, but, to be frank, she was pissed off. 
She told me that I ""ruined her daughter's self-esteem"" and that her ""life [was] ruined"" by me saying that ""her existence is wrong."" I didn't say that, by the way. I said that her name was pronounced atypically. Gráinne, for context, was around 2 years old and completely unbothered by the conversation until her mother got angry at me. She was just looking at the pictures on my jacket. The conversation was maybe five minutes long, but I managed to ruin this kid's life. 
Hindsight says I should have kept my mouth shut and waited for somebody else in this city to say something. 

So, AITA?

Edit: spelling and syntax
Edit 2: Some people have assumed that we're in the USA, we're in the UK, in a city with lots of Irish people, an Irish centre, and a great Irish folk scene.

We had a good time, and at the end of the meal, the bill came. One of my friends Sarah suddenly said she had forgotten her wallet at home. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened, but it’s never been with me directly she usually does this with other friends.

Everyone was pretty quiet, and I could tell they were waiting for someone to offer to cover her. I didn’t say anything at first, but when Sarah looked at me, I kind of awkwardly said, ""I cant cover you sorry"" She seemed shocked and said she would pay me back tomorrow. I still said i couldn't because I’m not comfortable covering other people's expenses, especially when this has happened before.

She got upset, saying she felt embarrassed and that I was making her look bad in front of our friends. One of our other friends ended up paying her share, but the whole mood shifted. Afterward, She also texted me later on saying I was out of line and should’ve just helped her out since it was ""only a small amount.""

1g30yhm,AITA for shaming my sister for being pregnant and refusing to help her at all with any expenses ?,"AITA? I (24F) have a twin sister ""Ashley"" and we've always been close. She started dating this guy a year ago ""Jared"" (32M). I never really liked him but my sister was head over heels in love with him and said she wanted to marry him. This summer I was at the grocery store when a woman with three kids came up to me in the aisle and asked if I was Ashley. I said no and was about to say we're twins when she cut me off and said ""Yes you are. You're dating my deadbeat baby daddy and want to stalk my pages leaving hate messages saying he chose you over us and to move on. How heartless are you""? I was like WTF I am NOT Ashley,I'm her twin sister ""Blaire"" and asked if she was talking about Jared.


She said yes, and showed me the screenshots of my sister DMing her saying Jared is now hers, he doesn't claim those kids, blah blah. I was very uncomfortable but I knew in my gut he was a weirdo. I was so shocked my sister would date a deadbeat and proudly knowing how our father being a deadbeat sent us both to therapy. I just walked away. A few days later I asked my sister and she denied it at first then admitted it saying she didn't tell me he has kids since I personally don't date men with kids and she didn't want me to judge her. I told her I was judging the fact that he's a DEADBEAT, not a father. We argued about it a lot and I've looked at her differently since. 


Anyways this week she invites me over and her and Jared tell me she's pregnant and are both so happy. I just sit there silently and kept eating. She asked why I was acting like a bitch and why aren't I happy to be an aunt and I said because of and gestures towards Jared. He got mad and said ""What's your problem with me"" and I said because you're a deadbeat. They both got quiet and he said ""That doesn't mean I'll be one for this kid""...  at that point I laughed and got up to leave. I'm in the hallway on the way to the elevator when my sister comes running behind me and keeps asking why I'm being so rude while she's sobbing. I told her thatshe should be ashamed to be pregnant by a guy that abandoned his other kids knowing that happened to us and that she's disgusting and a loser and he's gonna leave her like he did did his ex. 


She said I don't know the full story and she can't believe I would be not supportive in this time of her life and the baby has half my DNA too. I felt bad and said I would try to be there for her but she'll realize what a mistake she made then I left. Now she's texting me saying she wants to be come back and apologize to Jared and I refused and she said that she doesn't want to speak to me if I don't apologize to them.

1ggrg1s,AITA for buying my own dinner because I don't like what the in-laws order? ,"I'd like to preface by saying that I am not a picky person. I don't just...turn down food. I'm always willing to try new things, even if they're weird or unconventional. One of my favorite things to do is to pick out something I've never tried in the grocery store.   
  
But my in-laws are hooked on this one take 'n bake pizza joint that I just cannot stand. I've tried to like it. I've ordered so many different things off of their menu. I just. Don't. Like it. They order it for every single family event. Every get together. Every holiday. Every birthday. 

I started ordering my own meals to bring to the parties. They got upset when they realized what I was doing. I explained that I LIKE ordering my own food, because it's a chance to get a treat for myself that I don't normally order. Still, they're always trying to convince my partner to get me to change my mind and just eat the same pizza as everyone else. 

This Halloween, we'd all planned to get together for a Halloween party. My partner and I had actually planned out a fun homemade meal (pasta bar) for everyone, but MIL became VERY upset that we weren't getting pizza. She put her foot down so hard that we thought there'd be an actual honest to God fight about it, so we told her she could order the take 'n bake she wanted. 

And of course, I was going to run to the store and get my own favorite pizza. She became SO angry. She insisted that I eat what she ordered, what everyone else was eating, and even offered to buy me ANYTHING that sounded good off the menu. I told her again that I don't like anything on the menu and that I'm perfectly willing to go and buy something that I do enjoy instead. 

She's still angry with me. FIL is angry with me. They tried again and again to convince me (they always do) to get something off the take 'n bake menu. 

But I just don't like it!

1fxtzjf,AITA for telling my friend I won't be inviting her out anymore?,"So my bf tells me im not the asshole but I feel like I may be. So I F23 have a friend I'll call Mary who's 22. She and I work together and became friends. Well this past Saturday, I invited her out with my friend group to go to a local amusement park that goes all out for Halloween 

Mary asks if she can bring her kids a 5 year old boy and an 18 month old girl. Everyone involved tells her it's really not a good idea as this park and it's haunted attractions are not geared towards children and we're planning on being there until it closes which is midnight.

She seems to accept this but asks repeatedly throughout the week leading up to Saturday and she is again told no. Well Saturday arrived and as you can guess, she brought her kids. Other people in our group asks her why and she just shrugged saying she thought the kids would have fun.

They didn't, her son got scared with in about 10 minutes of us getting into the park and began to cry begging to go home to which Mary tells him to calm down and he'll have fun eventually. We get in line for the first haunted house and her son again starts to cry saying he doesn't want to go into the house. Mary then asks myself if I'll stay and watch her son and daughter so she can go into the haunted house. 

I tell her no and that this is why we told her not to bring her kids. She gets upset and drags her very scared child through the haunted house. He had a melt down and had to be carried out. This repeats through every single haunted house we attempted to go through.

Around 11:30, my boyfriend pulls me aside and tells me that he can't take anymore of the screaming/crying and we try to break off to find a place to calm down, Mary sees this and leaves her son and daughter with us while she runs off to go on a ride. Her son gets scared by an actor chasing people with a chainsaw and has an epic melt down. I'm doing the best I can to console him but I am rapidly running out of patients. Finally his mom comes back and I all but shove her son back into her arms 

I tell Mary that my bf and I were leaving along with the rest of our group. She gets huffy but agreed. We leave the park and go to waffle House for dinner. At this point it's midnight and both kids are extremely tired and upset. They cry all through dinner and Mary did nothing to calm them down. Finally at the end of my rope, once we get out of the restaurant I lose my temper. I tell Mary that this is why she was told not to bring her kids to this event and that I will not be inviting her back out again if she can't follow the rules of the group. Mary got upset and has since blocked me and the other people who agreeded with me. No one in the group agreed with Mary but they all did say that I didn't need to say anything about it to her and I didn't need to tell her I wasn't inviting her out again.

1furzzy,AITA for refusing to cook a vegetarian Thanksgiving dinner?,"I feel like I’ve slipped into the twilight zone with this whole argument, so tell me what’s up, internet folks.

Background: I (31F) and my brother Mark (35M) do not get along. When he was a teen he saw a documentary on factory farming and decided to become a vegetarian. He got very, very annoying about it quickly, but my dad shut him down when he started trying to get the rest of us to be vegetarian with him.  Then he went to college, made a bunch of very strange friends, and went militantly vegan. It’s his entire personality. I stopped talking to him after he threw a fit about one of my birthday dinners being at a steakhouse and spammed my messages and SM with pictures of abused cows.

My parents have been trying to repair the situation and for a while, it did seem like Mark was getting better so I’ve been letting him back into contact gradually. Then he started dating Pam, who is some kind of vegan influencer. She is apparently moderately popular online, but I have no idea what she does exactly. I don’t know if Mark was trying to impress her or what, but last Thanksgiving he insisted that mom cook at least a vegetarian meal or they wouldn’t come on “ethical grounds”. My mom just wanted everyone to get along on her favorite holiday, so she agreed. It was not a fun meal.

This year, my parents have downsized for retirement and my mom is having health problems. I bought their house when they moved, so my mom asked me to host Thanksgiving so it would be like usual. I told everyone in the group chat so Mark and Pam could make travel arrangements and Pam immediately started gushing about all the vegan replacement recipes she could give me to replace the traditional ones.  I said to send me a main dish recipe they like and I would give it a shot, but I’m making the traditional meal otherwise and there should still be plenty of things they can eat.  Mark and Pam have been arguing about this with me for days and then Mark said that if I wouldn’t make a meat-free meal they wouldn’t come.  This upset my mom, who asked me to just make what she made last year to keep the peace, but I told her that Mark needs to get over himself and I’m not coddling him.  I’m having turkey on Thanksgiving.

My dad privately agrees with me, but Mark threatening to not come is upsetting my mom so much that he’s worried it will impact her health. There’s a not big, but also not zero chance that these might be some of the last family holidays we have with her. My mom thinks I’m putting turkey over my own family and I’m not so sure anymore.

AITA?

Edit: Whoa, this blew up.  So the answers to some common questions:

As I said, I’ve already offered to make sure there is a main dish and sides they can eat. Mark and Pam will not show up if anyone else eats meat at this meal. If any meat is served to anyone, they won’t come.

Doing multiple meals that day or across multiple days is a no go. I’m a newly minted critical care physician at an understaffed hospital during a major holiday week and I will have a limited window of time between shifts. I have time for one gathering and I would rather not waste it on a miserable one like last year.

Mark and Pam can’t host because they live in a van at present. I’m also not willing to have them in my kitchen for hours bitching about the meat in my fridge, the cookware and utensils, and whatever else they can find to complain about. The time it would take for them to come eat, socialize for a couple of hours, and leave is the maximum amount I’m willing to let them be in my home. Although it would admittedly be interesting to watch them try to host a family Thanksgiving out of a van.

It is very unlikely that my mom is going to die anytime soon.  It’s just a non-zero chance, she’s understandably worried about it, and is in the pessimism stage of grieving her health. She has a good prognosis and most people with her condition pull through and live for a long time afterward. If it is by some chance the last Thanksgiving, I don’t think a repeat of last year’s Thanksgiving would do her any good either as everyone left that table unsatisfied and unhappy.",Suspicious-Basil7882,6761,0.9399999976158142,2572,1727905530,2024-10-02 16:45:30,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1furzzy/aita_for_refusing_to_cook_a_vegetarian/,10,2024

1gaoypm,AITA for telling my husband I won’t be going to his birthday dinner since he asked if I would leave early anyway?,"For context, I will be 38 weeks pregnant on my husband’s birthday this year. 

The previous week, I reluctantly allowed his sister to pick my daughter up from school so she could spend the day with her and his parents (she does half days still). I say reluctantly because they have continuously crossed parental boundaries in the past, but that’s a different story. It had been a while, and she loves them and I truly want them to have a relationship, so I gave it another go. 

Anyway, my husband and I went to pick her up at his parents and while there, his sister asked what he was doing for his birthday coming up. I had asked him a number of times already what he wanted to do, had thrown out some ideas for us to do as a family as well, but he never decided on anything. So, he says he doesn’t have plans. She asked if he wanted her to make him dinner at her apartment then and he said yeah, that sounds good. It would be a family dinner: his parents, her partner, and our family. All good. 

Tonight, he said that we could drive separately because he doesn’t want to leave early. He asked me at dinner if I would leave early with our daughter so I could put her to bed. He wants to stay and drink and smoke and be up late. 

This majorly upset me because this whole pregnancy has not felt like a partnership what so ever. He only made one of my several ultrasounds (I’m over 35, so get a good amount of them), works almost every weekend voluntarily vs. making plans with my daughter and I, put off doing things I physically cannot do for the nursery until the third trimester I’ve been asking him to do since the first. I’ve also asked him to look into ways he can support me during birth and not a single google search has been made to that effect. 

I’m not sure if I’m being the crazy pregnant lady, but it certainly feels like he just wants to do whatever he wants without any regard to me carrying this child he told me desperately wanted (I was fine with one). Our birthdays are close, the baby’s due date is only two days after mine (so I’ll be 40 weeks for my birthday if  she doesn’t decide to arrive before then). 

So for my birthday, I don’t get to do anything but be pregnant and wait for baby. It would be nice to feel like he wants to spend these special occasions with me/my daughter and I. He clearly is not empathetic to the fact that I can’t go out and do these things for this period of time, so to be told to go home he can is hurtful. 

I told him that in that case, I don’t even want to be there and she (my daughter) and I aren’t going to dinner. Honestly, I would not be in a mood to celebrate and just get upset anyway. But it does constantly feel like as much as he claims to be a family guy, spending quality time with us doesn’t matter to him.

1fx1yuv,AITA for Refusing to Let My Brother’s Kids Stay at My House After He Got Evicted?,"So, I (23F) just moved into a new apartment in a pretty nice area after getting a promotion at work. I worked hard for this place, and it’s the first time I’ve ever lived alone. I’m really proud of it.

Here’s where things get complicated. My older brother, “Jake” (31M), has always had a bit of a chaotic life. He’s a good guy, but he and his wife don’t really manage their money well. They’ve always been living paycheck to paycheck, and with the rising rent costs, they recently got evicted from their apartment. They have two kids, ages 4 and 6.

Jake asked me if they could stay with me temporarily until they figure things out. Now, I’m not heartless, but my apartment is a one-bedroom. I barely have enough space for myself, let alone for four other people, two of whom are little kids. Plus, I’ve never had kids around, so I don’t know the first thing about taking care of them or childproofing my place.

I offered to help them financially — I could contribute to a short-term rental for them or even let them stay in a hotel for a while. But Jake and his wife insist that staying with family would be easier and less stressful, especially for the kids.

The thing is, I’m not comfortable with the idea of having my peaceful space completely turned upside down. I don’t think it’s my responsibility to accommodate their poor planning, and it honestly feels unfair to me. But now my parents and other family members are calling me selfish and saying I’m putting my “fancy apartment” above family. They’ve been guilt-tripping me, saying things like, “Family helps family in times of need,” and “Think of your nieces!”

I love my brother and my nieces, but I’m standing firm on my decision. Now everyone’s angry at me, and I’m starting to wonder if I’m being unreasonable.

1g1nodm,AITA for pouring my boyfriend's raw milk down the drain because I found out it's dangerous?,"So I recently found out that my boyfriend has been buying and drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk. He grew up on a farm and apparently his family always drank it straight from the cow, and he's been doing the same ever since we moved in together.

At first I didn’t think much of it (being a vegan I never drank it myself) but I started doing some research after I saw the label on it literally says ""not for human consumption"". Apparently raw milk can carry harmful bacteria like salmonella, E. coli, and listeria. I freaked out when I read that, I don't want him to get sick or expose me to something dangerous.

So, when I saw a fresh bottle of raw milk in our fridge yesterday I panicked and poured the entire bottle down the drain. I thought it was the safest thing to do.

When my boyfriend got home he immediately noticed and was pissed. He said he spent a lot of money on that milk and that he’s been drinking it for years without a problem. He accused me of not trusting him and said I had no right to throw away something he enjoys just because I disagree with it. I tried explaining that I was just concerned for his health and ours, but he said I was being a ""control freak"".

When I was 6 my mom bought me different blanket sets for the hospital since their blankets are uncomfortable and sometimes I have to use them at home if she’s behind on washing my bedding. I used to love them but now I hate them. I had a princess set, unicorns, butterflies, and flowers. I “accidentally” stained the princess set so she donated it but now I’m stuck with the unicorns, flowers, and butterflies. I asked her to get me new ones because mine are for little kids and she said yes then she changed her mind and said I need to wait because she had to find a new school for my sister and there’s a lot of extra expenses right now. She said if I want them I can use my charity money but I already had stuff that I wanted to get with that money so I called my grandma and asked her to get me new blankets. She said yes and told me to send her the sets I wanted. 

She dropped them off at my house when I had to go to the hospital and my mom asked about it. I told her my grandma agreed to buy them for me so I don’t need to spend my charity money on it. I told her we can give the blanket sets to the little kids at the hospital. Some of them are there even more than I am. 

She tried to make me give my grandma my allowance money but my grandma didn’t let her.

1gcwl1t,AITA for Telling My Wife Her Parents Will Die,"I (39 M) and my wife (36 F) have been together for 14 years and have what I consider a great marriage. We very rarely have arguments and in general have a pretty good life. 

My wife had a pretty good, middle class childhood, no major issues other than the typical stuff you experience as you grow up. Her parents were loving and did the best they could for her and her brother. There are no buried secrets or hidden abuses, I don't believe either my wife or her brother ever even got spanked.  Her parents are divorced but still on great terms with one another and with the family at large. They live about 1,200 miles away from us so we don't see them as often as I would like. Her parents have always been there for us and on more than a few occasions have helped us financially when we needed it. Honestly they are a somewhat boring Hallmark channel family and I cherish it. 

Shortly after getting married my father passed away and my mother passed about a year later. I was very close to both of them and the loss was terrible. I often think about every time I didn't pick up the phone to call them or would put off a visit because I'd ""do it next time"". 

My wife is really terrible about being in contact with her family, but especially her parents. She just... doesn't make an effort. I will often ask her if she has spoken to anyone and she just says ""I will later"" and then never does. Sometimes weeks go by and she won't reach out to them at all. Her mother made a comment once that she knows everyone is busy but she wished her children would reach out a little more. It drives me crazy that she just doesn't try- there is no reason. I could understand if they had been bad parents or had done something to her but that isn't the case. When I ask her why she won't do it she says she doesn't need to. 

I told her a few weeks ago that I encourage her to speak to her parents because I miss mine terribly and I really regret every missed opportunity. I just don't want her to have the same regrets. She said just doesn't feel that way and kinda moved on without saying much more. 

Her parents sent us some money to cover an unexpected medical bill and I thanked them but told my wife she really should reach out and at least say thank you. She said she would ""later"". I am embarrassed to say that I got angry and I said "" You know, they'll be dead some day and there won't be a later!"" She began crying and told me that I was cruel and should never have said something like that. I apologized to her profusely and again told her I just have my own baggage from my parents and it gets to me sometimes. I told her I just want her to use the chances she has now. She told me she will never be able to forgive me and that she will always ""think about how cruel"" I was to her. I know I messed up but I still don't understand why she can't just speak to her parents. AITA?

1g7ki0p,AITA for not letting my sister move in with me when she and her kids were facing homelessness?,"
Here’s a little bit of back story

In 2022, my sister (22F) had asked if she, her boyfriend (23M) and her newborn (6mo F) could stay with us for 1-3 months (which turned into 11 months) until they had gotten their taxes so they could save up and move to another place.

my partner and I agreed (21F & 20M) because it was only going to be a few months and I didn’t want them to be potentially homeless, with an infant. I had only 3 actual rules. A.) Take care of the wood floors B.) Help out with rent when they can C.) No births. 

My sister stayed home with the baby mostly, while us 3 worked through the day. But soon, so we’re consistently piles of dishes, dirty diapers, food trash, and just things left around.  And they had also spent all their tax money and asked if they could stay longer. 

After a while, my sister was getting really comfortable with asking me to watch my niece. I would end up watching my niece almost every night/off day for 1-5 hours. It got to the point where my partner and I couldn’t really hang out. Them living with us was starting to have an affect on mine and my partners relationship at that point. 

She had gotten prescribed birth control. Shortly after, I started to notice a bunch of ovulation tests in our bathroom. 

Not long after that appointment She happily came up to me and showed me a positive pregnancy test. She tried to lie and say that she was too fertile for birth control to work.m and said that it was accident. But it was so hard to believe. So then I told them both, they had to leave before that baby was born. 

When they moved out, Her boyfriend literally said to me before they left “wow your house looks TRASHED!” And then left. Their bedroom floors were super sticky, random substance on the walls, and a shit ton of dirty dishes were left For me to clean up. 

Now, it’s been about a year and a half since they left. And currently, my partner is having some heart issues causing him to be out of work and will need surgery. So I’m riding solo to keep a roof over our head, bills paid, and food in the fridge. 

My sister called me in a panic. Saying that her and her two babies that are now toddlers are going to be homeless because she was  on a waitlist for a rental assistance apartment And that she had done everything she could, and her boyfriend had been having issues keeping a job because he has a felony. And she had asked if she and my niece and nephew could stay with me for a few weeks. 

But I told her, no. I couldn’t take on anymore responsibilities than what I already have. That I’m having difficulty keeping up with my own shit. I suggested if they could reach out to her boyfriends parents, and see if they could help in any way. They agreed to let them stay. I called to check up on them, no response (which is very very unusual for her) and I feel like she may be upset with me, I just frankly have so much going on that I couldn’t go through that again.

1g89kfo,AITA for telling a woman she shouldn’t be at a dog party?,"I was at a dog costume contest in a public park. There were hundreds of people and dogs. In the middle of everything, there was a woman sitting on a bench with her dog. Whenever any dog or person got near she would yell at them to get away and she would yank her dog back. The dog kept trying to make friends and would stare longingly at the other dogs who were playing with each other and she would keep aggressively tugging him and scolding people. After a while I said ""You know there's kind of a big dog party going on. If you don't want your dog around people or dogs, perhaps this is not the right place for you."" She said ""I don't know what you want from me. I have a right to be here."" I wasn't questioning her rights, just her judgment. AITA?

Edit: It was an official park sponsored party. She would get angry when people and dogs were simply in the vicinity of her dog, not necessarily even interacting. Most of the time she wasn’t even paying attention, just scrolling on her phone.

Edit 2: A lot of people are saying “the dog might be aggressive” to justify her behavior. If that’s the case….why would you bring your dog to a dog party?!

1fylhno,AITA for replacing my friend’s throw pillow with a thrifted identical version? ,"So my (24F) friend “Wendy” (23F) just got a new apartment. She’s the first of our friend group to get an apartment, so everyone is really excited and Wendy wants it to be the main place we all go to hang out. Wendy threw a party this past Friday, just a small get together with our friend group and some of Wendy’s cousins. 

After a few hours, we were all pretty drunk, including me. I accidentally spilled my wine on one of her throw pillows. I tried to wash it out, but no luck. Of course, I offered to replace the pillow and Wendy sent me the link to where she bought it. It was SEVENTY DOLLARS for a tiny little carrot pillow. I told her I would definitely replace it, but I would probably have to wait for a few weeks for my next check because that eats into my gas money. She seemed a little pissy and I felt bad.

Yesterday, my other friends wanted to go thrifting for their Halloween costumes. I already got mine, but wanted to tag along. I thought it was my lucky day because at one of the thrift stores was the exact pillow! Like the very same one with the tag from the store and everything. The thrift store was selling it for twelve dollars, so I got it because it was cheaper and now Wendy would be able to have her complete living room quicker than we thought.

Fast forward a couple hours and we all go over to Wendy’s to show her the Halloween haul and I present her with the pillow. First she was happy, but then she was like “How are you gonna get to work?” I explained that I found it at a thrift store and she threw it at me and acted all grossed out.

Now I’m confused because we all go thrifting all the time, including Wendy. But Wendy was like, “I don’t buy soft furnishings at the thrift store.” I offered to wash it and bring it back, but she said no and still demanded that I buy the one from the actual store. I said no, I would wash the thrifted pillow for her, but I’m not buying a pillow for seventy dollars. She said it was my fault for spilling wine in the first place and said I was “too clumsy to live.” Then I said for someone who wants to host parties, you’re being a big brat about a little spill. 

We left it at that, but I left a few minutes later because I could tell Wendy was really annoyed at me. Now the friend group is taking sides and one of my friend’s girlfriend told me that now there’s a group chat that doesn’t have me or Wendy in it called “The Pillow Crisis of 2024” where everyone is arguing who is in the right. 

I did wash the pillow and gave it to my friend to give it to Wendy, but apparently she refused to put it on her couch and it now resides in the floor pillow pile. So, AITA?

(tl;dr: I spilled wine on my friend’s very expensive throw pillow. I replaced it with the identical pillow from the thrift store at a lower price. My friend wasn’t happy and demanded that I buy it from the actual store. I refused and insults were thrown back and forth. AITA?)

1gf6i1t,AITA for refusing to invite my brother’s fiancée to my wedding because of her Instagram account?,"So, here’s the situation. My (28F) wedding is coming up in a few months, and I’ve been planning it for over a year with my fiancé, Jake (29M). Everything’s been going smoothly—except for one major issue with my brother’s (30M) fiancée, *Amber* (27F).

Amber has a large following on Instagram, where she posts very revealing photos of herself. She’s been into “fitness modeling” for a few years now, and while I have no issue with her career, I feel uncomfortable with some of the attention it brings. For example, at my engagement party, she showed up in a tight mini-dress and spent half the night live-streaming the event to her followers, some of whom were commenting… let’s just say *inappropriately*. I didn’t say anything then, but it made me feel awkward.

Jake and I have been envisioning a fairly private and family-oriented wedding. We don’t want anything about it going on social media, and we also don’t want Amber’s followers gawking at our wedding photos or seeing our special day as just another “shoot” for her profile. I spoke to her privately and asked if she’d agree to keep her phone away during the ceremony and reception. She brushed me off, saying, “It’s my brand. It’s who I am,” and she made no promises.

This has been weighing on me a lot, so I told my brother that if she can’t respect my request, I’d prefer she not attend. He exploded and accused me of judging her lifestyle and her career. He also said that if she can’t come, he might not come either, and now my whole family is furious with me. Jake supports me, but he’s worried it’ll cause permanent damage with my brother.

I've settled for having four stretchy knit dresses that I fit into. These are all dark and not pink.

I messaged the bridesmaid and said I'm going to really struggle to find an outfit in barbie pink, as almost nothing has fit me.

1g61v0o,"AITA for refusing to let my neighbor cut down my tree because it ""blocks her view""?","I (34M) live in a quiet suburban neighborhood, and my house has a large oak tree in the front yard. It’s been there for decades, long before I moved in, and honestly, it’s one of the things I love about the property. It gives shade, keeps the yard cool in the summer, and just generally looks great.

Recently, my new neighbor (40sF) moved into the house across the street. She seems nice enough, but we don’t really talk much, just the occasional wave. A couple of weeks ago, she knocked on my door and asked if I’d consider cutting down my tree. I was confused and asked why, and she said it “blocks her view of the sunset.”

Now, I’ve lived here for years, and I’ve never had any complaints about the tree, from neighbors or otherwise. It’s perfectly healthy, and it’s not hanging over anyone’s property. Plus, I enjoy the view with the tree, and it’s part of the charm of my yard.

I politely told her that I wasn’t interested in removing the tree, especially for something like that. She got annoyed and said it’s a “reasonable request” because the tree “ruins” her evening view from her porch. I didn’t want to escalate things, so I just said I’d think about it and ended the conversation.

A few days later, she came back with pamphlets from a tree removal service and tried again, this time offering to pay for the removal. I declined again, saying that the tree’s important to me and I don’t want to get rid of it. She got visibly upset and said something like, “It’s just a tree, why are you being so difficult?”

Since then, she’s been giving me the cold shoulder, and I’ve heard from a couple of neighbors that she’s been telling people I’m being unreasonable. I honestly don’t think I am, but now I’m wondering if I’m missing something.

1fwcqhh,AITA for telling my husband that I think his brother and wife are bad parents for trying to make us watch his kid 24/7 when we visit?,"
Whenever I’m visiting the in laws (~3-4 times per year), we stay at my brother in laws house because they have an extra bedroom (and also insist we stay with them). My brother in law and his wife expect near 24/7 babysitting because I’m not working during these trips. They leave my niece with me and start asking and telling me to do things like can I feed her, why doesn’t she read a book with me, and not to let her watch tv. They basically just disappear into their own worlds the whole day (one goes to work and the other works at home). 

I don’t mind helping out for a few hours here and there but being expected to just watch her the whole day during the whole vacation (if I don’t have plans outside of the house) seems excessive to me and I find myself growing very resentful. I honestly don’t understand what they do when I’m not around as they don’t have a babysitter normally. Whenever I express that I’m tired or try to get away for some rest, they end up commenting later on in a “joking” way how me and my husband should reconsider having kids in the future since we get tired so easily. Or that we should watch my niece for a longer period of time (I.e. weeks) before seriously considering a child. These comments rub me the wrong way and seem so inappropriate to me because obviously having a child is a lot of work, but just because I don’t want to watch their child 24/7 doesn’t mean they can say such rude things to me. 

I’ve complained to my husband a few times but he seems to think that this is all normal and that this level of expectation for babysitting is also totally normal and “part of the culture” (they are south Asian). However I’m not really sure if this is the case because the tried to have their other sibling (sister) who lives in the same city agree to scheduling babysitting their kid one to two weekends every month and they obviously refused leading to a small fight. 

Recently I got so annoyed at their behavior over the past few trips (especially leaving their child with me and my husband when we have been feeling unwell and sick), that I told my husband that I don’t like his brother and think that him and his wife are extremely self centered and demanding people who are bad parents because they are always trying to pawn their kid off on other people. This obviously started a big fight as my husband feels close to his brother.

But, about a month ago, I finally had the opportunity to buy a new car. Beforehand, I had a 1999 Ford Fiesta; it was my first car, and I barely spent any money on gas.   
I don't have many financial responsibilities, so I chose to enjoy being a young man with a decent salary and bought a supercar. I LOVE my new car, and so do my coworkers, which means a lot more requests started coming my way for lifts home.   
I've worked at my current job for about 6 months, and I've probably done over 100 detours to make my coworkers happy.   
Here's the problem; not ONCE have I been offered any form of compensation from any of them, even though they would've had to pay for public transport, if I didn't offer them a lift.   
Now, my new car is quite a bit more expensive than my old one, which means it does not drive that far km/l (approx 12-13 km/l). 

Apparently, this is completely otherworldly for my coworkers. Today, I said no for the first time. I got asked if I could give them a lift, and I said: (sure, if you pay me the fee you would have to for public transport, I'll drive you home), and this did not sit well with them.   
I think I'm being as fair as possible, since I don't want to keep losing money by giving them a free service, that they don't seem to appreciate.

1fzce77,AITA for refusing to apologize for something I never did?,"Using a throwaway account.

I graduated high school 15 years ago. We recently had our 15 year school reunion.

Anyway, during high school, there was this kid named Ivan. I didn't interact much with him, but he hated me. For the life of my I didn't understand why as I hardly ever talked with him. Until one day during our senior I learned that he hated me because he thought I was telling people he was gay. I never did and I asked why he thought I was telling people that.

He refused to elaborate and said someone told him I was telling people he was gay (he wasn't to the best of my knowledge). I told him I""m sorry he thinks that, but I never said that to anyone.

Come our high school reunion and he again confronts me for calling him gay. I once more say I never did. He accuses me of lying and demands I apologize. I refuse and he goes off saying I'm a bullying AH and that he's tired of people assuming he's gay because of me.

I again said I never said that, and to be honest, I don't care if someone is gay or not because I don't have a problem with it. He storms off saying it was a waste of time coming and he wishes he would have known ahead of time that I was there.

Maybe I should have apologized just to give him closure or something. It was probably a little childish, but I've had to apologize before for things I never did and I hated it but I don't know.

The conflict is between me (44M) and my girlfriend (34F). My GF and I have been together for 5 years, living together for 2 years. She has a son (12M) from a previous relationship. Her son has ASD. In my early 20s, I started a business with my best friend. It has done very well and I am comfortable financially. I was previously married, and when I got divorced, ex took more than her pound of flesh financially. So, when I got with my GF, I told her, her expenses where her expenses, my expenses were my expenses. And we would never get married. She agreed and understood.

My GF's son previously went to a local private school. This school provided lots of resources for kids with special needs. He thrived there. My best friend's kids go to the same school. They are not special needs, but the school is good overall regardless of that. My GF's son's tuition was paid for by his bio dad and GF's dad. 

Here is where I might be the AH. My best friend, a couple of years ago, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. He unfortunately died this past spring. I promised him I would look after his wife and kids. About a year ago, GF's ex (the bio dad) lost his job and can no longer contribute to tuition. GF's dad cannot cover it (bio dad paid like 85%). So, GF's son is in public school right now and struggling. Meanwhile, I am paying the tuition for best friend's kids based on my promise to him. GF approached me and asked if I would contribute something so her son could go back to the school. I refused. She called me an AH because I am helping a woman who I am not in a relationship with while refusing to give her the exact same help. I see her point, but we had an agreement when we got together. 

AITA?

1g31bx3,AITA for refusing to pay double my own meal bill at a family event?,"We had a family meal out for my Nan's birthday yesterday. Family included:

Nan
Family A: Two parents with three adult children, ages 18,23,25.
Family B: Two parents with disabled, adult son.
Adult C
Family D: Two parents with two, school-aged children.
Me (30F)
This was arranged by my Family A 25F cousin, with meals pre-ordered from a fixed price menu. I chose a two-course meal plus soft drink. Everybody else (minus young children) had a three-course meal, two alcoholic drinks & a hot drink each.

(For the sake of maths, I've removed the service charge/tips from the bill)

The bill arrived, & I expected to pay for my meal & drink, plus ~£2.00 towards Nan's meal (each of us contributed, so Nan ate for free). My meal was £18.95, plus £2.50 drink, so I was expecting a bill ~£25.00. The three-course meal everybody else had was £22.95, & each person spent a similar figure on alcoholic & hot drinks, plus their own contribution to Nan's meal. My adult (18-25) cousins in Families A & B would be paid for by their parents.

My Family A 25F cousin said each adult owed £50.00, including division of school-aged children's meals amongst everybody. I checked my sums again - my bill was definitely £25.00 - but nobody mentioned that I'd consumed half of what everybody else had because they either wanted a cheaper bill or wanted to go home, so I reminded my cousin of my smaller meal & lack of alcoholic & hot drinks.

I left the room for five minutes, & chaos ensued. Everybody was shouting at everybody, & my Family D brother-in-law started yelling at me whilst my Family A aunt shouted at him 'She's not MY granddaughter, so why do I have to pay for her?!'. People then glared at me or avoided my eyes, & Family B aunt said 'You! Why can't you just muck in like everybody else?!' & when I said I can't afford to pay double what my actual bill was, she said 'Then why didn't you say that at the start? What do we do, not invite you to future events?!' My Family A 23M cousin paid the bill, & later messaged each person with what they owed him.

For reference, we have never split bills 'down the middle'. With different, individual family sizes involved including children with an age range of twenty years, it's not been fair to do so, so historically bills have been paid with each family paying their own way. Now, with the aforementioned children now being adults, this rule has shifted a couple of times to splitting a bill equally amongst all of the adults, with no thought towards anyone (usually me) who consumed less food & no alcohol. I challenged this once before, & my Family A aunt announced 'SHE (me) is paying [£10.00 for jacket potato & Coke], & EVERYBODY ELSE is paying [£35.00 for a two-course meal & two G&Ts]!', making everybody roll their eyes at me for being difficult/different/a tight arse, etc.

AITA for asking to pay only for what I have consumed at this family event plus my contribution for Nan's meal?",Flutterby91,2601,0.9599999785423279,339,1728857796,2024-10-13 17:16:36,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1g31bx3/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_double_my_own_meal_bill/,10,2024
1galk15,AITA for canceling Thanksgiving dinner without telling my family first? ,"So I, (30s F) am a single mom and I currently live with my kids and my mom, who is also single. I always cook Holiday dinners, as my Mother can’t cook. This would have been our 3rd thanksgiving dinner. The issue isn’t her lack of cooking. The issue is that she invites guests without telling me until the last minute. And she doesn’t actually ask, because she will have already invited them and will tell me by posing it as a question. “Oh by the way, I invited your (insert random family member) to come for dinner. Is it ok?” Like lady, you already told them to, so of course if i say no it starts drama. She knows I dislike her family because they are all drama, including her since she entertains it. 

So this year I have decided to not cook Thanksgiving dinner. She asked me the other day what was on the menu for this year and I told her nothing and my reason why. She loudly says wow and then tried to guilt trip me by reminding me this would be our last year living together. She is retiring and bought a house back in her home country. I told her she will live 30 mins away driving distance. So she chill on the dramatics, and also my kids and I will not be made to feel uncomfortable in our own house. She tried to deny we were uncomfortable m, until I reminded her we spend the entire time in my room watching movies, until they all leave. 

I didn’t feel bad at the time but a co-worker of mine did say maybe I should have spoken to her about it instead of her finding out the way she did.

1gbge2n,AITA for getting up from the table when my mom said I had to share dinner with my sister? ,"For some context: my sister is eight years younger than me. I'm nineteen and she's eleven.

We have alwayd had quarries over personal space and items, specially food (bc little kids always want what you have even if they have their own) so I've always been kinda greedy regarding my stuff, as I don't ask anyone for anything and I don't like being asked for anything

So, last weekend my mom bought some sushi for dinner, and I got home late from work, hoping to have some leftovers of that for dinner. To my surprise, she said they didn't leave any for me cause ealier in the day, she had bought me some lunch, so I shouldn't be hungry by the time I arrived home. (I ate at 1pm. And left work at about 11pm. At night)

So today, she bought sushi again, cause I asked her to, since I felt annoyed they left me out last weekend

Long story short, she said I'd have to share it with my sister (even if she had some last time and didn't leave any for me) and got annoyed when I asked her if I really had to.

I got upset and said I wasn't hungry anymore.

So, am I the a-hole for that? It made me feel crappy either way, dude. ",ProofStuff6903,2562,0.9399999976158142,212,1729812206,2024-10-24 18:23:26,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gbge2n/aita_for_getting_up_from_the_table_when_my_mom/,10,2024
1g7lx26,AITA for moving across the country and splitting the five of us up (Quints)?,"I’m 1 (28 M) of 5 in a set of quintuplets.  In order it goes Aiden, Beth, Charlotte, Deanna and me Eric. It wasn’t horrible and our parents did in all honesty a great job with all us.  I think really the only problem we had was Aiden who was the first out and knew he was the first out had a pretty big ego and felt he was superior over the other four of us and tried to push us around. Our parents did what they could to keep him inline and for the most part the rest of us would ignore him

Three years ago my brother decided to marry his then girlfriend. Our family for the most part are pretty laid back. This is good because out of the five of us, I’m the gay one. Up to a certain point it was never really an issue.  Or so I thought.   His wife’s family complete opposite. Highly political (Conservative) and devote Catholic. Again to each their own and it wasn’t anything for us to talk to him about.  If she makes him happy then there isn’t anything we can do about it.  When they got married I wasn’t included in any part of it.  Her parents were paying for it and they had the final say and said they couldn’t allow a gay person in the wedding party or in the church. My brothers, sisters and parents say they fought to get me invited, but were shot down each time.  My sisters were part of the wedding party but none declined.  My dad offered to stay with me for the day and we would do something.  I told him it was okay and both parents needed to be at the wedding.  The day of the wedding a couple of friends took a day trip.  We had a great time but it still would have been nice to see Aiden get married.

Not long after the wedding I was on vacation and met someone.  Long distance as it maybe three years later we have been making it work.  We have been talking about one of moving and I told him I loved Seattle and that if anyone was going to move it was going to be me.

Last night mom and dad asked for all of us to come for dinner.  I didn’t say much at all and everyone was talking and I was just listening and on occasion say a yes or no or answer an easy question. My dad finally noticed and looked over and asked if I was okay.  I just told him I have a lot on my mind and he asked what’s going on “I’m moving to Seattle  The room went crazy.  I can’t say I was being attacked but it still felt like it with the way everyone was firing off all their questions and calling me an asshole for breaking the five of us up. Dinner ended shortly after and Dad and I went out to his barn and talked for a long time.  Weather he gave it to me or not I am going to move.  But he gave me his blessing and told me he would help however he could.

Today Deanna and Beth came over and started in right away.  They started blaming Will for splitting the five of us up and calling me an asshole for not taking the rest of us into consideration. I told them it’s not a big deal and at least one of us has the ambition to move on with their life.

1g6tspt,"AITA for refusing to let my coworker move in after she got evicted, even though I have a spare room?","I (28F) recently moved into a nice two-bedroom apartment on my own after saving up for years. I have a good job and wanted a space where I could finally have peace and privacy. I’ve been enjoying having a place that’s just mine, and I turned the second bedroom into a home office.



Last week, one of my coworkers (32F), who I’m friendly with but not super close to, was evicted from her apartment. She came to me in a panic asking if she could move into my spare room “just for a couple of months” while she gets back on her feet. I felt for her situation, but I’ve been really enjoying my space and value my privacy. I explained that I’m not comfortable with someone else living with me and suggested she check out some short-term rentals or ask her family.



She got really upset and accused me of being selfish, especially since she knows I live alone with a whole empty room. She told some of our coworkers, and now a few of them are giving me side-eye and making comments about how I could “easily help” but just don’t want to.

My stepmom Sarah’s kids do not like me or my dad. But they’re moreso angry at Sarah because her and their dad aren’t together anymore. The issues are here because Sarah lied about the kind of person their dad actually was for most of their lives, so Sarah’s kids worship him and blame Sarah for the marriage not working.



We all go to family therapy. But the whole thing is a waste of time because Sarah and her kids just point fingers the whole time and aren’t receptive to anything the therapist says. My dad forces me to come too, saying I’m also part of the family. But I didn’t willing marry into this mess and I don’t want anything to do with it.



This week, I said I wanted to stay home because I had a lot of homework, including a huge presentation I had to rehearse for. My dad gave me the usual spiel about two hours of therapy a week not getting in the way of anything and it’s to make our family better.



I was stressed about the presentation and snapped at my dad that family therapy is a waste of time, Sarah and her kids just want to point fingers, and I don’t get why I have to be there because I’m 18 and on my way out anyway. I didn’t marry into this family and don’t want any part in their mess.



My dad originally grounded me and took away my electronics. Luckily, he gave me my electronics back the same night, but then lectured me about how he was disappointed, I could make time to help Sarah and the kids are struggling (you get the whole jazz.)

1g6vjst,AITA for asking my parents to start paying rent if they want to keep living with me?,"I’m (19F) in kind of a weird situation. I recently inherited my late grandmother’s house. It’s not a mansion, but it’s a comfortable home in a decent neighborhood. Here’s the thing: my parents (50s) moved in with me shortly after, saying it was temporary because they were struggling financially after some bad investments.



At first, I was fine with it. I mean, they’re my parents, right? But it’s been over six months now, and they seem really comfortable here—too comfortable. They don’t seem to be looking for new jobs or places to live. I’ve been paying for all the utilities, groceries, and maintenance out of my own money, which I saved up while working part-time and from the small inheritance I received.



They keep making these small comments about how it’s “their home too” since I wouldn’t have the house without them and my grandmother. They even redecorated part of it without asking me! I tried bringing up the issue, suggesting they could contribute financially at least by paying rent or utilities, but they got upset. My mom said, “We’re family, we don’t charge each other,” and my dad said it’s selfish to ask them to pay when they’re struggling. But I’m also struggling with balancing work and school, and it’s not like they’re making an effort to move out or even lighten the financial burden.



I love them, but I feel like they’re taking advantage of the situation. I don’t want to evict my own parents, but this is my space and I feel like I have no control over my own home anymore.

1g3sfh5,WIBTA if I told my best friend her wedding sounds like a nightmare?,"So my (27/f) best friend ""Claire"" (27/f) is getting married in February. I'm the maid of honor, which is making me feel like I'd be a super asshole for saying anything.

They're having a small wedding, about 50 people and they're having it at a family members property near a lake. Which is all great, no problems with that.

The nightmare part is the fact that this 50 person wedding is an ALL DAY event. They're having a rehearsal brunch at 10am instead of a rehearsal dinner. And then their ceremony is at 12:30pm. And then they have ""group activities"" scheduled from 2pm-7pm (they've listed cornhole as an example) finally, at 7pm, we eat dinner and the reception is supposed to last till 10:30pm. 

And finally, it's a completely dry wedding. And I had zero objection to the dry wedding until they sent me this agenda. I don't think I need alcohol to have fun. But to spend 12 hours in a nice dress and heels, running around with 50 people I either don't know or barely know (it's mainly family, I'm the only friend from our high school group invited, so I really only know her parents, I've met her fiancee twice), I think I'm going to need at least 2 glasses of wine. 

I feel like an asshole, because it is her day and I love her, but I really think this sounds like a disaster. If I'm just sounding snooty and stuck up, please tell me.

1fut4w6,AITA for telling my friend it’s her fault she chose a deadbeat BD?,"Aita? I've been friends with ""Anna"" for over ten years, we're both 24. Last year she started dating this guy and immediately I could tell he was a bum. Hes 28 and lives in his parents basement, drinks and smokes everyday (literally), hasn't had a job since he was 19, plays video games and watches streams all day, has told her he only bathes every two to three weeks, and is very rude. I've been around him a few times and this is all very evident, he doesn't hide this information. I was shocked that my friend would even look his direction. She has her life together, has a stable job and lives alone. I questioned her on why she was settling for his bum ass and she said she loves him and sees his ""potential"" and that she supports his streamer dreams...


My sister has a deadbeat ex and they  are so similar. I know it's not my place, but before she was even pregnant I warned my friend to get on birth control and use condoms everytime she sleeps with him because he has every sign of being a deadbeat. He doesn't even take care of himself, there's not a single paternal bone in his body. Anyone who brags about not changing their clothes for weeks, pees in bottles, and does substances every day is not good dad material. And in my opinion if you're sleeping with someone especially in a red state like ours, you're consenting to them being the potential parent of your child. She told me I was insane and who thinks that way, and that she has no intentions of getting pregnant.


Well... she did. Just like I expected when she told him he told her to travel to get a termination and she refused. Then he blocked her everywhere. She was devastated during the pregancy saying she can't believe she's doing it alone and I bit my tongue considering her vulnerable state. Well the baby is nine months now and she still complains about how hard being a single mom is, that it's not okay for him to be a deadbeat and that she wishes she could have known he was a deadbeat before having a baby. Again I bite my tongue because I know she's struggling.


Recently she found out that he has a girlfriend and has been going OFF. She's messaging her on social media saying she's disgusting for being with a deadbeat. She asked me recently if I would be willing to confront this girl at her job as a barista with her. I said no. She got upset and said if I was a true friend I would. That's when I reached my boiling point. I told her that I WARNED her before she was even pregnant how big of a loser he is and that she has no place to judge anyone for dating him when she procreated with him and dated him too. She started crying and saying I'm an asshole because it's not her fault she has a deadbeat BD. I just rolled my eyes and said it kind of is.

1g3twpx,AITA for declining to be a bridesmaid because of couple’s cultural? ,"I’m (27F) a mixed girl so I don’t understand the whole thing about Indian dowries. My friend from college was getting engaged and told me when she thought it was happening. She said she thought it was happening soon. They had been together for 3 years which was a long time for an engagement and she said relatives were starting to talk and making her feel like her bf was just screwing around with her and not serious about it.

Then she called me several times in a week which was a lot more often and seemed out of it. I asked her what was wrong and she cried on the phone and admitted the reason he had not proposed was because his parents back in India wanted a large dowry and her family in the US was refusing to pay it. She said her family has been in the US for 2 generations and no one has paid a dowry in that time but his parents are old fashioned and think if they don’t receive a dowry it will show there is something wrong with their family. I don’t understand their reasoning but I told her to break up if he won’t fight for them to be together. She said he won’t because he sees it as something to be discussed between their parents. I’m kind of shocked she still wants to marry this guy. His parents are in India, he is a grown ass man and he won’t marry his gf just because they want money. 

At the end of last year her parents agreed to pay a dowry because she begged them. She says it’s much lower than they asked and they are not happy but agreed. 

I got an invite for their wedding for Jan 2025 in California. I called her and told her I couldn’t attend and apologized. She was shocked and said I was one of the few friends she could invite and I said I couldn’t because I don’t think I should go to a wedding if I don’t think she is marrying a good person. She said she disagrees with the dowry practices but it wasn’t for me to judge if demanding it meant someone was a good person. I just said I disagree with the wedding happening because her parents had to effectively bribe someone to have it happen. She got mad and said I should RSVP no and hung up. I feel guilty because she clearly wanted me there but the whole thing is really gross to me. But AITA for judging cultural practices from a culture I’m not a part of?

1g63rjm,AITA for “not following through” on the rent to own agreement I had with my brother?,"My (F33) brother (M39) is an outgoing, likable guy. 

But, sticking to things (whether it’s a job or a relationship) long-term isn’t his thing.

Last spring, my husband and I purchased acreage where we wanted to build our new home. The question came up as to what we would do with our current home. We decided to rent instead of immediately sell. My brother and his new, third wife made the pitch to move in and “rent to own.” The conversation started over dinner with my parents and, admittedly, we let my parents’ advocacy for my brother sway our decision. They realized this was the only chance my brother had to own something so they pushed.

At the time, my brother had a full-time job at a phone carrier and had also been given an AMAZING deal by his old boss to purchase the DJ company he worked nights for - the guy was moving, offered to sell the business for just the cost of the equipment financed out of his own pocket. Bro’s cell phone job had benefits, and the DJ company was a multimillion dollar business, so my husband and I made the mistake of hoping that this time my brother would take advantage of his perfect storm of opportunity.

We agreed to let him rent the house for the cost of our current mortgage (easily a thousand less per month than we could rent it for) and give him 18 months to build up his business and credit and purchase from us then. We agreed to take the total of his “rent“ as his down payment. We agreed any improvements/maintenance would come out of his budget, just as if he already owned the house, but we would give him credit toward the purchase price for anything he put into the place.

Starting at the second month he lived there, rent was late. Then he decided to scrap his full-time job because the DJ company made enough money - problem is, he quit paying his former boss the monthly payments, didn’t bother following up on existing accounts or generating new accounts, just showed up to the already booked gigs like he did when he was just an employee. A bunch of the equipment got ”stolen“ and he couldn’t replace it because he canceled the insurance to save money.  Bro and his wife did nothing to maintain the house, we were constantly getting calls for lawn care, tiny stuff broken, complaints that we took the mower and snow blower with us, on and on. His response to repeated requests for rent payment was to say we could just add it to what he would buy the house for later.

It’s been 18 months and bro has less income, worse credit, and has treated our house like crap. We told him we’re just going to forget about the missed payments, but he needs to move out and the purchase of the house is off the table. He’s pissed that we ”went back on our deal,” and my family is mad (although I suspect it’s just because they’re seeing his last opportunity go down the drain).

This has caused a major rift in the family so AITA for not giving this longer?

1g3tx6f,AITA for not firing the babysitter for driving the kids without car seats,"My ex and I have 3 kids, 4, 3, and 1. I have a regular babysitter, Emma, to watch the kids 3 days a week from 6:30pm-7:30am. She gets the kids ready for bed after dinner, gets them in bed, gets them up and dressed in the mornings, and gets them breakfast. Emma never has to drive the kids so we never got her car seats. 

Last week there was a gas leak. The police and fire department were banging on the doors telling everyone to evacuate. Emma called me but I don’t have my phone on me at work. She called my work but the front desk isn’t the best at picking up the phone at night. At that point she grabbed the kids and took them to Walmart, 5 miles away, and bought car seats, diapers, a change of clothes for everyone, and some other essentials (I reimbursed her). She installed the car seats and brought the kids to my work. I was able to take a few minutes to find somewhere for her to take the kids for the night and the rest of the night went smoothly. 

The kids went to their dad’s house a couple days after and told him they got to ride in Emma’s car without car seats. My ex called to ask about it and I explained that there was a gas leak, they were under mandatory evacuation, and she got them car seats as soon as possible. He asked why she didn’t have car seats and I told him that in the 8 months that she has been working for me, she never had to drive them before this and I can’t afford to spend $700 on car seats that are going to live in the garage. He asked what I did to Emma about her driving them without car seats and I told him I didn’t do anything since she didn’t have another choice. He’s mad that I didn’t fire her and wants to try to get full custody because he doesn’t trust me or her to take care of the kids anymore (he’s a weekend dad).

1gamuu9,AITA for preventing my ex from getting 50/50 custody or our daughter?,"Ex and I separated a few months ago and in the beginning, we were in agreement that 50/50 was the best thing for our daughter. Then we went to the first mediation and I learned he expected me to be fully responsible for finding and paying for childcare on his weeks as well as my own. And if I couldn’t find childcare he expected me to pick her up in the morning before he went to work and bring her back to him when he got back to his apartment. I was not okay with that and said as much. We didn't get anywhere because he insisted all childcare-related tasks were my responsibility since I had always done them. 

After of mediation, he continued to argue with me and I told him that 50/50 custody means he is 100% responsible during his time with her and I am 100% responsible during my time. His counter-off was still 50/50 custody but she could stay with me most of the summer and he would see her everyother weekend but we still switch weeks during the school year. 

I again refused and told him “50/50 custody means 50/50 all year long not just when it's convenient for you.” That apparently got through to him and he's told me I can have primary physical custody and he will take her every other weekend and we split holidays during the school year when he can take vacation to stay with her instead of working. 

But now he’s told his family about our disagreement and they are texting and calling me because I'm stealing his child from him. They think I should continue to be responsible for all childcare all year long since he works so hard and needs the help. His mother was being particularly vocal about it and I asked her why doesn't she volunteer to pay for childcare for him. Her response was that it's too expensive and not her responsibility. Again I disagreed because im not her son's nanny. I told the rest of his family the same thing.

I was sure I was right until his sister who I've always thought of as level-headed also told me I was being unfair. Ex hasn't ever had to do any of those tasks and he shouldn't be expected to start doing them now after so many years. Am I the asshole for telling him he's reasonable for our daughter during his time with her which is now preventing him from having 50/50 custody?

Editing because I forgot to add: I have been exceptionally careful to keep our daughter out of earshot of any verbal conversations around this and I don't let her play with my phone she won't stumble across any of the text exchanges. She loves us both and I dont want to be one of those parents that involves the child in adult matters. 

Second edit because it was brought to my attention I didn't say why us both scheduling and paying for the childcare time we need is possible. Childcare is through her school all year long. We can each have an account and the days needed are selected and paid for a month in advance. It's not a set schedule until then days are paid for.

1gg06pj,AITA for not making enough dinner?,"My wife had a nail appointment after work, so I picked up the kids from daycare tonight.

When I got home around 5:30pm, my older daughter had already made herself one box of Mac & Cheese. The plan for dinner was Mac & Cheese and hotdogs anyway, so I cooked a package of hotdogs and waited to see if I needed to cook more Mac & Cheese.

All of us ate, and there was half a hotdog and a couple of bites of Mac & Cheese left when we were done.

Before I could clean up my wife called to say she was on her way home. I told her that we just finished eating, and that the food was gone, and asked what she wanted to eat. She said she would cook something for herself when she got home. I asked if she was sure, and she said yes.

When she got home she was very upset with me because I didn't cook enough for everyone. I offered to cook more Mac & cheese and hotdogs, but she said no, and continued telling me that I was socially inept and that I didn't understand and I should have made more food. AITA?

1fu07e9,AITA for telling my sister that her ex was watching her while she was naked?,"My sister is temporarily living with my brother and his wife Alice. Alice's brother is my sister's ex and my brother's 'best' friend, we'll call him Lucifer for the sake of the post. Since Lucifer and my sister *technically* broke up 2 years ago my brother feels like it's okay to constantly invite him over for dinner. It makes my sister feel uncomfortable and hurt but because she's living with them she feels like she doesn't have a leg to stand on so she hasn't said anything to my brother or to Alice.

Yesterday I caught him watching my very naked sister like a complete perv. He was outside 'smoking' and Alice asked me to call him inside as dinner was about to be served when I caught him watching my sister who had no idea he could see her. I immediately called him out and told my brother but Lucifer just denied it and my brother believed his blatant lie. My brother asked me not to tell my sister as he thought it was just a misunderstanding but there was no way in hell I wasn't going to let her know her ex was perving on her.

I probably could've waited until after dinner but I told her as soon as she came downstairs. My sister started yelling at Lucifer and my brother kept defending him by making it seem like it was  my sister's fault for not closing the curtains. The thing that really pissed me and my sister off is that Lucifer mostly didn't say a thing but he looked so fucking smug. One thing he did say is that he had seen it all already so he didn't need to try to sneak a peak. My brother did tell him to shut up but he also didn't stop defending him to my sister.

My sister is going to leave my brother's house now even though she really can't afford to. My brother doesn't want her to go because she's 'fragile' so he even convinced Lucifer to apologise to her today somehow but my sister still doesn't want to stay with them anymore. My brother is blaming me for the entire situation because I supposedly twisted the situation to make Lucifer look worse than he is because I don't like him but I think his best friend should stop being a perv and my brother should have more sibling loyalty.

He wasn't a lifeguard but a caveman. I was a bit confused.  My son said he was still going to be a lifeguard for trick or treating. 30 minutes ago he showed me his costume. It was a mullet wig, a lifeguard parka, 80s sun visor glasses and flip glops.

Oh and speedo briefs. 

That's why he wore a different costume at school. Obviously he wasn't going to wear a speedo at school. I said you are not going outside in a speedo. He said his mom was fine with it and his stepdad paid for everything. He thought it was funny.

1fze66q,AITA for taking my dad’s socks out of the dryer?,"I, (17F) needed to do laundry today because I was almost out of clean clothes. In my family, everyone does their own laundry whenever they need; we don’t have a schedule or anything. 

I was home alone because my dad (48M) was at work, and would be for a couple more hours. Before I moved my clothes to the dryer, I noticed my dad’s socks were in the dryer still. They were clean and dry, he just always leaves them in there for days on end before putting them away or moving them. I needed to use the dryer obviously, so I moved the socks to his laundry basket approximately three inches away. My dad is VERY particular about his socks, so I made sure they all were out of the dryer before putting my clothes in. (Our dryer isn’t some vast abyss, so it wasn’t hard to verify they were all out)

When my dad got home, I found him frantic in the laundry room sorting through his socks. He starts yelling at me that he’s told me not to touch his socks, and now one’s missing, and they cost $25 a pair (They aren’t special medical socks or anything, he just really likes high quality socks. To each their own.) and this is all my fault. 

I calmly explained to him that I checked the dryer and I made sure they were all out before I put my clothes in. Then he says that I should have left my wet clothes in the washer until he got home and could move his socks himself. This sounded slightly insane to me. I ask if there’s a chance he forgot to put one in the machine, but no, of course he couldn’t have made a mistake, it had to be me. The sock is currently still missing, and he’s very angry at me.

I know his socks are really important to him, and it’s his house, and he’s told me before not to touch them, but I feel like it might be a little selfish to leave your clean, dry, socks in the dryer other people use for days and days after they’re done, but then get upset when other people need to move them to use the dryer.

1g4l9gh,AITA? Sister in law kicked us out after helping her,"AITA??

My wife and i agreed to help my wife's sister with her two young kids. She moved into a big house, is a single mother. is a president of a company. before she moved, we would help out a lot anyways with the kids, over nights, take to sporting events, take to school, pick up from school, help with her dogs etc.

We rented out our home, and moved in to her house with our senior dogs start of the year, with the promise of her renovating the basement to a full functional house with everything we need. That never happened. We decided to tell her in July its best we move back home after a year as she was not able to fullfill her promise, and we need our own space and that was not going to happen clearly. She was silent and never said anything. refused to listen more to my wife who wanted to help with coordinating scheduled so she could still help with the kids after school.

Aug. 1st she just sent via text to move out that weekend, and would tell the kids we were just on vacation but she wanted us out of the house ASAP. It was devestating and a surprise. Especially how close we are to the kids. My wife made quick arrangements to stay at our close friends. IT was decided i would move 2 hours away with our dogs as i work from home and staying with my wife's mother was the best option while she stayed with our friends in town as it was down the street from her work.

I want nothing to do with her ever for what she did. She continues to gasslight us and say we never did anything in the house. we took care of everything, she only saw us in the evenings when she came home late when we were on the couch before we went to bed . we took care of the kids, the house (she is filthy person to cleain up after ) and said we didtn do anything at home, and doesnt know why we invited ourselves to live at her house!

my wife wants to make nice and move past to see the kids, however i will not be doing anything of the sort as she really damaged us financially and emotionally. it took a toll on my wife and i's relationship, and my mental health.
