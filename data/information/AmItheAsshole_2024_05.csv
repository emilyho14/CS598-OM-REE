1d578oc,"AITA for ""tricking"" my brother into selling me his half of our childhood home then demolishing it? ","My mom and dad divorced when I was young. My brother loved the fact that our mom had no rules for him so he went with her. I abided by the custody agreement because I had no choice in the matter. My mom loves us both but she dotes on my brother like he farts perfume. 

My dad kept the house. He had to buy my mom out. It was an old house built in 1953. It had old wiring and was really less than suitable for modern life. What it did have though was a huge yard that was great growing up. 

My dad passed away during COVID. He left everything equally between my brother and I. I wanted the house. I told my brother that we should tear it down and put in infill housing like that neighborhood is zoned for. He just wanted money. I bought out his half of the house at the market value. It was sold as a teardown. He took the money and bought a car and went on a vacation. He still has money left. 

Then I had the house demolished and built a fourplex. Each unit has three bedrooms, 2 and a half bathrooms, a small yard, and a garage. I kept one unit for myself  and rent each of the other units for $2,000 a month. My mortgage is $1,800 a month for the entire thing. So basically I live free and bank $4,000 a month. 

My brother is pissed that I didn't give him a unit to live in for him since it was his home too. I actually offered to sell him one at cost and he said no. 

I'm lost. I offered him a partnership, I paid a fair price, I offered to sell him a unit, I did everything to try and be fair. He thinks I tricked him because I get ""free"" money every month. 

Our mom said she would be cutting me out of her will and giving everything to him if I didn't give him a unit or the income from one. I agreed that was fair and said that I would no longer feel the need to contribute to her upkeep or retirement when the time came. 

I am being bombarded by the two of them but I took the risks. I took on the debt. This is my money now.

1d2wc7d,AITA for repeatedly calling someone stupid after they accused me of lying about my children’s ethnicity?,"My husband is Dominican and I’m Irish. Our kids look like him in terms of facial features but they inherited my pale skin. Our son has his father’s dark hair but my daughter’s is borderline dark blonde. Genes are weird, what are you gonna do?

Both my kids and myself have my husband’s last name, which is a popular Dominican last name. There have been times we get looks when people hear our last name and my husband isn’t around. But it’s never been too bad and usually, I shrug it off.

Due to my husband’s work schedule, he’s rarely at school events. So, most people just know me. There’s another little girl in my daughter’s class with the same last name as us. Her mom also volunteers often. When we met, she flat out said “you’re not Dominican.” I said, “no. My husband and kids are.” She said “but your last name is (x)”. I said yeah…because it’s my husband’s. She pointed out how pale they are. I just said genes are weird.

But almost every time we see each other, she brings it up somehow. Making comments about how pale the kids are. Finding it weird they don’t know Spanish (my husband didn’t learn growing up so they don’t know it either). I just let it roll off because while it’s weird, I’m not about to get into a pissing contest.

The teacher asked the kids to make collages about their cultures. My daughter’s had stuff related to being a Dominican and stuff related to being Irish. They had a whole culture day where parents were invited. The mom of the other little girl saw my daughter’s collage and rolled her eyes, thankfully not in front of my daughter. There were no other kids around at the time as they were getting food. It was just parents looking at the collages. I asked what her problem is. She said I’m not a real Dominican. I said I never claimed to be. She said my kids aren’t either and that my husband is probably only a little Dominican and we’re claiming a culture that’s not ours.

I was dumbfounded. All I could ask was “are you stupid?” She said there was no need to be defensive. Finally, I had enough, pulled out my phone and showed her pictures of myself with my husband and the kids. She stared at it for a moment and mumbled an apology. I said “yeah, maybe research how genes work so you don’t make yourself look stupid in front of a bunch of 3rd graders”. She got teary eyed and walked away.

I got the stink eye from some other parents which I ignored. When I told my husband later, he said calling her stupid repeatedly, when she already apologized, was an asshole move.

1cnie84,AITA for evicting my brother and his family from the house I have inherited so my daughter can live there?,"I(40f) have a daughter ""Caroline"" (17f), my brother ""Adam"" (34m) is married and has 2 kids under the age of 5.

Back when I was in my twenties our great grandmother ended up with an illness which required someone to take care of her. This ended up being me as everyone else was busy with their lives and I have only recently graduated from uni back then. Due to this when she passed away I have inherited the house she lived in, which is a small 2 bedroom. I have lived there until I got married and me and my husband ended up moving to a bigger property. About a year later my brother asked if I'm willing to rent it out to him, which I agreed to do, but have warned him I will need it back when Caroline turns 18 (She was 3 at the time) since it is very close to universities and city center. Legal agreement was drafted for the rent (significantly below market value) so everything was followed by the book.

About a year ago I have informed my brother about needing the house back as my daughter is going to be 18 and I would like to have some repairs done before she moves in. My brother ignored me, so I have issued him notice to vacate, which was also ignored. As he continued to ignore me, I had no choice but apply for a court order to evict them, with hearing taking place last month. Last week him and his family were officially evicted. Upon getting into the house I have noticed it wad in horrible condition and it would take a few months just to make it somewhat habitable, let alone do redecorating or repairs.

I have raised this with my brother since he was meant to look after the house and let me know of any repairs, but this talk ended up in an argument where I was called an asshole for evicting him and his family so my ""spoiled"" daughter can live by herself and not giving them enough notice (they had just over a year to find something suitable). He also said I have inherited the house by ""cheating"". My parents are on his side since Adam and his family live with them.",AccomplishedMango209,11560,0.9599999785423279,908,1715209920,2024-05-08 18:12:00,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cnie84/aita_for_evicting_my_brother_and_his_family_from/,5,2024

1d240bm,AITA for asking our babysitter to set alarms when she sleeps?,"My wife and I(34) have three children ages 7, 4 a 9 month old. I work a demanding job(in the medical field) and work many many hours, my wife not so much but she does have night shifts often. We just got a new babysitter a few months ago after our one we had for 2 years moved for college.  Our new babysitter is only 16, but she had been babysitting one of my coworkers children for awhile and I trust him. 

A few nights ago my wife and I were both working nights and I saw on the camera that our babysitter was asleep on the couch and the baby had woken up was crying for almost 30 minutes while she slept. That bothered me, so without talking to my wife when I got home in the morning I had told my babysitter maybe she should set alarms throughout the night to make sure she’s awake since the baby monitor didn’t wake her and that it was not okay for her to leave the baby crying like that.

 I guess it hurt the kids feelings because she mentioned it to my wife and my wife is really upset with me because “she’s only 16” and what I was asking is unreasonable and that this has never happened before so again I’m being unreasonable and that I should’ve talked to her first because this could’ve been a “learning experience.” She also said I was completely out of line as well. I’m really not worried about a learning experience but am worried about the fact if my children are cared for properly.

1d25mhh,AITA for not accommodating someone because she never spoke up?,"I (28f) recently went out with a few friends and some of their friends. Eventually we were discussing where to get food. I suggested a few places like pizza, Chinese, sushi, Korean, etc. People gave opinions, like they were/weren't feeling XYZ or they have certain allergies. This one girl, Abbie, never spoke up even when I specifically asked her. I didn't know her well but wanted to include her, but she would just mumble and not give a definitive answer. Eventually we settled on korean food.

There were few people in the group who weren't too familiar with the food so I explained the menu. Everyone seemed to enjoy the food and I thought that was that.

Towards the end of the meal, Abbie started whining about the food. She didn't like this, she didn't like that, she was unfamiliar with the food, she couldn't even ""choose"" the restaurant. Few people reminded her that I specifically asked her where she wanted to eat and it was a group consensus. (Just for the record, I'm an introvert but can be very opinionated and can speak up for myself.)

I asked Abbie why she didn't speak up earlier and she responded she didn't want to upset anyone. My tone turned harsher and said ""well you could've said something earlier instead of whining and causing a scene now. Why bring it up at the end of it if you didn't want to cause trouble?""

Abbie's face turned red as she got up, paid, and left.

1cit51q,AITA for not going to another restaurant after my boyfriend refused to order from where I stopped?,"Earlier today I asked my boyfriend to go with me to run some errands. When we finished I was hungry and picked a Mexican restaurant for lunch. It was more of an authentic place which I absolutely loved but my boyfriend said nothing looked appealing. He gave me money for my meal and said he was going to go to a place down the street. 10 minutes later he's back because the place had a really long wait
time.

I made some suggestions from the menu he would probably like to try but he said no. He said he told me last week he was burned out on Mexican food when we went out for dinner with my parents because 'we always eat it'. He didn't order anything that night either which was really embarrassing to have someone at the table not eating the entire time and trying to explain to my mother and step-dad in a way that didn't sound disrespectful. 

Service at this place was rather slow so I wound up taking most of my meal with me. He said to stop along the way to my place so he can get something to eat. I said no because he knew I had to be home by a certain time for a maintenance person and everything he wanted was in the opposite direction.

We got back to my place and he said he was going to go home because he was starving. I said he could stay and cook something here but he said no and that he needed space after I 'made him starve'. I told him he wouldn't be starving if he hadn't been picky and he left. He's still mad at me so AITA here?

ETA: No I am not Mexican but my stepdad is so I grew up eating it most my life. My stepdad picks where we choose to eat each week or he won't go, and they want all of us there each week or its a whole drama. I do cook other kinds of food sometimes. I do eat different food when I go to his home. When my boyfriend eats with me including our weekly meal with my parents it's only 3-4 days eating some kind of Mexican cuisine. I'll start asking him where he'd like to go when I drive.

The place he walked to was like 5 minutes away but he thought he wouldn't have time to wait for take-out since take-out was a 35 minute wait. Usually the sit down places I go to are pretty quick, like get your food 10-15 minutes after ordering. When we realized the place I chose was slow he didn't have time to go back or place an order online. I acknowledge that just picking the restaurant on a whim driving by it instead of asking if he wanted to stop for food was wrong of me. I'll pick up something I know he likes and take it to him at work for lunch.",crow_of_paradise,6425,0.8500000238418579,2689,1714689861,2024-05-02 17:44:21,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cit51q/aita_for_not_going_to_another_restaurant_after_my/,5,2024
1cjlv3y,AITA for failing to stop my MIL buying ‘landfill’ for my kids at a funfair?,"
I went to a local funfair with my kids & mother in law (MIL).

We decided to walk around looking at all the rides before deciding what to go on. 

MIL had forgotten her wallet so it would be me buying any rides. (This let me relax about the sometimes tricky dynamic of who is paying for what.)

As we walked past a prize stall (pay money to win a prize), MIL commented in shock at the high price & I agreed.

At the next ride, my husband joined us. He & I were chatting when we noticed that MIL had gone back to the previous prize stall with the kids.

He asked urgently what I had agreed with her about that stall, & I (slightly confused at his urgency) remembered we had both thought it overpriced.

I knew she didn’t have money on her so I assumed they had just gone back to look.

We have disagreed with MIL many times about her excessive (in our view) gifts for the kids. Each visit she buys toys which soon get discarded, or more sweets & snacks than the kids can eat.

This is important to us because (a) we want to teach the kids moderation & value rather than excessive disposable expenditure, (b) we are worried about the environment & the excess of toys contributes to landfill, (c) while she has the right to use her money, the amount spent on this stuff feels wasteful when it could be used for more lasting things for the kids.

Back to the fun fair.

My husband insisted I tell him what I had “agreed” with MIL. We hadn’t agreed anything, I told him. We agreed it was priced too high?

I then noticed she had taken out her phone to pay using her contactless payment.

Husband said he didn’t want her buying it, & I said he should go tell her. He insisted he didn’t want to do that before finding out what I had agreed with her. 

I told him if he could see what was happening he should go & stop her.

By now it was finished & I said look it’s done now, it’s her money to spend & if she wants to have fun with the kids by spending £15 on a prize stall that’s up to her, & that I hadn’t “agreed” anything with her as I believed she had forgotten her wallet.

After we got home he picked a huge fight with me, telling me he was really distressed by the landfill of the prizes (the toys are already falling apart), & the repeated messages this kind of spending sends to the kids about the value of things. 

His main complaint at me is that when we first saw the stall before he joined us, he insists I should have told MIL not to buy it for the kids, & the facts that (a) I believed she had no means of paying & (b) had commented on how overpriced it was were not relevant, I still should explicitly have said that we didn’t want her to buy anything. 

I think this is unreasonable & would have made things really awkward at what was supposed to be a fun outing.

He says it’s my fault that MIL spent her money on poor quality prizes which will be landfill by next week.

Was it my fault?",ImaginaryMammoth8643,6408,0.949999988079071,1208,1714777570,2024-05-03 18:06:10,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cjlv3y/aita_for_failing_to_stop_my_mil_buying_landfill/,5,2024
1cnhi4x,AITA for not getting my daughter anything for her birthday?,"My daughter turned 13 yesterday. I made sure to ask her what she wants for her birthday a few months in advance. She gave me a list. Great. I explained she won't be getting everything from the list as it was big and some things were expensive. She understood.

About a week after we had that conversation, she tells me she wants tickets to a show for her birthday. Going to the show would also mean traveling a little out of the city. Neither are cheap. So I told her that would be the only gift she would get and would also replace a party. She said that's what she wants and I triple checked before I booked tickets.

A couple of weeks ago, would you believe, she tells me she changed her mind again. She wants clothes instead of the show. I told her I already booked everything so there's absolutely no way. She got into a strop about it and said she isn't going. I told her fine I'll take someone else, fully expecting her to later apologize and say she is coming.

But the apology never came. In fact her attitude got worse and she got into trouble at school. She asked me if I got her the clothes and I told her no, I'm sticking to my word. I don't think she believed me. Well her birthday came and she realized I wasn't bluffing. I didn't get her any gifts. She was appalled and I was the worst mother ever. I told her she's learned a valuable lesson. I really wanted to make her birthday special but she was being awful. Of course other relatives got her things but none from me.

She told her grandparents her side of the story. Which was of course all one sided making her out as a victim. They called me and I explained to them the whole truth. They also think I'm awful and the ""poor girl"" needs gifts from her mother. I told them next year will be different if she behaves. 

AITA?

1cuhn0r,AITA for telling my girlfriend not to call my dad “doctor”?,"

My(28m) girlfriend recently got her doctorate. I’m obviously very happy for her and proud of her. 

Since then, she has been greeting my father as “Doctor” [lastname]. Although he does have a doctorate degree, no one has ever called him that, and he told me it makes him uncomfortable. 

I asked her to not call him that. She says that she wants to be polite and call him by his title. She now wants to be called doctor when might parents greet her as well. 

I understand it’s a massive accomplishment but I don’t think she should expect my parents to call her doctor? And she should not call my dad doctor if he asks her not to.

1cke3wt,AITA for having a bigger reaction to a strangers gift then my husbands?,"For Context: I 30F just had birthday, my husband got me 30 gifts to mark the event. Nothing big, just different little items. None of the items were anything I’d buy myself in particular. My husband has the habit of buying things he likes or finds cool but not really thinking of the other person. For example: one of the items was a nice set of colored pencils, I have a specific art style and only draw with black pens. Or a nice vase that is very specifically his style. 

However I was still extremely grateful and made sure he knew this. 

My sisters own a bar, so I go there and am around quite often. They have a regular who comes to the bar maybe 2 times a week for the last 2 years so I see him pretty frequently. I’d never seen him outside of the bar. We have a joke about how aliens are probably watching all of us and every once in a while throw crazy things at us just to see how it plays out. 

Anyways the other day we went in to have drinks for my birthday, the regular came and told me happy birthday and handed my a small pouch. In the pouch was 100 dollars and a small silver alien holding a diamond. Also a note that said, “I’m hoping the aliens give you everything you deserve.”

I started crying, it was just so thoughtful especially since I was expecting anything. I thanked him and gave a hug, he went about his way. My husband was acting strangely the rest of the night. When we got home I asked what was wrong and he told me that he was upset about the way I reacted to the gift. He said I didn’t act that way about his gift that he worked really hard on. He said that it was inappropriate for the regular to give me a gift. He said I was a AH for reacting that way especially in front of him. But it was just a natural reaction. He doesn’t want me to keep the gift. 

I feel really badly but I want to keep the gift. So AITA? 

Not a real diamond and he gives $100 to all the staff on their birthday. 

I just want to thank everyone for the responses, it gave me a lot to think on. I will say this an a man twice my age, I’m 99% sure he likes men and in no way it remotely flirtatious in my opinion. Also this was not a ring or piece of jewelry it’s just something you put on a desk.

We spent our vacation time the last two years visiting her grandparents who live across the country. Recently her grandparents (85), moved out of their house and into retirement living and no longer had space for both of their vehicles. Her grandpa decided to gift my BIL a truck with a fair value of $50,000. His justification was to ""help him build confidence"" and ""give him something to care for.""

We have a trip planned to visit them in a few months, but I have no interest in going to see them. I am mad at myself for letting money ruin my perception of them, but I do not appreciate how my wife was treated. I feel they take her for granted. We always go out of our to visit them. All of our trips are self-funded. We have never asked anything of them while lots of her cousins have been baled out financially. I just have an icky feeling about the whole thing.

I (30F) have a very small, not very close family. I have an aunt and uncle, who have three children (my cousins, two of whom are still minors) and I had my sister (40f). My parents have passed away. My sister and I weren't very close. She had three boys (9,7, and 6) and was a single mom. 

Last year I was accepted to a PhD program. I am set to start in the fall and I plan on moving in a couple months to get settled before the semester starts.

My sister passed away just after the start of the year. She had some health issues that unfortunately caught up with her. Obviously I was still upset to hear of her passing and went to her funeral. After the funeral, my aunt and uncle asked to meet.

My nephews are staying with them for the time being, but they want me to take over their care. I explained to them that I couldn't since I was moving soon to attend my program. They urged me to put it off. I told them it didn't work like that. I couldn't put things off until all three of the boys were able to be on their own. They asked if I could take them with me and I told them that wasn't possible.

Despite this, after she cooked, the kitchen was left in what I would consider a disastrous state—spills on the counter, pots not cleaned properly, and utensils misplaced. It took me hours just to calm down after seeing the mess. The next day, I calmly explained how distressed it made me feel and asked if she could cover the cost of a professional cleaning service to restore it to its original condition.

She was shocked and upset by my request, arguing that she had already contributed by buying groceries and spending her evening cooking for us. My husband thinks I was too harsh and should have cleaned it myself or let it go this time. This has caused tension between us and his sister.

1cp1h69,AITA for not wanting to walk her down the aisle or lie in a speech?,"I (41M) have two kids with my ex wife, (42F) a son John(22) and daughter Sally (20), I'm remarried to my wife (28). I'm very close with my kids, my son is engaged to Abbie, she seems nice but has been a bit pushy trying to create relationships with me and my wife, though she's also awkward with her. Abbie isn't close to her family, she told us many stories why and while some of her complaints don't seem awful, it's not my place to judge and I didn't live it so I can't know anyway. 

We've tried to be welcoming but Abbie has forced her way into some family traditions where she wouldn't have been invited, and some where no one outside of specific family would have. She has been calling Sally ""sis"" since they were only dating a few months, has an odd sister/mother-in-law thing she does with my wife, and the one I'm not a fan of, wants me to be like father to her. Not because we've clicked or anything. We are very different people, not saying that in a bad way, just saying it's not based on how we get along or anything. 

My kids and I have a tradition when they come over that we have a private catch-up in my office/study before they leave, which is now even more important to them because while they both get along well with my wife they don't want to have personal conversations around her yet. Abbie asked if we could talk, and after I explained the tradition John later asked that I do it, saying she'd never had a caring conversation with her dad. We compromised that I didn't include her in the tradition but do join the two of them for coffee and let her talk. Then she started calling me dad, they werent even engaged yet, John pulled me aside and begged me to give her that, laid this whole thing on me about me always being the dad she always wanted right in front of her and she just wanted that, told me she cried watching me and Sally together (she still gives me random hugs, I'm a lucky dad). I didn't like it but I do feel bad so fine I gave her that. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and the father/daughter dance. I don't want to walk her down, and I walk with a cane so dancing is hard. At my own wedding I only danced twice. John is begging for me to do one, preferably the aisle. 

They came over Sunday, John and I were talking, I thought to address it, when Ab walked in without knocking, asking if he'd told me yet. I asked what, John said she wanted me to say something about having a second daughter now in my speech and how I loved her. I just looked at him. She asked if I'd do the walk and dance for Sally, I said of course. She yelled she's my daughter too and I said it will never be the same, Sally is my actual daughter. I tried to explain I'd talk about her being a happy addition to the family and I love how happy she makes Jack, which i thought was a good compromise, but she started crying. John apologized and they left, but he called me when they were home nearly begging me to.

1cob8oh,AITA for accepting a part in a play even though my boyfriend doesn't approve?,"I (16, F) have been a part of my school's theater company since I was in middle school. Theater means a lot to me, and it's given me a community of silly, talented, amazing people that make up my core friend group. While they would get all the leads for each show (both at our school and local community theaters), I never got anything higher than an ensemble part or a part with a few lines, and it always hurt me a lot because I would feel excluded. I've never let myself feel too discouraged by this, and I've been able to do a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff for shows I'm not a huge part of, like building sets, making props, and directing. This would always be super fun, but never as fun as being onstage and being a part of all the inside jokes my other friends would bring up outside of rehearsals (and this only added to me feeling excluded).

Anyway, me and my friends all auditioned for a local teen production of Little Shop of Horrors last week, with four of us (including me) all auditioning for Audrey. We audition, and I think I do pretty well, but part of me knows I won't get the part. Well, yesterday, the cast list came out, and to my surprise, I GOT AUDREY!! I'm so excited and still buzzing over the fact that I finally have a lead, and one of my dream roles no less. All of my friends were extremely supportive and there was no tension among any of us over the results of the cast list, so I accepted the part right away before dancing around my room and going out for ice cream with my friends. 

When I got back, I texted my boyfriend of a year (17, M) about the news, expecting congratulations and excitement (since he knows how big of a deal finally getting a lead is for me), but instead, he told me I should reject the part because I'd have to kiss the guy playing Seymour, and also generally act romantically around him onstage, and that makes him uncomfortable. The guy playing Seymour is one of my close friends I've known since 7th grade, and our relationship has always been purely platonic (he also has a boyfriend of his own). I can see how my boyfriend would be uncomfortable since I'd be acting romantically with someone who isn't him, and with someone I'm pretty close to. I told him I already accepted my part and he left me on read, and I don't really know how I'm feeling at the moment. I'm hurt because he hasn't congratulated me, but I feel bad for potentially hurting him and accepting the part without talking to him about how it would affect our relationship.

1cqljhp,AITA for refusing to wear the dress my mother-in-law bought me?,"About 2 weeks ago was my brother-in-law's wedding and they were VERY clear that it was a formal event and they wanted everyone dressed nicely. My MIL told me that the dress I planned to wear wasn't formal enough and offered to buy me one that would fit the occasion better since I don't exactly have the money to buy myself a fancy dress right now. Let me be clear that I LOVE my MIL and I was very grateful for her offer. I sent her a link to a dress that I liked and she agreed to order it and have it shipped to me. 

The dress came the other day and it's NOT the one I asked for. It's nice, but its not what I wanted. Its a completely different cut and color from what I asked her to get. Even though it's a nice dress I hated the way it looked on me, so I just wore the dress I was originally planning to wear. It didn't perfectly fit the dress code but I figured it was close enough. Apparently not because the moment my MIL saw me she was asking why I wore it instead of the dress she bought me. She was very upset at me for not wearing the other dress considering she paid for it (which I understand but it still wasn't what I asked for).

When I told her it was the wrong dress she said that she ordered a different one on purpose because she thought it would ""fit me better"". Which it didn't because it looked awful on me. She also said the one I sent her was a bit pricey, but she's not exactly living paycheck to paycheck, she has the money for it. She let it go after a while but I'm starting to feel bad for it.

1ci0153,AITA for thinking each of my kids getting their own room is more important than my new husband having 3 to himself?,"My new husband and I agreed before we scheduled our wedding that, even though space would be tight, we would lIve in his house. We have a master bedroom & a second bedroom upstairs, a main floor office/bedroom, and a finished basement with a legal bedroom, a second good- size room, and a storage room. Each floor has a full bathroom. We have 3 children who live with us, 17, 14 & 12. They are all mine, his are all out of the house. We decided to give the basement bedroom to the 17, upstairs second bedroom to the 14, and the office to the 12. That would leave the second room and storage room in the basement for my husband's exclusive use for his activities- magic & writing. WE ALL 5 AGREED TO THIS. 

We married in December and moved in towards the end of March. He was nowhere near ready (chronically late), but I had a tenant moving into my home and we had to leave it. Now we've been here a month (with a box or two & a suitcase each, most the rest is in a storage unit or was sold/donated/tossed) and my husband just decided he writes best in the office, so the 12 & 14 year- olds will have to share a room. I think he's being selfish, he could easily write in his magic room, which he has to himself. As a compromise, my 12 said he could have his office and give the her the storage room instead (I'm sure I could fix it up nice for her!). He says no, he needs all 3 rooms to be able to write and do magic. He & I have dated/been married for almost 6 years now and he's maybe used each room 5 times. He's disabled but wants to try to make some money on the side as a magician (he's great & he was an outstanding magician in his youth, so this may be possible). I just don't think he requires 3 tooms of the house to do this, that 2 should be sufficient. 
The only other 2 rooms in the house are the kitchen (my husband also cooks and has every gadget and ingredient, so there isn't always a place to sit in there...) and the living/dining room (one room). My husband spends most of his time watching tv or researching magic tricks in the living/dining, so the kids can't really hang out in there, either. So the only place they have where they can choose what they do or have alone time is their room. 
I am paying half the mortgage, all the food, and for everything the kids or I need. He pays the other half the mortgage, gas/electric, and for everything he needs. If he has a show (he did one last fall) we ALL help (making things, set up, tear down) and I invest $4 figures in it. So we feel like we're being supportive.
I think each kid should get their own room, AS WAS AGREED to before we got married. And my husband should make it work with 2 rooms instead of 3.

1d4gqm8,AITA for telling my mom I don’t want to care for her kids ,"AITA for not wanting to care for my siblings

I (20f) have a sister (16f) and two half siblings from our mom’s new marriage (3m) and an infant sister. My mom insists on my help with the youngest siblings, constantly, without notice. She wants me to babysit, or feed them, or give them baths. Most of the time it’s fine, but sometimes it’s overboard. For context in my reactions: I have autism, high functioning/ Asperger’s.

The situation: Today she asked me to give them baths, I did. It was hard because of my sensory issues and the fact they were both screaming bloody murder in my ear over wanting my mom to give them baths instead. It was okay though, I pushed through, got them dressed through the screaming. Then I left them in the living room with her and started to go back to my room. She asked if I could hold the baby a little longer. I did, but she was screaming and crying still, so it was hard. The only time she’d calm down was if my mom held her, and she didn’t want to because she was getting ready to leave for an AA meeting. At this point I was extremely overstimulated. I was standing sort of rigid, but still holding the baby acceptably, I thought. She began to yell at me, saying I wasn’t holding her with the right body language, and if I held her “like I cared about her” she wouldn’t cry. I told her she’s probably crying because she wants to be held by her mom, separation anxiety, because no matter how much I coddled her before, she still cried. This is a consistent thing that’s happened since my sister started going to daycare. Maybe I am a bit rigid after being screamed at, but still I don’t feel like my body language was the issue. My mom eventually got fed up and told me to put her in the feeding chair, so I did and started to walk back to my room. She then started to rant on about how she still needs my help with watching them longer and how I don’t care about my brother and sister. She said she shouldn’t have to ask for help. It didn’t even occur to me that it was assumed for me to stick around and watch them because their father is home. All she asked was that I give them a bath, then hold the baby, and I did that. This escalated into an argument in which I told her that her children aren’t my responsibility, especially not at 20 years old, and while I don’t have a problem helping out sometimes, I’m not her employee and both can’t (because of autism) and won’t (because I wouldn’t want to if I could) predict what she wants from me in order to wait on her hand and foot.

I do live at home for free, so it could be entitled of me to be so averse to helping her with them. I do other things, I’m the only one in the house who cleans regularly (every other day) and that’s easy for me as it doesn’t involve any crazy variables & never changes. But I do not want to help with my siblings the amount she wants.",kydism,2767,0.9599999785423279,295,1717109587,2024-05-30 17:53:07,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1d4gqm8/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_dont_want_to_care_for/,5,2024
1cva3j9,AITA for not moving my wedding date? *UPDATE*,"Hey everyone! It's been a while (I forgot my password), but a few people asked for updates on how my last post turned out. Unfortunately, a lot of you may not like the answer. 

Almost all of you said not to change the date, and to enjoy my time without them there. I followed half of that advice. I eventually did relent to my family and change the date of the wedding. My fiancé (now husband!) said that the date wasn't as important as my happiness, and the fighting with my parents was destroying that. Now after six months, we both wish we hadn't because it was useless.

They still didn't show up. Not only that, but they convinced 90% of my family not to show up either. I ended up with only four relatives there in a crowd of about 100 guests.

My mother claimed that I had been ""excluding her from planning"" (by scheduling venue tours on days that my fiance and I were both free but I didn't realize she was working, and by finding my dress by surprise on a ""just here to look"" trip without her being there). They hadn't shown any interest in planning, so I mainly didn't want to bother them. To them, this was ""clearly a sign that you don't want us there"". So they went out of town on the new date.

In the end, narcissist mother still got her yoga, I still moved my date, and I still walked myself down the aisle.

But my petty self did, in fact, strike back. I had an amazing time, and I made sure that I left obvious empty seats marked for them and told everyone the truth with a smile when they asked. The few family members that did show are now no longer speaking to them either, as are all of the friends who came. The only exception is my brother (who I'm pretty sure they asked to relay the details of the party to them), and even he has almost entirely cut them out due to how they've acted.

I haven't spoken to my mother since about a month before the wedding, when she told me to get all of my old things out of her house. I speak to my father very rarely, and only over things like deaths in the family. My in-laws have basically taken me in as their own, and I'm far happier than I ever was in the nightmare of a family I grew up with. Life is good.

TLDR: moved the date of the wedding so mom could go to yoga, parents still didn't show, had a better day without them than I would have with them there, finally cut contact with those narcissists",friendlylocalnpc,2730,0.9700000286102295,120,1716074271,2024-05-18 18:17:51,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cva3j9/aita_for_not_moving_my_wedding_date_update/,5,2024
1clw8w7,AITA for not wanting to attend my brother’s wedding because and for calling my SIL rules stupid? ,"Im 27F dentist and my brother 32M and his soon wife 27F are getting married in less than 2 months. Let’s call my SIL Abby. Abby and I never had a relationship of our own. We definitely don’t hate each other but we are not besties. We just exist in each others presence.
I noticed that in the invitation to their weeding that Abby requested the dress code to be all women in the wedding to wear off the shoulder dresses, suits or anything just off the shoulder. Doesn’t matter the color or the sequence unless it is off the shoulder.

Now as I said I am a dentist and as many people already know dentists may not have the best back/shoulder posture ever. And Im not an exception and I always tend to wear outfits that do not emphasize that part of my body.  Now the type of clothing this dress code demands needs someone with a good back posture because that’s the emphasis. I totally lack that and yes I did try one dress of the shoulder on looked absolutely horrendous.

So I asked if I the dress code is really that important and if I have to abide it but my brother told me Abby stressed on this dress code so much. And Abby was like if she “leeways” me she has to leeway everyone (I was kinda baffled that so much importance was placed on a certain type of clothing with no explanation given) 

I went with my friend shopping hoping I’d find one that I looked not so clownery in. I tried on so many different fits, looked like shit in all of them. So I told my mother since they are so attached to that dress code then I think the best option here for me is to not go. So I wouldn’t ruin their organization and I wouldn’t have nightmares about how awful I looked in that event. But my mum got mad at me and said Im being dramatic for not wanting to be there for brother and family just for a dress. I told her I want to attend but I also want to look good and feel pretty and they are sticking to such a stupid rule that they can’t provide a meaning. Regardless I respected that and decided not to ruin their image of how they want their wedding. My mum said my absence will also ruin things because the guests will wonder why the sister is not attending when Im healthy. I told her well the guests will also wonder why I look like I could be the guy of hunchback Notre Dam (okay Im not that bad but you get the gist here) My mum is still mad at me (haven’t told my brother and SIL yet)",Useful_Flower2687,2607,0.8899999856948853,2034,1715034868,2024-05-06 17:34:28,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1clw8w7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_attend_my_brothers/,5,2024
1cl4gmd,AITA for not treating my step daughter like my daughter?,"Iam 38F married to my husband 42M. Back when I was 16 I gave birth to my daughter, Mary, dad deadbeat but we’re fine now anyways. I started business in my early 20s and now Im considerably wealthy. My husband has a daughter, jane, who’s only 1 year older than Mary. We got married 2 years ago and one of our main “aims” with this marriage was to have a nice accompany as we both had almost the same experience with love/sex/birth as his ex left him with Jane just like my ex left me with Mary. However,Im objectively wealthier than my husband, he’s not poor , I just make more money and finances never been a main topic to us both thankfully. 

Now Mary works in a certain institution and makes her own money and pays her own bills. But I also like to spoil her with money and luxury and we travel alot together sometimes I give her money to travel alone. Like she’s fine on her own financially but I give her always. Also Mary has a boyfriend he’s somewhat well off and always pays for their dates so Mary wanted to surprise him on his birthday but her plans were kind off above budget so I paid the rest. 

Everything was fine until  Jane called me saying she wants me to give her 2K for her and her friends to travel for a little vacation. I told her 2K for a vacation is alot I can help her with sone but she then brought up everything I get and pay for Mary and never her. I told her because Mary has no one but me, as my husband doesn’t contribute anything to Mary so obviously I’ll direct my efforts to her and she also work she doesn’t just depend on me. Let’s just say that phone call wasn’t the nicest. 

I know the whole perception of if you marry someone with kids then they’re your kids too, sure Jane is not a kid she was 21 when I got married to her father. So that’s why it was never logical for me to become her mother just like she never tried to become my daughter just like my husband never tried to be Mary’s father. This family started with all adults and I never try to separate Jane and her father nor get between them.

She has always been a huge fan of a lot of rock bands, particularly emo bands. This by itself doesn't bother me at all, in fact I love the music too and we go to concerts together all the time. What bothers me is that she has posters of these bands tacked up everywhere around our house. Our bedroom walls are COVERED in them. And I mean covered. There is not a single inch of wall space in our bedroom that is not dedicated to her band posters. Everywhere I go, everything I do, therd are always eyes of a hundred emo men following me around. It sounds stupid, and it probably is to be honest, but I don't think I can stand another night's sleep feeling like I am being watched constantly. I don't want to be ""watched"" by the members of My Chemical Romance or Taking Back Sunday or 21 pilots as we make love.

1ci13ea,AITA for refusing to knit a blanket for my new grandson even though I’ve made them for my other grandchildren?,"I 53F am married to my husband Dan 59M. Dan has 2 kids Jack 35M and Adam 31M with his ex and I have two kids 29M and 27F with my ex. As a blended family, our kids have all been supportive and they were all out the house by the time we started dating so they didn’t care. 

All of our kids have children, so for all my grandchildren I have knitted a blanket for when my grandkids first leave the hospital, which has been a tradition since I made the first one. 

Adam has recently introduced us to Kate 30F, his coworker. Kate was married and Adam was dating Sarah 33F, who at the time was pregnant with my grandson (Adam and Sarah’s second baby), when Kate and Adam started their affair. Kate realised she was pregnant so she got a divorce and Adam broke up with Sarah. Adam and Kate’s relationship has not gone down well with anyone, with Dan and Jack  refusing to see Kate or Adam. Dan’s ex cheated on him which is still a sore topic for Dan and Jack as he remembers his mom and why they have especially struggled. 

Through this, I have maintained a relationship with Sarah who is really struggling. Her family haven’t spoken to her since she had my granddaughter Annie 3F without being married. Adam didn’t go to a single appointment for Sarah and instead I have gone with her which has created a rift between me and Adam as I refuse to go with Kate.

The blankets I make are very intricate, and take months to make as I make them slowly. I decided to only make one for Sarah’s baby and not Kate’s, Adam never asked for a blanket so I assumed he understood I was not making him and Kate one. I maintain a civil relationship with Adam but I am also upset at how he treated Sarah, and how he now ignores her and their baby.

Sarah recently had her baby and I was with her whilst she was in labour. I gave her the blanket and she posted her baby’s hand and the blanket on her social media. Adam has contacted me to say Kate is infested in having a blanket for their baby and he told me how much it would mean to them as Kate has no family and they ant their child to be part of the family and think that we will all come around later.

I am on the fence, I am angry for Sarah and her baby but Adam is family and I don’t want to make rash decisions that can cause more drama in the family especially as Adam’s and Sarah’s two kids are involved, with Annie old enough to understand the dynamics.

1cp3df4,AITA for not giving my sister any of my money even though I am in a significantly better financial situation?,"My (26F) sister (32F) ""Bethy"" and I are both stay-at-home moms. I have 1F twins; she has three sons, 6M, 4M, and 2M.

My husband, Micheal, is a master plumber who makes excellent money; he owns his own business, and I couldn't be prouder of him. I used to be a librarian; I have my MLS and bachelor's in Education. During the birth of our girls, on the way to the hospital in the ambulance, we hit a speed bump, and I was injured. I am now an ambulatory wheelchair user and attend physical therapy, as I am learning to walk again. I hurt from my hips down, but my babies are worth it. We decided I would be a SAHM after my first surgery, and my husband gives me $3000/month to use how I want to, as ""payment for being such a good mom"" We are extraordinarily blessed financially, and I'm happy being able to see my girls growing up.

Bethy's husband, Jackson, is an elementary school teacher, but teaching doesn't pay much in our state. Bethy has been a SAHM for the entirety of her marriage and is used to having to scrimp and save for things.

She asked me out for coffee recently and I accepted. I was chatting with her when I mentioned that our girls would start baby swim classes soon. I was happy the pool was wheelchair accessible. Bethy started ranting about how expensive swimming lessons are and how she could never afford to put her boys in swimming. I said I was also excited about playgroup this week, as I had been nervous to go the first time we had gone because none of the other moms and dads in the group used mobility aids. When I mentioned the name of the playgroup I go to with my girls, Bethy became angry because it's one of the more expensive playgroups.

She was angry because ""I knew money was tight."" and ""I didn't even think to invite her and Jackson's son because then she wouldn't have to pay for daycare. She then asked if my husband gave me an allowance. She was a bit angry, and people were starting to stare, so I said yes and asked her to keep her voice down. She wondered how much it was, and I told her. She asked if I could give it to her, and I told her no because I like to treat myself after my physio appointments, and I want to save as much as possible for a rainy day fund.

Bethy said she and her husband have nothing but rainy days and left the restaurant without paying. I feel embarrassed and ashamed that I'm not helping her when I know I could. Still, when I asked Micheal he said that my sister could get a job and reminded me that I became a SAHM because it was something we agreed we were financially stable enough to do as well as because of my mobility limitations. He also said I deserve nice things and shouldn't have to give them up just because my sister wants me to.

1cpt7jl,AITA for revealing at a Dinner I am the one who makes more money?,"A little context for this post I (33F) have been dating my Partner (34M) casually for 3 years and 8 months. Over the last 8 months we have gotten more serious. He works in IT and as I ""Only"" work behind a bar in a strip club he seemed to always assume I make much less than him, he'd always say that he never wanted us to discuss money as he didn't want me to feel embarrassed so I never brought it up as I didn't care even if I found it a bit funny despite the fact I own both my car and home while he is renting and paying off his car.

I like him though so I brushed it aside figuring if we ever moved in together then we could talk about our finances and be open about it. Despite him thinking I only work behind the bar, I am actually a Mixologist at a high end Strip Club, so on top of a very generous salary I actually make amazing tips most nights too, i've worked at the same place for 9 years and I love it there.

As things are getting more serious he wanted me to meet his parents and I agreed, yesterday we had dinner with his parents and they clearly didn't approve of me and during the dinner his Mother brought up that she didn't think this was a good idea but if he was insisting on doing this when we got married we'd need to have a prenuptial agreement to protect her son. I was silent waiting for my partner to say anything but he didn't. He just continued to eat and I got annoyed before agreeing with her. I told her I fully agreed that we needed a Prenup as i'd need to protect my assets, this led to some laughs from around the table and I finally asked my boyfriend how much he made, he tried to brush it off before finally revealing he made £25,000 a year and telling me it was fine and not to feel less.

I won't lie I burst into laughter right there at the table not caring that I was being rude and bluntly told him not including my tips I make £43,291 a year they didn't believe me so I began to point out how I go on holiday twice a year, how I own my home and car while he rents and is paying off, how I always bought him nice gifts. I then told him for perhaps the hundredth time that i'm a Mixologist not a Bartender.

The dinner got silent and on the drive to my home he berated me the entire time for embarrassing him, and how could I have not told him I made that much money, that I should have told him from the start. I reminded him that he didn't want us to talk about money and I figured when and if we one day moved in together that we'd talk about our finances then. He kept talking about how I should have just privately told him after the dinner then and not embarrassed him in front of his parents but when I asked him then why he didn't defend me when his mother embarrassed me he had no answer.

I don't know i'm just super annoyed right now and feel done with this, was I wrong to reveal it the way I did?",MediumChart5892,1959,0.9399999976158142,747,1715467284,2024-05-11 17:41:24,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cpt7jl/aita_for_revealing_at_a_dinner_i_am_the_one_who/,5,2024

My sister contacted me about her mother’s day gift and told me she wanted a iphone 15 max pro so she can capture the special moment with her baby. I told my sister she is not my mother and I am not the father of the child so I’m not getting her that.

She cried to my mom about how rude I was to her and how I don’t love her or my  nephew. My parents tried to convince me to go half with them on a phone to make it up to my sister and I said no. My mom also offered to get the new phone through her carrier and we could do monthly payments. I said no again stating my sister is not my responsibility.

My mom admitted that my parents and my sister have had some money issues because everything is up in price and I told my mom it took two people to make that baby so it’s time to get child support from the dad.

1ctomq8,AITA for refusing to pay for my sister's expensive wedding even though I'm wealthy?,"I (35M) have a younger sister (29F) who is getting married in a few months. Our parents passed away years ago so it's just been the two of us. I'm fortunate to have a very high paying job and have done well for myself financially.  
  
My sister and her fiancé are planning a large, extravagant destination wedding and the costs are adding up to over $100k. They asked if I would be willing to pay for everything since 'I can easily afford it'. I told them no, that's an unreasonable request, and I'm not comfortable spending that much. I offered to give them $20k as a wedding gift instead.

1cpsggj,AITA for asking my friends what flavor their wedding cake is?,"I (22f) am in the wedding party of my friends we will call Em(25f) and Roe(25m) who will be getting married in about 2 months. I have been really excited for the wedding since it'll be an opportunity for all the friends from college to get together for the first time in 2 years. Not to mention Em and Roe are my best friends, or at least I thought they were. 

We have a discord for all the wedding stuff and they have a channel about food. They've been really good about being open about the food they intend to have at the reception including vegan/vegitarian/gluten free options for everyone and answering questions so I didn't think there would be any contention if I asked a question. 

Anyway, about 4 days ago I posted a message into the discord asking ""Hey, what flavor is the cake gonna be? I wanna mentally prepare myself lol."" I think looking back my choice of extra words is what caused all this, but I meant it in the sense that I have a long documented dislike of chocolate flavored foods like cake or ice cream.  So I added it in the event the cake was chocolate. 

I recieved a private message back that the cake would be chocolate and that if I had a problem with it then I could ""shove it"" cause it was their wedding not mine. And i felt really taken aback by this response. 

Never did I mention that I would have been upset and I certainly wouldn't have put up a stink about it. Its exactly like Em had said, it's their wedding. I explained as much and tried to apologize for any offending I did but she got even more defensive and started basically blasting me for implying that she was offended and I was just left overall very confused. 

I gave it two days before I tried to apologize again and smooth it over figuring she may have just been having a bad day but I got shut down again telling me she didn't need my apology cause nothing was wrong and I needed time stop trying to make it seem like shit was wrong between us and to just drop it. 

I texted Roe to see if I could gauge what was going on since he and I have always had an open dialogue about things like this but he basically just told me he couldn't talk to me right now and I have to imagine its cause Em told him not to. 

Its been 2 days since then and I'm just really confused. This whole thing has made me want to drop out of the wedding party and honestly not go at all. I wish Roe would talk to me and Em would be honest. I can't help but think maybe I just don't get how stressful planning a wedding is and like maybe theyve gotten pushback from other people on other things and somehow its being taken out on me? Or is it really a big no no to ask stuff like this? I don't know?

1cwtc4p,WIBTA if I bought a car my wife couldn’t drive?,"WIBTA if I bought a car my wife can’t drive?

I need to buy a new car, and I would love to have a manual transmission. It’s my one non-negotiable. I grew up driving manual, and I miss it deeply. All of my cars have been inherited, so I’ve never had a say in my car’s features/specs. This will be the first car I’ve purchased for myself. Finally, I’m a “car guy.” I enjoy driving, and I’ve always wanted a sporty car, but also have it fit my needs.

My wife is 7 months pregnant and bought herself a new mid-size SUV last year (with her own money). She views cars as a way of getting from A to B, with practically and comfort.

Note: we have to park our cars back-to-front in our gravel driveway, with one car being in the garage. I will widen the driveway, which I can do it in a weekend, so we can park our cars side-by-side.

We have mostly separate finances, but have a joint CC and checking account, which we both contribute to monthly. The rest is our personal money that we keep in personal bank accounts (including separate savings and separate investments).

I’m paying the down payment and monthly payments on the new car. So I feel the decision is mine, but happy to listen to my wife’s thoughts (reciprocation from her car purchase). 

When I started the car buying process, I went with sport compacts (which are in my budget). Based on our prior discussions, the car has to be a daily commuter for me, allow me to take the kid(s) to/from Daycare, and quick local trips.

My wife thinks these cars are too small and cannot fit our needs with a baby and a potential second child. She says there’s not enough space for kids stuff (there is) and the backseats won’t fit two backward-facing car seats (they will). I’ve tried to show her my research, but she refused to watch the videos or read the articles I’ve bookmarked. 

Her main sticking point is she won’t be able to drive it because it’s a manual. She’s concerned she won’t be able to drive it when she’ll need to (in an emergency). I told her I’m happy to teach her manual, but at first she flat out refused to learn. Now she says she’ll learn, but gives an excuse of how we’ll be too busy. I said if it’s that important she drive the car, her mom can stay for a weekend to watch the baby and we can take a day for her to learn. Again, she said we won’t have time. 

Every time we discuss it, she accuses me of ignoring our family and that she needs to be able to drive the car. I say she’s creating a false dichotomy, and the car I want can fit our needs. I also argue that her car can be the big family car for trips or hauling, and my car can be for easy parking during city trips or sports events. Note: I don’t drink, so I will always be able to drive.

We’ve had many arguments over this. The most recent resulted in her giving me the cold shoulder for 2 days. I am at my wits end and ready to buy without her blessing. 

WIBTA if I ignored my wife’s objections and got the car I wanted?

Edit: I’m specifically looking at is a Honda Civic Si. We live walking distance to urgent care, CVS, and a grocery store. Our neighbor is a NICU nurse if shit really hits the fan. And we do “baby sit” my FIL’s SUV (he works/lives abroad), which we use on occasion, but we don’t know when he’ll be returning. So a third car is not an option for now

Edit 2: Classic RIP my inbox.
After parsing through this thread, there are separate issues at play that I’ve sorted out and here’s what I’ve gathered.

1. IWBTA for BUYING a car my wife can’t drive WITHOUT her blessing - yes, I fully acknowledge my timing of this is awful. I will postpone the purchase until after the baby arrives and I’ll get an automatic to ensure we both drive the car.

2. I’m not an asshole for WANTING a manual car and the model of car I want is reasonable. My wife could learn eventually, but that’s her choice. Again, my timing is terrible (which makes me the A-hole) so I’m going to get my “fun car” in a few years time. 

Clarifying point: I don’t want an SUV. They’re more expensive and I much prefer driving a car that’s not high up. I also think automotive companies have shoved a narrative down American’s throats that SUVs are the ONLY family friend options which is false. Literally just look at the rest of the world.

1cujoln,AITA for not letting my neighbors use my backyard?,"Created an account to ask.

My partner and I (F30s) just got some new neighbors. They moved in about a month ago. We met them briefly. They are a couple around our age and a daughter who might be 4 or 5, and a dog. 

We have our backyard fully fenced in with a privacy fence. Their yard doesn't. I was out front last weekend when the couple came up our driveway and started chatting. They mentioned that they were on a waiting list to get their yard fenced in but were told it would be a few months. They said they would really like their daughter and dog to have a place to run around but didn't feel comfortable with the lack of fence (our neighborhood backs up to a wooded area and a creek). 

They asked if they could borrow our backyard for a few hours a day so they could let everyone run worry free. I admittedly immediately didn't like this, but I told them I would think about it.

I talked to my partner, and we both agreed this wasn't a good idea. We have two dogs ourselves, and they can be a tad protective of their yard. One of them also doesn't love kids and the other one can be a tad dog selective. Because of this, we would have to coordinate when we could let our dogs out and that's just not something we want to deal with. There are just too many things that could go wrong. Plus that good ole American worry that if someone got hurt we could get sued. 

The guy stopped by again on Wednesday and asked if we had given it any thought. I told him we had discussed it, and unfortunately it just wasn't going to work out with our dogs and their schedule so we wouldn't be able to accommodate them. He immediately got sour and said it was nice to know how neighborly we were. He left abruptly but I could hear him muttering under his breath.

Him and his wife have made a big show of snuffing us the last couple of days. My partner said they will get over it, and while I'm not going to reconsider, I do feel kind of guilty.

1d0nn8i,AITA for not stopping to explain what I was doing to a bystander while I was helping a seizing man?,"Please do not share this outside Reddit. 

I’ll try to keep it short. I (40F) witnessed a dude have a seizure, which I was able to identify bc my best friend is epileptic and has been since we were kids. A few bystanders came over and helped me stabilize him as he was a big dude and I’m an average sized woman. Another woman and I were on the ground with him when suddenly a not-at-all-good-Samaritan we’ll call Dick shows up and starts barking (wrong) orders and instructions. Neither of us listen to him or act on his demands. He gets louder and louder and starts recording, saying it’s evidence that “these women refuse to let me help this man!”  

Eventually the seizing stops and EMS and the police show up. Dick immediately accosts the medics AND cops shouting about how he was trying to help and nobody would listen to or let him.  After everyone chatted, EMS confirms what we did for the seizing man was correct. 

Dick is outraged and then decides to direct his ire square at me and tells me that all I had to do was explain it to him in the first place. Internally I was like: What? You’re suggesting the “correct” answer was for me to take my attention off a medical emergency and explain to you why and how I was doing what I was doing/not doing? But I said, “I do not owe you or your ego any explanation for anything, ever, most certainly not in the middle of a medical emergency,  but for your information my best friend of 25+ years is epileptic. This is how I know what to do and not to do in the event of a seizure.” He YELLED, “That’s all you had to say!” At this point even the cops piped up and one said, verbatim, “No she didn’t, bro. She was focused on helping the guy.”  

I felt like I didn’t do anything wrong but was also kind of rattled, so when my friend’s wife later said I was being harsh and arrogant by not acknowledging and/or addressing Dick during the actual seizure and later referring to his ego in my “speech” to him I kind of felt like an asshole. 

She said he too was also just trying to help and “possibly prevent a disaster,” and then asked who anointed me the “Jesus of the situation.” I said I wasn’t being arrogant Jesus, I was simply the first one to get to the guy, knew he was having a seizure, and knew what to do, so I did it and didn’t concern myself with a dude screaming (again, WRONG!) orders in the background. 

Outside the screaming guy it was really a scene full of good people trying to help and made me feel better about humanity even. And then this friend’s wife basically called me an arrogant asshole.

1cvanvk,AITA for questioning my husband about cross contamination in his food truck?,"Backstory: My husband runs a food truck with his mom in the summer and maintains a daily full time job, I work full time in mental health. We often bicker about everything from who forgot to fill the water pitcher last to whether our mother's are disrespectful to each other. We have a pattern of questioning each other on stuff we know the other knows more about. Further context, I don't work on his truck, but I do maintain the paperwork side of it (accounting, licensing, food safety certifications, etc).

The situation: I brought our toddler up to the truck today to see daddy and grandma, otherwise he doesn't get to see them as much in the summer. A customer asked what they had that was gluten free, and he said they have corn chips for the nachos and corn tortillas. We marinate all our meat by hand and buy fresh veggies and queso for toppings, but we do toast the corn tortillas and the flour tortillas on the same pan for the tacos. So I asked, ""but what about cross contamination?"" in front of the customer. He kind of snapped at me and said, ""it's fine, it's not a problem."" The customer didn't get anything and he lectured me that I don't work on the truck, no one's ever complained, and that he knows what he's doing. I think I'm trying to make sure we don't accidentally make anyone sick and/or get a lawsuit.

I invited my mom along, and five minutes after my sister and her boyfriend showed up, one of my youngest daughters (twisted her foot running to the kitchen and cried. My sister told her to toughen up and critiqued my husband for getting her an ice pack, calling him unattractive for being so soft and continued to joke about how he got a wife. I told her to be quiet. 

Later, my oldest kids (F18 and M15) came to hang around and my sister commented on elements of my daughter's body, stating how lucky she was to have a ""hot body"" as a teen. My daughter politely told her not to talk about her body in any way, but my sister told her to be more aggressive because it would get her attention. I told my sister if she wasn't going to quit bullying my family she could take her boyfriend and leave, but she only laughed at me. My son told her to ""stop projecting"" just because she's wimpy and not attractive and my sister said ""it's not cute when you do it."" We all (excluding my mom and the boyfriend) were telling her to leave and she wouldn't until my son, of all people, raised his voice and said to make like her hairline and recede and called her a miserable freeloader. My sister rolled her eyes but left; I think she was intimidated. My son can be very scary when he wants to be and he's very no-bullshit. Later, once my mom recovered from the stress, talked with me and said what my son said was ""highly inappropriate and abusive."" I referred to my sister as abusive instead, and we argued until she eventually left. Knowing her, the entire family will know soon. But I'm not going to defend my sister's behavior.

1czwzo4,AITA for “breaking” my vegan diet?,"Hi people, 

My entire family are vegans, my dad especially is a very “vocal” vegan. He goes to vegan protests, was in vegan groups in our old city, he’s a vegan activist. Which I love, I’m not trying to paint those things as bad I really respect him for his thoughts. 

My brother and I have both been raised vegan our entire lives. At school it’s always made me feel “othered” is the best way to explain it. Never able to eat anything sold in the school canteen, at friend’s birthdays never able to eat a piece of cake with my friends, or have to be the one who says “we can’t go to that restaurant they don’t serve any vegan food”. Always having to explain why I’m not allowed to “try a bite” of their sandwich. They aren’t huge things but they are things that make me stick out. Since I’m an awkward guy anyway, it just doesn’t help me socially. So when we moved cities and I joined a new school last Monday I decided that I’m not going to follow the vegan diet while I’m at school. I kept this to myself because I know my parents wouldn’t support it and would be angry. 

When at home, or with my parents I will follow the vegan diet but if I’m out with my friends or at school I’m not going to say, in my mind this was respectful of my parents wishes. No meat in the house or around them but my myself is different. My brother and I both go to this new school. Since we don’t share a dinner time I didn’t tell him that I wasn’t going to follow the vegan diet, I didn’t think he would support it and I thought he would tell dad. 

Things have been going alright but I didn’t know that on Fridays my brother’s dinner time would be at the same time as mine. I was sitting with some new friend and I was eating a cheese pizza (this is the only non-vegan food I’ve eaten so far. I want to try pepperoni but still feel a little scared) and my brother caught me and asked what I was doing eating pizza. 

I tried to play it off but I knew I was screwed, my brother told my parents and now everyone is really upset at me. I’ve been grounded and my dad said he’s going to call my new school and tell them that if they sell me non-vegan food he will put in a discrimination complaint. Which is just going to make me seem like a weirdo now. 

I tried to explain to him that I was trying to be respectful by not doing it here, but my parents just gave me a huge lecture about how I’m so selfish for breaking the diet. He said he can’t trust me anymore and now I feel guilty in one half of my brain and in another I’m telling myself it isn’t that big of a deal and they’re overreacting. 

But I don’t know if I’m just being blind. 

Please, no debates about the ethics of the vegan diet. I don’t care to debate it with anyone I’m sure there are subreddits where people will be happy to. Please focus on my situation when giving your verdict.",Vegan-conundrum,1274,0.8899999856948853,893,1716589204,2024-05-24 17:20:04,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1czwzo4/aita_for_breaking_my_vegan_diet/,5,2024
1cjk523,WIBTA If I kept some of the insurance money from my car (that my sister totaled),"Update #1: So far I’ve seen similar opinions from everyone and I appreciate everyone’s comment. We’re having a BBQ tonight since my sister just got back from school for the semester. I’m going to bring it up with everyone at dinner and I’ll post a second update letting everyone know how it went. 

Bit of background, I bought a new car in 2022 and gave my old one to my sister after she totaled her last one. Since then, my mother has been paying the car payment for her (she was a minor). With the payment history split between us, I've paid for 60% of the car to date, while my mother has paid the other 40%. My mother came in a told me they were looking at new vehicles today and that she wouldn't mind putting $4-6k down on a car if it meant a low interest and monthly payment (this money comes from the insurance payout being sent to me). I commented that I would need at least $1500 to pay off some credit card debt, and was told no. Now, I don't mind helping out, but I was just told that I wouldn't be receiving any of the insurance money meant to pay for my vehicle, because my younger sister needs it more? Why does the person who has totaled three vehicles in four years need to put $4k+ on a brand new vehicle, and $400 to pay off her credit card, but I can't get $1500 to pay off a credit card to make my life easier?   
  
Would I be the asshole splitting the money based on how it was paid? 60/40. The original loan was 48 months, we have 8 months left, I paid the first 20 and $1500 down, and my mother the second 20. That would give me $3500, much more than I originally asked for, and leave $2500 to pay off her credit card, and the rest as a down payment on another car. I feel like this is going to be an unreasonable offer considering they both assumed they would get the entire amount.

1cs4uw5,AITA because I didn't want to cook a steak on mother's day?,"I (40f) and my husband (41m) have been married 21 years. We have several children the oldest is 20 the youngest is 5. 
Mother's day has always been a point of contention. I really wish he would do something nice for me but he always tells me ""you aren't my mom,"" and does nothing noteworthy. It's gotten worse over the years and came to a boiling point two days ago (mother's day) 
I had reminded everyone that mother's day was coming up but on the day everyone except our 20 and 18 year olds forgot. 20m works all day he came over late in the evening, and 18 said happy mother's Day in the morning before he left for work.  I can't really fault the other  kids for it as many of them are young. By noon I was almost in tears. 

When my husband came out of his man cave and told me he wanted me to cook steak for lunch I almost broke down crying. I cook almost every day for everyone and I really just did not want to cook on mothers day. 

I left the house, went for a walk and bought myself a pizza. When I came home I put his steak in the air fryer. Which was apparently wrong and he got mad about it. 
As he was scolding me over cooking the steak wrong I started crying and said ""it's mother's day!! "" And his response was.... 
He yelled at me for wanting to be the center of attention and told me ""you aren't my mother! You did not give birth to me!"" 

He spent the rest of the day angry at me. He refused to eat the rest of the day. He said he wanted steak to be something nice we did together and I said I didn't want to have to cook because it was mother's day and I wanted him to do something for me but he didn't want to so I went for pizza alone. 

Around dinner time he made a steak and I thought it was for him as I had already eaten but he put it in front of me and told me I better enjoy it. I ate about half it was a huge steak the size of the plate.

I tried to talk to him later he got angry and stormed out. The next day he was still angry. I told him he really hurt my feelings and he said ""you say every other day that I'm hurting your feelings. You always take things wrong, so I guess I just won't talk at all that way you can't take anything wrong."" 

He wants me to act happy so I've been trying to but now it's been two days and he's still angry with me. He keeps sitting on the couch arms crossed refusing to speak or anything. 

Maybe I should have just cooked the steak and not gone out? Am I being unreasonable, after all I'm not his mom. It's just that, as the mother of his children it would be nice to be celebrated on mothers day for once.

1d23txo,AITA for refusing to pay off my boyfriend's overdraft?,"I've known Ron as a casual acquaintance for a few years, but we started dating about two weeks ago.  I'm 19 and he's 20.  He has a full-time job and only pays his mum £40 a week for bills/food.  His only other expense is his car.  So he has a lot of disposable income, but he doesn't save, he blows it all on nonsense like gadgets that he then never uses again.  So much so that he's overdrawn by £2K.

I'm a full-time student who babysits on the side, and I'm frugal.   I've managed to save £3K.  It has taken me about 2 or 3 years to save that.  Tonight I mentioned that some friends of mine are going on holiday in September and I am going to join them.  Ron asked me ""How will you pay for that, you don't have a job apart from babysitting.""  I said ""I have £3K in savings, so I will just use some of that.""

Suddenly Ron got a really calculating look in his eyes, and just outright asked me to pay off his overdraft.  He said he would pay me back £200 a month.  I said he should just pay off his own OD at £200 a month.  He said ""But then I have to pay interest!""

I refused to lend him the money for several reasons:

1. He's such a spendthrift I don't believe he would pay me back.  If he can't set aside £200 a month to pay off his own OD, he is not going to set aside £200 a month to pay me back.

2. I earn a small amount of interest on my savings.  Why should I lose that to save him interest?

3. What if I have an emergency, or an opportunity like my upcoming holiday?  I then  won't have any money to pay for it.

And I didn't say this one to him, but also I don't want to lend him the money because he has such a bloody cheek.  I know we've casually known each other (friends of friends) for a few years but we're only really just now getting to know each other properly and I just think it's such a rude and selfish thing to ask.  It's really made me see him in a different light and I don't like what I'm seeing.  Anyway he thinks I'm the one being selfish because the money is ""just sitting there"" and I ""don't really need it.""

1cjm3zb,AITA for kicking my MIL out of my house for being passive aggressive about my husband cleaning up?,"My husband, Tom, and I recently moved into our house, today we hosted our first dinner party with my mother in law (mil), FIL, BILs and their wives and SIL. I took a day off from the my business to make sure everything was perfect. I spent hours on my feet to make sure everything was perfect, I went grocery shopping, cleaned the house and cooked. By the time everyone got here I was exhausted but I still entertained everyone because I was so excited to have them over.



Everyone was having a good time, even MIL, I think its because Tom and I sat at opposite end of the table and she got to sit next to him. We moved to the living room to have dessert and that's when everything went to crap. I was in the kitchen with SIL plating up the desserts she brought and making more ice cream. A few minutes later Tom came back and started clearing up the dishes that were on the table, I didn't ask him to do this, he's just like this. MIL heard us talking and came to the kitchen and saw Tom loading the dishwasher, she asked if he knew what he was doing and he told he did.



MIL came in after Tom went back to the living room and said (I forgot some of the other stuff she said). ""PugLoverNo1565, if you needed help with cleaning up you could have asked us to do it instead of stressing Tom with it. He's not good at this sort of thing and he has had a long day at work. The key to happy marriage is working together and making life easier for each other. Tom works so hard, he bought this house and everything in it to make life easier for you. The least you can do is clean up"". I told her I didn't ask for help, Tom just helped because this is house too and he wants to make life easier for me. I also asked her if she realised it wasn't 1993 because Tom isn't a baby anymore he's capable of cleaning up, its not rocket science. I told her we don't need marriage advice, especially from her because she said something about making our marriage last while she's was on marriage number 3/7 at my age. She called me angry and said I had no need to be vicious, I told her I'd show her vicious and I left the room. MIL followed me to the door and I told her get out, she did and then started crying.



Everyone came to see what was going on and I told them I'm tired of MIL and her nastiness she tries to hide by being passive aggressive. FIL apologised for her and I told him I don't accept, she can apologise for herself or leave. Tom and his brother Andrew told her to apologise and she refused so I shut the door in her face and went to the kitchen. FIL and one of DH's brothers and his girlfriend left soon after. The rest that stayed had a good time and they left two hours ago.



All hell has broken loose and I'm getting messages basically calling me an asshole. I don't think I was but Tom and everyone who stayed is biased because they can't stand MIL, so I don't know.

1cre4nx,AITA for not allowing my sisters family members (her dogs) at my family party.  ,"I hosted a Cinco de Mayo family party last weekend.  I recently remodeled my backyard and pool, plus being Mexican, I thought it would be the perfect weekend to show off the updated digs.  I invited any family that lived in the area.  Its the first party i've held since before Covid.  

My sister and I are opposites.  She is a dog mom (god I hate writing that) to an extreme degree, My wife and I are not dog people.  When she got the invite she reached out and said her, her boyfriend, and 2 dogs (Small 10 pound dogs) would be there.  I was annoyed and called her to tell her no, her dogs are not allowed.  

She asked if kids were going, I said yes, some were.  She said well her dogs are family and they should be able to come.  I told her I don't consider your dogs family.  In fact I think your crazy for thinking that your dogs are my family.  She argued her dogs were just as much family as the kids were.  She said her dogs wanted to see their uncles new backyard.  I told her to shut up and never say that again to me.  I re-affirmed that her and her boyfriend could come, but nothing else from their house.  She got angry but I eventually hung up.  

She didn't go to the party claiming I was rude and an asshole to her.   Apparently my parents even agree with her, which fucking blows my mind.  Heard a rumor she is hosting an event and is seemingly excluding me from the invite list.

1cobi5n,AITA For Wanting Mothers Day to be About Me? ,"I (30f) gave birth last year and so this year will be my first Mothers Day this Sunday. This upcoming Monday also happens to be my MILs (63f) birthday. Every year my husband (32m), and his brothers ( 29M, 25M) and FIL have celebrated both MILs birthday and Mothers Day on the same day no matter what day Mothers Day fell on that year. I was all too happy to celebrate both occasions with them because I lost my mom when I was 8 to ovarian cancer so I never really celebrated Mothers Day until I met my husband.

This year however, I would like to celebrate Mothers Day with just myself, my husband, and our daughter. I tried to encourage other plans on Saturday, a day filled with fun, food, and activities that MIL likes but have been shot down. I even asked if the three of us could do breakfast/brunch and then we go over to MILs to celebrate but this was also unacceptable. Both Mothers Day and birthday must be celebrated on the same day. I tried to talk to MIL about it but she said that this is the way it's been for years and it isn't going to change now and that maybe we (my husband and I) can do Mothers Day things another day.

So this is where I might be the asshole; I told my husband he is welcome to go and spend the whole day with his mom, dad, and brothers but I will be staying home and celebrating with the wee potato who made me a mom, we're going to watch Bluey and make tiny blueberry pancakes (her favourite, lol). My husband says I'm being unreasonable and that we can celebrate another time, that his mom just loves celebrating being a mom and her birthday together with the ones she loves and that it would be awkward if her first grandchild isn't there to help her celebrate (BILs have partners but do not have children yet). I told him I am standing firm on this and he got angry and went to our room. He's been in there for a couple of hours now and I'm starting to feel bad for putting him on the spot like that and making him choose how to celebrate.

1cirfdn,"AITA for ""spoiling"" my daughter by taking her on holiday? ","Made this as a throwaway account for personal reasons.

I (M53) split up with my ex-wife (F49) about nine years ago. We have one 17-year-old daughter from the relationship, Tilly, who we share custody of. Due to work commitments, my ex has Tilly most of the weekdays, and I have the weekends. So my ex isn't stuck entirely with the ""boring"" schooldays, she also gets the weeks when Tilly is on vacation.

While my ex got remarried a few years ago, I never did. Although I dated here and there, a combination of work commitments and just not finding the right person meant it never clicked and I've stayed mostly single. I've worked my way up the career ladder as a result and I have a healthy amount of excess income, which I mostly put towards Tilly. I wouldn't say she's spoilt because I still try to give her a sense of responsibility around the house by helping with chores and don't hand out pocket money unless it's earned. However, since I have the means to do so, I do treat her with any clothes, makeup, gadgets, and the like. It's something I enjoy doing and she shows gratitude for it.

On the other hand, my ex is a stay at home mom and her new husband/Tilly's stepdad has a pretty standard job. I don't mean that disrespectfully but.the income generated in the household is average at best for a similar family type. As such, Tilly rarely gets any presents from her mom/stepdad other than on birthdays or any other holidays.

As Tilly's 18th birthday is coming up, I wanted to do something vey special for her, to also tie in with her leaving for college shortly. I arranged a trip to Europe for the two of us for two weeks over the summer. As co-parenting plans have to be arranged, I phoned my ex to say this would be my plan and to sort out all the logistics. To be surprise, my ex exploded at me. She said how I was ""spoiling"" Tilly and was only doing this to spite her because she knew that any gift she gave by comparison would be meaningless, making me the ""favourite parent"". I told her that wasn't true, and I just wanted to give my only daughter a present she'd love and memories to cherish.

Nonetheless, this went on, and my ex called me an asshole over the situation, saying that I need to scale down my present to not spoil Tilly and put us at a ""level playing field"". I laughed and said she was being ridiculous but to avoid any argument, I offered to say this was a ""joint present"" from us both if she/her husband were willing to contribute. This idea was shot down because Tilly ""wasn't stupid"" and knew it would be my present. I was done arguing at this point, so put down the phone.

My ex has text me since, labelling me an asshole again and requesting I rethink. I have no intention of doing so and feel I'm in the right.

1d2wf7e,AITA for leaving a restaurant because my kid decided he wouldn’t eat anything?,"Wife, son(6), and I are currently on vacation.  After a long day of sightseeing, we found a restaurant that had a decent looking menu for all three of us.  After we sat down however, my son decided he wouldn’t eat anything on the menu.  He agreed to eat some things that we brought with us, and since he was tired and hungry, I decided not to argue.  I did, however, check with our server before we let him open anything.  The server went to check with the manager, and unfortunately the manager said no outside food allowed.

I respect their rules, but I’m not going to make my son watch us eat while he’s hungry, so I apologized to the server and said we would have to go.  I wasn’t rude or upset at their decision, just tired and hungry.  I made sure to leave a tip for the waiters trouble.  This must have been an insult to the manager though, because he was talking to his hostess loud enough for us to hear, saying that we were leaving because we were mad we couldn’t bring outside food in.  It wasn’t worth fighting about, so I just kept going.

1cjksr1,AITA for asking a deaf person to stop signing in class because it was distracting? ,"First off, for some context, I am a music major in college and I’m all for accessibility, when, let’s say Joe, when Joe introduced himself and his interpreter I said wow! This is really interesting. Not because he’s hard of hearing but rather a deaf person majoring in something which specifically requires hearing is what baffled me. Everything was fine, we all got used to the interpreter being there and no one really payed attention to the fact that he was deaf. Except for one class. A class that everyone as music majors take, a performance recital class. In this class people take turns each week to Perform, in this class it was explained to us in the beginning of the year some of the basic common decency like clapping when they finish singing, not talking, turning off your phone, stuff like that. Just being nice for the performer… you know? Anyways, the year started off fine in this class, but lately you could tell he wasnt signing to his interpreter about the songs , the reason for this is because we sing opera/classical songs in this class so the interpreter didn’t know the language to be fair no one did so she definitely wasn’t translating the songs but rather just cracking jokes! He’s laughing! In the middle of the performances! You could just imagine as a performer seeing someone laugh as you are performing?!  On top of that, this is all happening in the front row! with the interpreter in front of the stage on the side laughing as well! Snickering and giggling all throughout the performance so much so that even one of the performers look to the side to see what happening but just kept singing and ignoring it. I tried ignoring it thinking you know what, he’s deaf, he already has a hard time, no need to bug him more but I finally had enough when a friend of mine sang her song and she and I previously translated the song, it was a very very sad song about death and deleteing yourself. What was Joe doing? Signing, not just signing, SMACKING his hands and laughing bout something else, he made a gesture that you do when someone is pregnant?!?!? You know like the making a circle over your stomach and rubbing anyways Maybe that means something else, but laughing like come on, not just quiet laughing btw audible snickering. Finally I had enough and went up to both him and the interpreter how I understand the need the translate the slate what the teacher is saying and everything the else but that the last song that by friend sang was not a funny song and that it was not only distracting but rude to be talking and laughing while someone is performing even so when your right smack in the front row. The interpreter stayed quiet and he just went on to say that I’m abilist and that it shouldn’t matter what he does because he’s dead and I can’t take he’s mean of communicating, but I’m not saying he should stop, I’m saying in the middle of performances to at least not laugh. Anyways, what do you guys think, AITA?

Both my kids, and my husband all have noise cancelling headphones.

I considered (and went through with) asking them to not not wear headphones in the house, but just no noise cancelling or one side in one side out.

1d1crmt,AITA for telling my brother I hate him and probably will never forgive him ,"
AITA for telling my brother I hate him and I’ll probably never be able to forgive him 

Background I 27f and brother 25m were raised by a single dad our mom left we didn’t really have family so we only had each other. I’ll refer to my dad as dad and brother as James. Fast forward to 18 year old me my dad was diagnosed with schizophrenia that took a lot on me mentally because my brother refused to help. My dad accepted help and was put on medication fast forward to 23 year old me my dad had a stroke and was diagnosed with heart failure. I was the sole care taker and it was breaking me. He still worked and could fully function unless he had an episode which was rare with the meds. Fast forward I move out of the state for my peace and a break my brother James promised to step up. September of 22 I could tell my dad was going off the deep end so I called James to advise of POA rights James told me I was being dramatic and didn’t need to worry about it cause I was selfish and left. Fast forward November 2 days go by I didn’t hear from my dad. I called a welfare check and they found him deceased believed heart attack. I immediately flew back home that day. When I get there james drunkenly confesses to me he seen him the day before and describe him as “unrecognizable, sick, couldn’t eat, move or anything.” James brought him some energy drinks and left quoting “if it was that bad he’s an adult and would’ve asked to go to the doctor.” I stood there stunned. No words. My brother kept pushing me to say something when finally I snapped and said “I hate you, I’ll probably never forgive you for this. The one time you had to be an adult you couldn’t and had you did there’s a possibility he could still be alive today.” He called me a heartless b* and now all of my family is saying the same but I feel my feelings are valid so AITA? 

Edit to add: I understand eventually I would have had to come to terms with him dying, but the part I’m angriest about is my brother robbed me of his final moments, I didn’t get to say goodbye. I didn’t get to tell him how much he meant to me. I didn’t get to tell him how he was my hero. I didn’t get to say thank you for still loving me everyday when my birth mom left us cause we were a burden. I feel like I was robbed of so many things. 

Edit 2: I did explain to the police the next week what happened and exactly what my brother had told me when the autopsy on my father was performed. When I spoke to the detective they said basically I was SOL because I had no proof other than his confession that I also had no proof of. An because I couldn’t concretely prove my dad was in a manic state at the time of the incident that nothing really could be done especially giving the heart failure diagnosis that was given 2 years prior. I also want to say thank you so much for all of the support even the non supportive ones. I understand that me leaving the state did make me responsible and I take accountability for that and regret that everyday. But I have taken up seeing a therapist who specializes in grief. Ive been very angry for a long time. My dad had living brother and sisters and a dad who lived in the same state who knew everything and also did nothing. I guess while my main focused anger has been at my brother for a long time I’m angry at everyone who I begged to help who promised they would and didn’t. Either way there’s a lot of comments and I can’t really keep up through the tears. But I again want to say thank you. This is the first time my anger and pain has felt seen in a while and I appreciate that.

1cz7ezq,AITA for getting a kids bike taken away?,"First and foremost, I want it to be known that I have no issues with kids. As someone with a lot of experience working in childcare, I have a lot of patience. I met the end of this patience and want to know if what I’ve done is justified. 

My apartment is known for tight parking (there are probably 20 spots for 16-20 apartments.) There are no rules for parking, which causes issues from time to time with getting a spot near my building. Typically it doesn’t bother me, as it’s to be expected.

My neighbors have two kids (roughly 6 and 11)  they don’t take responsibility for. As a tame example, we have a quiet hours set at 9:30PM on weekdays. These kids have been in the hallways screeching (I am talking stuck pig, would’ve called the police fearing child endangerment kind of screeching) at midnight or even 1am on weeknights. The parents do nothing about it. To put it gently, these kids think they can do whatever they want, no consequences. 

Summer is arriving, and the weather has been great. The kids across from me have also been enjoying this weather, except they’re “enjoying” it so much that one of them (11 year old) has taken to blocking the parking spots in my complex by parking his bike in the middle of one and standing there on his phone for hours. The parents watch this happen, the dad SOMETIMES goes out and bring the bike back into their apartment late at night. Emphasis on sometimes. I’ve talked to them about this, as recently I’ve had to park over five, ten minutes away from my building because of the kid taking up an entire parking spot. The father shrugs and laughs, and does nothing about it. 

Next point is where I am unsure if I’m the asshole.  

Our complex has strict rules about personal items taking up public spaces (planters, grills, and most relevantly bikes.) They’ve sent emails stating they’re not responsible for reimbursing personal items removed from the public spaces. 

I came home from a particularly stressful day, and the kid was in the only spot left near my building. I asked him nicely to move his bike so I could park. The kid stared at me, then laughed as he left his bike and went inside. His father watched all of this from their patio and did nothing.

After parking 3 buildings over, I’d had enough. I called the complex and reported a bike taking up parking. Within half an hour, maintenance came and took it. 

Next morning I woke up to screeching from this kid. His dad realized what happened and came over to yell at me. Pissed at being woken up at 7am on my one day off, I responded “play stupid games win stupid prizes” before I shut the door and went about my day. 

Part of me feels justified, but theres part of me that feels bad this kid won’t have a bike for the majority of this summer. 

AITA?

TL:DR kid acted like he owned the parking lot, got a rude awakening when his bike was thrown away by maintenance, and his dad who encouraged the behavior is pissed.
