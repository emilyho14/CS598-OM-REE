165gf8q,"CMV: Most ""inclusive"" spaces online are one of the most bigoted and discriminatory places you can be.","So any sub or space online claims to be ""inclusive"" ""tolerant"" blah blah are one of the most prejudiced hate filled, bigoted spaces. The thing is if you say anything remotely different than what they want you to say they will ban you, remove your comments. But aren't these places supposed to be inclusive? I am still the same female, bisexual, poc etc that they claim to protect so why is my opinion not important when I don't agree with them.

I'd rather be in a sub where free speech is allowed and I say this while fitting the description of the users they claim to protect,if you dare to say anything against them they will literally make a mob and attack you and I am not even conservative/right wing.

166f071,Cmv: Religion has done more harm than good for humanity.,"This is most likely a biased opinion as I grew up non-religious, but as i’ve observed the world I see religion as an agent of mass violence and hatred for the world. I don’t deny the great things that religious motivations have done for the world- art, literature, culture, healthcare, donations, you name it- but it seems to me that a large portion of conflicts TODAY are based on religious disagreements spanning thousands of years. The mass killings throughout history done in “the name of god”, the persecution of minority groups like the LGBTQ+, the denial of science and silencing of great thinkers working to advance humanity, and the mixing of religion and government to create harmful legislation have contributed to my perception that religion has had a net negative impact on humanity.

15momit,CMV: Conservatives have very little to lose if liberals win. Liberals have everything to lose if conservatives win.,"On most issues, the liberal stands to lose a lot, while the conservative stands to lose little or nothing.

Take abortion, for instance. If liberals win, it doesn't mean pregnant conservative women will be forced to get abortions against their will. Conservative life goes on unaffected. If conservatives win, on the other hand, it means pregnant liberal women will be denied abortions (if they want them.)

Gay marriage - if liberals win, no heterosexual conservative is going to be forced to marry someone of the same gender against their will. Conservative life goes on unaffected. On the other hand, if conservatives win, gay/lesbian liberals would be prevented from being able to marry.

Taxes - sure, liberals may raise taxes if they win, but it would be for *everyone*. Liberals are not going to pass some tax that only hits conservatives but spares liberals. There are plenty of rich liberals who would be hit hard by higher taxes if taxes were raised. 

Climate change - what do conservatives have to lose from a liberal world in which there are less carbon emissions and less air pollution? That's a *beneficial* thing.

Now, there are a few I could see conservatives losing substantially on:

Guns - this is one issue the political right might be affected somewhat; liberals might try to enact very strict gun control. That being said, plenty of liberals own guns, so they'd be affected as well.

Affirmative action: This could lead to fewer conservatives getting hired or admitted to elite colleges while more liberals get in.

The funny thing, though, is that based off of the *behavior* of conservatives and liberals, you'd never be able to tell that it was liberals who had the most to lose. Conservatives are the ones who fanatically support Trump, were so desperate that they tried a Jan-6 insurrection, while liberals are comparatively more placid, lazy and lackadaisical despite having much more to lose.

161yf92,CMV: The seven dwarves are not supposed to be people with dwarfism. It’s idiotic that Disney will not feature dwarves in their remake of Snow White.,"In case you aren't aware, Disney is remaking Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. But, there are no longer going to be any dwarves. Instead, there are going to be seven magical forest creatures. From what I can tell, Disney is doing this because they think it’s not politically correct to make a movie featuring dwarves. This is idiotic 

**Fantasy dwarves are not people with dwarfism**

Fantasy dwarves are not meant to represent individuals with the medical condition of dwarfism. In fantasy, dwarves are usually depicted as stout, bearded beings, distinct from humans. They don’t have the same proportions as people with the real medical condition. 

Fantasy dwarves are not people with dwarfism any more than giants are people with gigantism. The same goes for gnomes, hobbits, leprechauns, etc. These diminutive beings are distinct creatures, not people with real medical conditions. Santa’s workshop is not staffed by people with dwarfism. 

**How to cast dwarf characters**

Disney is correct for worrying that its problematic to cast people with dwarfism to play fantasy dwarves. Its potentially belittling because it portrays people with a real medical condition as being like silly magical creatures. 

But, this doesn't mean that fantasy dwarves can never appear in movies. It means you shouldn't cast people with dwarfism to play them. You follow the blueprint laid out by Perter Jackson. You cast an ordinary actor, and then you use movie magic to make them shorter. 

**Disney's current casting choices are offensive**

Furthermore, I would say that Disney has not avoided controversy by eliminating references to dwarves. Here's a cast picture:

https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/14/12/73212119-12298801-image-a-139_1689332652585.jpg

They've cast at least 1 person with dwarfism to play these magical forest creatures. As I argued above, this is belittling towards people with dwarfism. They are portraying people with a real medical condition as being whimsical creatures. Despite their efforts, I think people can legitimately argue that this movie will be disrespectful towards people with dwarfism. 

Disney has totally misunderstood the nuances of this situation. There would have been no problem if they cast actors in Peter Jackson style costumes to play the dwarves. But, by casting a person with dwarfism to play a magical forest creature, Disney has done something that's actually offensive. They gain nothing by avoiding the word ""dwarf"".",damndirtyape,993,0.8899999856948853,486,1693064242,2023-08-26 10:37:22,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/161yf92/cmv_the_seven_dwarves_are_not_supposed_to_be/,8,2023

164xhqk,CMV: Slavery reparations should NOT be given out.,"I dont think people should be given cash for slavery reparations. Reparations should take a more indirect form, things like tax breaks and investment in communities rather than just handing people a bunch of money and telling them to spend it wisely.

Of course reparations is a little vague, but the most common sum Ive seen is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is quite a lot for the average person. You only have to look at lottery winners to see that giving ordinary people large sums of money is a bad combination. 

There's also the issue of how much would be given out. The most common sum I have seen is 250-300k, but Ive also seen 1 million thrown around which if true would cost almost 6 times the annual us budget.

It also seems like it could become a slippery slope.

15gdyf8,CMV: No amount of mass shootings is going to persuade gun supporters to give up their guns.,"Every time there is a mass shooting in the United States, the attitude of many gun opponents seems to be one of bated breath: *""Surely* ***this*** *one will be The One - the one that will finally mark a watershed moment and convince gun supporters that enough is enough, and that it's time to give up guns.""*

......and it doesn't happen.

If there were to be a critical-mass moment, it would have happened by now. The sheer volume of awful mass shootings - Columbine, Parkland, Sandy Hook, Pulse, Vegas, Uvalde, Aurora, El Paso, Sutherland Springs, Virginia Tech, etc. - would have done it by this point. And yet most gun supporters are no nearer to abandoning their stance than before. Gun opponents are waiting for a ""straw that breaks the camel's back"" moment that may never come.

Granted, it's hard to see what argument *would* work to persuade gun supporters to give up guns - if any such argument even exists. But it can be clearly seen, from the last 20 years, that ""hoping that the next mass shooting will finally be the one that changes their mind"" isn't it.  

And when America gets its next mass shooting that kills dozens of people - which, for all we know, might come as soon as next week or something like that - the argument of most gun supporters will most likely be the same again: ""2nd Amendment, my guns didn't cause the shooting, the self-defense benefits of guns outweigh the drawbacks of mass shootings, we need guns to resist governmental tyranny, the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" etc.

15uwzhx,CMV: Abandonware should automatically enter the public domain after 7 years of inactivity and a lack of declared intent to renew rights.,"For context: abandonware is software that's no longer sold, updated or maintained by the developers. On the one hand, it generally becomes impossible to purchase or obtain if you don't already have it, and on the other it's illegal to download or use if you don't already have it. This even applies to software where the teams that made it have long since dissolved and the rights could be held by companies that have literally forgot it exists. So, I think it makes sense that generally software is eventually released to the public domain if it isn't actually being used. If a company's planning on a reboot or selling the IP or something along those lines, sure they can put in with the courts that they want to renew the IP and retain rights and let that be a thing, but I mean specifically for the old and dusty projects that haven't been thought about in decades, just let them lapse into public domain so the freeware community has those resources without engaging in piracy, the chances of adding value for someone are way higher than the chances of taking away from value from anyone.",MostRecommendation84,786,0.9599999785423279,150,1692394259,2023-08-18 16:30:59,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15uwzhx/cmv_abandonware_should_automatically_enter_the/,8,2023
15txqtc,cmv: I don't see the emotional benefit in me having children.,"Genuinely looking for people to change my view <3

I am a 30 year old married woman to a 32 year old man. We own a home, and my husband has a pretty stable job that incentives parenthood (US military). 

I'm at that age now where it seems like every coupled person has kids, and honestly I just don't see the point. For what? I don't see the point in having sleepless nights and a 20 year expensive commitment, just for the occasional feeling of ""I love them so much my heart might burst"".

The only child I have an interest in fostering is my inner one. I don't think society would suffer if I didn't multiply - I ain't anything special. I'm just a regular millennial. Honestly I think I'm quite childlike at heart, and I feel like I can stay this way forever so long as I'm never a mom. I really really hate the idea of having a kid, and my husband being like most men and suddenly working longer hours to ~~not be at home~~ ""bring in more income"", and me being saddled with the brunt of the work whilst also dealing with all the body and hormonal changes.

15y5y4j,CMV: Hard work pays off is BS,"Complete and utter BS. The entire notion of ""hard work pays off"" is just manipulative to the everyday employee. Especially since the idea of ""hard work"" is totally subjective.

If the hardest workers reaped the most rewards, then roofers and coal miners would be the richest people in society. 

The real truth is that investment of time in the right places pays off. I worked my ass off in blue-collar, and, at some point, you hit a cap. There's only so many hours in a week and only so much you can work. You can sacrifice every personal/social event in your life to work all the overtime you can, but you'll always hit a cap.

I became tired, and my health was suffering. I fell into a deep depression. All of my coworkers started calling me lazy when I started rejecting the overtime. I invested time into earning certifications in a different field. This was an easy thing to do here and there. My certifications put me in another position, making double the money with half the hours and a fraction of the labor.

Was it hard work? Nope. I assure you that in comparison, sitting in front of my computer for a couple hours on the weekends was a LOT easier than working 15+ extra hours at my job where I was killing myself with the workload.

I promise you, you can live a good life working hard, but you will live a great life working smart.

Ofcourse it's true that if you're not working at all, you won't achieve anything. And ofcourse it's true that if you work really hard you might get a promotion that puts you in a better place, but my point is ""hard work"" always has a cap. At some point it becomes less about the workload you complete, and about where you invest your time.

You'll hit a wall, and the only way to move up after a certain point is to build connections and invest time/money into yourself. Nepotism is very real, and it will throw your hard work out the window.

15s891q,"CMV: The conservatives who complain ""Why are we sending money to Ukraine instead of helping people here at home in America?"" wouldn't want that money to be spent on people in America, either.","Since the beginning of the war, a certain Trumpish faction of Republicans has been arguing that we shouldn't spend money on helping Ukraine ""because of the domestic needs at home.""

The first problem with this is that the amount of money the U.S. has sent to Ukraine is actually only a tiny percentage of GDP/federal budget, and it's for a good cause.

But the second, more pressing, problem is that even if the U.S. never sent any aid to Ukraine, and instead diverted the $70 billion in weaponry and financial aid back to America instead..........most of these Trump-wing conservatives wouldn't want that money spent on Americans either, despite their complaint. I'm talking about the Marjorie-Taylor-Greene type.

If it were spent on school lunches........Republicans have been spending a lot of effort blocking free school lunches.

If it were spent on welfare.......Republicans would complain that that's......well, welfare.

If it were spent helping the homeless...........Republicans would complain that it's helping 'stinky, dirty, lazy homeless people.'

In other words, Republicans don't actually **want** that money spent on helping people, they just want something to complain about.

Lastly, if the Biden administration indeed sent no aid to Ukraine, you can 100% guarantee that these Trump-wing Republicans would do a 180-degree and attack Biden for being ""weak,"" an ""appeaser,"" and claiming that Biden is letting Russia win.",SteadfastEnd,671,0.8199999928474426,626,1692140979,2023-08-15 18:09:39,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15s891q/cmv_the_conservatives_who_complain_why_are_we/,8,2023
15j96fq,CMV: Humanity has not been visited by “non-human intelligence”,"David Grusch recently testified before the US congress that the United States is in possession of air/spacecraft operated by non-human intelligence.

I think this is ridiculous. It would require a multi-national effort with airtight secrecy lasting decades. It would require multiple nations and government officials to stay silent on this topic and have no photographic evidence or other objective evidence of these craft fall into public hands. 

The non-human intelligence would need to constantly operate in a covert manner and avoid large populations of humanity to avoid having indisputable proof of their existence documented.

No. I am not gonna start the rambling about AI and deep fakes or other dumb sh*t like that. That's a different topic for another day. 


This is probably the closest belief to a conspiracy theory I believe. 


This is something we should have done since the beginning of the internet. 


Many things are fake on the internet, or at least have missing contexts. From news on social media, photoshoped/airbrushed models, drama made as an attempt for attention, etc. 


Needless to say most mental health issues, scams, dumb culture and misinformation related to the web are steming from taking the internet at face value. 


Even before AI and pals it is incredibly difficult to verify what's real or not. Not always but at least in *most* cases it sure as hell is.


The remedy to this: Assume everything you read is fake. 


Example: If one assume everything he/she reads is fake (or at least take it with a massive grain of salt) then it will be more difficult to be scammed, feel bad for oneself or get fooled by the internet.



You're almost never sure who's behind the screen.

15kmtfo,CMV: I see nothing wrong with legalized euthanasia,"hat's it. My view is simple. However, to expand why I think so. I think if someone wants to die, they have a fatal condition or they hate life. Now, I know some things are temporary, and that it can be fixed. So I propose that government give them one year of therapy etc. If they still want to die they should be allowed to. 

My second reason is, if the government has failed them, then the least the government can do is not punish the helper and them for taking matters into their own hands. Morally speaking, for example, if there was a town for whatever reason, think wild west, with no sherrif or the sheriff is literally sitting on his/her ass all day, I have no problem morally if everyone went all 'batman'. 

My third reason is, and probably the most important one, freedom and consent. If it's proven that there was no coercision etc. then the doctor or whoever shouldn't be arrested. 

Thats why I believe it's better to legalize it. There would be institutions to make sure that 

Now for background. I'm in canada. We already have checks in place for fatal conditions, I see nothing wrong with expanding it. 

But really the heart of the matter is, I don't see why the government should have a say what I do with my body. I am of the principle if it doesn't remove someone elses freedoms or rights, then it should be ok. I took nothing from my neighbour by dying.

Answer 1: Although I do not deny the biological differences, the Selective Service System currently only drafts able-bodied male Americans who pass the physical strength requirements. If female Americans were also drafted, the same process would apply so no one who is not physically capable will be drafted. Therefore, the biological differences won't create an unfair draft.

Argument 2: No one should be required to register.

Answer 2: I completely agree except America’s leaders agree that despite the success of the All-Volunteer Force, registration with Selective Service must continue as a key component of national security strategy.

You can't bring more than 3 oz of a specific liquid, and it has to be put in a quart sized bag. But if it's in your checked bag, suddenly it's fine. You can buy water once you get past TSA, but it's always much more expensive than water you'd buy outside of the airport. It's a price gouging scam. 

The TSA also discriminates against various minorities. Black women get their hair searched by the TSA. Since the TSA agents put the gender they assume a passenger to be into the machine, and it scans that way (if an agent puts male in for someone who is biologically female, their breasts will get flagged), LGBTQ passengers who's appearance may not match their physical sex are often flagged by the scanners and forced into a patdown. Breastfeeding mothers are also often required to have their breast milk tested, which is ridiculous.

I believe the best solution is to replace the TSA's current system with metal detectors. The metal detectors would be able to identify weapons better than body scanners, since metal detectors just search for metal. Metal detectors would also deal with the discrimination issue since it isn't scanning for body shapes, just metal.

—-———————————————————————-
Matthew 19:21
Jesus said to him, ""If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.""

Proverbs 29:7 
A righteous man knows the rights of the poor; a wicked man does not understand such knowledge.

Deuteronomy 15:7-8
""If among you, one of your brothers should become poor, in any of your towns within your land that the LorD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother, but you shall open your hand to him and lend him sufficient for his need, whatever it may be.

Corinthians 8:9 
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich.

John 3:17 
But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?

Leviticus 25:35 
""If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you.

Luke 12:33 
Sell your possessions, and give to the needy.
Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.

He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and on them he has set the world.

Timothy 6:17-19 
As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy. They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, thus storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.

Psalm 68:10 
Your flock found a dwelling in it; in your goodness, O God, you provided for the needy.

Psalm 112:9

165sjkh,CMV: The US Should Mandate all Fees/Expenses be Disclosed Up Front As Much As Possible,"I believe the United States should legally require ticket sellers like Ticketmaster to provide prices inclusive of all fees and surcharges when shopping for tickets.

Hidden fees distort the free market and make it harder for customers to fairly do price comparisons. These fees are deceptive and can often add up to 40% of the advertised price.

I’m tired of clicking on a $49 dollar ticket for a show to find out it’s really $70 when I go to checkout.  Or a $50/night hotel room having a mandatory $30/night “resort fee”

Similar policy should apply to things like hotel rooms, car rentals, phone bills and all sorts of other consumer purchased goods.

If a fee is variable (like shipping) or taxes, I could see that not being included in an advertised price if they can’t be reasonably determined at the time of advertising.  a TV commercial for a national brand, they could say “$499 + tax” since the tax is different everywhere.

However, for sales where the tax CAN be determined, it should be included in the price.  A hotel room should advertise the total price, since the tax calculation is based on where the hotel is, and can be reasonably determined at the time of advertising.

This greater price transparency would greatly benefit consumers.",Front_Many_6231,430,0.949999988079071,214,1693433781,2023-08-30 17:16:21,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/165sjkh/cmv_the_us_should_mandate_all_feesexpenses_be/,8,2023
166h3ge,CMV: Most people would not speak out or fight against slavery/genocide/apartheid/theocracy if they lived in such a society.,"Many students in the USA and Europe are understandably horrified by what happened in the past. They read about how a popular dictator like Hitler genocided Jews and other groups. Or how several European societies were complicit in chattel slavery and brutal colonialism. Or how the USA and other countries wiped out entire native tribes and fiercely subjugated their non-white populations. They also wonder why don't the citizens of Russia try to overthrow Putin's regime or why the women in Saudi Arabia tolerate being second-class citizens with little autonomy. From the student's point of view, these are clear and egregious human rights violations and it is any sane and moral person's duty to oppose such a government or institution.

What is often ignored is that the average person (especially in developing nations or historical states) has many personal problems and is just trying to live their day-to-day lives. Going on a huge and dangerous moral crusade to save a group of people you don't even belong to and might not even be able to pay you back seems completely foolhardy from their perspective. What you also must understand is that nobody is born in a completely neutral environment; morals and beliefs all come from somewhere. The people who partook in any historical atrocity or even merely ""looked the other way"" were fed ton of propaganda from birth justifying how abusing/killing the bad people is righteous and in-line with what God wants. The people in such societies have access to completely different information/technology than what modern Western kids have along with a different lifestyle. And it is not like modern westerners don't have their own biases and ignorant beliefs as well.

Before being offended that people in another land or in another time are committing major atrocities, how about some people try to fix the major wrongdoings going on in their own homeland first. Let's focus on the USA since most Redditors are from there. How many Americans support prison reform? How many Americans support animal rights? How many Americans want to stop climate change? How many Americans actually engage in protests? How many Americans even bother to boycott?

Everyone likes to imagine they would be the hero, but in reality, they would probably only join the heroes once their victory is inevitable. Assuming you aren't a member of the persecuted group, your average person nowadays wouldn't oppose chattel slavery if they were born in the 18th Century New World. The average person wouldn't oppose The Holocaust if they were a German during the 1930s/1940s, the average person wouldn't oppose the apartheid if they were a White South African in the 1960s. The average person wouldn't join a secular revolution if they lived in an Arab theocracy. This is not to say brave revolutionaries don't exist, or otherwise societies would never change. But revolutions more often succeed due to external forces and extra-political factors than they do to brave heroes finally saying enough is enough and standing up for what is right.

To change my view, you have to demonstrate that either ""evil regimes"" have a lot less popular support than I think, or that a significant part of the population opposing an atrocity that doesn't directly affect them is actually quite common.",Utopia_Builder,430,0.8899999856948853,231,1693502396,2023-08-31 12:19:56,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/166h3ge/cmv_most_people_would_not_speak_out_or_fight/,8,2023
1644dcp,CMV: The government should pay people €100k euro if they donate a kidney to someone who needs one,"I'm going to use numbers from my own countries as reference:  

In Belgium, a year's worth of dialysis treatment costs the government roughly €60k per year per patient. Meanwhile, a kidney from a healthy live donor lasts on average between 15-20 years with relatively minimal other costs after transplant.   
So let's assume 15 years of dialysis saved on average that would mean that 1 transplant saves the government roughly €800k (assuming €100k in total for surgery + medical follow-up of donor and recipient).   

I think to encourage more people to donate their kidney, the government should pay people €100k. Even with such a large payment, it would still lead to big savings for the government. And obviously, the recipient would benefit greatly as well due to massively increased QoL.    

And because I know people will bring up the health impacts on the donor: I don't consider this to be enough of an impact to not implement this plan. A thoroughly screened and healthy donor sees an extremely limited (if any) impact on their life. A month after the surgery, the donor can resume life as normal without any restrictions whatsoever. And the odds of developing kidney failure later in life are also very small when properly screened.    

And even if kidney failure is developed, there would be plenty of donors ready to give a kidney due to the high payment involved.",SuckMyBike,428,0.800000011920929,428,1693272003,2023-08-28 20:20:03,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1644dcp/cmv_the_government_should_pay_people_100k_euro_if/,8,2023

I say that not as some kind of brag, but to set the tone for this conversation and to express that I have really thought this through.

For example, putting all your passwords into a service that can now be hacked, disrupted, or is subject to access by its employees is actually risky and I'm not sure why people think it's ok. 

Beyond that, what about the convenience factor? If I use a strong password system (of my own design) that I can remember easily, but is long, unique, and has solid variety, I can be on my computer, any number of laptops, my phone, my wife's computer, friends' computers, or anywhere else and still be able to log in if I want to.

Usually the house they live in and maybe a separate flat or two to rent, not massive wealth but more than enough to be life changing (from the point of view of the average person paying rent/mortgage).

I'm super happy for them (and surely a little bit jealous), some of them were able to transform their hobbies/passions in small businesses, some have travel the world extensively, some others have kept a regular job but of course they have no financial worries. I have no issue accepting that this is the way life is, some families are richer/more generous and each person is entitled to do the best with what they get in life. Good for them! 

What rubs me the wrong way are the ones that don't acknowledge their luck when talking about life choices/life opportunities. It honestly felt disrespected at times:

I'm complaining about my job and you tell me how happy you are about your ""brave"" choice to stop working and travel around? or how becoming a Pilates instructor changed your life?   
On the other side I do have friends/acquaintances that have no problems being honest about how their financial luck impacted their life chances/choices and it's honestly so refreshing to hear!

15qa9uf,CMV: Nobody is too Busy to not Text Back Within a Couple of Days,"This is moreso related to dating than just conversing between friends/family. One thing that has really frustrated me about modern dating is this idea that everyone is somehow ""too busy"" to text back. I understand not wanting to message someone back and forth, especially when it's early in a relationship, every couple of hours. That's exhausting and we all have day jobs/hobbies we want to pursue and not be constantly trying to think how to keep someone we barely know, or maybe haven't even met yet, entertained through our words.

That said, I think it's way too common these days for people to claim they don't text back within 24ish hours because they're ""too busy"". I get that life is sometimes unpredictable and things break/shit happens. I work in a pretty demanding job and I have periods too where I basically have to be heads down and really focus on something for 14+ hours a day. The thing is, I don't believe that:

1. Most peoples' jobs are THAT demanding. From what I've seen/read online, most people do maybe 4ish hours of work a day and are pretending to be busy the rest of the time
2. This is the more important part: I know for me personally that if I really like a girl, I'll respond to her by EOD. For one, it realistically only takes 5-10 mins max to think of something and type it out. Even if I worked 14 hours that day, I can still find 5 mins before bed to text someone I'm into before I fall asleep at worst. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see how it'd be different from a woman's perspective if she were really into me
3. IME, whenever I start talking to a girl over the phone, we generally feel each other out and naturally come up with a ""rhythm"", for lack of better word, of how often we communicate. The two things I've noticed are that if a girl is really into me, she'll text me back come hell or high water. The second is that the minute this ""rhythm"" starts getting extended, that's when things have gone south.

If you had a convo or two over a dating app, or even one to two face to face dates. Fine whatever, it's somewhat expected that ghosting happens. I still think you should say ""Honestly I'd rather not talk anymore"" block but I can see maybe giving that a pass.

But someone, whether it be someone you are seeing romantically, a friend, a family member does deserve some closure. If you just cease contact with no explanation that is an extremely fucked up thing to do. You are leaving people in limbo. There could be a period of days where they are questioning if you are just mad, busy or perhaps hurt. It takes a whole 5 seconds to type ""I don't want to be in your life anymore"" and if they say something mean or start to argue, block them.

What pisses me off is the super individualized, pop psychology excuses people use to defend this dogshit behavior. ""I don't owe anyone my time. No one is entitled to a response. Telling someone I want to cease contact may be unsafe. I have anxiety around confrontation, how dare you question me abliest!"" It's all such bullshit and you dancing around the fact that you are selfish, careless asshole for doing this. As for the safety thing, a person that is aggressive and unhinged actually may go more nuts if you ghost them then if you just sternly end things. And if they may be dangerous? End things over text and then block. What are they going to do? I know I'd be more pissed than if someone just ended things.

We should be striving to be more loving and caring people. Especially in this digital age where relationships are becoming more commodified. We are all sad, lonely, and a lot of us are inside more than out. Thinking you struck a connection with someone only to have that ripped away without an explanation is extremely cruel. I don't care if they aren't ""entitled"" to it.

One more thing I would like to add is some clarification on what ghosting is. I have heard people defend it in the past by saying ""I have had talks with this person and tried to establish boundaries. But they wouldn't listen."" That's not my definition of ghosting. To me ghosting is when one party suddenly ceases all contact when all was well the last time they talked. The ghostee had NO IDEA that the ghoster wanted to end things. It comes completely out of left field. Giving up on trying to talk to someone who you've repeatedly warned does not fit the definition IMO. If I am wrong there, let me know.

15xx5if,CMV: We need a non vegan animal rights movement,"Feel free to argue we don't need an animal rights movement, or that it has to be vegan.

As a preface, I have no issue with vegans. I think they are admirable in their dedication for something they care so much about. I do think veganism as a movement is counter productive, and will elaborate below. 

When I say a non vegan animal rights movement, I mean a movement that is primarily lead by non vegans and supported by non vegans. This is because I think this is the only way to really pressure governments to create and truly enforce animal rights.

Yes this means that I don't think animals desperately need the right to free movement, or the right to not be killed. In my opinion the current discourse around animal abuse leads to the majority of people just not engaging. 

What rights do a realistically think we could get animals? The right to not be tortured, the right to nutrition, the right to free roaming in an enclosed outdoor area, the right to clean living spaces. 

Is this perfect and amazing for animals? It's a lot better than what we have now and honestly I'm so frustrated with the idea that we should do nothing instead of ending animal abuse because it's not full emancipation. 

The fact is that individuals changing their diet makes almost no impact on the meat industry. Far more people are being born than are going vegan. The world is not going to go vegan! Also, if you are truly convinced that eating less meat will reduce factory farming, convincing 50% of the population to eat plant based one day a week would roughly double the impact of the current vegan population. (3% of vegans vs 1/7/half the population = 7% reduction in meat consumption) not to mention it would allow many more people to discover plant based food they like, and may eat that more.

The whole thing where we identify ourselves as vegan and eat no meat ever is completely non productive and in my opinion, has slowed down any movement on animal rights to a standstill.

I know it's not fully representative but just check out the vegan sub talking about someone eating less meat and how inadequacy it is. They will tell people to break up with their spouse because they decided they couldn't fully commit to veganism after all. 

Imagine if we decided anyone who drives a car is an enemy and cant advocate for climate awareness. Imagine how little that movement would be accomplishing if it was so exclusive and judgemental. 

We don't need to imagine it for veganism. It's accomplishing absolutely nothing right now. More meat is being eaten than ever and more animals are being abused than ever. Idealism will not save these animals from torture.

Obviously there's people who have personality traits that drive them to cheat, e.g. always needing to be the centre of attention or having a combination of high sex drive and lack of impulse control, but even in those cases I think it's possible for a person to change if they want to, with a lot of reflecting and action and therapy or both.

However I think some people do it for genuine reasons, e.g. to escape an abusive relationship, and I think even some people may do it once and learn from it and never do it again.

15zuka6,CMV: Final moral dilemma in The Good Place is invalid,"Minor spoilers for 3 year old sitcom. I would ask everyone to use a spoiler tag when talking about major spoilers for the series because this is one of my go-to sitcoms and I want people to experience it without spoilers.

Final moral dilemma in Season 4 Episode 12 ""Patty"" is as following: Hypatia of Alexandria (Patty) informs that prolonged exposure to the Good Place will cause you to become lethargic hedonist. Because all your needs are met without effort, you become monotonous, lose interest in everything and even cause mental decline. You become a happiness zombie. Solution for this was >!to give option to ""quit"" the afterlife giving meaning for existence.!<

After the solution was implemented everyone went fine. While dilemma and conclusion itself is valid it's not valid in context of The Good Place. Reason for this is simple. The Good Place is not without challenges and hurdles.

Tahini >!learns thousands of tasks meaning that they actually needed to study and learn instead of instantly gaining those skills.<!

But maybe most compelling argument is Jason and his goal to >!play perfect run of Madden which takes him thousands of tries.<! Even with access to our current collective collection of media and games I could spend thousands of Jeremy Bearimies exploring this vast quantity of content. And not just that I would have access to everything new created on Earth. 500 hours of content is uploaded to YouTube every minute. New movies, games and books are released every year. And not just that but I would also have access to everything created in the Good Place (!>They tell that Shakespeare wrote multiple new plays and people can spend a life time learning about his works while he lived<!) multiplying new content to almost infinity.

Fact that you have to (or at least can) work for your enjoyment in The Good Place means you cannot become Happiness Zombie.",Z7-852,269,0.8500000238418579,176,1692861554,2023-08-24 02:19:14,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15zuka6/cmv_final_moral_dilemma_in_the_good_place_is/,8,2023

""Why don't you just leave if he/she isn't filling your needs?""
 ""Why don't you just leave if he/she isn't pulling their weight?""
 ""Why don't you just leave if he/she refuses to go to counseling?""
 ""Why don't you just leave if he/she cheated on you?"" ""Why don't you just leave instead of cheating?""

All of these are great reasons not to stay, but they make people who don't have the option to leave feel like crap. If leaving was possible, I'd imagine the vast majority would do just that.

15tt316,CMV: Being pro- capitalism and pro free markets should mean you are also pro- open borders/immigration,"It seem like a lot of conservatives are very interested in capitalism and free markets, but anti-immigration/open borders. This has always confused me. People moving between countries seems just like people ""voting with their wallets"" on which countries/companies are the best. Not only do people benefit from this free movement by chosing where they can live the best life (based on income/living conditions/social programs/climate/etc), businesses also potentially get access to more people. This would allow them to hire better and/or cheaper labor.

Within the US, you can see movement of people between states and it's a powerful way for people to increase their quality of life and business benefits too. So why not at a global scale? It doesn't make sense to me.

15vxy35,Cmv: women should not be billed for childbirth related medical attention,"It's so weird to me that this happens. I get that it's a medical situation just like any other. But it strikes me as wrong on a fundamental level 

Childbirth is something that is necessary for the continuation of us as a species. It's also an important and natural human activity. A momentous activity that is considered to be vitally valuable in every culture, and even ritualized in many.


We need to be incentivizing rather than discouraging birth in developed countries. Most of which would be losing population if not for immigrants

165b0px,CMV: Drinking age should be lowered in the US,"There are several reasons I think the drinking age in the US should be lowered from 21 to either 18 or 19.

1. most people ignore this law and drink before they’re 21. It’s odd to have a law that the majority of the population breaks. IMO it creates a disrespect for the law in general.

2. When I went to college, because I wasn’t allowed to get alcohol safely, at a restaurant with friends, our only option was to go to a frat house and drink the punch that they could have put anything inside of. I personally know a girl that was raped after a frat party. Outlawing drinking until you’re 21 just makes people put themselves in dangerous positions to drink.

3. The age was raised to 21 in order to lower the amount of drunk drivers. I agree if you drive after drinking then you’re a terrible person. But the type of person who would drive drunk definitely isn’t the type of person who would listen to the law about waiting until you’re 21 to drink.

4. When I joined my sorority the very first meeting they had all the new members bring photos of ourselves we took at CVS along with filling out a form with our info. They did this so they could place an order for fake ID’s for all the new members. My point in sharing this is to show how common fake ID’s are. Like most freshmen in college get fake ID’s. The problem with this IMO is that we are giving money to people who probably aren’t the best (think cartels and gangs who make the fake IDs)",Difficult-Prompt1731,230,0.6700000166893005,706,1693391610,2023-08-30 05:33:30,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/165b0px/cmv_drinking_age_should_be_lowered_in_the_us/,8,2023
162zhov,CMV: Porn is one of the most psychologically degrading influences in our society. (TW),"It is so fucking sad that a whole generation of kids (and probably going to get only worse, for now at least) is experiencing pornhub main page as their introduction to what should be the beautiful, intimate, exquisite, bonding experience of lovemaking. Instead they immediately get thrown into an online world of aggression, incest, rape, sado-masochism, and just over all disgusting displays of human disconnection, abuse and selfishness, as the fucking NORM! AND on top of that, since the fish have no clue about the water they swim in, the culture around us validates all of this as “harmless fantasy” and overrides (or at least attempts to) the sense of the destructiveness and dehumanization that porn truly is… I work with kids in the mental health field and I see so much how radically it has impacted them, warps their view of sex, of women/men, before they have a chance to explore it innocently themselves. It also can have massive impacts on mental health in general.",BenedrylBooferBro,230,0.6600000262260437,380,1693164534,2023-08-27 14:28:54,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/162zhov/cmv_porn_is_one_of_the_most_psychologically/,8,2023
15xjb56,CMV: Having kids is great,"We often get posts here about kids, usually about how awful it is that society expects people to become parents, how having kids is selfish and environmentally unfriendly or how having kids will ruin your life. It’s very hard to respond to these posts because telling people who don’t want kids that kids are great and that they should have them is a bit of a dick move. However, this subreddit is all about expressing and defending opinions, me writing this isn’t about convincing others, it’s about defending a view that’s rarely expressed here.  
Before I explain why kids are great I need to set a condition, it is possible for something to be great whilst still being expensive, frustrating, tiring or difficult. Many great things are one or all of these things, a safari is amazing but costs a fortune, climbing Everest is one of the hardest but most rewarding things you can do and sometimes my wife is incredibly frustrating, it doesn’t mean she’s not the best thing that’s ever happened to me.  
So why is having kids great? It boils down to two main things, one, they’re great fun and two, you get to experience how wondrous the world is through their discoveries. We never stop enjoying play but, as we get older, we get responsibilities and mature, we still like play but we limit how much of it we do and the play we do do we often take seriously. Kids don’t suffer from this, they don’t have our ego, they just want to imagine and pretend and race and climb and build. It’s a pure form of play that adults have often forgotten but we get to experience again with kids. The other day I pretended my three year old daughter could electrocute me. We spent a good 10 minutes of her touching me, me pretending to get an electric shock and her laughing like crazy. It was joyous and wonderful and I rarely experience anything close to it in my wider life, my daughter and I do something like that 5 times a day, it’s incredibly fun.  
The other thing is less obvious. One of the most rewarding things we can do as adults is to achieve something we’ve never done before, the older we get the less this happens. For kids this happens like clockwork, especially early on. Seriously the pride a child feels the first time they pull on their socks is wild and guess what, the parent feels it too. Rolling over, seeing a duck, eating with a fork, catching a ball and don’t even get me started on their first steps, these are all incredible experiences and you experience them along with your child. Children reframe what life is, the most mundane things for an adult are an incredible adventure for kids. Last week I flew with my kids for the first time, I filmed them as the plane took off, it was like we were on the greatest roller coaster ever built.  
Kids give you an experience that is unlike anything else in my adult life and, despite the tantrums, despite the mess and the constant need for attention, that is absolutely worth it. Here’s the other wonderful thing, I haven’t lost the adult stuff either. It takes a bit more work but I get to go out with my friends and do all the kid free stuff I used to, I still have both worlds. Having kids is great, Change my view.

In the US there has been an increase of teens from 13 to 17 getting such surgeries and a lot of them later regretting it because they weren't mature enough to make this decision.

15j0guf,"CMV: The ""No True Scotsman"" fallacy is more pervasive in religion than anywhere else, and can never be taken in good faith in that context.","Of all the groups of people I've seen try to ""disown"" a certain individual or group of individuals, none have done so with more frequency and fallacy that the religious.

Using Christianity as an example, if a Christian is a homphobic, racist person who likes to beat their children and drive on the sidewalk, you don't get to say they're not a ""true Christian."" They are just as Christian as you are.

A humble, accepting, loving moderate Catholic is absolutely a part of the same group as a Neo-Evangelist who uses their platform to disenfranchise minorities and spread hate and fear. They both fall under the banner of Christian, and the denominations therein make no difference when discussing how Christian they are.

If you can explain to me why one religous individual can realistically say another isn't a ""true <insert religion here>"" without it being a fallacy (or someone obviously making a mockery of <aforementioned religion> and not trying to genuinely be one,) I will take that as a flaw in my view.",TheWheelZee,208,0.8100000023841858,146,1691253979,2023-08-05 11:46:19,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15j0guf/cmv_the_no_true_scotsman_fallacy_is_more/,8,2023
15nodtz,CMV: The military has a right to be as selective as it chooses when it comes to screening for medical conditions,"I am really lost at this point and looking for various opposed ideas.

The military has a right to disqualify certain medical conditions for service. Whether that be a history of medical disorders or physical limitations.

Here are a list of conditions ive seen ppl have a problem with;

Diabetes mellitus (either type), a history of gestational diabetes, a history of gout, high cholesterol or TAG, history of anemia even if known to be caused by nutritional deficiency, history of kidney stones that reoccur, irregular menstrual, history of irregular PAP smears, PCOS, being intersex, being menopausal, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, history of more than one knee dislocation, history of stress fracture, excema/psoriasis/dermatitis that requires systemic steroid therapy or covers more than 10% of the body, severe acne, history of allergies that cause anaphylaxis, severe allergy to shellfish, peanuts, or treenuts, severe allergy to biting or stinging insects, restless leg syndrome, if you've had sleepwalking or night-terrors after the age of 13, Tourette's syndrome, if you have a history of headaches after having experienced a concussion, migraines, cluster headaches, ADHD if you've needed any accommodations (educational or work) after the age of 14 or you have taken medication for it within the past 2 years or have any other comorbid mental disorder or it's ever been documented to adversely impact your work or education, dyslexia, autism, depression if you ever needed more than 12 months of counseling or had symptoms or treatment in the last 3 years, any history of eating disorders even if in recovery, any history of suicidality, and any history of self-injury are all disqualifying, among many others.

And so on.

I have these believes because at times the military can lead people into austere deprived places around the world. Many medical resources wouldn't be there to treat underlying/ prior conditions.

If jo bob has a history of suicidal attempts when he becomes depressed ( deployments can be very sad places) he trys to hurt himself or others. He know is a person who cannot function in a immanent hostile area that is now taking up space and exhausting resources for those other warfighters.

15nrxil,CMV: Peak Privilege is Having Almost No Anxiety,"Those who grow up in households where most of their financial and social (and psychological) needs were met, and whose family has learned to enjoy such privileged life, will clearly have little to no anxiety. It seems obvious but I think there's more to it. Ever seen videos of someone doing an adventurous feat and commenters writing ""white people shit"". Yeah, it's because white people enjoy financial and social privilege in the US, they thus have little financial and social anxiety, and are more likely to be adventurous bc of it. Number one trait to know whether someone comes from an upper or lower class background? It's their anxiety. Some of my lower income tenants are extremely anxious for even the slightest inconvenience. Upper income people enjoy the luxury of not having learned anxiety in its harmful form while growing up. They do stuff, get injured if need be, and move on.  


  
And the social component is as equally important as the financial. The privilege of not getting anxious if a girl you are flirting with talks back? Of having social/romantic privilege, and knowing that you can get your social/romantic/sexual fantasies satisfied (even if not totally fulfilled). Think Chuck Bass in Gossip Girl. Of course it can make you a douchebag if you so choose, but it also gives you the freedom and privilege to enjoy a life without social fears.Just had these thoughts as I evaluate how I want to live my life.
