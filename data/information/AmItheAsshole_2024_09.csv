1fd0m2c,AITA for refusing to move out even though my roommate is 7 months pregnant?,"Hi guys, last week my roommate Becca found out she is not only pregnant but seven months along. 

She texted me that we had to talk today and  I had assumed she would be moving out soon for more space when the baby comes. Instead she told me I have to move out to make space for the nursery and her baby daddy to move in. 

I’m on a terrible salary and cannot afford anywhere else to live, plus like she wants me to move out right now so she can prepare for the baby. Even if I wanted to move out now, the apartment rentals in my area are either too expensive or well below living standards so I don’t want to move. 

She went absolutely crazy the moment I told her I wouldn’t move out, because I’m ruining her motherhood experience by not letting her family live together. I pay rent here and my names on the lease until at least the end of the year. I’m not gonna pull out of the lease and I told her that if she wants her little family together that she should move and I’ll find someone to half the cheap rent with. 

That made her start crying and saying how I just want to ruin her life to the point her baby daddy had to console her and tell me to get out of their way already. I’ve not heard her stop crying since but I think I’m totally valid that I don’t want to leave.

1fbibcr,AITA for signing my kids up for public school behind my wife's back?,"So, I (36M) am a dad to 6-year-old twins, and my wife (28F) is a stay-at-home mom who has recently gone full crunchy mom mode. She's all about essential oils, no processed foods, cloth diapers when they were babies, and she's absolutely against anything mainstream. For the longest time I didn’t mind because a lot of it is about healthy living and I want the best for our kids. But things are starting to get way out of control.

The latest issue is that my wife is dead set on homeschooling the twins. She’s convinced that public school is “toxic” and that our kids won’t thrive in a system that’s “designed to make them little robots.” She even has a few friends in her crunchy mom group who homeschool their kids and she’s been talking nonstop about joining their co-op. I’ve expressed my concerns about this from the beginning. I work full-time and I don’t think she realizes how hard it’s going to be to manage homeschooling two kids at the same time while giving them a proper education.

But she won’t hear it. Anytime I bring up public school she shuts it down immediately, saying she doesn't want the twins to get bullied or that we’ll lose control of what they’re learning. I just don’t think homeschooling is realistic and I can’t see how she’ll keep them on any sort of consistent schedule.

I gave her time to prove me wrong over the summer, thinking maybe she’d ease into it and have a plan. Instead, she’s spent most of the time bouncing between different unschooling philosophies and signing them up for random activities with her crunchy mom friends. The kids are constantly bored, and I’ve seen them starting to fall behind.

I'm not proud to admit it but I went behind her back and enrolled the twins in public school for the fall. I told her a few weeks before school started and she absolutely lost it. She accused me of betraying her and said I was undermining her role as a mother. She keeps saying I don’t trust her to raise our kids which isn’t true. I just don’t think she’s prepared to handle homeschooling and I don’t want the twins to suffer because of it.

She spent the whole first week of school trying to make me feel guilty by saying the twins are miserable and that I’ve ruined their childhoods by forcing them into the system. The thing is as far as I can tell the twins actually loved their first week school. They’ve made friends and like their teacher. But my wife keeps insisting they’re just pretending to like it to make me happy.

Now, she’s talking about pulling them out mid-year and starting over with her homeschooling plan but I’m putting my foot down. I want the best for my kids, and I honestly think public school is the right choice for them right now. My wife is making me feel like I’m the bad guy for going behind her back and forcing them into something she was so against.

AITA for enrolling the twins in public school without her consent? Should I have handled it differently? I'm starting to feel really guilty about what this is doing to my wife.

**EDITING TO ADD:**

* Yes the twins are vaccinated. My wife wasn't so far in the crunchy pipeline back then. Her friends do sometimes make her feel bad about that.

* I looked into homeschooling and unschooling and did my research. I had hoped my wife had a plan which was why I gave her the summer to figure that out.",atmylimitsnow,10265,0.949999988079071,2920,1725746282,2024-09-07 16:58:02,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fbibcr/aita_for_signing_my_kids_up_for_public_school/,9,2024
1fgx5ai,AITA for refusing to give my roommate a tampon?,"My roommate (23f) and I (22f) have been living together for about a year now. I have been renting on my own since I was 17 and this is her first apartment. Her lack of experience shows. 

I’ve had to remind her to pay me for utilities and rent a few times, and she is often a couple days late. She also doesn’t really pick up after herself and leaves dishes in the sink for over a week sometimes. I’ve had to ask her to contribute to buying necessities of daily living, such as toilet paper, dish soap, paper towels, laundry detergent, etc. because she always just waits for me to buy them. 

A few months ago I started my period and when I went to the bathroom to take care of it I saw she had used all of my tampons and didn’t ever buy more to replace them. Needless to say, I was very annoyed. She could have at least texted me to give me a heads up or something. I asked her why she used mine and didn’t buy her own. She told me she was broke and I didn’t really know how to argue with that so I just asked her to at least tell me next time.

And then it happened again! A couple weeks ago I started my period and when I went to the bathroom, my box of tampons was completely empty. Now I was livid. When I purchased more I started keeping them in my room and hiding a few in a clever spot in the bathroom so she wouldn’t find them. 

Yesterday she knocked on my bedroom door and asked if I had a tampon from the other side. I told her I bought a box a little while ago (the one she emptied) and there should still be some left because I haven’t used them. She said she would check but I didn’t hear from her again that night after she went to the bathroom. 

I did have tampons. They were in my room. 

Now I feel like an asshole, like I’ve betrayed the sisterhood. I could have given her at least one and told her to purchase more herself. But I was admittedly still bitter because of how she is as a roommate in general.

1fnz6v1,AITA for not cleaning up after my bf messed up?,"Context: my bf of 2 years decided he wanted to cook tonight. As I had just been to the dentist and had a procedure done I told him that if he chose to cook it, he needed to know that I had no interest in participating and if that wasn’t ok we could take a meal from the freezer. 

He really wanted to and made Mac n cheese. This needed to go in the oven and he wanted to use a form that is very difficult to clean so I told him to use a backing sheet of some sort to make sure it didn’t stick too much. He chose not to. 

After he was finished and the form was burnt and lots of pieces stuck to it. He put it to soak and asked me before bed if I could clean it for him the morning after. 

I told him no. He then proceed to say “oh then I guess I’ll be doing it at 8am in the morning before work” I asked what he meant and he said that he found it ridiculous that I wouldn’t do it as I go to work later than him. I explained that I had previously tried to warn him about this issue and that I was trying to prevent it for him and that I didn’t find it fair that he was trying to make me feel bad for not fixing it for him now that it could’ve been avoided. 

He thinks I should feel bad, but I really don’t. I’m I the asshole? ",NeighborhoodShot4168,9124,0.9700000286102295,423,1727135898,2024-09-23 18:58:18,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fnz6v1/aita_for_not_cleaning_up_after_my_bf_messed_up/,9,2024
1fpfdyy,AITA for not making my fiance a “list” of things to do for our daughter? ,"I’ll try to keep this as short as possible I 24F and my fiance 25M had a rather large disagreement this morning. While I was brushing my teeth and using the bathroom my fiance placed our daughter to watch her show in her high chair and then just proceeded to watch tik toks for the next approx 10-15 minutes straight while my daughter waited. I finally came out and saw this and asked why he hadn’t made any breakfast for her yet… he proceeds to say “I was waiting to ask you what to make for her” (note: she is one and eats scrambled eggs on daycare days like today) I said that’s a lie you know what she eats by now. Anyways this comment sparked a disagreement between us because I vented about his lack of assistance in helping to get her or any of her belongings ready to go in the morning. His solution after getting frustrated with me was to tell me I need to “make him a list of what I would like him to do for her” and I refused as I said I don’t want to mother him as well and as her parent he should know what needs to be done (diaper changes, outfit, teeth brushing, daycare bottles cleaned and filled up, etc.) I tried explaining that as her mom no one ever gives me a “list” I simply look around or think about what needs to be done.

1fmg8kx,"AITA for locking the pantry to stop my roommate from eating all my food?

","So, I (26F) live with two roommates, and one of them, “Jess” (28F), has a bad habit of eating other people's food. At first, it was small things like a handful of chips or a piece of fruit, and I didn’t really care. But lately, she’s been eating entire meals I’ve prepped for the week, snacks, basically everything. I’ve confronted her multiple times, and she always apologizes, saying she’ll replace it, but she never does.

I’ve asked her to just respect what’s mine, and she’ll agree, but the next day, something else goes missing. It’s driving me insane because groceries are expensive, and I don’t want to budget extra just to feed her.

I finally got fed up and bought a small lock for the pantry I use and started keeping my dry goods and snacks in there. I also cleared out a section of the fridge for my food and labeled everything that’s mine. Since I installed the lock, Jess has been super passive-aggressive, saying I’m “treating her like a child” and making the house feel uncomfortable. She even made a sarcastic comment in front of friends about me “putting everything under lock and key.”

Now, the other roommate, “Sara,” says she understands why I’m frustrated, but she thinks I took it too far by locking up my food and creating tension in the house. I honestly don’t think I’m in the wrong here, but now I’m second-guessing myself.

1fnyawx,AITA for crying when my entire family started to speak a language I barely know?,"So I'm a 14 year old guy and my parents are from Taiwan their native language is Mandarin. My older sister(19F) and older brother(17M) both speak it pretty much fluently. Well by the time I came around and was like old enough to actually learn stuff my family rarely spoke our native language. Due to that I barely speak it, my mom said I barely compare to a toddler in the language so she signed me up for online Mandarin lessons that I'm starting this week.


Today when I came home from school my sister was the only one home and greeted me in Mandarin and started speaking to me in it, I asked her why in English and she told me in English that our parents want everyone to speak more Mandarin around the house. I just started to have a lot of anxiety because of it and tonight at dinner everyone was speaking Mandarin and I can't really pick up on most of it, I understand enough to like kind of understand what's happening in the conversation but barely and sometimes I get lost. Then my brother turns to me and asked me a question in Mandarin and I just didn't understand a single word of it and I started to cry. I told my mom that she is bullying me for not knowing how to speak our native language and she even agreed that it's her fault and I don't get why she's doing this to me.

1fnvdia,AITA for allowing my wife to pick my son's names and not letting my family call him a 'Westernised' nickname? ,"We live in England, wife is South Asian and I am white British (late 20S F and M). We have young boy twins, just under 2 years old. Names are important and we don't mind who sees this so we're using exact first names but not surname. 

I had no name preferences, am uninventive and have a boring 'British' name myself, think John James Jacob Smith (not really, but basically). With our kids, they both have my surname, 'Smith', and from day 1 I said I wanted her pick on first names and she chose lovely names from her culture that I fell in love with. 

So our boys are Ramin Navroz Smith and Rustom Parvez Smith, which means 'joyous new year' and 'victorious hero' in its Parsi origins. We liked that they were similar ish without being the same.

The boys will live in the UK so obviously we have no problem with either shortening their name or going by a nickname at school as long as its their choice. Plus it's not likely theyll do it for racialised reasons: we live in very diverse London. 

Problem: boys are not identical, and like many mixed race siblings, they look a bit different. They have similar features but Ramin has dark hair and eyes like his mum and Rustom has light hair and eyes like me. They're both ethnically ambiguous and very young if you're thinking in terms of ""white passing"" you would say Rustom will find it easier to ""pass"" while Ramin a bit harder. We don't micromanage our toddlers racial traits so haven't given much thought to it. 

Unfortunately, my family (except my parents) seem to have given this too much thought. 

SIL started it by repeatedly commenting that Ramin looked like a Ramin but Rustom didn't look like a Rustom and we were just ??? but let it go. Then she and my brother start calling him 'Russell' as a nickname, get extended fam to do it to the point he starts answering to it and people use the nickname in captions or texts. We said no multiple times! 

We put our foot DOWN and said only my parents could see either boy till they knock the Russell shit off. Cue flood of tears from SIL and blame from others, telling us it was just well meaning nicknaming, that her 3 yo daughter came up w it and that we're oversensitive.

I feel we're going insane as other than my parents, everyone seems on their side and saying we're draconian? We don't care if the boys want a nickname at any point but they're babies, and I just can't buy ""it has nothing to do with race"" when they're doing it to the blonde kid and not the ""darker"" one. I also can't buy that their child gave the name because of the above + WHAT 3 y/o comes up with ""Russell""??? 

Our line = we do not want this weird difference to exist between the boys before they even comprehend race. We think it's damaging longterm to give one boy a ""white name"" just because he's blonde, especially as the two do actually look different. 

But maybe we are too close to it and SO many people keep telling us it's harmless/we're overthinking? Help!

1fbjj26,AITA for hiding my boyfriend’s anime body pillow while my parents were visiting?,"My boyfriend (M/32) and I (F/27) have been together for a year. He’s only met my parents once over the holidays last year because they live pretty far away. They've been visiting this past week and since he and I just moved in together they were excited to see our new place, and get to know my BF a little more.

We have an extra bedroom, and this has become my boyfriend’s gaming room for the most part but we agreed when guests come over it would be a second bedroom. He really likes video games and anime in particular so he has a lot of toys and artwork that he’s collected over the years from different games and such. 

One thing he has is this anime body pillow that features a sexy anime girl on it. He also has a mousepad for his gaming computer that resembles a busty anime girl. Before my parents came over I asked him to take down his toys and stuff so they could be comfortable. I was upset to see that he left the body pillow and the mousepad in place.

I don’t really feel comfortable with either item but he’s really into anime so I’ve always kind of left it alone. But I absolutely didn’t think it was appropriate to leave it in there when my parents would be staying over. I took the cover off the body pillow and put the pillow in the closet and I put the mousepad in a drawer in our room.

When my parents arrived and we showed them to their room, my BF noticed the missing pillow and mousepad. Later, when we were in bed, he brought it up to me and asked why I hid them. I told him I didn’t think my parents would feel comfortable with those things in the bedroom and when they leave we can put them back.

My BF got really upset. He told me that he feels like I’m ashamed of his interest in anime. He said he’s spent his whole life feeling like people think he’s weird for being into anime and he didn’t expect his own GF to be “just like everyone else”. 

The next day, I noticed him taking some of his manga books off our bookshelf and putting them into a box. I asked him why and he said something like “I’m putting them away so you don’t have to look at them anymore”.

I feel really bad, I feel like I hurt him but I just really didn’t think my parents would feel comfortable sleeping in a room with those items. But now he’s just acting so distant and cold and he’s not really engaging with my parents at all. They keep asking me what’s wrong and I don’t know what to say.

1fq9egy,AITA for disagreeing with my wife’s idea of her never learning how to cook? ,"My wife (24) and I (26 yr old female) are struggling in our marriage as she believes she does not need to help cook or prepare food or even help clean up after, besides dishes. 

She was raised in a family with no chores and they had a maid come clean the house. She has never learned to cook and can not boil water despite me walking her through it, she just loses patience. I love my wife and have taken time out of our evenings to show her how to cook and measure spices, for example. She lasts about 2 minutes before either walking away or throwing a tantrum that she doesn’t want to learn and I should be the only who in this house who has to know how to cook. 

The other night, I got home from work and was exhausted since it has been a busy week in healthcare. She complained she has not spent enough time with me these past few days, so I offered to have her cook with me so she can learn while also spending time together. I thought it would be cute to make a recipe together that we never ate before. She threw a fit and said she just wanted to just TV but eventually agreed to sit in the kitchen with me. About 10 minutes in, I asked her to wash a grill rack since she usually does the dishes when I cook. Surprise, she threw a tantrum. Eventually she did it because she was hungry and I was busy cooking 3 different parts of the dinner. A few minutes later I had to go outside to and grill some chicken and I asked if she could start putting some spices away so I would have less clean up. I think you know what happened next… 

She eventually stopped yelling and complaining and put some stuff away. I gave her her plate of food first to enjoy since I still had some cleaning up to do. I talked to some friends about it and they said if it was their significant other who never cooked they would eventually said they had to prepare their own meals if they would not help. 

I have mentioned in the past she should learn to cook on her own for numerous reasons but one being that she is a very picky eater so anything I do cook, I have to prepare differently and seperately. 

I am also the one who does the “handyman” duties as well as take care of all the bills and yardwork. I do have to give credit where credit is due and mention that she does the dishes and puts the laundry away.

Our neighbors are a woman, her husband, and their college-aged son. Everything was fine until a few weeks ago when the neighbor woman came over, visibly upset, and told me she saw me changing through my window and would appreciate if I didn’t do that there.

I was surprised because the angle of the window makes it so that someone would really have to go out of their way to see anything. I checked it out myself, and unless you’re standing in a very specific spot in their yard, you can’t see much at all.

To be clear, no one in her family (husband or son) has ever mentioned seeing me; she was just “worried” that they might. I didn’t feel like I should have to change my habits for her, especially since they’d have to be actively trying to look in. So I kept changing there, as I had been.

Well, she came over again last week, this time freaking out at my fiancé, calling me a “whore” and accusing me of being disrespectful. I honestly think it’s ridiculous because I’m in my own home and I’m not flaunting myself. her husband came over and apologized and said he asked her specifically not to do that, and clarified he hadn’t ever mentioned seeing me nor had his son.

My Mom privately requested that I visit my Dad once a day, spend time with him, etc. I have a very busy work schedule so I don’t see how this is really possible, and beyond that, I don’t really get why an adult man needs to be babysat. I told her this and she said he isn’t all mentally there—I haven’t seen evidence of this, besides anecdotal evidence. I told her I wouldn’t babysit my Dad but I would call him and check in on the weekend. She is furious at me, saying that she will be too worried about my Dad being okay to enjoy the vacation. I pointed out she could call him whenever she wanted but she just hung up on me basically. 

I feel a little bad but I also think the whole concept is kind of insulting to my Dad and a waste of my time. AITA?

1fsfv8e,AITAH For not helping my adult sister after our parents passed away ,"I (45f) have a sister (55f) who our parents have always helped/bailed out of every situation she's ever been in.  She has 2 kids so! (32) daughter (30).  My sister and her adult kids were living with my parents and my parents were paying all of the bills.  Over the recent years both of our parents have passed away.  First our mom then our father.  Once my mom passed away I started taking care of my dad's finances and began cutting my sister off.  I no longer gave her the ""allowance"" that my mom had been giving her each month.  After dad passed away I informed the three of them that I was selling the house.  They looked at me confused and asked why.  I simply told them there was no one to pay for it anymore.  They found a place to rent and eventually my nephew bought a house.  He met a girl and they got married.  Here's where I am wondering if I am the asshole.  My sister is living with my nephew and his wife and they are starting a new life/family together.  More info I finally after my  parents passed away married my long time boyfriend and we are starting a life together ourselves.   I feel like I have always put everyone's needs and wants before my own.  So, AITAH for not taking in my sister so my nephew can start a new life and family?

1fhqimh,AITA for not giving washer and dryer away to brother-in-law and sister-in-law,"
I have a brother-in-law and sister-in-law that has owed my wife and me $1,200 for over three years now. They were struggling at the time and we let them borrow the money to get a place of their own with the expectation that they would pay us back quickly, although we really expected that they would give us $50 here and there until it was paid back, which we were fine with. Now, more than three years later, we have not received a dime and they avoid the subject. 

The other day, our four-year old dryer quit working and instead of dealing with the hassle of getting it repaired, we went out and bought a new washer and dryer set. We posted the old ones for free on FB marketplace. 

Almost immediately, my sister-in-law messaged that they wanted it, to which I replied that I would sell it to them for $1,200. She called my wife about the exchange and my wife was somewhat upset. I've temporarily taken the listing down, but I am adamant that they don't get it, especially since there is till a ton of value in them.

1f7jdth,AITA for asking a woman to teach her autistic son boundaries? ,"My grandmother became friends with a family who a few years ago moved to her same neighborhood, they have a son with autism, he is 16 years old.

I lived my entire childhood with my grandmother and a few months ago I returned to live with her because someone must take care of her because of some problems that happened.

My grandmother has always been really friendly and the boy's mother always goes to her house with her son and his babysitter. I've been doing a few dialogues with them and the guy has started to get more trusting with me. 

He is non-verbal, his way of communicating is touching people and he gets too close for my liking. I don't like physical contact and it bothers me that people don't respect personal space but I try to be respectful. 

When the guy comes up close to rubbing his nose against my cheek (that's how close he gets, it's his way of Communicate) I walk away but he continues following me, his family finds him adorable and they are happy that he is comfortable with me but I am not. 

They even started making jokes that he's in love with me. I'm an adult, there's nothing funny or cute on saying those kind of things. 

I have asked the boy to please keep his distance from me but he does not listen to me, I have tried to make him respect my limits but it does not happen and he even follows me to my room sometimes. 
Anyway, a few days ago I approached the mother alone and told her that I feel uncomfortable when someone gets so close to me, that she should teach him to have limits with some people because in the future that could bring him problems. 

She just said to me ""Sisi, thank you for the advice"" but now I have found out that she complained about me to my grandmother and did not come to visit her because she says she felt uncomfortable that I discriminated her son. 

I really don't think I said anything wrong, in my internship I have worked with people with autism and their families correct those behaviors but even my mother told me that I was wrong so I don't know, aitah?

1fkxudz,AITA for telling people that I don't want to cut my hair and it’s my choice?,"It's pink October in my country next month, breast cancer awareness and for some reason it seems like everyone is begging me to donate my hair to charity.

I've long, thin wavy voluminous hair and that's the only thing I'm vain about: no makeup, fancy clothes, nothing.

First, it was my therapist, as l've previously stated I had already trimmed my hair last month, (and I barely wanted it tbh) I said I didn't have the courage many times but she kept saying that it was only 10cm. She said that as the coordinator of the clinic herself, she was going to bring a hairdresser or she'd go with me to a salon.

Then at school, the social pressure from teachers, staff, classmates, everyone... Next week a hairdresser is coming to the school, I'm ugly and insecure, and the only thing I get compliments for is my hair, I'm not going to cut it despite the noble cause, I can help them in other ways. They're begging me and saying that l'm obligated to donate since it's not that much, but I don't want to. That I should donate in the name of everyone since it is so long.

. I’ve a teacher that keeps repeating the same thing again and again cuz the project was her idea, I’m taking longer and different routes to not see her. AITA if I skip school that day?

1f8d5z1,AITA for not being sympathetic that my dad’s affair baby was stillborn?,"I (16F) do not have a good relationship with my dad.  It used to be better when I was younger, but I just don’t expect a lot from him anymore before all this and he has totally messed up things for everyone. He cheated on my mom and they separated back in the spring. My mom found out because he got the woman he was cheating with pregnant and had to come clean.  I stayed with mom and told him to kick rocks because how dare he?  My mom is the nicest and most supportive person in the world. If a hug were a person, that would be my mom. He’s been trying to get me to meet up with him and talk and I told him that as long as he’s still with the affair woman he’s never going to see me. He said that since they’re going to have a baby he has to be there for the baby. I told him looks like he made his choice then.

Last week my oma called to let me know that they were on the way to the hospital because the baby was going to be born and they said they would pick me up if I wanted to come meet my little sister later.  I said no and basically ignored my phone the rest of the day because I don’t want to hear about it. My dad tried to call me that night and I didn’t answer.  This weekend he just showed up at my mom’s house in tears.  My mom let him in and he said that the baby died. I went upstairs and left them alone.  He came up to my room later and asked if we can talk and I said no.  He said that he really misses me and he wants to find a way to make things ok between us. I told him I don’t care and to leave me alone. Then he said that he’s just lost a daughter and can’t I just cut him some slack right now because he’s been punished enough?  That pissed me off pretty bad because he caused this whole problem in the first place, so I told him that he already picked the people that he cares about more and he can’t just do a takesies-backsies now that the kid died. So now he’s 0-2, hope it was worth it. He left.

My mom came up later and said that while she understands why I’m angry at him, he’s really hurting right now and throwing it back at him was wrong. I’m not sure because I think he just brought that up to guilt me into forgiving him. I don’t think he’s really sorry for any of this he just wants to not be the bad guy anymore.",CriticalProof3414,2313,0.949999988079071,611,1725402117,2024-09-03 17:21:57,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1f8d5z1/aita_for_not_being_sympathetic_that_my_dads/,9,2024
1fq97jt,AITA for leaving my brother passed out in a luxury hotel and going back to sleep?,"Last month, I (21M) went on a family trip with my parents and my brother (26M) to a pretty high-end all-inclusive hotel.

Before I dive into the story, you should know that while my brother and I get along really well, we have our moments of friction. The main issue is that he’s the kind of person who lives life to the absolute fullest – which sounds great, but he tends to overdo it. Think of Barney from *How I Met Your Mother*, but in real life. There have even been a few times where he’s called me at 4 a.m. because he has no way of getting home after changing the plans and drinking too much (there’s no Uber in our city, FYI). He usually apologizes later and repays me in some way, but honestly, I’ve started avoiding going out with him too often because of this.

Now, in a fancy hotel with unlimited drinks, it was almost impossible not to go out at night, so I went with him. Before we left our hotel room, I told him, “Hey, I’m just having a few drinks and heading back early.” He agreed. We enjoyed some live music, had a few drinks, and by midnight, when the music ended, I reminded him that the bars closed at 2 a.m. and suggested we grab one more drink before heading back. He said sure. But after that last drink, he decided he wanted to stay out longer. I reminded him that we had family plans the next day and it wouldn’t be fun being hungover, but he pretty much ignored me. So, I left him and went back to the room to sleep.

Fast forward to 4 a.m., and the hotel room phone rings. I wake up, notice his bed is empty, and answer. It’s the lobby telling me my brother is wasted, passed out, laying down in a hallway, and had thrown up all over himself. They asked if someone could come help him. Still half-asleep and pretty pissed, I just hung up the phone, disconnected it, and went back to bed.

When I woke up around 9 a.m., his bed was still empty, and I had a bunch of missed calls from my parents. I called my mom, and she started yelling at me, asking why I hadn’t helped my brother. Turns out, my brother eventually made it to my parents’ room around 6 a.m., helped by two hotel staff members. Apparently, he had also broken a glass door, and they were charging my parents’ card for it. To make matters worse, the staff had told my parents they’d called our room first, and someone (me) had answered, only to hang up.

When I went to my parents' room, they tore into me for not helping my brother. What surprised me the most wasn’t their anger – they didn’t know the full context – but the fact that they didn’t seem upset with my brother at all, even though he was the one who caused all the chaos. My parents and my brother ignored me for most of the day, and we never really talked about the incident again. Eventually, the tension faded, but I’m left wondering…

1f7jmum,AITA for not telling my neighbors my religion/ sexuality?,"Hi there! So for a bit of backstory I have 4 kids, 2 from myself, 2 from my partner (both female) and my two older children made a friend with a kid down the street, he's been coming over for about a week, and he'll spend hours at my house at a time. I don't have a problem with this, he's a very nice kid, and I don't mind taking another kid to the park. (I'm also a stay at home mom) well, yesterday, I finally met his mother. And I knew the kid was Mormon, but I personally don't raise my children in religion even though I identify as a theistic Satanist. Well his mom saw my baphomet necklace (which honestly my best friend gave me when we were kids, and I just still wear it regularly) well she practically blew up on me, telling me I'm sending my own kids and her child to hell, and that I was obviously planning this because I didn't tell her. And then I dropped the fact that I am also in a homosexual relationship, and maybe she should check where her kids are, instead of having random people from the neighborhood watch her children while she's at work... 

Anyways. Am I the asshole? Because personally I don't feel like she's entitled to my information if she doesn't want to have a relationship with me?

Also I feel bad, because he was a good kid, and I'm worried he's not eating when he's not over at my house..and I feel bad that I'm the person that ruined the relationship between our children..",demon13775,2148,0.8799999952316284,621,1725315403,2024-09-02 17:16:43,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1f7jmum/aita_for_not_telling_my_neighbors_my_religion/,9,2024

he suggested I work for him, David is self employed as a house hold cleaner, he makes a well living and I thought it was a nice offer and it would look good on a resume (considering all I’d have on there without it would be babysitting), 

well anyways I asked him what the pay would be and he said he’d pay me 15$ an hour and i happily excepted, I worked 25 hours a week for a month so I made 1,500$ but when I asked him when I’d be payed he asked me what I ment so I clarified and said “when will you be paying me for the 100 hours I worked” he looked at me like I was crazy 

I thought I got the hours wrong so I checked again and it was definitely 100 hours so I showed him the hours I worked and said “yeah one hundred see” and then he said “no I got what you mean but why would I be paying you?” 

And I froze for a moment before before I got mad and asked him why would he not be paying me and he told me that I was just helping him and being a good niece well his wrist heals (he sprained his wrist 3 months prior and it was fully healed)

I said that I wasn’t doing that work for free and if he wasn’t going to pay me like he said he would I would take him to small claims court, after that he got really quite and said he thought I was a better person and that family should help family.

1f8cc4t,AITA for how I told my family that I have cancer?,"I (24F) discovered a couple weeks ago that I have breast cancer. It came as a real shock to me because I had practically no symptoms. I was at the hospital for a different reason and from there referred internally to the mammography suite. (That's not really important to the story but just a little context on how I was diagnosed). But the good news is that doctors were able to catch it early and the outlook is good.

My problem, aside from the obvious, is that I had no idea how to tell my family. I knew they would panic regardless, which is understandable as I lost two great aunts to breast cancer and my dad also has stomach cancer. So I just kind of avoided telling them because there's a lot going on in my family at the minute. I didn't want to put any more on their plate. But then I did my first round of chemo and it floored me. I knew then that I had to tell them because I genuinely couldn't go through that alone again. 

This is where I'm possibly the AH. My family are really bad with emotional stuff. We're not good at expressing ourselves. We can laugh and make jokes and that but when it comes to serious matters we're all quite awkward. And I knew that this was going to be awkward and I didn't really want to face that. My mum, I could deal with, she's a lot better with stuff like this but I really didn't want to tell my dad. He's the suffer in silence type and I knew it would break him to learn about this, especially since he's going through the same thing.

So, to tell them, I bought a cake and a card to give my dad. They said, ""Congratulations! It's twins!"" with the diagnosis/outreach letter from my GP.

Reactions were mixed. My dad, while really upset, did find it funny. My mum is distraught and did not. Siblings are split, some found it funny, some found it insensitive to my parents. Personally, I thought it was funny but they did raise some good points. In the end though, it's mostly forgotten as they're all still in shock and focused on the diagnosis itself. It's been a couple days and I'm starting to think that maybe it was wrong of me to do it like that. I could've have just gotten over my awkwardness and had a mature conversation with my parents about it but it's too late for that now. AITA?

1frra6r,AITAH for giving gluten to my gluten free mother without telling her,"So my mother and I don't have a great relationship. I recently moved to a new place in a really nice area because I just got a really nice new  job. Suddenly my mom really wants to come and visit and see me. I do my best to make up excuses, but she pushes so hard that eventually I cave.
  
  
I've been cooking a lot since I got here because I have a nice big kitchen all to myself. Recently I started making latiao. I love it.
  
  
Well, my mom and dad got here yesterday afternoon/evening and settle in and we start talking about dinner. As usual, mom has to pick after looking at online menus for a couple hours to make sure they fit with her dietary requirements. She ends up picking a vegan restaurant that's accross town, but she's just *so tired* from the drive up she can't fathom getting back in the car. So dad and I agree to go pick it up while she rests.

Driving accross my new city is a long process (which I told her ahead of time), and it's a little over an hour later when we get home with the vegan/gluten free food she wanted (she's not vegan, but she is adamantly gluten free and has been for a few years now). We get inside and as I am opening the food in the kitchen I notice the pyrex snapware container of Latiao that was in my fridge is now empty in my sink. She even dumped out the sauce that I'd been soaking them in.
  
  
I asked her if she'd eaten something out of my fridge while we were gone and she said that yes she had eaten some chicken because she was getting light headed from hunger, but it was terrible and she was so ready for some 'real food'. Now this is where I might have been the asshole; instead of telling her what she had actually eaten, I just rolled my eyes and dished up the food for everyone and we ate. She continued to remark about how bad and oily the ""chicken"" was all night. 
  
  
I finally snapped when she brought it up again first thing this morning when I was picking them up from their hotel. My mom made a joke about not wanting me to cook them breakfast because she didn't want more oily chicken or something to that effect.
  
  
I finally said ""mom, that was homemade latiao, and I don't understand why you ate ALL of it if you hated it so much."" She asked me what latiao is and I explained that it's essentially 100% gluten. I watched as her face dropped, and sure enough within 30 minutes her stomach was ""killing her"" and she was having difficulty breathing and needed to go to the emergency room.
  
  
The whole time we were there she went on and on to the nurses and doctors about how I'd fed her gluten and not told her until it was too late for her to take her medicine and crying because now the whole trip was ruined. Mind you, this is the hospital WHERE I WORK. My dad essentially told me to go home and think about my actions and give my mother some space, and now I'm just sitting here alone in my cool new place feeling like a dick and super anxious about what work is going to be like next week.
  
  
So, AITA?

1fffwe4,AITA for not sticking up for my boyfriend when his friends made fun of his weight?,"My 24F boyfriend “Steve” 28M has always been on the chubbier side. He still is somewhat active and is not fat by any means but definitely not thin. I used to be thin when Steve and I got together 18 months ago, but have since gained about 20 lbs. I’m still a healthy weight for my height, but not thin anymore.

A couple nights ago, Steve and I were out for dinner. He told me I should watch what I eat because I’m gaining weight. I rolled my eyes and ordered a burger and fries (same thing as Steve) because I thought it was just a poorly thought out joke. But on the car ride home he told me he was concerned because I was gaining weight and becoming unhealthy and less attractive. He put it gently, but I was still upset and pointed out that he wasn’t the poster child of thinness himself, but he said it’s different because he’s the same size he was when we got together.

I told him to give it a rest and slept in the guest room that night. When I woke up the next morning, he apologized profusely and begged me to forgive him. Since he’d never messed up that bad throughout our year and a half of dating, I told him we could just move past it.

I thought we had forgotten about it until last night when we were out with Steve and his friends. They were joking as male friends normally do, which means they were throwing around insults. One of Steve’s friends made a silly comment about Steve’s weight and suddenly they were all piling on. “Yeah Steve, you ARE fat, hahaha.” Steve laughed along, but it was obvious to me that he was hurt by the comments. I thought about telling the friends to cut it out, but then remembered what Steve said to me just a few nights prior and decided he could handle a bit of playful teasing.

When we got home, Steve asked me why I didn’t stick up for him when I knew he was uncomfortable. I told him I thought he could handle it, given what he so comfortably said to me the other night. Steve said it was different because he didn’t make fun of my weight in front of my friends and he was coming from a place of concern. He said he thought we had agreed to move past the comment he made and that what I did was petty and holding a grudge. I told him we weren’t going to get anywhere with this conversation and we should take time to cool off and think.

Steve booked a hotel last night and should be getting home any minute now. I’m still not sure if what I did was wrong. I talked to my sister and she said I should have joined in with Steve’s friends and I wasn’t mean enough, but my sister’s also a lot bolder than me.

1fnvo9o,AITA for calling out my stepsister for acting like a brat in public?,"(Obligatory throwaway I've been using because I don't want it to be tied back to my personal life.)

Here's some backstory: 

My dad(52M) met my now stepmom, Janet(47F) when I(17F) was 10. She also brought in my two younger stepsiblings, Mike(13M), and Lindsey(17F). If I'm being honest, I actually really like Janet and Mike. The only person who I never took a liking to was Lindsey, mainly because she's a brat and it's gotten to the point where I don't like being seen with her at all, especially in public. She will start throwing actual childlike tantrums and will start pouting and being extremely rude to my parents if:

- We don't go to a restaurant she wants to go to when the rest of us agree on another place. 

- We want to see a movie that she apparently hates, even if it literally JUST came out.

- We use the bathroom (there's two, she just prefers the SLIGHTLY bigger one) when she needs it, even though we ask her if she needs to go beforehand. 

My parents say to just let her ride it out and ignore it, but it's so EMBARRASSING to be seen with this 17-year-old girl who is crying and yelling just because we can't afford to go to Starbucks, or whatever it is she wants in that current moment. 

The situation: 

We went to Applebee's the other day because my parents took us to a local fair and they didn't want to spend a bunch of money on fair food (and anyone who has ever been to a fair knows how ridiculously expensive it is). We were already teetering on the edge to a meltdown with her, because of course she didn't want to go to Applebee's, but Janet calmed her down and told her she could get whatever she wanted, within reason. 

So, we sit down, everything is going well and then the waitress comes over and obviously, asks what we wanted. I asked for a cheeseburger with fries, because it was on the cheaper side, but Lindsey wanted this BIG steak and a bunch of sides. Janet tells her to get one side and a smaller steak, and I guess that sent her over the edge. 

She started being so incredibly rude to Janet, saying how her dad would let her have it, that she was told she could have whatever she wanted by Janet, even though Janet said to keep it cheaper. Lindsey just kept talking about how she WANTS a bigger steak, she WANTS more sides, all the while this poor waitress is standing there looking nervous. So, I cut her off and said, ""You're lucky you're getting anything at this point, because you're acting like a giant ungrateful brat and it's so fucking embarrassing.""

She just stopped and went quiet, and the first five minutes after were a little awkward, but the rest of the dinner was fine. When we got home, Lindsey just went straight to her room and slammed the door (as usual when she doesn't get her way) but my dad stopped me before I went to my room and told me that while he sees where I was coming from, it was a bit of an asshole move to embarrass her like that in front of the other customers and the waitress. 

So reddit, was I really the asshole?",throwaway22383849,1770,0.9599999785423279,275,1727126195,2024-09-23 16:16:35,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fnvo9o/aita_for_calling_out_my_stepsister_for_acting/,9,2024
1fkxh65,AITA for turning down an offer I made two years ago? ,"I do jewelry and metal smithing as a hobby. 

Two years ago, a “friend” lost her grandmother. The grandma had left a pretty big estate behind. Her will hadn’t been updated, so “Amber” inherited a pair of cufflinks instead of earrings like the rest of the women. 

At the time, I offered to recast the cuff links into earrings. They wouldn’t be as nice as the rest of her grandma’s jewelry but it was better than nothing. 

Amber said she would have to think about it.

Fast forward to now. I cut contact with Amber a while back. I don’t appreciate some comments she said about my ethnic background, let’s just leave it at that. I unfollowed her on social media and blocked her number.

Amber reached out via an Instagram page I made for my jewelry casting. She wanted me to reforge her cuff links.

I wrote this DM declining her request. I wasn’t comfortable working with her anymore given what she said about my ethnic background.  Instead, I referred her to someone I know who can help. 

She got upset and reminded me of the offer. I know I offered it, but that was before our fallout. 

I still said no. Some of our mutual friends think I’m an asshole who should have just made the earrings. After all, an offer is an offer and I should be a better person.

I think I did what was right by me.

1fqa3lh,AITA for taking my girlfriend home from the hospital?,"I (19M), have been house-sitting for the week and one of my rules was not to have my girlfriend (21F) over to the house. She currently lives in a shelter. Last night, she was feeling very ill and ended up blacking out on the floor of the shelter. She was rushed to the emergency room via ambulance, and I'm the only contact for her since she has no family or friends. I showed up last night around 11pm, and she was discharged from the hospital around 5am after concluding she didn't need an overnight stay at the hospital. Her shelter doesn't allow anyone to enter under any circumstances after 7pm nor allow anyone to enter before 8am, so I opted to take her to the house where I could make sure she was getting proper care and treatment after a long night of sitting in a busy emergency room.

1fdvmtw,AITA for Not Letting My Son See His grandparents After They Said He Should Be Ashamed of His Black Features? ,"I (M28) Am half Black and half Mexican, and I have a 5-year-old son with my ex-girlfriend, who’s Korean. Our relationship ended a while ago, but we’ve always tried to co-parent and keep things civil for the sake of our son. Lately, though, something has been bothering me. My son has started acting more self-conscious, especially about his appearance. He’s got my curly hair and darker skin, and it seemed like he was starting to feel uncomfortable with the way he looks.

A few weeks ago, I figured out why. During a visit to his mother’s parents—his Korean grandparents—I overheard them telling him he should be ashamed of his Black features. They told him he’d be ""more handsome"" if he looked more Korean and suggested that when he’s older, he should straighten his hair and stay out of the sun so his skin doesn’t get darker.

I was furious. My son is only 5, and for him to hear that from his own family is unacceptable. I confronted his grandparents immediately, and they tried to excuse it, saying they were ""helping"" him because life would be easier if he looked ""less Black."" I told them that’s racist and harmful, especially for a young kid who’s still figuring out who he is.

When I got home, I called my ex and told her what happened. I said that her parents were no longer allowed to see our son until they changed their attitude. She wasn’t happy about it. She agrees that what they said was wrong, but she doesn’t think cutting them off is the solution. She says our son should still know his Korean family and culture, and that her parents might change if given a chance.

Now, my son keeps asking why he can’t see his grandparents, and my ex is mad at me. She says I’m being too extreme and that I’m making things harder for our son by keeping him away from part of his family. But I don’t want him around people who will make him feel ashamed of his Black heritage, even if they are family.

Am I the asshole for not letting my son see his grandparents after what they said?

1f9yvjp,AITA for refusing to interview my cousin for a position at my company?,"I (27M) finished my Bachelor's 6 years ago. Right after graduating I worked as a software engineer at Facebook for a year, got a job at a hedge fund and worked there for three years, got burned out, took a few months off, and founded a company around 1.5 years ago.

My little cousin Meera (22F), bless her bleeding heart, has always been my biggest supporter. When I was at Facebook she'd frequently remind me that my employer is a cancer and I'm working to make the world worse. When I was at the hedge fund she'd always remind me that I'm paid a boatload to contribute nothing to society. When I started my own company, she said that she hoped my hedge fund would take me back when the AI hype wave died off and my company went under. 

Anyways, we're currently interviewing for a lead designer. I guess the new grad job market must be tough because earlier this week we found Meera's profile in our applicant portal. My uncle messaged me later letting me know that she had applied and it would be great if we could interview her. I replied that I'm flattered by her application but unfortunately we're hiring for a lead with more experience. He said we could still hire her to work under the design lead. I said we're not looking to hire junior designers at the moment but we'll keep her in mind as we grow.

My uncle then sent a link to an article about my company's funding and said I certainly have budget to hire her. I got fed up and basically told him I won't hire someone who takes every chance to shit on my career and who I can't trust to be respectful in the workplace. And also it's unprofessional that her father is messaging me on her behalf when she could be asking me herself.

He didn't message me after that but Meera sent me a snarky text saying she didn't realize I was so sensitive and she's sorry she offended me. The thing is, I don't think she's entirely wrong about Facebook/hedge funds, but still she hasn't said a single nice thing about my career or even my company and I don't think I can trust her.

1fqalv2,WIBTA if I returned a handmade gift to the person who made it?,"I (32F)’m an indigenous artist in a tiny cabin with limited storage. I’ve spent years purging stuff and told my friends/family I won’t accept gifts other than food or plants bc of lack of space, and they understand.

6 months ago, I met a guy (42M) who hired me to teach him leather craft and local medicinal plants. I was excited to connect, but things felt off. One day, he said he was “wildly attracted” to me and questioned if our 10-yr age difference would affect our connection. I’m on the spectrum and struggle with social cues, especially romance. I was blindsided and told him I wasn’t interested in dating.

He later said he’s never felt this way about anyone before. I reiterated I had no romantic interest, but he kept pushing the idea of a connection. I denied his advances and avoided 1-on-1 activities that could be seen as romantic.

During one visit, he noticed a knife displayed on the wall. It’s a special piece made of damascus steel with a white-tail deer bone handle; a collaboration piece w/ another indigenous artist. The bone’s sentimental to me; I’ve rehabbed/raised (permitted) many white-tails here and cherish this connection. I told him I don’t collect knives, gave away others that weren’t family heirlooms, and kept this one bc of its significance.

Later, he asked what I wanted for my bday. I pleaded with him not to get me anything and reminded him of my food or plants rule. I specifically said, “I don’t want a knife.”

On my bday, he texted that he had something for me and would drop it off at the gate. I didn’t hear from him, and over a week later, I saw a knife in a leather sheath by the gate. It was clearly from him; I checked the cameras and confirmed he’d left it there.

He hasn’t mentioned it. I feel bad it sat out in the rain, but I’m also frustrated my boundaries were dismissed. The knife serves as a constant reminder of this disregard, and I have no safe place to store it.

1fr0uus,AITA for not babysitting my sister’s kids pretty much every day?,"
So, I (21M) am childfree and have been very clear about that my whole life. My sister (33F) has three kids (8M, 5F, and 2M), and while I love them, I don’t want to be responsible for taking care of them.

Recently, my sister has been asking me more and more to babysit so she and her husband can ""have some time to themselves."" At first, I said yes occasionally because I felt bad for her. But then she started asking all the time, like every weekend. I finally told her I’m not comfortable with how often she’s asking and I can’t keep saying yes.

Well, she blew up at me, saying things like “family helps family,” and that I’m selfish for not wanting to help out when she really needs it. I suggested she hire a sitter, but she said she can’t afford one and that since I don’t have kids, I should be more available to help her out.

Now my parents are involved, and they're saying I should just help her because I’m not doing anything important with my time (I work full time but apparently, it’s “different” (because I don’t have kids). I’m feeling a lot of pressure to cave in, but I really value my free time and feel like I shouldn't be guilted into taking care of kids I didn’t choose to have.

A few days ago I saw his computer unlocked and he was on reddit and in the process of posting to a sub a fake story that came across as very sexist. I memorized the username and it was a throwaway with no posts until later posted it.

Later when he wasn't there and left his laptop unlocked I basically went and checked his browser history and it was full of links to the create post link on reddit and posts made by throwaway accounts which I assumed were his. A lot of them were on this sub but also others and basically they were either outrageous opinions or stories with sexism and racism. Stuff about women drivers, women in tech, immigrants etc. I exported the history to a flash drive.

I confronted him and he initially denied it and then realized he was caught and got mad at me for snooping.

I have not hade a relationship with my father in 2 decades and have only seen or talked to him a handful of times in those 2 decades. The man is just an asshole and always has been. My brother doesn't talk to him or like him either.

My brother text me that he heard from my sister that my dad has got bad dementia and all my sisters have been taking care of him because he is in a lot of debt and can't work because of his condition. I asked in the family group text what the deal was and my sister explained what's going on with him. She didn't want to post in the group chat about his condition because she knows my brother hates him and didn't want to read anything bad said about him in the chat because she was upset about dealing with his failing health.

1fd0y3b,AITA for telling my boyfriend his family are leeches after meeting them for the first time?,"We’ve been dating for about 4 months and last night was the first time I met his family. They were nice at first but I couldn’t stand the sight of them at the end of the night.

Dinner conversation was normal as they asked about me and my family. Then the table divided into smaller conversation groups and I overheard his older brothers talking to his sister about investing. I’m not an expert so I’ll give you the gist of what I heard.

She’s been out of school for a couple of years and have saved up about $75,000 and wants to start investing. They said property is the best and that section 8 is the way to go. They said that the rent is always paid on time and the people won’t mess up the property because they’re afraid of getting kicked out of the program. They said the best part is that they’ll still own the properties and the value will always go up. They said they’re developing a small neighborhood with about 10 houses specifically for section 8. All of those houses under 2000 sqft and have 4 bedrooms as section 8 pays higher rates for more bedrooms and smaller houses are cheaper to maintain. They said that it’ll cost them about $100/sqft to build these houses and the rent will be about $4000 per month. They said that she could buy in on her first rental house next year when they start another development. They’re in the process of closing on a piece of land that will accommodate about 20 houses.

I cringed then couldn’t keep quiet anymore. I told them that instead of renting out and keeping those houses off the market, they should sell them to those people. They looked at me quietly and I knew they never considered helping people out by selling the houses they were building. His dad told me I was out of line and I answered that his family was out of line for preying on people in need while feeding off of the taxes people pay. I said that most people can’t afford to buy a single house yet his sons are building 10-20 at a time which makes them leeches. 

We argued for a bit then we left. This morning my boyfriend told me I need to apologize to his family but I refused to. We just met after my last class and told me we’re no longer invited to any of his family function including the Christmas trip back to their old country. Since we're still in school, his family was going to pay for us so he really wants me to apologize and smooth things over.

I know I’m right but maybe I shouldn’t have been so harsh on the first meeting.

1fph3xl,AITA for playing a role that my girlfriend doesn’t approve? ,"I (30m) have been with my girifriend (29) for almost four years. From since before we started dating I've been a part of an acting group mainly performing small venue comedy theatre once a year.
We have practice every Tuesday and after every practice I call my girlfriend to tell her about what we practiced. 
Why do I do that? Well, that's because she says she doesn’t trust them and that she’s afraid to lose me. 
I’ve agreed to steer away from taking parts that had a kissing scene or anything physical. I even told our director that I won't take any parts that include kissing, even if it's just a peck.

For our upcoming show I'm playing an older gentleman who’s married, father of the bride (the play takes part at a
wedding). He’s a whimsical dude with an eye for someone other than his wife. I let my girifriend read the script, because I don't want her to be upset or sad when she comes to watch. In a scene my character meets a girl that he used to be in love with in his teens. He declares his love and tries to win her over, but she completely brushes him off. He says the words ""I love you""
as she storms away. 
That scene made my girlfriend fall apart crying, saying that she can't stand ""watching her own
boyfriend saying he loves another woman"". Even if it's in a non-romantic, comedic setting.

I get it when it comes to kissing, and I have no problem turning down parts that has kissing scenes in them.. But saying ""I love you"" to a woman 25-30 years older than me in a comedy play act can't be that bad can it?

I told her I don’t know what to do other than quitting, but I really don’t want to do that. 

Am I the asshole for not quitting so she can be happy?",Radiant-Race8475,943,0.9399999976158142,574,1727303128,2024-09-25 17:25:28,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fph3xl/aita_for_playing_a_role_that_my_girlfriend_doesnt/,9,2024
1fsf79a,AITA for telling my Friend that her new military bf is probably full of shit?,"So my best friend(26)is seeing this new guy(21)who says he was in the army, he constantly goes on about it and has so many stories of everything he did. Now I called him out on maybe being to young for him to have really served but I also don't really know anything about it. But it just seems to unreal to me. He supposedly only was in combat training but didn't finish due to injuries. This is where his stories seem so un real, with him saving multiple fellow recruits from hurting themselves, to having canons shot off near his head which caused him a hearing injury, to a bomb exploding near him to the point it messed up his back, and stories of how they had to climb mountains carrying hundreds of pounds and sleep almost naked in -5 climate. Like I said I don't know much of what goes on in the army training but that seem so wild. I told my friend that it all just sounds like bull to me and she got extremely mad calling me a horrible person for looking down on a military man and how I was an AH. So I'm I just dumb and an AH?

For a bit more info we are in America and he just turned 21, he has seis he didn't finish combat training and was in the med cor. She's known him for a year and a half now, and he starts telling his missions every time someone in our friend group shares an experience they had. For example one of our friends went hiking with his dad in Washington's mt. Rainer and they stayed at a look out tower, they mentioned how it was very cold and it was a fun experience, then my best friends boyfriend chimed in with the story of climbing a mountain in below freezing temperatures and how they had to sleep almost with no clothes. And I suffer from depression and it came up in a conversation and he started talking about how he saved a fellow soldier who tried to hurt himself in training and how he still remembers all the blood. Also I've cought him in certain small lies trying to impress my friend, like being into the same sport teams yet not knowing the team colors, or how we love riding horses and he said he's rides all the time but couldn't get on the horse at my ranch. Or how he loves the same bands but can't name a song with out looking it up. I have asked him if he has proof and all he's ever said is I can pull out my training uniform, which is just a camo suit but I feel like normal civilians could get their hands on that.",Hot_Confection_4588,916,0.9399999976158142,482,1727645114,2024-09-29 16:25:14,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fsf79a/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_her_new_military/,9,2024
1fshglt,AITA for giving up my seat on the bus for an old lady and not for a kid?,"I 15nb currently use public transport to get around the majority of the time because my parents are too busy working, gambling, taxiing my siblings around to their stuff, and life in general to really care. 

Anyways so today (about an hour ago) I was on my way home from work. The bus was full when a kid and mom got on the bus. They came and the mom was talking with her kid trying to get my attention as she kept saying that polite people would give up their seat to let a kid sit down especially if they were just teens. After a few stops this old woman gets on, using a cane having trouble walking. I stood up and gave her my seat. 

The mom tried to get her kid in the seat id just left but I stopped them and said it wasn’t for the kid, it was for the lady. The woman then said that her kid needed a seat and that I was a b for not giving her one. 

I vented to my brother about this  when I got home and he said it was a bad move for me not to give my seat to the kid (who looked to be about 6) in the first place but was better of me to let the old lady have the seat. 

So AITA for not giving up my seat for the kid? ",BlueJaguar6,876,0.8500000238418579,472,1727651503,2024-09-29 18:11:43,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fshglt/aita_for_giving_up_my_seat_on_the_bus_for_an_old/,9,2024
