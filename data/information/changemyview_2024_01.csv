1aeuoo0,"CMV: A major reason the Trades are dying is not because younger people are lazy, but because the work culture is awful and no one is willing to train apprentices.","When between jobs previously, I had occasionally considered working in the trades. I enjoy working with my hands, and I think some trades such as electrical work sound very interesting on top of that. However, one thing always stopped me. When I was younger, I used to work security on a few construction sites and noticed something that put me off the trades permanently.

The work culture was just beyond awful. Plenty of verbal abuse (screaming curses, insults, and slurs) from bosses towards the apprentices, plenty of racist, sexist, and homophobic talk, and plenty of generally nasty behavior across the board. It didn't matter which site I was at, or which company was working there, there was a similar trend.  This was only half the issue though - the other half I noticed is that for all these construction companies and tradespeople complain about their dying industry, none of them are even willing to train anyone as an apprentice unless they're a family friend or paying for it through school which presents the same issue of accessibility as university. Half the people at those sites were perfectly competent men who were working for total peanuts as temp laborers in the desperate hope that they'd get chosen as an apprentice.

And, you know, who honestly wants to do any of that?

You can call me weak or a snowflake, and that's fine, but the fact of the matter is that younger generations overwhelmingly don't want to deal with that kind of work culture. I am sure many people would be willing to do a trade, if it was actually accessible work without grinding away your body at dangerous temp labor work in the vague hope of getting chosen and if the industry wasn't rife with casual bigotry of all kinds. If the trades are so desperate for new blood, they should work to be a more welcoming and less abusive environment.  I am aware that making mistakes in trades work is much less acceptable than some other industries, but employers don't need to be abusive in order to get this point across and should be focused on teaching and fostering new talent to continue the most important work in human society instead of pushing away anyone they deem emotionally weak because of dudebro locker room culture.",funwithdespair,2068,0.949999988079071,680,1706637491,2024-01-30 11:58:11,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aeuoo0/cmv_a_major_reason_the_trades_are_dying_is_not/,1,2024
1ach425,CMV: The idea that Wikipedia isn’t a reputable source is a myth bred from the school system.,"We all have heard from teachers that we can’t use Wikipedia because it “isn’t a reputable source.”

In reality, teachers only say that because of how easy Wikipedia makes assignments. And any smart person *still* used Wikipedia for assignments.

You simply scrolled to the bottom and clicked on the sources that were linked, then cited those in your work, even if you just got the info from Wikipedia.

As a website developer myself, who even once put up a fake news website to humor my friends, anyone can make a website. So nothing is really reputable if it’s not peer reviewed.

Teachers accepted non-peer reviewed articles, and articles listed as sources on Wikipedia, but not a Wikipedia link itself. Simply because they knew it was too easy.

Now years later, we have people who still believe Wikipedia isn’t a reputable source and will disregard any information coming from it if used in an argument.",Aspiring-Programmer,1341,0.800000011920929,705,1706379374,2024-01-27 12:16:14,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ach425/cmv_the_idea_that_wikipedia_isnt_a_reputable/,1,2024

And there is a flavour for any type of young person, e.g:

* A young person interested in STEM for example can be sent to a rabbit hole consisting of: Jordan Peterson, Lex Fridman, Triggernometry, Eric weinstein, and then finally sent to rumble to finish of yourself with the dark horse podcast
*  A young person interested in bettering themselves goes to a rabbit hole of : Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Triggernometry, Chris Williamson, Piers Morgan, and end up with Russel brand on rumble

But these parents were the parents who would force their kids to go to church on Sunday, force their kids to read the Bible, force them to pray, force them to go to religious summer camps, shelter them from outside influence, etc. - in many cases, also heavily censoring what their kids were allowed to read or watch. If anything, the upbringing that they raised their kids was even more focused on instilling a certain message or agenda of the parents' preference in the kids' minds than anything the schools did. Somehow all of their raising of their children this way didn't count as ""indoctrination,"" but the schools or media promoting a pro-LGBT message was ""indoctrination.""

196nl2d,CMV: doctors should not circumcise baby boys unless there’s a clear medical reason for doing so,"Not sure how genital mutilation of baby boys is even allowed in a developed country like the united states.

Why would doctors conduct this completely unnecessary procedure? It doesnt matter if the parents are religious. No doctor should say yes to mutilating a body unless the baby clearly needs it done medically

I believe doctors should not do elective surgeries on children when the child literally has no say in the matter. I can imagine some elective surgeries should be allowed on children if the child has a strong desire to do so. However babies can not consent.

Not only that, it’s almost certain that no child would strongly desire genital mutilation. And even if they strongly desired it, the doctor should still think twice about executing on such a surgery.

19brluv,CMV: Sex offenders with more then 10 victims should be chemically castrated and sterilized for the betterment of society,"As harsh as it sounds I really do think it’s necessary. Nobody stumbles into the life of being a serial rapist. It’s not like some sexual assault cases where there’s some, if not nuance, then grey area. To be clear, the assault happening is unjustifiable and wrong no matter what, but the college frat boy who rapes a girl while she’s passed out at a party is different from a predator following a woman to her job, her gym, her house, waiting for a moment to kidnap her and get his rocks off. More time, planning, obsession and in some cases violence go into the latter type of offender.

The frat boy, in most cases I’ve seen, is opportunistic. They want sex. They’d prefer it consensually but if the girl is drunk and too fucked up to say “no” they’re fine with that too. Serial rapists however, they get off on the lack of consent. They get off on the resistance. They want the person to scream, fight and try and run. Domination is inextricably bound up with their sexual desire. 

Did anybody watch The Last of Us on HBO? Well, there’s a character just like that in the show. Someone that gets off on resistance. Someone like that can’t be reformed, retrained or redeemed. They’re wild dogs. And even if you could “tame” them, it’s still too risky in my opinion. A drunk who relapses will likely hurt themselves, either via alcohol poisoning or just your run-of-the-mill self-destruction of their lives. A junkie will likely be the same. Though the risk they betray a friend or family member and rob them for a quick fix is also a factor. They too are more likely to just OD and die.

A serial sex offender though? If they relapse someone is getting raped.

That risk is too much for me. Humans are animals, no? If an untrained/abused/mentally ill dog bites two or three kids, not matter how much their owners might love them, they’re getting put down for the benefit of society according to the state. Even if you could put them on meds or put them in a different environment there’s always the risk that down the line something could set them off and then it might not be a bitten kid you’re dealing with but a dead one. I feel like this is a happy medium for the criminal justice reformers and the tough-on-crime crowd. Because when the offender is “fixed”, we release them from prison free of the “urges” that would make them want to attack someone again, we save billions of dollars that would be otherwise spent on feeding and housing them, and the “law and order” crowd can sleep soundly knowing these guys are castrated and, though they’re free, will remain on a list for the rest of their lives.

1afie1j,"CMV: The Palestinians' fear of getting ethnically cleansed is very real and valid, and it needs to be taken seriously.","It was reported yesterday that 11 cabinet ministers and 15 coalition members of the Knesset attended a conference calling for a ""voluntary migration"" plan of Gazans. Let's call a spade a spade, this is textbook ethnic cleansing. It's no different from when the US ""asked"" Native Americans to move to reservations, or when Soviets conducted population transfers in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. There's no ""voluntary"" here when their homes have been destroyed by the IDF.

The people attended this conference were not some fringe figures as well, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich were both there, they are the Minster of National Security and Minister of Finance respectively. They are also in the war cabinet. Despite the fact that the government has denied these plans, it remains true that these people have real power and real influence in the government. 

When it comes to public perception, the plan is not deeply unpopular or fringe as well. 33% of Israelis support the resettlement and annexation of Gaza and 56% oppose it. Governments all around the world have implemented policies much less popular than 33%, just ask Netanyahu's protestors last year. A proposed policy that only a slim majority of Israelis oppose has a very good chance of becoming actual policy if the political climate changes, even slightly.

If you're a Palestinian, I think it's valid to have fears of being ethnically cleansed from your homes when the climate in Israeli politics is so in favour of such a policy. We need to recognise that and take concrete steps to reaffirm that that's not going to happen, by drawing red lines, or punishing problematic officials, etc.",WheatBerryPie,1063,0.6499999761581421,1608,1706709332,2024-01-31 07:55:32,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1afie1j/cmv_the_palestinians_fear_of_getting_ethnically/,1,2024
192eqb6,"CMV: It is now in men's best interests to stop using dating apps, disconnect from them entirely, and force society to find a new way for people to meet and date.","39M here, FWIW. The culture of dating apps has established itself in such a way that men have arisen as the unequivocal losers in this game, basically like playing a football game where you start being down by multiple scores and it's already the final quarter of the game. 

We all know the statistics: men get about [1 or 2 matches a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/11btxok/men_how_many_matches_do_you_get_a_day/?rdt=52564), across all dating apps. That's going to be roughly equal to the number of LIKES they get since most men are liking the vast majority of profiles they see, a strategy they are probably justified in using since there's no point in being selective with so little working in one's favor. Women, on the other hand, get [hundreds of likes a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/163amr9/how_many_matches_for_women/?rdt=42121), all of which can translate into a match if they so choose. If I conservatively pick the number as 200 matches a month, that means women are having ONE HUNDRED TIMES THE SUCCESS THAT MEN ARE HAVING. One. Hundred.

That's clearly a losing game for men. So why should we continue to participate? Clearly it is in the best interests of men to collectively agree to stop using dating apps, to delete each and every one of them from our phones and, I dunno, at the very least force us to meet people the old-fashioned way, by meeting people at bars, getting set up with a friend of a friend, asking out your cute coworker, etc. These options are all on the table right now, obviously, but a lot of women aren't even leaving themselves open to the opportunity because they know they've got their ace-in-the-hole on a dating app somewhere. So why risk things with your coworker or do the socially awkward thing of approaching that dude at the bar when you can just rely on these dating apps to do the guesswork for you on whether the dude is even available and if he's interested in you?

It's a losing game for men and we men should collectively agree to stop using dating apps completely. Keep in mind that my viewpoint is not so concerned with how FEASIBLE it is to suddenly get all men to stop using dating apps; it's more about what I think would happen if we could snap our fingers and make it happen. But also, I don't consider it to be completely NON-feasible, since generally it is easier to not do something than it is to do something, right? If I can do my part to do my fellow men a favor, of course I will do that, and I think this move right here is in our best interests.

19dyanb,"CMV: The ""Free Market"" doesn't work with goods and services that are necessary to sustain life. An choice of purchase or die is not a free and voluntary exchange entered into by equals, its an ultimatum.","I think the free market, such as it is anyway, works pretty well for about 90% of the normal consumer good related market activity most of us engage in.

The ""free market"" breaks down, it's internal check and balance mechanisms, become self destructive, when the good or service is one that cannot be refused on pain of death or substantial material deprivation. 

This is why healthcare, housing, and food are so often the ones that require the greatest government intervention to stabilize and are most prove to radical exploitation is left to their own devices. Everyone needs to live somewhere, and everyone is eventually gonna need a doctor, everyone has to eat, and one cannot freely opt to refuse these services, well you can, but in the same way you can freely choose to not give a mugger your wallet and get shot. It's not a ""free"" choice, it's a coercion and an ultimatum. It is widely accepted that a choice made at spearpoint isn't a free choice. Whether that spear it literal or in the form of not being able to afford insulin.

Without the consumer being a free agent, able to enter into an exchange with the purveyor as equals, able to arrive at a mutual beneficial transaction, the inherent self-correcting mechanisms of the ""free"" market break down, because at that point the market, at least the market for that good or service, is not free. It is obligatory. 

When a good cannot be refused, on pain of death or severe material deprivation, the purveyor is free to jack up the price as high as they wish, they are free to price a large swathe of people out of the market entirely, accepting their demise as chaff if it means the profit they pull in off of the substantially higher price on fewer transactions still proves more fruitful than lower profit on more transactions.   


There are only two ways to address this. At a certain point, people, as in the bulk of the people, the mass of the people, will not merely accept dying cause their job doesn't pay enough. That state of affairs will eventually lead to civil unrest of uprising. Which of course will see a breakdown of the market. To avoid this happening, an institution, usually the government, must put their hand into the transaction in some way to ensure the populace has access to the service, either by subsidizing the purchasers or placing price controls on the purveyors. 

&#x200B;

But long story short, in the case of an obligatory good or service, the market can never be free. The choice is coercive to the buyer by default, and can only be corrected by institutional intervention, or dismantling the market entirely (usually violent revolt). But all three scenarios are not free markets.",Jimithyashford,1014,0.8500000238418579,592,1706042224,2024-01-23 14:37:04,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19dyanb/cmv_the_free_market_doesnt_work_with_goods_and/,1,2024

1991b9g,CMV: The trouble young men are having with dating right now is exaggerated and mostly caused by stunted social development rather than anything young women are doing.,"It has become common in certain online circles to complain about how many young men are single. It does seem to be true that singleness among young men is particularly high right now, but the reasons for this are not what many dejected young men say they are.

Those in the so-called ""manosphere"" or the various ""pilled"" communities generally blame women for their singleness. They accuse women of ""hypergamy"", IE dating men of higher social status than themselves. They accuse women of having unrealistic standards and say most women will only date a man who is over 6 feet tall with an income above 100,000 dollars. Some end up just hating women in general. 

I do not think these people are correct. What I see is a generation of young men who, relative to previous generations, rarely go out of the house and rarely socialize with women in real life. So many young Gen Z men are socially and even physically under-developed because their primary sources of recreation and socialization have been virtual for their whole lives. When you talk to these young men in real life it is clear that they have not developed the social skills and hobbies necessary to interact normally and healthily with women they're attracted to. Moreover, the way these young men talk about women online makes it absolutely clear that they do not regularly interact with a variety of women in real life and do not have a realistic understanding of women.

To put it simply, most women are not interested in dating socially awkward and physically under-developed men who spend all day on the Internet. I think we can all understand that and accept it as normal.

How big is this problem really? Online, it's huge. In real life, I don't think it's all that serious. The great majority of these dejected young men eventually grow up, acquire real life jobs and hobbies, and learn to interact with women like human beings.

190eajj,"CMV: Anti-Zionism is not inherently antisemitic, though both Zionists and Anti-Zionists can be antisemitic","From the Jewish Virtual Library, Zionism is defined as the national movement for the return of the Jewish people to their homeland and the resumption of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel. It is NOT just the self-determination of the Jewish people. To disagree with Zionism is not to deny Jewish people of their right to self-determination, but to resist the maintenance of **Jewish sovereignty** in **Israel** and maybe Palestine depending on which form of Zionism one is talking about.

It's not anti-Kurdish to say that Kurds shouldn't have their own state, or anti-Scot to say Scots shouldn't be independent in Scotland, or anti-Roma to say that Roma shouldn't be granted a state. Therefore it is not antisemitic to say that the Jewish people shouldn't have their own state. If, however, Zionism is PURELY the self-determination of the Jewish people, then anti-Zionism can be associated with antisemitism, but that's not what Zionism is.

Furthermore, saying that Jewish people shouldn't have their own state is not the same as saying Israelis shouldn't have their own state, just as saying Whites shouldn't have their own state in England is not the same as saying the English shouldn't have their own state in England. There is a leap of logic that Israeli == Jews for that equivalence to hold true. One can hold anti-Zionist position while believing that Israelis living in modern-day Israel deserve a state, which is also my position.

On top of that, it's not antisemitic to say that a people shouldn't have inherent sovereignty in a country. If someone says ""There should be White or Black sovereignty in America"", you are not a racist to criticise that person.

Lastly, no group is entitled to return to their homeland. Americans of German descent are not entitled to anything in Germany, the Romani people are not entitled to anything in northwest India. Chinese diaspora in Singapore are not entitled to anything in China. Singaporean Chinese can't just move to ShenZhen and start claiming the city belongs to them. I am not anti-German, anti-Roma, anti-Chinese for pointing all of these out, so why am I antisemitic for pointing this in Zionism out?

With that being said, there are anti-Zionists and Zionists that are antisemitic. On one hand, it's not uncommon to hear things like ""Zionists control the media/the bank"", ""Zionists are too rich"", etc. in the anti-Zionist camp, these are antisemitic statements and should be condemned.

1952r0z,CMV: Zombies Would Be Much Easier To Survive Than People Think,"We’re going based off the stereotypical zombie here. They’re slow, want brains and don’t have much of a consciousness. If you get bit, you turn into one.
That being said, I feel as though it may be earlier to survive one than people make it out to be. When pictured, people usually think of a post apocalyptic world but I think we could go about life pretty normally.
For starters, if this disease eats away at the host like it portrays in some media’s, it’s going to eventually get rid of their ability to see, hear, touch and even bite meaning they’re not really all that dangerous. Even if it doesn’t, and it only starts to infect the dead the only real threat are really only people who have recently passed away as their body has not been corroded yet, and likely still have full functionality. But I feel like this doesn’t make things all that harder because everyone would steer clear of the zombie once it first becomes infected, hence creating less infected and making it easier to contain. Again, the zombie is slow so you have plenty of time to react.

19a0ir3,"CMV: My teen spends much more time Online than IRL, and I believe it's an unhealthy balance that will impact his future relationships.","As a parent, I'm concerned about my 13yo son's social engagements, which is mostly online, through gaming. He has friends from school, but rarely sees them after school or on the weekends outside of school. I worry about the long-term effects on his social and emotional development as a person spending so much time online.

I'm in my late 40s, and grew up in a time before smartphones and online communities. In my experience in-person interactions benefited me greatly: getting a deeper understanding of friends through nonverbal cues, a sense of true connection with friends when you're just hanging out, and the opportunity for more meaningful conversations when there are fewer distractions around.

These things seem to be missing in my son's online interactions, which are often limited to in-game discussions about strategy, or even which game to play next, and then lack any in-depth (or even mundane talk) that happens naturally when you spend time together face-to-face. Also, he ends up meeting a variety of online-only friends and those relationships are more fleeting and never get that deep and real. I think spending more time with fewer, but real in person friends would be better for his social development. He'd have more opportunities to learn social skills - listening, empathy, resolving conflicts, social cues, etc.

I advocate for a much more balanced approach, ideally splitting his social time equally between online and offline. We already don't allow him to play games during the weekdays when school is on. And I'd do more to encourage and allow him and his friends to get together in person more.",blueandyshores,437,0.8799999952316284,231,1705611196,2024-01-18 14:53:16,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19a0ir3/cmv_my_teen_spends_much_more_time_online_than_irl/,1,2024

1adsjhe,CMV: Black-and-white Us-vs-Them thinking prevents us from resolving most social issues yet is impossible to avoid,"*I am starting this one with a genuine hope that someone can change my view. Please, change my view, I really hate having it.*

This problem comes up everywhere, but I'll explain on the example of gender debate as it's what I'm most embedded in. I realise it's massive in politics but it's not what I'm focusing on here.

The one thing I battle with the most is the tendency to paint all men or all women as being this or that, and using it to justify dismissing them and their problems, saying they're not deserving of something, justifying being mean to them, discriminating against them while claiming they asked for it, punishing an individual for the sins of the group, and so on.

Very often B&W thinking is underlined by some painful personal experience with one person or more, which is then generalised to the entire gender. Sometimes it's super overt, like [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0g2drvCUYj/) (men think of their families, women only about themselves) or [here](https://medium.com/@donna.gratehouse/society-does-include-men-but-whenever-society-is-being-called-upon-to-address-mens-problems-it-s-6ea30fe2f4ac) (women want to help men but all they ever get in return is violence). Other times it's by implication, like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiDpvn77eqE&lc=UgyZ5Bm0GnM23wIQ5wR4AaABAg) (highlighted comment implying that all women want marriage and will make it a disaster for men) or [here](https://medium.com/@lelper/10-things-for-guys-not-to-do-on-dating-apps-5680ce34ffd9) (men are shit at dating, listing 10 sins which are hardly things only men do). I'm literally just picking a couple examples I've got fresh in my mind, but there are millions around. 

It's usually examples of the [Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error). 

* Whichever side you're on, **We** are always the good ones and everything **we** do is good or, if it's bad, it's because **They** provoked us or deserved it anyway. Meanwhile, when **They** do something bad, it's proof of their wicked evil nature.
* Whichever side you're on, **We** are always the innocent victims and underdogs and **They** are the perpetrators in power.

Those basic narratives are so powerful and play so hard to the tribal thinking we evolved with, that it's incredibly hard to break out of them. The simplicity of this heuristic just makes it win with the complex truth that the world is not B&W but all shades and colours, that everybody is different and you can't just treat groups as monoliths. They might have power in this domain but we have power in another, many people in the group might have power but not necessarily this person, some of us are also pretty shitty sometimes while some of them are actually great, and so on.

Of course, there are many who know this. When you explicitly ask people about it, many will say this. But in practice, most still act and overwhelmingly think in terms of black-and-white. And it's a constant in human history - it's as much of a problem now as it was in Ancient Greece, we have evolved nothing.

What does this mean? It means that it is just such a bloody pain to get through to people! To help them stop spending so much energy on fighting each other and instead use it on making the world better for everyone. We keep fighting culture wars with imagined enemies and make everyone's lives miserable, while all it would take is to just stop and admit that there is in fact no us and them. That we're just all people who make mistakes and can get better.

But so I go, trying to promote this view, yet every time I feel like I succeeded on some small scale, I just see more and more of that everywhere else. It seems so inescapable. Can you please change my view and show me that it's not?",Simon_Fokt,436,0.8799999952316284,414,1706525378,2024-01-29 04:49:38,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1adsjhe/cmv_blackandwhite_usvsthem_thinking_prevents_us/,1,2024
1ae4b6a,"CMV: No group of people in history would willing allow the enactment of anything like the Zionist project on their own land, and no group of people would, in the Palestinians' place, respond to Zionism with anything but hostility.","For me, the most frustrating thing about the discourse surrounding Palestine-Israel is the way in which the Palestinian people are routinely portrayed as irrationally extreme, violent, or anti-Semitic, when in fact their deep hostility to Zionism (and Israel in general) is the most obvious and predictable thing imaginable. I am convinced that **no group of people in history would willing allow the enactment of anything like the Zionist project on their own land, and no group of people would, in the Palestinians' place, respond to Zionism with anything but hostility.**

Imagine the following scenario in *your* country:

* A group of people are immigrating into your country in massive numbers, and *they have made it explicitly clear they want their own state on your land*. They go from a trivial percent of the population (\~2%) to almost a third of the population in around a generation. A foreign power retains control of your immigration policy and doesn't allow you to stop the influx
* As soon as this group arrives, they begin lobbying foreign powers to grant them their own state on your land. They'd love all of it, but they'll take as much as they can get for now
* They buy up land from absentee owners and kick off native tenants. They enact terms on the land that makes it illegal for it ever to be owned or worked by anyone but them ever again
* Eventually they succeed in making their case to the reigning superpowers: despite representing less than one third of the population and being mostly foreign-born, they are granted over half of your land — including half the coast and virtually all of the best farmland. Additionally huge numbers of your people will now have to live in their ethnostate, while none of them are expected to live on your side.

Given this history, the Palestinians rejected the 48' deal. Can someone seriously tell me that they are surprised? How do you imagine *your* people would respond? Do you really think that your people would have accepted that deal? 

Or, to put it differently, if the Zionists had wanted Connecticut or Cornwall for their state, do you think the US or UK would have considered that proposition for a single second? Do you think they would have handed over a single acre of their territory for a Jewish state? And if not, why should the Palestinians have been expected to?

Here is some additional evidence:

* The 30s and 40s were a massive litmus test of the Western world's decency toward refugees, and virtually everyone failed. There *were* hundreds of thousands of Jews looking for a home then, due to Nazism, and every single country turned them away. As an American, I think it is to our eternal shame that we did not go out of way to take in the whole of European Jewry, but if the US — a far larger and richer country with a much, much larger Jewish population (at the time) — was unwilling to open its doors, why are we surprised that the Palestinians weren't crazy about Jewish immigration, when it clearly meant the death of their society?
* I was once arguing with a Zionist about the right of return. And he said: ""Of course we can't offer them a right of return. It would mean the end of the Jewish nature of Israel."" He was right of course — that would be the result. He was also right to imply that *obviously* Israel is going to implement policies that protect it from being overwhelmed demographically; obviously, Israel is going to behave with the instinct towards self-defense that all functioning societies do. But to him the Palestinians were simply not human enough for him to have to consider the obvious: the entire existence of Israel is predicated on the Palestinians having been denied the right to do this very thing, to protect their society's integrity
* Far smaller rates of immigration create tremendous controversy throughout the developed world. Think about how controversial Muslim immigration into Europe is. Right now Muslims represent around 7.5% of France's population, after 80 years of immigration. In Palestine, in less time, Jews went from 2% to 30% of the population. And it's funny: most of the folks that are pro-Israel are also anti-immigration. They would absolutely lose their minds if they were made to tolerate the rates of immigration the Palestinians had to, especially if their immigrants were making it known they wanted their own country!
* In fact, I cannot think of a single country that currently allows the rates of immigration seen in Palestine in the early 20th century.
* I cannot think of a single people in history that has willingly allowed such a massive demographic change to take place on its land. If you can think of one, please, by all means, share.
* I cannot think of a single people who have willingly traded away any of their land for the sake of others' national aspirations
* I expect to hear the common Zionist talking point that ""There never was a Palestinian state, and Palestinian identity only goes back to the early 20th century."" This is undoubtedly true, but, for the life of me, I cannot understand what the implication of this is supposed to be. Are they saying: ""because the Arabs of the land of Palestine never had a nation state, it's okay to swap out their society for another one""? This logic looks remarkably like that used to colonize the Americas and Africa: they don't have a state, so they don't count politically. If this means something else, please let me know.

1afvqlm,CMV: America is both overhated and underrated,"When America helps people or helps the world, nobody really shows any gratitude. And if we help in *too* much or in the wrong ways we get called cultural imperialists sticking our white noses into brown/black people's business and messing up their countries. If we don’t help enough, as the case shows in Rwanda or the current Latin American refugee crisis, we’re a callous, settler-colonial nation who couldn’t give two shits about the plight of the black man or the brown man suffering just beyond our borders.

The history of human life on earth is in large part a study of the various empires we created over thousands of years and based on our predecessors, I’d say if America is an empire, we’re by far the most benign and just the world has yet seen. We’re grading on a curve of course but does anybody else here reasonably think we’d be better under a Pax Russia? Pax China? Pax Britannia? How about the slave empires of the antiquity such as Rome, Greece, or any of the Islamic Caliphates? 

There should be some middle ground between giving the appropriate credit to countries that have made enormous strides in terms of lifting their citizens out of poverty, ending hunger and raising the standards of living while also acknowledging the role, where it’s appropriate, of the US in facilitating it. For example, China lifting hundreds of millions of citizens out of poverty is a major humans rights achievement. China is/should be very proud of it. But it never would have happened with out the aid of US markets, US credit, and US help. And we should take pride in that as well. But liberals think they’re above the low hanging fruit of patriotism, “why do we even need to be proud of our country? That’s weird.” — because it’s so associated with the political Right. 

So they go the opposite direction and constantly harp on all the wrongs America may or may not have done.

Well I live in a town with an obscene homeless population, one of the largest in America. 

Anti homeless architecture does not reflect how hard a city is trying to help their homeless people. Some cities are super neglectful and others aren’t. But regardless, the architecture itself isn’t the problem. I know that my city puts tons of money into homeless shelters and rehabilitation, and that the people who sleep on the public benches are likely addicted to drugs or got kicked out for some other reason. I agree 100% that it’s the city’s responsibility to aid the homeless.

But getting angry at anti homeless architecture seems to imply that these public benches were made for homeless people to sleep on…up until recently, it was impossible to walk around downtown without passing a homeless person on almost every corner, and most of them smelled very strongly of feces. But we’ve begun to implement anti homeless architecture and the changes to our downtown have been unbelievable. We can actually sit on the public benches now, there’s so much less litter everywhere, and the entire downtown area is just so much more vibrant and welcoming.

I’ve tried these substances and experienced how potent they can be and alter your perceptions and outlooks for the better, but to say EVERYONE should give them a try is simply absurd.

Abusing psychedelics can lead to psychosis, HPPD, schizophrenia, worst case scenario a psychotic episode leading to death of the user or those around them.

Of course cases like these are relatively few and far between. Responsible users would take all of the necessary precautions to ensure the risk of an event like this happening is as minimal as possible, but not everyone is a responsible user. Even if you include controls like being of a mature age, having no history of mental illness in yourself or family, being in a safe environment at the time of effects, etc., the risk of mishaps is higher than 0% and must be considered.

I believe psychedelics and marijuana have the potential to give wonderful experiences and alleviate some of the stress that life carries, but these are powerful substances that must be respected, and the potential risks of everyone trying them just once outweighs the rewards.

194axin,CMV: It Should Be Illegal for Politicians to Tell Blatant Lies,"This is Trump-inspired. I was just listening to Trump speaking to reporters not five minutes ago after coming out of his civil trial in New York where he has already been found guilty of massively inflating the value of many of his properties and holdings and they are determining what the punishment/fine should be. He stood in front of reporters and stated, time and again, that ""this was the new way Democrats were stealing the elections"" and repeatedly said that all of these trials and charges he is facing are being coordinated by Biden. 

I understand that the news media can rebut these claims and can follow-up his conferences with fact-checks, but I don't think that is sufficient as he is consistently allowed a megaphone in which he can state huge, incredibly damaging lies that hurt our country and there is no reprecussion for doing so. 

I do not believe that politicians should be held liable/that it should be illegal for them to tell lies in that for example, they say they will do ""X"" for their constituents but then that doesn't happen. What I mean is it should be illegal to make such incredibly damaging and damning claims when there is literally no evidence to support it. This is because the types of claims Trump is making are the type that can lead to true disarray, hatred, anger, and potentially even civil war if allowed to carry on unpunished. 

When Trump tells people that Biden is coordinating charges against him when there is literally no evidence of this his supporters believe it. And this type of claim is the type of claim that angers and infuriates his supporters. They truly believe that the election was stolen (even though he had many, many chances in court to prove his claims and failed in every single one) and they truly believe that Biden is somehow coordinating an effort to put Trump behind bars.

The simple fact is, Trump clearly was told by many, many individuals that there was no evidence of fraud in the election but he plowed forward with ""stolen"" claims anyways. He called the Georgia secretary of state and asked him to find just enough votes for him to win. He did all these things and there are consequences. He brought this upon himself, not Biden. 

Why shouldn't it be illegal for candidates to tell these types of lies? In a world where gaslighting the public leads to true national division, can we really continue to allow such dangerous lies to be legally okay? What is the end of this type of lying? Where does it lead? It can't lead anywhere good and it infuriates me that he is allowed to just straight-up lie without consequences.

19apxuf,CMV: plastic surgery is largely unnecessary and people need therapy more than plastic surgery,"Excluding outlier cases such as deformities or deformities caused by accidents, or anything pertaining to health. I think plastic surgery has a place of usefulness.

I am talking about the casual pursuit of more and more plastic surgery + fillers + Botox - particularly in young people who spend a lot of time on social media.

Social media has caused an unhealthy obsession with appearance. There are communities on Reddit where people exclusively pick each other apart, tell them what kind of plastic surgery they need, then encourage posters to come back and update with their new look.

This is kind of nuts. Changing your face to look more like everyone else in pursuit of a beauty ideal (and those ideals change) makes me think people need therapy to help them feel comfortable in their skin more than they need to change themselves to fit the ideal.

I don’t think it’s “acceptance” to accept that people get plastic surgery to fit some societal ideal. Acceptance would be just accepting people as they are and not placing such an insane value on being “attractive” (a shifting goalpost tbh).


Edit to clarify point: 

I think I need to clarify - I am not saying it should be illegal, that people who get cosmetic surgery should be judged, or that they shouldn’t be allowed to get surgery.

I’m saying my view is that a lot of the demand for cosmetic procedures is inherently unhealthy and driven by social media and looking at images of ourselves more than we were ever meant to.

I am not referring to necessary plastic surgery to correct issues, fix real deformities or problems that would affect how someone is treated (that includes cosmetic surgeries!!)

I’ve gotten more and more into politics each year and I’ve found that I lean more with left-wing ideas. But I don’t really understand conservatism especially from a historic perspective.

I think the most recent one is gay marriage but, suffrage for virtually every group, climate change, social security and basically every hit button issue of the past i feel like are in the same boat. 

I say this not to insult, rather to learn more about the other side. Because as I am left leaning I don’t really abide by political tribalism. If someone can explain or enlighten me, I’d genuinely appreciate it.

The admissions process works by taking an unbiased entrance test, after which candidates are ranked, based on how they did on that test. 

I'm cases where the admissions process works by interviewing candidates, I could potentially see the use for quotas (because when men are in positions of power, they might be more likely to accept men), but in cases where the admissions process is entirely skill-based, it does not make sense to me.

1acfvhn,CMV: Men are becoming more conservative because progressives refuse to talk about men's issues.,"The way I see it. There's few people who want to speak to men about the issues the face in a way that doesn't either center women or blame men. I took multiple feminist studies classes in college and something I noticed as the only man there was that how patriarchial standards harm men was also said as a footnote, minimized, or implied that men were holding the boot on their own heads. 

As a man born in 2001 who has literally no political or socioeconomic power other than my own ability to vote, I could easily see how this would be frustrating. I feel there are issues I have to deal with that women do not have to. I also feel that it's not other men that cause 100% of those issues 100% of the time. A lot of women who believe they are feminists don't want to acknowledge this because they feel conceding any point to women having any aspect of life easier than or playing into certain patriarchial roles anti-feminist and pro-men.

Men are struggling to date more and more. I mean I saw some statistics that men age 18 to 30 were twice as likely to be single than the same age group. Many young men are struggling to find romantic partnerships. The ""feminist"" view to that is to tell them that they're not entitled to romantic love. The Petersonian view is that men are struggling and they should be allowed to feel what they feel and it is a problem that so many men are lonely. g that hates you.

With this I think there's been a bit of an overcorrection to casual misogyny that women specifically in my generation do where they call for an end to casual misogyny (valid and correct) while combating it with casual misandry. Again, seeing both of these views perpetuated by what you believe feminist are and by someone who calls themself a feminist, you're not gonna want to look into it. You'll view it as something counter to you and something that hates you.

This is such a common belief that the average man's exposure to ""feminism"" is likely going to be from social media and turn him off from feminist ideals. I mean why would he? If some 19-year-old dude keeps seeing online that not only is he oppressing women but he's also the cause of his issues, he's not gonna see feminism as a positive thing. st, you're not gonna want to look into it.

1afqnkw,CMV: There is no legitimate reason D.C. shouldn't be a state or at least absorbed into a neighboring state,"For those who are not American's, the capital of the USA is Washington D.C. which is not itself a state nor is it part of any state. It is a federal district which offers those citizens living within it little benefits and many disadvantages. I care not for the historical reasons it was not originally created as a state, I only care the facts as they stand today.

* D.C. is just over 60 sq miles which is quite a bit smaller that the smallest state, Rhode Island at over 1,200 sq miles.
* It has a population of 690,000 which is larger than two states.
* The nearly 700k people living in D.C. have no federal representation in congress besides a non-voting member (who aggressively advocates for statehood).
* Despite not having representation, they still need pay federal taxes like any other citizen.
* Over 80% of D.C. citizens want to become a state.

As far as I can tell, the arguments for D.C. statehood are sound and comprehensive. The only argument against D.C. statehood I know of is that it's citizens lean heavily democrat and the republicans don't want more democrats in congress (which I do not find compelling).

19a7yjm,CMV: voters can and should be blamed for the horrible policies they enact by voting for certain parties politicians and policies,"I know this post will be controversial but I've been thinking about it for some time. There seems to be a disconnect over how politicians and law and regulation is overall started in the United states. Many people will give a pass to a person who voted for a politican who enacts a bad policy for their state country or city. It all starts origin wise with a vote by the people for a person or proposition to enact a law. 

For example the people in states like Texas and Idaho and other states with complete abortion bans (even the life of the mother is really just on paper) if you are a conservative person who has been voting republican your whole life and saw the extremist pro forced birth laws creep in your state year after year you can't be surprised by your state now post dobbs going full abortion ban. Many will say it's counter productive to do this as it could drive people away from changing their beliefs and voting for another person party or policy. But I believe that confronting someone with that fact that these polices that are enacted are in fact started by a vote. Many people feel that their votes are not causes for bad policy and can divorce their responsibility for their vote for harmful policy. Many ""left wing"" Podcasters claimed this about blaming Trump voters in 2016 by saying you couldn't blame them for voting for him. 

And so people don't think I'm leaning politically one way or another I think that way about a voter in the south side of Chicago who bemoans gang violence but won't vote for another alderman or state representative or voters who are upset about rising crime yet vote for people who support cashless bail or abolishing bail altogether.",SnooPeripherals2455,272,0.7699999809265137,196,1705630687,2024-01-18 20:18:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19a7yjm/cmv_voters_can_and_should_be_blamed_for_the/,1,2024
19fctws,"CMV: ""Victim syndrome"" has pervaded almost every group around the world over the last 30 years","The idea of the echo chamber isn't new. Nations and political groups have always used it to coerce people into action. 

However, the last 30 years of increasingly ""personalized"" news and social media has created more and more self-contained echo chambers that deeply benefit from hyping their specific audience's particular fears and concerns. They rely on the age old technique of blaming reliable ""boogeymen"" that are out to get them.

As the increasing economic distortion field of social media makes us feel more and more insecure about our own social and economic standing, these echo chambers tell us that we, too, would be rich and powerful if some other group hadn't wronged us or wasn't trying to destroy us. 

In many (if not all) cases, there is some real injustice and, possibly, genuine concerns that ought to be addressed. However, the echo chamber serves to amplify the scope and scale of those concerns and discount or dismiss the concerns of others. 

The facilitators of the echo chamber profit from their enablement leading people to go deeper and deeper into the victimhood rabbit hole. 

People occasionally peek out of the rabbit hole and see that their victimhood is not validated by others or see other people's sense of victimhood as a threat to their own desire to be the ""true victims"" who deserve attention and restitution. 

Any denial of their ""true victim"" identity only serves as proof of the threat from the ""other.""

There is no truth unless it agrees with us. Facts are replaced with varying sets of ""alternative facts."" We are told not to trust our eyes or our feelings if they counter our narrative. They claim that the conspirators of our destruction are rooted deep in every institution and they are continually working towards our demise. 

There is no nuance. There can be no compromise. Every person who disagrees with us is ""in the pocket"" or ""under the control"" of ""the other."" Every fight is another step in the existential struggle. Every slight is proof of the other's intention to destroy. Every victory is a sign of righteousness. All damage done in the name of the cause is excusable. 

So... deeper and deeper we go until the only option left is the complete suppression and silencing of others who do not acknowledge our absolute and unarguable right to be validated and for our perceived wrongs to be made right. 

This, to me, seems like the template for each group I interact with and I see no sign that this will change given how the echo chambers are being reinforced by the increasingly ""personalized,"" click-driven media landscape.",ExtinctLikeNdiaye,270,0.7400000095367432,112,1706198995,2024-01-25 10:09:55,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19fctws/cmv_victim_syndrome_has_pervaded_almost_every/,1,2024

Chicken nuggets have always been ultra processed shaped “nuggets” and boneless wings will never be processed to the degree that nuggets are. Another part of the argument brings in chicken tenders.

Yes, it’s a small country, but it’s the same continent!

And bearing in mind, some of these were said by students at top Universities.

In fact, their attitude is quite embarrassing since they do not know about their own continent. Not to mention the rest of the world (a man convincing the other that the Taj Mahal is in Abu Dhabi, which also happens to be the capital of India apparently). In fact, the only thing Brits might know more about is the US, since they seem to align themselves more closely to them.

They might know something little about western Europe, like France bc of proximity or Spain bc of holidays, but that’s about it.

The debate about whether our representative form of government was ever a true ""democracy"" is another topic entirely.

The US has long had a two-party democratic system. Now, one of the two parties is openly un-democratic. They support a candidate who already attempted one coup to overthrow an election, and who openly wishes to be a dictator. So from my perspective, that party is no longer participating in the democratic process, which leaves us with a... one-party democracy? Is that even a democracy at all?

In 2020 Biden ran on the premise of saving democracy from Trump. Now, entering the next election, democracy seems *even farther* from ""being saved,"" and Biden is running on the same premise again. Frankly, it seems a lot like the rhetoric from self-labeled but widely accepted to be undemocratic regimes like Russia and China; ""you must vote for THE party or doom us all.""

It seems to me that the only way out of this situation is to create a viable third-party (or rather, 2nd party, if you assume that the Republicans are not participating in democracy). If the Democratic Party is serious about ""saving democracy,"" then they should be acknowledging the vast differences between their constituents (currently, anyone who still wants the US to operate as a democracy), dividing themselves into factions (sub-parties or new parties altogether), and forming a coalition of those factions to elect leaders through a democratic process (e.g. serious primary elections for president).

But it will give less than near perfect standard people nowhere near as good an option for dating and marrying, because 90-95% of matches goes to an absurdly small % of people on these apps. In this case, it didn't democratize anything because human choice and preference maintains the same, making the apps pointless.

I felt this was very far fetched the marvels had a lot going against it. Its the latest in the line of marvel films that were already mediocre its also very generic and paint by numbers. Thor Love and thunder Ant Man Quanamanium and Secret Invasion really destroyed the general audiences desire to see more marvel movies. 

I also don't the Marvels is a particularly ""woke"" movie sure the leads are all women and the villain is a woman but does it have a feminist message or anything particularly to say about the female experience? 

Not really maybe there is that line about ""black girl magic"" but other than that nothing in the movie seemed very offensive to the average male movie goer.

If you contrast that with Barbie that has a explicitly feminist message and said the word ""patriarchy"" which obviously should turn off antifeminist viewers despite all that it was a success.

Now I see disney hiring a basically unknown female feminist female director to make a new star wars movie and I can't help but think they are trying to copy barbies success. Who knows maybe it will fail but I don't think disney is going to blame female leads or minorites for its failures. We are going to see a lot of barbie copy cats in the next few years like it or not.",PublicActuator4263,230,0.7200000286102295,301,1704756030,2024-01-08 17:20:30,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/191zd8y/cmv_barbie_will_have_a_much_bigger_impact_on/,1,2024
190573g,"CMV: As an Asian American, voting for the Democratic Party is the only viable option for me, as they are the lesser of two evils","As someone deeply engaged in the upcoming election, I remain aligned with the Democratic Party as an Asian American, especially considering I reside in California. This state is the wealthiest in the nation and holds a remarkable economic standing, with a GDP that, if considered independently, would rank among the top 10 globally.

On top of that, the GOP has this habit of throwing around racist remarks, which just doesn't sit right with Asians. It's the kind of stuff that could be used against them, especially when we're talking about the surge in hate crimes against Asians.

While Asians encompass a rich tapestry of ethnic diversity, I want zero in on the ""holy Asian trinity"" (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) due to their numerous and influential representation among the Asian community. Democrats tend to lean towards supporting social safety nets and regulations, and this tends to resonate more with educated minorities.

Education holds immense significance in Asian culture, exemplified by phenomena like cram schools in East Asian countries such as Korea and Japan, where students attend supplementary classes to gain a competitive edge in entrance exams to some of the most competitive colleges in their respective country.

Drawing a comparison within the U.S., states under Republican governance tend to exhibit lower academic achievements than their Democratic counterparts. This discrepancy is often attributed to the Republican Party's inclination to reduce funding for education, resulting in lower academic outcomes.

While there is a consensus that schools could benefit from increased cost efficiency, the solution does not lie in defunding education. 


To change my view:

Provide insights on how the Republican Party can effectively cater to and address the interests of the Asian American community as opposed to the Democrats.",ChronowalkerZ,228,0.550000011920929,1163,1704562507,2024-01-06 11:35:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/190573g/cmv_as_an_asian_american_voting_for_the/,1,2024
