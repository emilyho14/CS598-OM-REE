1cpozer,"CMV: The Republican Party made a mistake running Trump 2024. People would vote for just about anyone other then Biden, but we will not vote for Trump.","Who knows how well this post will age but for me personally I think this was a mistake. Yes I know, this is in part what the GOP base wants. Yes I know that he could easily split the party and cost them the election if he *didn’t* get the nomination but I still think it was a poor choice. 

And I still think the wet noodle spine of most of the party establishment precluded the possibility of them mounting any serious opposition to Trump’s candidacy. But look, Biden is old. People don’t like him. They’re not inspired by him. His voice is weak and thin and his economy is unaffordable. 

But I genuinely believe people dislike Trump more. God I wish Haley was running and the GOP should too because she’d be cleaning Biden’s clock right now. I’d happily campaign for her. 

But I will not support a man who led an insurrection against our 2 centuries of Republican government.

1chig4t,"CMV: Saying “The United States is a republic, not a democracy” adds nothing to political discourse","You see this a lot, particularly from right leaning commentators when someone says that something thing or another is undemocratic, usually something Trump did or said. And someone will say, “The United States is not a democracy, it’s a republic.” 

This is essentially like saying, “human beings are ren’t mammals, they’re primates”.

Yes, the United States is not a *direct democracy* like ancient Athens, but it’s a representative democracy, which is essentially the same thing as a republic. 

And it features pretty well developed press freedoms, an independent judiciary, full equal protection for all citizens under the law, enforcement of property rights, transparency and accountability of government officials, elections of legislators, robust political debates , etc. These are all hallmarks of a democracy. 

So, I’m not sure what stating that the United States is a republic, not a democracy, adds to any discussion. Unless, the people who bring this up are suggesting that Americans abandon the rule of law and liberal norms.

1cz17gg,"CMV: The reason there’s so much loneliness in America today is because we the people have replaced our traditional institutions of community in America with social media and the internet, which are half-measures at best and actively harmful at worst.","
Humans are, in my opinion, naturally lazy creatures who will always choose the path of least resistance in almost anything. This includes communication. Throughout most of human history our sense of community was connected to our ability to travel to meet other people or other peoples ability to travel to us. 

The postal service, mail, letters, tv radio shows and phones all altered the equation but none more fundamentally then the internet did. The internet offered something unique. The *closest* simulation you could get to having a person/people in the room with you while also being alone. It has the trappings of community but none of the soul.

Low investment, low barrier to entry. Those are the hallmarks of social media. Yes it’s monetized in variety of different ways but on the whole it’s accessible and easily available at no cost to almost anyone. But it’s this lack of investment that causes the problem. People feel less satisfied, more lonely and more disconnected because the crutches they’ve fallen back on — again the path of least resistance — are empty calories. They provide no real nutrition, no food for the soul, they can aid people in connecting but they’re a tool. Not a solution in my opinion. 

My nephew is the textbook example of social media’s failed promise. He’s probably on the autism spectrum, he’s naturally shy and as a result has almost no friends in school. But with social media, game chats and YouTube to provide nourishment it should be no problem right? 

Wrong. 

He’s almost graduated high school and god love him, he’s emotionally stunted. Idk how he’s gonna meet a man/woman, how he’ll fall in love, how he’ll build a network of friends, how he’ll even hold down a job if he’s never exercised, never developed, the “muscles” you need to form meaningful, longterm connections with other humans. 

It’s not to say people like that are doomed. They’re not. I’m not on the spectrum but I had many of the same problems as he did in school but I was forced/forced myself to develop a personality and learn how to work and be social outside of a screen. 

But if you’ve got a collection of electronic crutches to fall back on, you and by extension the rest of your society is going to splinter into smaller and smaller, more disconnected tribes that happen to share the same town, city or country.

1clrqw2,CMV: future of Islamism in Europe is not promising ,"
I'm ex-muslim and I was worried about what's happening in the last few years where people in the UK chanting for implementing Sharia as well as Germany 

I don't have problems with Muslims just if you want to say I'm islamophobic but I don't want my head to be chopped off because I left my faith for the scientific errors in the Quran which is the word of God 

But I truly believe that stoning to death, killing apostates, cutting hands and doing jihad which is militarily fighting other countries to worship allah and enslaving their women and children and kill men if they defend their land and implementing jyzia to humiliate non-muslims is something bad and inhumane and terrorist 

I think that 1 scenario will happen in the future out of 2 

1. The good scenario 

Europe will organize the immigration policy and the next generations of Muslim will be less conservative and many of them will leave the faith and everything is gonna be fine (most of the ones who want sharia are either 1st generation or 2nd at most) a


2. The bad scenario 

UK will face a civil war from people who wants to implement the Sharia (and yes that's what literally in the Quran, Muslims are ordered to jihad) and eventually the UK will win but after many casualties 


Sorry if that's sounds very extreme but I'm genuinely worried because I'll encounter many persecution if people in my country knows that I'm atheist and maybe I'll be killed if they know and I'm willing to go work in the west and I -for obvious reasons- don't want to be killed there too

1ckwnfl,CMV: You have the right to be overly neutral about foreign conflicts that you don't really have too much affiliation with,"This is in response to things like Israel vs Hamas and Ukraine vs Russia as an American (more with the former). Since I'm pretty young, my feed (mostly Instagram, I don't really use TikTok) unsurprisingly has people constantly saying how we need to have our voices involved and that if you do nothing you're letting genocide happen. I think I've seen at least ten posts a day about this with the same messages. But I do feel that as someone with barely any personal ties to these conflicts, I feel I just don't really think I can say who is right. Plus having a wide variety of friends and my knack for researching tons of information has exposed me to different views which has made it only harder to truly pick a side of sorts. The only opinion I really have is that I don't want the civilians of the region to suffer any longer, which isn't really that disagreeable. I have several friends who protested and while most of them didn't see too much fighting (their schools mostly just had a two hour rally and everyone left afterwards), the ones who did see battles like at UCLA or Columbia were much more distressed and I did spend some time comforting them as a friend even if I had told them I was more or less neutral, which they understood and had no problem with.

1cwq65v,CMV: it is perfectly reasonable of the ICC prosecutor to seek arrest warrants for leaders of Hamas *and* of Israel for alleged crimes against humanity,"I’m feeling like the world has gone mad in its general reaction to this move by the ICC prosecutor.

We have Biden and others calling it outrageous to suggest equivalence between Israel and Hamas (which it would be) but that’s not at all what the ICC prosecutor has done - he’s just said ‘name’ is suspected of this list of bad things, and ‘name’ is suspected of this other list of bad things, with evidence, and those allegations are serious enough that there is potentially a case to answer. 

I’ve also seen people on Israeli subs saying although they might hate Netanyahu, the ICC has lost the plot. Like: ‘he’s a criminal but obviously not THAT kind of criminal!’, and saying the ICC should turn its attention to the real crims in Russia or North Korea instead. But, jurisdictional issues aside, why would you not want scrutiny of all leaders responsible for massive loss of life? Even the strongest supporter of Israel’s right to defend itself should surely be concerned about how exactly that defending is done? And there are lots of features of Israel’s warfare that should at least prompt cause for concern (disproportionate fatalities, friendly fire, dead aid workers, soldier misconduct)

Meanwhile Hamas says the move equates victim with executioner. Same point applies as above, that leaders on both sides might have some charges in common, but the question in each case is “did this person do this stuff?” NOT “is this person better/worse than that person?” Also I don’t believe there is any doubt that Hamas ordered deliberate killing of civilians and taking of hostages. The whole point of the concept of war crimes is that it doesn’t matter how righteous or justified you feel, or how nasty war is - you should never do them. 

Are we really so addicted to “good guy vs bad guy” narratives that we can’t bend our minds around the concept that maybe two sides, despite all sorts of legitimate grievances, can simultaneously inflict great evils on one another?

Is it perhaps that it’s such a complex situation the moderates stay quiet so the polar extremes dominate the airtime?

Or am I missing something here? I see no sensible reason for calling the ICC’s (very preliminary) move anything other than reasonable, or anything short of exactly what we should want to see in modern civilisation.

1d1h20u,"CMV: Being homeless is a situation that is next to impossible to get out of without financial assistance, and or free room and board for at least a couple of months. This could be from any source. Expecting someone to do it alone is unrealistic. ","Alright, so disclosure, I’m homeless currently. I’ve been homeless for roughly 7 months now. So I have a different perspective on this than probably the majority of people who might see this thread. I also have had the better part of a year to get a closer look at how this really works and what options are available. 

So imagine this scenario: You receive disability income at $900 a month. You do not have a permanent residence. Your disability stipulates that you can earn up to an additional $900/mo before losing benefits. You receive a check on the 3rd of every month for $900. 

Okay, so on the 3rd of, let’s say, June, you check into the cheapest motel you can find. It’s $76/night, or $350/week. No monthly rate. That means a month is $1,400. Already more than you have. The most you can afford is two weeks, for $700. Now you have $200 left. You will need to use this money for food, unless you have EBT. Let’s assume you do, and food is not a cost you have to be concerned with. Your checkout date is June 16th.

Let’s say that on day one you apply at, say, McDonald’s, and they hire you, on day one. And you begin work on the 4th of June. Both of those things are unlikely, but let’s roll with it. 

They have presumably agreed to hire you part time, and keep your monthly pay at under $900. Let’s also assume that you started work at the perfect time in the pay period, and you will be paid in exactly 1 week and 6 days. Also unlikely. You will be paid on June 17th, and will be evicted from the motel the day before you get paid. But you’re tough, you sleep in a park that night and roll with the punches. You get paid $450 before tax, so probably around $400 after taxes, generously. Congratulations, you can now afford another whole 7 days in a motel! 

Unfortunately, you won’t be paid for 14 days, with no reliable or consistent way to bridge that gap. Homeless shelters are frequently full, and rarely near where you need to be to work. They also have strict curfews, and no excuse (even working) will bypass that. You probably also haven’t got phone service, because the entirety of your money is going to your motel. This means you cannot call a shelter before heading to it to see if they have a bed, not that it would matter anyway as they don’t reserve them. So you will waste away your entire day and or night walking around to find a place to stay. 

During this time, you will more than likely be fired, as you have nowhere to sleep, no way to shower, nowhere to put your belongings (whatever they may be) no way to wash your clothes, and ostensibly no food to eat. You will try to show up for work, because you’re not a quitter, but you’re haggard, tired, and smelly, not to mention fatigued from lack of nutrition. 


This is just a taste of the struggle of the cycle of homelessness. You could change my view by demonstrating that my assessment of the situation isn’t accurate, and provide me with evidence.

1csqdpf,CMV: Muting mics during a Biden/Trump debate actually benefits Trump's style of debating.,"Biden and Trump are scheduled to debate ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/15/biden-challenges-trump-to-two-debates-before-election.html)).

A lot of people are praising this as a win generally, but especially for Biden because it will stop Trump from interrupting Biden during his responses. I don't think that's right. In fact, I think muting the mics will benefit Trump much more than Biden.

Muting someone's mic when it's not their turn to respond does *not* stop interruptions, it only stops the audience from hearing it. Consider this: Biden is answering a question posed to him. Meanwhile Trump is talking and rambling over Biden. If Biden gets distracted by this (as any reasonable person would), then this could very easily throw off Biden's response. But to the wider audience who can't hear Trump's interruptions, it will simply look like Biden is stammering, stuttering, or otherwise ""too old"". Especially in an era where sound bites and TikToks drive political perceptions, this could end up looking really bad for Biden.

I realize Biden could also employ this kind of tactic, but it's simply not his debate style. Trump's debate style on the other hand is very suited for this kind of tactic.

There could be ways to mitigate this though. Part of the debate rules could include a requirement that both candidates are visible at all times (like a PIP), or the two can be physically separated (like being televised in different rooms). But I think on its own, the rule to mute mics for the person not responding will mostly benefit Trump in the debates.

1cktjcg,"CMV: If Israel is an illegitimate state because it was founded on ethnic cleansing, so is Turkey.","In 1948 Israel won its war of independence as a product of Arab states refusing the UN partition plan of Mandatory Palestine and then proceeding to not make any sort of counter-offer during this period. 700,000 Arabs either fled Mandatory Palestine or were expelled. 

In the Palestinian narrative, this is seen as the ""Nakba"". They conveniently ignore the significantly larger number of Jews who were expelled from Middle Eastern countries immediately after this.

Regardless, let's say that this narrative is entirely correct. That Israel is an illegitimate state because of their acts of ethnic cleansing justified through Jewish nationalism. Then it should also logically follow that Turkey is an entirely illegitimate state.

Turkey emerged from the remnants of the Ottoman Empire after the Turkish War of Independence (1919-1923). The establishment of Turkey happened as the result of significantly worse levels of ethnic cleansing and genocides against ethnic minorities. The most obvious example being the Armenians. 1.5 million of them were systemically exterminated in this war. The ideological justification of this is fundamentally identical to that of the State of Israel, Jewish Nationalism or Zionism. Following the war, the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne created a compulsory population exchange involving 1.2 million ethnic Greeks from Turkey and 500,000 Muslims from Greece.

This was explicitly endorsed and enforced as state policy to create an ethnically homogeneous nation. If Israel had the same intentions, they failed. This is not, and has not been reflected in the ethnic makeup of the State of Israel.

The only *possible* difference between these two circumstances that would make Israel illegitimate and Turkey legitimate, is that many Israelis came from Europe instead of the Middle East. However I fail to see how this is relevant to the actual act of ethnic cleansing and population swaps that makes Israel illegitimate in the first place. 

Out of consistency, all pro-Palestinians who think that Israel is an illegitimate state per the principles of its founding should also apply this standard to the State of Turkey and many other states around the world.

All 'anti-zionists', who want the destruction and/or dissolution of Israel entirely (not just them to stop their actions in the West Bank or Gaza and implement a two-state solution) should also be in favour of the destruction/dissolution of Turkey and right of return for all displaced Greeks (and Muslims) from both countries.  
  
The fact that Turks happened to *also* be in modern-day Turkey for a very long time is irrelevant to the question of whether or not ethnic cleansing (or 'population swaps, as it was called') makes the state that did it illegitimate. Saying that Israel is a 'European Colonial Venture' has nothing to do with the logic presented nor do I particularly care about the recklessness of the British Empire in the dissolution of their mandates.

But I think regardless of gender, it’s not an unfair standard to want a partner that hasn’t slept around a ton. A popular sentiment online is that if I found out well into a relationship that my partner had slept with 50 people, any emotional reaction I may have can only be the result of insecurity. 

Is it inherently insecure to not want a person who is willing to let their body be used by numerous strangers? At the very least I think I’m justified in thinking “ew”, and that doesn’t have to be because of my own insecurity.

","Election season is coming up, and my mostly conservative family who can't stop whining about how the 2020 election was stolen are ramping up their ""you need to vote for Trump,"" rhetoric. However, this doesn't make sense. 

If you truly believe that the 2020 election was compromised by the deep state/George Soros/the Democrats/whoever Alex Jones is blaming this week, in favor of Biden, then it doesn't make sense to even bother voting for Trump. 

Typically when I hear this argument, it follows that there are some sort of vague background characters acting under the eyes of the American public, pulling strings to subvert Trump. Why wouldn't this then occur again in 2024? If you truly believe that, then by the logic of your own worldview, Biden is guaranteed to win again, and you're wasting your time by even walking to the ballots on Election Day. 

I think the only way you could convince me otherwise, is by demonstrating that something about the election process has changed fundamentally for this upcoming election, that essentially limits/disables the unseen actors from performing the rigging again. However, I don't think you could reasonably even scrape that point together, because if anything, the circumstances would only be more against Trump for this upcoming election. In the last election, Trump was at the very least in charge of the Executive Branch. Now Biden and Kamala are in charge, meaning that the 'deep state democrats washington elite cabal' or whatever, have EVEN MORE of an upper hand in playing around with the votes. 

If Trump, while president, had the election unfairly taken away from him in 2020, because the elites rigged the election against him, then it stands to reason that the now only stronger elites would do this again, meaning there's literally no reason for anyone to go cast a vote for him.

Or racist. Arabs are fine. Islam is not. I hold all 3 religions in nearly equal contempt. However the other two are in the 21st century at least. There are a frightening number of radicals worldwide. The religion itself was built on conquest and spread by the sword. Muhammad was a pedophile. And Islam actually got better for awhile. Then I want to say around the 1700s/1800s you started having these different schools of thought. Then you had Sayyid Qutb come along in the early 1900s. He’s basically the father of modern day Islamism. Let me explain two different kinds of people. 

There is a difference between radicals and terrorists. A small minority are terrorists.

15-25% of all muslims are radical in their beliefs, meaning they believe one or a combination of the following:

1.	⁠Being gay should be illegal.
2.	⁠Honor killings are sometimes justified.
3.	⁠Apostates should be killed.
4.	⁠Terrorist attacks against civilian centers is sometimes justified.

Anyone who believes those things is a radical. Regardless if Islam teaches it or some government says it. In this specific case, 15-25% or more muslims believe some of these things. There are polls recently that show close to 90 percent of Gazans support Hamas. A majority supported October 7th. 93 percent of Palestinians oppose homosexuality. Close to 40 percent of young British Muslims believe apostates should be killed. I can go on and on. And that is why I believe Islam evil and a grave threat.

This isn't to say I hate cats, I really do love them. But allowing your cat outside, feeding feral cat colonies without TNR efforts, and refusing to spay/neuter your cats is causing immense harm to the environment.

1cis8r4,CMV: Standing in solidarity with Palestinians does not mean endorsing or supporting everything Palestinians believe in,"When I discuss with people here about Israel/Palestine issues, I will always get accused of supporting Hamas or condoning the Oct 7th attacks because many Palestinians do, but this is a line of reasoning I don't follow. When Nat Turner rebelled and killed more than 50 White people, abolitionists did not stop supporting abolition, in fact he is viewed quite favourably today by African Americans. Or when ANC bombed Church Street which killed 19 people and wounded 200 more, many South African Blacks saw that as justified yet it doesn't mean one should stop opposing the apartheid. Similarly, just because many Palestinians believe that the Oct 7th attacks are justified, it doesn't mean that I think they are justified and, more importantly, that I should stop supporting them in getting their right to self determination.  

The other accusation I get a lot is that I am homophobic to support the Palestinians, which is strange given that I am bisexual myself. Truth be told, when considering all matters in politics, I probably have more in common with the average Israeli than the average Palestinian, but the right to self-determination, the right to safety, and the right to basic necessities are not and should not be conditioned on someone having political beliefs that align with mine. If that is the case then I would not support most self-determination movements in the world because I am solidly on the left on most issues.

I think the converse is true as well, if someone is standing in solidarity with Israelis, I do not immediately assume that they support Bibi or the Israeli settlers (in fact odds are they don't). I am very well aware that someone can simply believe in Israel's right to self-defence without taking Bibi's actual political positions into account.

So I would like to hear why standing in solidarity with the Palestinians necessarily means that I endorse or support political positions that are mainstream amongst Palestinians.",WheatBerryPie,688,0.6700000166893005,1354,1714687498,2024-05-02 17:04:58,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cis8r4/cmv_standing_in_solidarity_with_palestinians_does/,5,2024

But how is this generalization attitude any different from police who profile black people? Or a TSA agent profiling someone with a turban?

1cmfr1l,CMV: Dropping birth rates isn't an actual problem. ,"I've seen more and more headlines and news outlets in the last year talking about how horrible it is more people aren't having babies. Everything from blaming selfish millennials to focusing on how our economy can't be sustained without more kids. 

I have so many problems with this. But the main is that it's such a waste of time to keep circling around ""we need more babies"" mind set for our economy. 

We have advanced technology, brilliant scientists, more knowledge at our fingertips than ever before. Why are we STILL so reliant on an economic model in which human population MUST grow or society will collapse one day? Really? No one can problem solve some and spearhead some solutions here? 

Not to mention, we can't just grow indefinitely. Truly, we can't. We've already wreaked havoc on the environment and our natural habitats. We're practically an invasive species. 

Less people in the future means less cars driving to pollute the air, less consumerism, less suburban sprawl to ruin beautiful land with strip malls and mcmansions. It'd also mean cheaper homes in better locations. 

Of course, there are issues with having less young people. The older generation needing to be taken care of seems to be the biggest fear I hear echoed, but again, there could be a solution for that. For example, actually PAYING nursing home workers better and providing benefits so more people flock to the field? Maybe we'll need less schools in the future if there are less kids. Funding and resources can be allocated to the elderly. I'm not even saying that's a great idea. I am not a brilliant scientist or someone with political power. But even stupid me can see that there are ways to problem solve some of the issues rather than blaming the younger generations and forcing women to give birth. 

I'm tired of hearing it talked about. Because at the end of the day, it's a mute point. Women have birth control (for now), and we have a sense of self and the right to choose. We aren't the generations of the past who had 10+ kids. And we probably never will be again. We have to move on and focus on new ways to live rather than trying to boom a population growth spurt when it simply will not happen.

I have a friend who spent years stocking shelves at a retail corporation with a degree in sport management. She went to grad school for a masters in accounting. She is now a CPA.

I just did a quick google search and it turns out this is the reality for millions of Americans.

1cm7v5h,CMV: There is no valid aviation-safety-related reason for airplane mode in modern airliners,"Airplane mode makes little difference to the navigation or communication capabilities of a modern airliner. First, the bands that a mobile phone tranmit on (800MHz upwards) do not overlap with the coms radio of airliners (100-300MHz for VHF and lower for HF). Second, they largely do not tranmit on the same bands as what’s used for navigation either, and either way ground based navaids are going the way of the dodo, and what’s left that’s commonly used is only ILS systems. One could argue that they may interfere with GPS since they both use GPS, but that’s neither here nor there or else GPS would break down in a slightly more crowded area.  

The simplest way to explain my point would be, if having mobile phones off airplane mode is so dangerous, then terrorists wouldn’t need to go to the trouble of bringing a bomb or some such, they merely need to turn on their $200 phone and that would be enough.  

Finally, to clarify, I am narrowing the scope of this to aviation safety related reasons. I don’t care if your phones might impact cell towers which might just happen to make an emergency call be delayed. And I don’t care if it’s because the law tells you to.

1cs557z,CMV: Disparity in any system is not automatically evidence of discriminatory practices,"This seems to be a common sentiment for a lot of people and I think it's a projection of their ideology, which is one not of equality, but equity.

For the purposes of this post I use the definition of equity as meaning ""Equal outcomes for all identity groups"". But that is not realistic or rational.

Equity is not natural and for companies/corporations for example, you can't expect the demography of the company to match the demography of the surrounding area, and for larger corporations it's especially unreasonable to expect the corporation as a whole to match the demography of the entire country. I'm talking about America, and in a place like America each state has different demography depending on the state and even the county.

But even so, you can't expect the demography of even a county to match every company in that county. People have different interests and capabilities for any number of reasons and that's normal and okay.

I don't think ironworkers are mostly men because they dedicate energy to discriminating against women. Same with construction workers. Or oil rig workers.

I don't think Kindergarten teachers are mostly women because they dedicate energy to discriminating against men. Same with nurses. Or secretaries.

I think this is just a natural reflection of the biological differences between males and females and our natural tendencies, aptitudes, and personality traits.

This could apply to ethnic groups as well, for any number of reasons. Sometimes those reasons seem arbitrary, and that's okay. But I think usually it's cultural.

In 2006, Joe Biden, remarked that ""you cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent"". I guess what he meant is that most people who own gas stations and convenience stores are Indian/Pakistani/etc. I seem to recall he made a similar statement during a political debate.

People bristle at comments like these, saying they're racial stereotypes. But they're true? The statistics back that up.

I hope the anti-AI crowd will forgive me, but I had this funny dialogue with ChatGPT just now. In asking about Biden's remarks, it says:

>This remark was widely criticized as being insensitive and perpetuating stereotypes about Indian-Americans. While the comment was specifically about Indian-Americans, it does touch upon a broader stereotype that certain immigrant groups are heavily represented in the ownership of convenience stores and gas stations.

But then I asked it, ""Which demographic group is dominant when it comes to ownership of convenience stores and gas stations?""

And the answer included:

>""...one prominent group is Indian-Americans, particularly those of Gujarati descent. This demographic has a substantial presence in the convenience store and gas station industry.  
>  
>Other demographic groups, including Arab-Americans, Korean-Americans, and Pakistani-Americans, also have a significant presence in the ownership of convenience stores and gas stations.""

So...reality is insensitive? This stereotype is bad? But the stereotypes are literally true according to the data.

Does this mean that the gas station ownership industry is discriminating against white men? I don't see any reason to think so. Why is it a bad thing that certain ethnic groups dominate the ownership of various businesses? Asian-Americans owning laundromats is another one that comes to mind.

My thought is, who cares? Why is this a bad thing? I just see it as another interesting quirk of living in a multicultural society. There are certain things attributed to various ethnic groups for various reasons and that's just part of the delightful tapestry of a diverse society.

The way I see it, it's okay that we have lopsided representation of various groups in various different fields. There are many different kinds of companies/hobbies/whatever, and they have many different kinds of work cultures, required aptitudes and personality types for the employees, and this results in sometimes unequal representation. And that's okay.

I could expand on the title of this CMV to relate to many other, more ""serious"" topics, but that would make this post much longer and much more complicated.

Anyway, a lot of people seem to disagree with the idea that disparity is not automatically evidence of discrimination. Why is that?

1d1adl1,cmv: The Electoral College should not be winner takes all for each state,"I've seen, over the years, plenty of arguments about the electoral college. Ranging from it being a hallmark of our country, a cornerstone that if changed would lead to everything falling, to being a cancerous stain upon what could otherwise be a democracy.

  
From where I stand, the biggest problem with the Electoral College is that each state is winner takes all. Look at Florida, for example. It is a state which, for the most part, is 50/50. A nail biter of counting, where nobody knows who will get all of the votes. Entire elections hinge upon such counting. And then other states, which are solidly blue or red....they don't matter. Because everyone knows which party is getting all of the votes. 

  
So, where do I stand? If you get 50% of the votes in a state, then you get 50% of the electoral votes. Odd numbers go to whomever get more. Florida, for example, has 125 electoral votes. In 2020 Trump got 51% of vote, meaning he got all 125 electoral votes. I argue that he should have gotten 63. 

  
By splitting it this way, every state becomes in play. Let's say democrats get 40% of the vote in Texas. Usually that would mean absolutely nothing, but now it means 40% of the electoral votes. The same for Republicans in say, California. This makes every state a battleground state, and every vote matters. Candidates can't ignore the vast majority of the country, and nobody would be able to shrug and say that their vote doesn't matter because of the state they live in. 

  
I honestly can't see any downside to this. But when I posted something similar in a different subreddit, I got downvoted with no replies, and that means that there are different points of views. So, I'm posting this here, as  I am willing to have my view changed on this.

Biden has also withheld military supplies and threatened to withhold more, as reported [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68980820), but not enough to actually stop the Rafah invasion from happening. 

To me, this is an attempt by him to appease both the pro-Israel and the pro-Palestine camps within the Democratic party, but I think he's failing at both. Pro-Israel folks will see this as a severe stepback from the unconditional support US has historically provided to Israel, while the Pro-Palestine folks will still see him as complicit in the genocide in Gaza as long as the Rafah invasion goes ahead, and the campus protests are unlikely to die out anytime soon. I think the most disastrous outcome for Biden is neither side doesn't feel like they can vote for him anymore in the election, handing Trump a victory. He should commit to one side, either back Israel unconditionally or withhold significantly more arms sales and aid so that America is no longer complicit in what's happening in Gaza.

I feel like people assign her the above moniker purely due to her early work, ignoring the fact that her later filmography has more misses than hits.

The argument is that committing suicide sounds like they're doing something wrong. Since you commit crimes and historically suicide, or attempts to do so were illegal.

But we don't just use ""commit"" as a crime. It's also just means to pledge, or just carry out. You commit resources. You commit to a relationship. You commit energy.

According to the majority of Muslims here, I should be punished. 23% believe I should be executed:

[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law) 

It's not just in numbers. I've faced discrimination by Muslims irl. I've seen Muslims I know, neighbors and classmates, say online gay people are ""sick"" and that Western women are trash. 

I'm from a Catholic third world country. An immigrant. In my country, where over 90% of the population is Catholic, I never faced discrimination. Just some stares. We recently legalized gay marriage. I consider myself Christian and I've never been treated differently by other Christian. So even though the Bible does have homophobic messages, most Christian don't hold those views.

However, most Muslims do hold those views. My friends in Belgium and France say it's worst there.  In these first world, Western countries Muslims already hold regressive views. In the Middle East, it's even worse. The regions with more support for sharia law are Palestine and Iraq, with over 90% of people there believing I should be executed.

Why should I care about Muslims then? This doesn't mean I want anything bad to happen to them. I don't support what's being done to innocent Palestinian children, but I also know their parents and relatives would almost 100% want me dead. What it's being done to them, they want to happen to me.

People around me say I should combat islamophobia. They want to me to advocate for Muslim women to be allowed to wear a veil in public spaces, they want me to believe Islam is the religion of peace. My classmates invited us to a mosque, to ""connect"" with that group, why should I go to a place where they want me dead? Why should I care if a mosque is not allowed to be, if Muslim men are not allowed to pray at work, when they want me dead? Why should I denounce islamophobia when Muslims would hand me over to executioners without a care in the world? As long as their physical wellbeing is intact, then I simply do not care

1cvfy5u,CMV: We should start moving to a point where it’s more widely taught that race doesn’t exist and only ethnicity does. ,"So the premise of my argument is that the mainstream concepts of race cause confusion and ultimately is the main contributor to bigotry. Because although you can still be bigoted towards someone based on their ethnicity / culture someone is still less likely to make assumptions about you based on your outwardly expressed genetic traits and be forced to talk to you first.

This also comes from a personal point of argumentation. So I am mixed, grew up in a predominantly black community, and ethnically I would say I’m “black”, but when asked what race I am I ussually default to just white or mixed as im pretty light with a looser curl pattern and colorful eyes. So now back to this ethnicity thing I have a problem that there is no better description or identifier for the culture that I am apart of other than black.

And then what about a black guy 2 generations suburbanized in a white community, or a white guy in a black community. Is the black guy white now and the white guy black?. What connects them to the other people of similar skin tones other than well, their skin tones. Like to us an Indian is an Indian or a “south Asian” but they don’t get it twisted they got Punjabi’s, Marathis, Gujaratis, Rajasthani and so on. And there are separate rate ethnic groups there that speak I was just naming the main ones.

Most of the world doesn’t have this problem and I think we should abandon this 1600s style way of looking at someone’s identity and heritage.

I don’t like Vivek Ramaswami but he made a good point after his talk with Anne coulter. I’m which he said regardless of his religion he was born in this country his parents assimilated and assimilated him into American culture and he is more American than many white Christian’s out there. In which he was basically saying he fits in better with upper white society than many white people.

I’m not saying to be colorblind but for logical conversation to be had about how unreliable someone’s features are for determining anything about their life or who they are.

Then my last point will be this, so the way it’s ussually classified in America is this, white, black, Asian, Arab, south/Central American, Native American. None of them give any nuance to the identity of that person and a majority of them are just geographic locations and a large chunk of the would gets left out.

1csag26,CMV: There is nothing wrong with female students helping a male teacher unbraid his hair,"If you haven’t seen the news recently JaQ Lee is a teacher that went viral for making a video with his female students helping him unbraid his hair. He only asked his students to help him unbraid his hair because he had a hair appointment after school that day and he wouldn’t be able to unbraid his hair in time if he waited until after school.

Prior to making this video he had already posted many videos of his students. It is very obvious that he loves his job and he loved his students. However recently he was fired for that video. Many people think it is inappropriate for him to have his female students unbraiding his hair even though it is obvious he had no ill intentions against his students. However I have to disagree.

It is a teachers job to build strong bonds with their students. A strong bond between a teacher and their student is the main way for a student to trust their teacher. A student who trusts their teacher is more likely to listen to that teacher when they teacher and is more likely to go to that teacher if they have any issues. It is obvious that this was just another way for him to bond with his students. 

Also it is just hair. People are acting as if the students were putting lotion on his back or cutting his toenails. The students were just helping him unbraid his hair what exactly is the harm behind that.

In the black community many of us don’t have strong male figures in our lives. When a male role model does enter our life we look up to them and admire them. Majority of his students are black. It is very possible that many of his students may not have a male role model in their life and because of the strong bond they have with their teacher they look up to him and admire him. Helping him unbraid his hair is a way for his students to bond with him and show their appreciation for him.

It is very possible that now since this teacher has been fired that the students in that classes grades will drop. They had a lot of trust and respect in Mr.Lee and it will be hard for a new teacher to gain these students trust and respect. The students may not listen in class anymore leading to their grades dropping. A lot of negative things could happen as a result to this school firing an amazing teacher.

1d3jdol,CMV: There is much subtext to the Israel - Hamas war.  But not everybody gets this.   Bad actors ON BOTH SIDES constantly shift between the specific and the general to muddy the waters and make progress difficult,"

I don't think anybody has covered themselves with glory, post 10/7. When Chuck Shumer publicly calls out Benjamin Netanyahu, on the floor of the United States Senate, then it is clear that Israel, under Netanyahus leadership, has gone off the rails. What happened after that? Chuck Shumer was called an 'anti-semite,' and Israel kept barreling down that path.

This is a lot of anger at Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, all of which he has earned, and which he hides behind the Israeli people to avoid, calling any and all criticism of his specific actions just general anti-semitism.

I also think people conflate the Palestinian people with Hamas.  Hamas, ostensibly, is the governing party in the Gaza strip, but Hamas, as an organization, derives from the Muslim brotherhood, is largely funded and fueled by non-Palestinian Arabs who are hiding among and behind the Palestians in Gaza, more than half of whom are under the age of 15.    The October 7 attack was not a legitimate piece of governance, but a specific attack on Israelis and and a continuation of the oppression of the Palestinians.

With specific regard to American protestors I think the fact that this is happening now, when the Shoah fades from living memory, and much history lies between us and World War II, is of interest. I would venture to guess that the majority of people protesting, and most of the younger ones, grew up in a relatively peaceful world with a strong Israeli nation, and don't have the historical context to understand the Jewish state: they may regard it as just another country, acting badly, and protest accordingly. This may, fairly, be regarded as a form of naivete. That is, at least, how I regard it. But there are two, small but vocal groups who have a propensity to hijack the narrative. The first is the amoral pugilist: they just love to fight and will employ whatever dirty tactics necessary to prevail. They will employ anti-semitic tropes to put people off balance and 'stir the pot.' The second is the true anti-semite, who see, in Israels present behavior, an excuse to let their hate flag fly. Both of these groups, I venture to say, take advantage of the naivete of the majority to push their anger and hate and derail any manner of constructive dialogue: call it the Yigal Amir veto, if you will. 

So it is valid criticisms of specific actions, by belligerents, (Netenyahu, et all, and Hamas)  that are then attacked as support for generalities: Pro-Palestianian is equated to Pro-Hamas, and criticisism of specific Israel action is termed generic anti-semitism.  All of this muddies the water and makes resolution of this so much more difficult, which is what the haters, on both sides, want.

1cneckr,CMV: Ghosts aren’t real and our cultural ideas about them make no sense anyways.,"I believe that ghosts are not a real thing, and that we have very good reasons to be certain that people aren’t really seeing them. A few things that make no sense about common reporting of ghost sightings are:

1.) The ghosts are clothed. But why? Did the dead person’s clothes also have a spirit that hung around lol?

2.) Ghost reportings are always of humans, dogs, cats, or some other animal people like. Where are all the ghost bugs, birds, armadillos, snakes, etc.? No one sees these, but there is no good reason why.

3.) A ghost is a spiritual being without a physical body. Our sense of sight works by photons of light literally bouncing off of the physical matter comprising an object and reflecting back into our eyes. If there was no physical matter (there isn’t in a spirit) then there would be nothing for the photons to reflect off of and you couldn’t see the object. Hence, a ghost wouldn’t be visible to human eyes and so people are not really seeing ghosts.

I believe that most claims of ghost sightings are just people either making stories up (which is why they are often very formulaic and informed by horror movie tropes) or people being mistaken (which is why the sightings mostly happen in the dark, late at night, when someone’s senses are at their least sharp).

I welcome any attempts to try to change my view and make a good case for why ghosts do exist and especially anyone who could explain why my 3 issues above shouldn’t be considered a real problem for those who claim to see ghosts.",Sonnyyellow90,266,0.7799999713897705,321,1715199620,2024-05-08 15:20:20,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cneckr/cmv_ghosts_arent_real_and_our_cultural_ideas/,5,2024

Let me explain what I mean by ""real human contact"". I mostly mean interactions with people you don't know and aren't in your social circle. Here's some examples of this kind of real contact that existed a while ago but are getting reduced. I'm not saying that there's no more human interaction at all and for most of these things the majority remain ""human based"". I'm just saying that there's a trend in this direction.

\* Supermarkets -> more and more cashiers replaced by self-checkout

\* Movie theatres -> more and more tickets being sold online or at self-checkout machines

\* Passport control -> often you go to the e-Gates and no longer interact with anyone

\* Airline check-in -> often done online and you can even drop off your bags without an operator in many places

\* Taxi drivers/Uber -> this is still years away but replacement with self-driving cars

\* Video stores/libraries -> replaced by streaming services and Amazon for books

Of course there's benefits and efficiency to self-checkouts and I'm the first to use them. I just feel like we're losing something by replacing people with automated processes, and it makes people feel less connected to their community or to other people.

1cyfuom,CMV: Requiring landlords to prove tenant damage is more fair than requiring tenants to prove their innocence,"At every apartment I've rented, the landlord can charge the tenant for any damage or uncleanliness that they find. They don't need to provide any evidence or proof that the tenant was responsible for the damage. In order for the tenant to *not* owe the landlord money for this, the tenant needs to have noticed the damage/uncleanliness within the first few days of moving in and reported it to the landlord.

I think this is unfair, because it is unrealistic for a tenant to notice every minuscule damage or uncleanliness within the first few days. For example, most people probably wouldn't immediately notice dust on top of the fridge, but a landlord could charge a tenant for leaving dust on top of the fridge. Many people wouldn't immediately notice a broken blind, but a landlord can charge for this. Most people wouldn't immediately notice a small dent or scratch on the side of an appliance, but a landlord can charge for this.

I think what's more fair is requiring the landlord to prove the previous condition of anything they want to charge for. If they want to charge for dust on top of the fridge, they need a picture showing there was no dust when the tenant moved in. If they want to charge for a broken blind, they need a picture showing that all the blinds are not broken, et cetera. 

This would not only protect tenants from shitty landlords, it would protect landlords from shitty tenants. For example, a tenant could report ""damaged blinds"" seeing that two of them were broken, and they could break 10 more and pretend the original report of ""damaged blinds"" was referring to 12 broken blinds rather than 2. 

Supposing that landlords are required to provide pictures/video proving previous condition - these must be date-verifiable so that the landlord cannot use pictures from previous tenancies.
