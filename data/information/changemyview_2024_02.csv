1azdt9d,CMV: Not cheating is extremely easy and anyone who cheats on their partner actively chose to do it.,"The idea that someone can “accidentally” cheat or that they “just made a stupid mistake” is completely asinine. If you cheat, you had to either purposefully approach another person to cheat with, put yourself in a situation where others would approach you, or be receptive to an unexpected approach. All of these are conscious choices that take more work to do than not to do, and the idea that any of them could be a “mistake” and not a purposeful action is stupid. Even if someone approaches you repeatedly while you are in a relationship, it is a choice not to authoritatively shut them down and continue to be in their presence regularly.

I would change my view if someone can give me a situation where cheating is not an active choice the cheater made and was instead a mistake anyone could have made given the circumstances.",Bagelman263,2409,0.9300000071525574,488,1708831385,2024-02-24 21:23:05,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1azdt9d/cmv_not_cheating_is_extremely_easy_and_anyone_who/,2,2024
1b34ir6,CMV: CEOS and executives should be forced to take paycuts and lose all bonuses before laying anyone off.,"With the sickening amount of layoffs this past year all while companies are reporting ""RECORD PROFITS"". It's clear to me that CEOs and other members of executive management should be required to take paycuts and loose out on all bonuses before they lay a single person off. It is absolutely insane that normal people are suffering while the CEOs get paid out in bonuses for laying people off and reporting these ""record"" profits.

1axovtd,CMV: For American Jews there is a de facto loyalty test to Israel to participate in vast majority Jewish spaces,"I'm an American Jew who was raised in the reform tradition. Been more and less connected to the broader Jewish community at various points in my life. As a grow older with a son of my own I would love to be more connected to the Jewish community, but I'm really turned off by the intense social pressure to uncritically support Israel. 

I don't agree with Israeli government policies both around Palestinians and the fact that Netanyahu is extremely right wing on many other issues as well. As a public school teacher my school is facing budget cuts because the government has ""no money"" but is sending Israel millions and millions of dollars every day. 

Besides that I'm an American citizen, I fail to see why my Jewishness should be contingent on my loyalty to a foreign country.  

When I go to mainstream Jewish spaces I feel intense social pressure to keep my mouth shut. If I were honest about my views I feel I would be ostracized. Mainstream Jewish groups like the Anti-Defamation League have called Jews who dare to criticize Israel as ""self-hating""

I try to imagine this situation in any other ethnic group. Just imagining Chinese-Americans being called ""self-hating"" for not supporting the CCP. That would be insane. So why does it happen to Jews?

It was Hitler's viewpoint that Jews were secretly loyal to a foreign government. It's wild to me that mainstream American Jewish organizations have come around to essentially the same view - American Jews must support Israel or they are ""bad Jews.""

Anyway, I'm sad about what is going on Gaza - but also sad because I want to raise my child within the Jewish community and feel very disconnected right now. 

What would change my view: examples of large, mainstream Jewish organizations or communities which accept Jews who criticize Israel

What would not change my view: you should support Israel, you are a bad Jew. That would just prove me right.

1aqz3a1,"CMV: The gun problem in America is too far gone, and there is no viable solution. The shootings will continue to happen forever.","I live in America. I own 1 gun for protection, and if I had to give it up tomorrow due to an outright gun ban, I wouldn't give a shit. Ignoring the fact that the US government would never in a million years even attempt this in the first place, even if they did, there are millions of unregistered guns that would just stay in the owner's possession and we'd never know.

Then you end up in a situation where all the registered gun owners have now given up their guns, but also know that most of the people they wanted to protect themselves from are still in possession of their unregistered guns, so the now gunless people will just find a gun via illegal means, and just keep it hidden at home. Millions of people will wanna do this, and now there is just a much larger black market for guns, and anyone can get one if they really want one (which they will) and we will be back where we started, where everyone still has a gun that wanted one in the first place.

I also think ""fixing the mental health crisis"" is maybe even a more impossible task. That relies on these people willingly getting help for their problems, which completely flies in the face of the macho ""suck it up or i'll give you something to cry about"" culture that every male has instilled in them growing up, and many have not grown out of as an adult. 

I really see no solution to this, and even if there was one, I think we have too many lunatics that would rather let the problem continue than give up their guns, which is absolutely insane to me.",drippyneon,1212,0.7300000190734863,3111,1707948049,2024-02-14 16:00:49,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aqz3a1/cmv_the_gun_problem_in_america_is_too_far_gone/,2,2024
1ajmref,CMV: Jay-Z made a fool of himself at the Grammy Awards,"The Grammy Awards aired last night and of all the great moments, Jay-Z gave a speech where he implied disrespect to his wife and hip-hop.

The unspoken part is maybe a bit of bias and racism? Also a little bit of targeting at the sensation known as Taylor Swift?

A little bit of verbal activism and righteousness without much a bite in my opinion.

Beyonce has won 32 Grammy Awards. She is the all-time winner in the history of music. In terms of the Grammy Awards and subjectiness of art... She is considered the all-time best.

Several black artists have won the top prize over the years, including pure hip-hop like OutKast.

In terms of hip-hop being disrespected, didn't they dedicate last year's show to the history of hip-hop? I believe that Questlove produced it, and 20+ acts performed.

The telecast is the telecast, but the Grammys is genre based. They still have to give awards to the best Americana and Polka albums at some point, too. It can't all be a tribute to Beyonce.

You still need time to acknowledge what artists like Billie Elish are doing as well. Pure pop music was absolutely gigantic this year.

All genres of music are represented.

1aoh83p,"CMV: Loli AND shota, although not illegal is still CP and I think you should try to get help if you like the category.","Alright, I know I'm on Reddit (home of the neckbeards) but in my defense, I am actually trying to get my view changed. If this discussion was already had please redirect me and I'll take this post down.

 look. I never understood why loli-cons just could not admit this. I don't think they should be arrested as YES it IS a drawing. This isn't hurting REAL children and I don't think they should be shamed for liking it. HOWEVER, loli/shota are still children. 

I thought this was common knowledge. That is the literal appeal. the fact that they look + act, and sometimes are children. (especially in Shotacon where they don't even use the 9000 yr old child excuse.), However, when I see people defending it, it is always trying to someone claim that either they are a child or it isn't a weird kink. both arguments I do not agree with. 

they are CLEARLY a child or at least trying to portray a child and are attracted to children, fictional, anime, cartoons, dolls. is WEIRD. 

I don't think these people are going to go out and hurt real children or look for real cp.  

and I do believe this regardless of the kink, but this is one where age or children are involved.  So I definitely think these people SHOULD try to get help. even if it is to just learn the reason being their kink so they're certain that they arent attracted to actual children.

1amad3o,"CMV: We can throw billions of dollars at public schools all we want, but until parents care more about their children’s academic performance nothing will change","We can’t spend our way out of it. We’ve tried. Look at the NYC public school system. We’ve shoveled dump trucks worth of money into their pockets and, while seeing some *marginal* improvements among some elements of the student body, have gotten nothing for it beyond more debt. America can’t wipe our asses for us, it’s not our mommy/daddy and we need to take responsibility for our lives and the lives of our children. And that means buckling down and making sure your kid is studying, doing their homework, **going to class** and in general giving two shits about their academic performance. No amount of money from the nanny state can fix that. Unfortunately, this problem is so deep and widely rooted I don’t know how the government *can* fix it.

In addition, the racial climate in America right now is just not conducive to discussions on a child’s poor performance. 69% of urban public schoolteachers in the United States are white. Using the New York state example, [https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/12/10/americas-public-school-teachers-are-far-less-racially-and-ethnically-diverse-than-their-students/ft_21-11-17_studentteacherrace_3/] (black and latino students are more then 40% more likely to have a white public-school teacher then one more congruent to their skin color (though how this takes into effect mixed race schoolteachers and mixed-race students I have no clue.). To be clear, I’d rather slam my hand in a door then get between *any* parent and their child. But it gets even harder when you’re a blonde, white woman telling a black parent/parents “hey x kid is a real shithead in class and doesn’t work hard, study, or in general attend.” without immediately losing the parents or at the very least, raising severely their hackles.

Parents are already extremely defensive about their children and then if you add the ugly history of race relations in America on top of it? Not a conducive environment for early interventions in troubled students lives. It’s the sad truth but you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. If the kid don’t care about reading, writing, or education in general you can’t force them to care. It has to come from the parent or guardian. And even then some people are happy to do the bare minimum required until they become magically rich via lotto ticket or until they die and when they have kids they pass the same values onto them, not explicitly obviously but via example.",nowlan101,851,0.8100000023841858,629,1707437052,2024-02-08 18:04:12,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1amad3o/cmv_we_can_throw_billions_of_dollars_at_public/,2,2024
1aj04n2,"CMV: The USA's foreign policy is not to promote democracy, but to secure its own economic interest","A common thing that I keep hearing Americans say is that ""The USA is the great promoter of democracy"" or something along those lines. It usually assumes that democracy is more moral than authoritarianism (which I agree with to a certain extant), therefore the USA's foreign policy is broadly moral.

But that's just not true.

America allies with undemocratic states all the time, most notably Egypt and Saudi Arabia today, but also in the past. South Korea and Taiwan were dictatorships until 1987. Pakistan has shifted between democracy and military rule numerous times. The USA has often directly propped up dictators in other places as well like South Vietnam and Indonesia to secure their economic interests. Sometimes they even toppled governments that were elected democratically or were in favour of democracy, like in Iran and countless times in Latin America.

This pattern in foreign policy cannot be explained by the USA's willingness to protect democracy, but its willingness to secure its own economic interest. Egypt controls the Suez Canal and Saudi Arabia controls the oil. The USA must work with these authoritarian countries to ensure control over its own economic interests. 

Can someone please explain to me how so many Americans believe that the USA is the bastion of democracy? I would love to hear from you to change my mind.",WheatBerryPie,754,0.8299999833106995,437,1707084721,2024-02-04 16:12:01,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aj04n2/cmv_the_usas_foreign_policy_is_not_to_promote/,2,2024

1ano790,CMV: Someone should leak “Coyote vs Acme” on the internet,"Warner Bros Discovery produced a Looney Tunes “Coyote vs Acme” film, produced by James Gunn and starring John Cena. In test screenings, the reactions were overwhelmingly positive by the audience. 

But WBD CEO David Zaslav decided that it would be better to never release the film for the company to get a tax off in its earnings. The movie is already finished and it’s just there, getting dust. 

My view: WBD doesn’t want to release the film themselves nor sell it to other studios. With that, it would be perfectly ok (although illegal) for someone to leak the film on the internet, just like they did with “Scooby and Krypto”, a movie that would have had the same fate if not for a leak. 

What would change my view: arguments that don’t revolve around the illegality of leaking and arguments that don’t revolve around “the film is WBD’s property and they should do what they want”.

1apxvv3,CMV: Abortion pills should be as accessible as a can of tuna at Walmart,"Abortion should be as accessible as a can of tuna because it's a fundamental aspect of reproductive healthcare. Easy access ensures timely interventions, reducing risks to women's health and well-being. Restricting access disproportionately affects marginalized communities, exacerbating inequalities. Accessibility respects bodily autonomy, empowering individuals to make informed choices about their lives. It promotes safer procedures, minimizing the need for dangerous alternatives. Ultimately, it upholds human rights by affirming individuals' control over their bodies and futures.

1az7dqj,"CMV: Trump'ism didn't manifest out of nowhere. The American people were conditioned, and ready to receive it.","I often hear talking heads trying to figure out the rise of Donald Trump, or try to explain his phenomenon. As if he simply arrived and corrupted everyone… a sweet innocent public.

My post is probably going to sound like a screed from the John Birch Society, but I have a lot of loose thoughts here.

There was a meanness and sickness to the culture at times, that we simply might have forgotten.

As someone who has followed politics, I can't stress how wild and nutty the Obama v. McCain election cycle was. Those McCain/Palin rallies were full of unhinged and crazy people. It's true that McCain was a relatively measured man, but the lines of people outside his rallies were pretty much the same MAGA people without the label yet. They were the eventual “tea party” people. I've never believed the myth that rank & file MAGA loyalists were non-political and simply got woke up in 2016.

It's the same usual suspects. They have just put their former campaign accouterments in storage.

There was a nastiness in popular culture for a while. 

All those daytime talk shows like Jerry Springer were common on all the networks. Go back and watch clips of these shows. Audience members take the microphone and call people on a panel, “BIG FAT SLUTTY PIGS!” to the roar of the crowd.

I was a massive Howard Stern radio show fan. An era where he would get disabled people to fight with the Klu Klux Klan, or openly use the “n-word” on terrestrial radio. Trump was a frequent guest.

There were just a lot of sleazy things that wouldn't be around today. A popular television commercial was for “Bum Fights,” a mail order VHS where someone got homeless people to attack each other.

Never mind Tucker going to Russia. Late '90s and early 2000s political media was horrendous. Anyone remember MSNBC's Michael Savage? He was telling people to get AIDS on TV.

This was the tone of the media. Bush v. Kerry was a wild and crazy election cycle, too. I remember Zell Miller challenging Chris Mathews to a duel on live television, or Ann Coulter calling Al Gore a ""f*g"" on TV, without much notice in pre-Twitter world.

Trump comes from celebrity popular culture. My first board game as a child was a Donald Trump one. He comes from this world.

He was a character. Comedy Central did a celebrity roast for him right before he became a candidate. They've never re-aired it, and simply pretend it never existed. Most of the jokes were about how he could grab any “pussy” he wanted because he was rich.

Trump was a long-planted seed that finally produced fruit. I've known that some populist crazy celebrity was going to eventually arrive. WWF wrestlers were becoming Governor in Minnesota.

I can't feign my poor virgin Puritan eyes and ears weren't ready for Trump, and it shocked me.

The American people were ready for it. Enough of them wanted it. We had been conditioned for it.",DougieSlug,708,0.8399999737739563,265,1708813690,2024-02-24 16:28:10,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1az7dqj/cmv_trumpism_didnt_manifest_out_of_nowhere_the/,2,2024
1arpifv,CMV: Leaving NATO would be one of the worst foreign policy decisions a President could make,"In case you haven't seen it, Reddit's favorite President, Donald John Trump, has been teasing the US stepping back from NATO, [telling his aids he's considering withdrawing America from the alliance](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html). It seems that MAGA conservatives and left-wing radicals alike are open to isolating the US from our NATO allies, which I think would be a generationally awful foreign policy blunder, ultimately resulting in bloody war in Europe. 

While this may have been a different discussion in early 2020, Putin has now made his imperial ambitions and willingness to wage war clear. His invasion of the sovereign state of Ukraine was an unprecedented violation of all the laws and norms of war Europe established after World War 2. Putin has made his ambition to recapture other former Soviet Republics clear, and it seems self-evident that the only thing stopping Putin from eventually invading NATO allies is his fear of triggering NATO's Article 5 and falling into a war with the United States.

While other NATO members have their own armies, they suck. [All other NATO allies combined have a smaller fighting force than Russia or the US](https://www.statista.com/statistics/584286/number-of-military-personnel-in-nato-countries/), and their technology and training are generally regarded as woefully inadequate. Turkey is the only other NATO ally with a decent army, but they're also the most unreliable in the alliance (along with Hungary). Without the guarantee of US mutual defense, I don't think that the threat of European NATO allies alone would be enough to deter further Russian expansion once they finish the war in Ukraine, and have the time to rebuild their army.

1b2o53w,CMV: it is impossible to ethically accumulate and deserve over a billion dollars,"Alright, so my last post was poorly worded and I got flamed (rightly so) for my verbiage. So I’ll try to be as specific in my definitions as possible in this one.

I personally believe that someone would hypothetically deserve a billion dollars if they 1. worked extremely hard and 2. personally had a SUBSTANTIAL positive impact on the world due to their work. The positive impact must be substantial to outweigh the inherent harm and selfishness of hoarding more wealth than one could ever spend, while millions of people starve and live in undignified conditions.

Nowadays there are so many billionaires that we forget just what an obscene amount of money that is. Benjamin Franklin’s personal inventions and works made the world a better place and he became rich because of it. Online sources say he was one of the 5 richest men in the country and his lifetime wealth was around $10mil-$50mil. I would say he deserved that wealth because of the beneficial material impact his work had on the people around him. Today there are around 3-4 thousand billionaires in the world, and none of them have had a substantial enough positive impact to deserve it.

Today, there are many people working hard on lifesaving inventions around the world. However, these people will likely never make billions. If the research department of a huge pharma company comes up with a revolutionary cancer treatment, the only billionaires who will come out of it are the owners and executives. If someone single-handedly cured cancer, and made a billion from it, I would say that is ethical and deserved. But that is a practical impossibility in the world today. Money flows up to those who are already ultra-rich, and who had little to do with the actual achievement, in almost all cases.

On entertainment: there are many athletes, musicians, and other entertainers who have amassed billions. I recognize that entertainment is valuable and I do think they deserve to be rich, but not billionaires. That’s just too much money and not enough impact.

Top athletes are very talented, hardworking, and bring a lot of joy to their fans. I don’t think they bring enough joy to justify owning a billion dollars. If Messi single-handedly cured depression in Argentina, I’d say he deserves a billion. There’s nothing you can do with a sports ball that ethically accumulates that much money.

Yes, a lot of that money comes from adoring fans who willingly spend their money to buy tickets and merch. Michael Jordan has made over $6 billion in royalties from Nike. But I would argue that there is little ethical value in selling branded apparel or generating revenue based on one’s persona or likeness. It’s not unethical, but it doesn’t change the world for the better. MJ deserves to be rich but doesn’t deserve billions. I’m open to debate on this.

My general point here is that if you look at any list of billionaires, the vast majority are at the top of massive companies and profit directly or indirectly off of the labor of others. You could say that’s just how to world works but that doesn’t mean it’s right. I don’t think there is any person who has individually contributed enough to the betterment of the world in their lifetime and has also amassed a billion dollars. I am open to any particular billionaires and their work that might change my mind. I also should say that this is a strongly held belief of mine so I would be hard pressed to offer deltas but I absolutely will if someone provides an example of one person who has made a billion that deserves it.",champagne_papaya,687,0.7200000286102295,945,1709171094,2024-02-28 19:44:54,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b2o53w/cmv_it_is_impossible_to_ethically_accumulate_and/,2,2024
1avs3ma,CMV: All police officers in the United States should be required to get a Bachelor's in Criminal Justice,"Hello! Long time lurker on this subreddit.

I am a current Criminal Justice student and I interact with a lot of police content, both from the pro and anti side. I've seen enough horrible things to fully support police reform in this country, especially in rural departments that still operate like it's 1960.

The view that I hold is that 6-8 weeks of training is NOT enough for law enforcement officers, period. This is my second semester and we are barley scratching the surface. We spent an entire week on Search and Seizure case law and that was just the intro class, there is way more to learn in Constitutional Law and Legal Ethics.

The concepts we're just starting to get into this semester are very complicated and nuanced and require vast amounts of context to fully understand. I can't fathom how a police officer can learn enough at the academy when most of the training hours are spent on tactics and police operations.

Is eight weeks enough time to learn how tactics, firearms, and operations? Yes!

1arqgnj,Cmv: People of colour absolutely can be racist,"The notion that black people and POC can’t be racist has become more prevalent in the last few years, usually explained by saying that racism is a system of oppression and because white people have not been traditionally systematically oppressed, they cannot be subject to racism.

My issue with this is that I believe people are mistaking racism with systematic oppression.

Racism as a word, to me at least  simply means prejudice based on race. Any prejudice that is based on someones race or ethnic background is an example of racism.

Systematic racism is a form of oppression based on racial characteristics, and it’s true that white people have rarely been held under these systems.

So the mistake people make is claiming that POC can’t be racist full stop, which is untrue, and actually a racist claim in itself. 

If somebody dislikes white people based on the colour of their skin or the acts of their ancestors that is racism in its rawest form, just like any other.",serialrimmer,606,0.7400000095367432,1211,1708031776,2024-02-15 15:16:16,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1arqgnj/cmv_people_of_colour_absolutely_can_be_racist/,2,2024
1ahyd7d,CMV: The sentence of Bryn Spejcher for stabbing her boyfriend to death was ridiculous.,"I'm refering to the California woman who stabbed her boyfriend 108 times after consuming cannabis and only sentenced last month to 100 days of community service.

This case reminds me of Sarah Halimi's one in France where an elderly lady got thrown off a window by a man who had just taken cannabis before his rampage and was considered not criminally responsible penally.

Although, contrarily to that other murder I do think that Bryn was indeed in a serious state of psychosis as she not only stabbed her boyfriend but her dog, and herself. And when the police intervened, even taser and baton strikes were not very effective at stopping her.

That being said I do believe that the sentence she received was highly problematic (way too low) for these 4 reasons:

* Even if marijuana frenzies can potentially happen on rare occasions, I just don't believe a mentally stable person could reach such violence with only marijuana. This led me to believe that she either consumed other additional substances or that she has some sort of mental instability that can lead her to become violent in some instances. And if that second hypothesis is true, then she needs psychiatric treatment (which was the decision for Sarah Halimi's murderer)
* Maybe the most important of my 4 points: Her not being aware during the killing doesn't mean she isn't responsible for it. The fact that she willingly decided to take psychotropic drugs that could potentially cloud her judgment meant she was responsible for putting herself in that state. Correct me if I'm wrong but if a person after consuming alcohol becomes violent a attacks others, he will be convicted. Removing all responsibility for marijuana sounds like encouragement for murderers to use this excuse and be cleared of charges.
* Receiving only 100 days of community service after brutally killing someone is shameful and a total disrespect for the deceased and his family. It just isn't right.
* Let's not fool ourselves, she only got this miraculous judgment because she was an upper-class white woman. If it was a man, poor or of color that sentencing would have been different.

And for these 4 reasons are believe that Bryn judgment was not only unfair but dangerous.",vuzz33,544,0.8299999833106995,621,1706973492,2024-02-03 09:18:12,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ahyd7d/cmv_the_sentence_of_bryn_spejcher_for_stabbing/,2,2024
1awisda,CMV: An airborne strain of Rabies is the most terrifying (and realistic) pandemic scenario imaginable,"Rabies has a 100% lethality rate. It also has an extremely wide window of transmission, as it sometimes takes several weeks for symptoms to begin showing. An entire state or small country could become infected without anyone noticing it was spreading. Once those symptoms begin, there is no cure, It makes your brain swell giving you hemmorhages and severe constant headaches until it kills you. During that wait for inevitable death you get Paranoia, delusions,hallucinations, and an inability to drink water due to a heightened gag response.

There is a very effective vaccine. But millions would still die. And unlike covid, the government would actually have to go door to door FORCING people to take it. The consequences of vaccine denialists would be too great not to. This could actually lead to the collapse of civilization if totalitarian measures are not put in place

1aktlq9,CMV: talking about politics early in a relationship (even on the first date) is healthy and shouldn't be frowned upon especially in the United states,"I was inspired to post this here after reading an article in late 2022 early 2023 after the Supreme Court decision that overturned the federal constitutional right to abortion (the Dobbs decision) that overturned roe v wade. 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/29/relationships-post-roe/&ved=2ahUKEwif6JzHkZiEAxXsm4kEHQ-1AmQ4ChDF9AEoAHoECAsQAg&usg=AOvVaw1d0y_ODgBmhuXN63xJR_KK

It says that more and more couples are reevaluating their long term relationships with their partners or spouses over the controversial dobbs decision in June of 2022. Many hadn't had that conversation with their partners or considered their partners postions at all. In the article it states how many are asking new partners or dates how they feel about it early on to see if they would be on the same page or if they should end the relationship before it gets more serious.

Now that got me thinking. I believe that it's extremely healthy for dates and new couples to talk extensively about politics in the beginning of relationships. When you think of it politics controls alot of out lives whether its a supreme court decision like dobbs or roe or a local issue like the town council expanding a local park both those issues involve politics. So how does not talking about politics early in a relationship not benefit people really by seeing if a potential spouse and you have the same values in life. Even ben Shapiro agrees with this 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dr1cK1WoL2HE&ved=2ahUKEwi59cuplpiEAxU_jYkEHc4ZBzIQFnoECBkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2QWbRsuE0M6ksLhrHZza3O

Now many will say politics doesn't equal values and that you shouldn't limit yourself or not want to date people bases on their political opinions. A famous couple who are in a relationship like that are democratic strategist James Carville and his wife republican strategist Mary matalin make it work (despite her joining the libertarian party with the rise of trump). I argue relationships like that came to be in an Era when Americans weren't ""political"" in a sense but since 2016 America has become a very political nation like European counties. Which can be shown with this study from the United Kingdom 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/dating-relationships-tory-politics-b2095705.html&ved=2ahUKEwjNkr78pZiEAxXsjIkEHXkgDkcQFnoECBQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0Q6gE6zFYeFPiTgHYYsdoN

So I think debating and learning someone's politics early in a relationship is a healthy thing to do. Why would I want to invest time and energy in a relationship with someone whom I don't share my values (this is especially true if your non religious) why would I want to buy a house with someone who doesn't think climate change is real and wants to buy a beach house because nothing will happen. Why would I want to date someone who treats a homeless person with disdain if I value empathy and especially with bodily autonomy why would a woman want to date a man who doesn't value her bodily autonomy and why should I who might value euthanasia and ""pulling the plug"" want to date someone who doesn't belive in that either. Americans have (albeit an increasingly less) interest or stomach for giving their political opinions in public especially in the dating world and I think that in order to not waste either parties time that should and need to change.",SnooPeripherals2455,511,0.8199999928474426,510,1707277436,2024-02-06 21:43:56,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aktlq9/cmv_talking_about_politics_early_in_a/,2,2024

Men commit close to 80% of violent crimes. The issue is that it’s not 80% or men committing these crimes. It’s not like every male victim of a violent crime deserves it. It’s is extremely relevant that men are more likely to be victims of violent crimes than women. This narrative that men don’t have fear and never have to be cautious in life just doesn’t make any sense. & if someone says “well men are also victims of most of these crimes” saying “well men are committing them as well” just doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.

1apr98a,"CMV: ""not all men"" is the socially righteous position to take","Statistics help show many facts as best as census data provides.

Some of these statistics show that in some places Islamic people are more likely to advocate Sharia. However, if you use these statistics to make generalisations about Islamic people that would be racist and inappropriate, because even a statistical majority does not mean that all Islamic people are that way. This kind of bigotry should be called out.

The same is true when people use statistics to say that black people are more likely to be criminals, or in gangs, and so on.

However ""men"" as a subgroup seems to be an exception. I think it's common to see people argue that it's obvious they aren't talking about all men, or that they are talking about all men because the good ones don't do enough. This is in discourse around gender based violence, where the statistics show that men are responsible for the majority of rapes, sexual assaults etc.

However, basing your view on men as a group on statistics is as flawed as basing your opinion of Muslims, blacks, and anyone else on statistics. It's by definition prejudice, and shoobe called out.

When you highlight that not all black people are criminals and that you shouldn't assume that from their race it is  socially just. The same goes for calling out prejudice against men based on statistics.

There's also a racial aspect to this. With the naacp launching a lawsuit against one school district who kept passing a student, all the way through getting a diploma, while the student was functionally illiterate. The case claimed his civil rights were denied because he was not given an education.

https://edsource.org/2022/the-right-to-read-it-took-a-lawsuit-against-california/678069

Worth noting, students in predominantly white districts are often held to very different standards in the same state. Certain behaviors are tolerated and worse yet, actually getting worse grades is considered passing. This creates two tiers of an education system that's also based on race to a degree. 

But it gets worse. Because these students then come out of high school knowing less, but they go on to college, often going into debt, and then they quit after realizing they're nowhere near the level which it takes to pass a college level course. This sets up these students for even worse prospects in life. Worth noting, this is also why California quietly ended affirmative action admissions years ago  at many state universities. It was having negative repercussions for students of color. 

https://www.npr.org/2023/06/30/1185226895/heres-what-happened-when-affirmative-action-ended-at-california-public-colleges

Students who have learning disabilities or need special help can also request it in this system. It's called an IEP and this allows for accommodations for their disability. So a student can get extra time, or individual tutoring should they fall behind. If they really want to, they're going to pass. 

And this isn't even touching on the grade inflation we've seen on the last couple decades. C level work is now considered A level. Curriculums have been dumbed down to the point where showing up and doing the bare minimum is enough. Well, fsr less than the bare minimum. The numbers themselves are pretty shocking. Whereas it's common for predominantly white school districts to have around 85% on grade level, in many cities across the us this drops to just 25% of black students in cities like Philadelphia and Cleveland. 

https://www.realcleareducation.com/articles/2022/11/24/large_racial_reading_and_math_performance_gaps_persist_as_children_age_110794.html

The answer isn't to continue to just pass everyone with a heartbeat, but have actual repercussions for students. Of course some accommodations should be made and in some instances students should be able to retake certain tests, but overall as it currently stands, there's not much a school will do to a student who is far below grade level, and also having multiple absences.

1armn1r,Cmv: Kids are disrespectful toward the school system because it's disrespectful toward them.,"When I was in school I remember clearly, the overarching message coming from the teachers, staff, the entire school system in general was this: ""We don't care how you feel, we don't care what you think, you're here to do what we tell you to. If you don't do what we want, you're worthless to us."" 

Students who did poorly were often singled out and mentioned by name as examples of what not to be. Students who obviously came from neglectful homes were given no extra help or leniency, they were just treated as failures when they were clearly suffering and not allowed basic hygiene at home. How can you expect someone to get their work done when they don't even have a clean table at home? The students who were treated fairly were the ones who lived in the same subdivisions as the teachers, the ones who live in the neighborhood and who's parents hang out with the teachers as friends. 

There was a clear rift, if you could afford to live in the middle class subdivisions you were worth something and the teachers treated you like a person, if you couldn't afford to live there you were treated with disrespect. Poor kids were seen as a bad influence on the middle class subdivisioners, and so didn't deserve respect. They were always bad right from the start to the teachers. 

There were times I walked up to the teacher to ask for help, and they would stop and make me go away when one of their preferred students would come ask for help, or sometimes refuse to help at all. 

When I see teachers talk about problem students online they don't talk about the factors that cause them, and chock it up to ""lack of discipline.""

The meat industry has a huge impact on global warming, it takes up massive amounts of land, and most animals live and die in horribly cruel circumstances. I am not innocent of buying meat from the grocery store, but I only eat meat about once every two weeks and try to treat it like a luxury instead of an every day food.  

I mean, even from an animal rights standpoint, what is better? an animal living its life in nature, with plenty of land to roam, or stuck in a tiny poo covered pen and only fed corn? It reminds me of that Parks and Rec episode where Ron brings a pig to slaughter for a family BBQ. There was gonna be a dead pig either way, slaughtering it in front of you only reminds you that at one point it was a live animal.

Here is the link if you haven't see it before. It's not necessary to watch it to respond though.


https://youtu.be/m4Z_fNDq_Pc?si=ryV4z7PPu35dbBdy


It's almost like Neil expected an ""obviously no I wouldn't"" and was surprise that that wasn't the answer.

Honestly it's a bit ridiculous that not only was he expecting the answer to be no but also was surprised by the possibility of the answer being yes.

Like yes Neil, some people don't like the idea of being dead. That's surprising to you?

If anything it should be the more expected position for the average person until they say otherwise.

Anyways, I'm full on board with Larry here. Rip to him he died a while ago btw. I, like him, can't stand the idea of not being alive.

But I want to adress Neil's argument more here.

He says that the absence of death means a lack of urgency and why would you even get out of bed because there's always tomorrow.

I believe this is a dumb argument. If I lived forever I would maybe stay for longer in bed. But that means because I have more time I can relax more which is not a bad thing at all.

I don't think Neil would say this is a bad thing which means it's more likely he meant you would have people stay in bed for... ever?

Like never get out of bed? Spend all day eating popcorn and watching TV?

Ummm no Neil, people would still want to improve their lives today rather than tomorrow.

But perhaps it would be this year rather than next.

Like sure it would he easier to put things off but that doesn't mean I still wouldn't want to get things done. 

Besides if I do more per day with a finite life, that doesn't mean a finite life is going to make you do more.

An infinite life you could still do more if you work only 10% as hard, which again I'm not suggesting people will do.

So why the hell is a finite life better?

Infacy with a finite life your appreciation of your accomplishments will come to an end when your life is over.

1agdy9r,CMV: Humans are inherently cooperative and egalitarian versus the violent and selfish brutes that modern civilization has made us out to be.,"Buckle up - this is going to be a long one.

I know this might seem counterintuitive to what is being observed in modern day societies. We have murder, rape, wars, genocide, slavery, hate crimes, and large disparities between classes of people. There’s so many examples of people hoarding resources from needy underserved populations. There’s many examples of corporate greed in which they know they’re poisoning the world (see: forever chemicals such as PFO/PFAs pushed by companies like DuPont and 3M that’s now in everyone - and I do mean everyone’s - blood streams) but fail to act because it would hurt their shareholders bottom line. 

Personally, I am a professional ecologist who works in the private sector in America and knows first hand how governments write and re-write laws to help bolster business profits at the expense of the environment. I am not naive to the throes of how every major system (social/racial/environmental) is basically fucked and in need of a major upheaval to get things back on track - if they were ever on track in the first place.

All of this can be chalked up to greed of the few at the expense of the many. This greed seems to trickle down to the everyday person because if you’re not looking out for number one you’ll get left behind in the poisonous dust, polluted air, and contaminated drinking water. You’ll be poor, uneducated, and forever stuck in the cycle of being exploited for what little you do have by those who want it all.

However, I am currently in the process of writing a book about how f*cked humans are, how we got here, and what we can do about it. Through my interdisciplinary research I have discovered surprising theories contrary to what is obviously happening to us all. Which has changed my pessimistic POV of what being human really means.

Richard Dawkins might be the proponent of the trickle up theory of how our genes are selfish which equates to us as humans being selfish but I have come to the conclusion that he is ultimately short sighted in his argument.

To begin let’s get some dates straight - humans (Homo sapien sapien) first appeared 200,000 years ago. The beginning of modern civilization was only birthed 10,000 years ago with advent of agriculture (the Neolithic Revolution) which changed the way humans lived from migratory hunter-gathering to a more sedentary lifestyle. The sedentary life style that agriculture required is what has done us in, not our biology.

We are taught that our selfish brutish behaviors are inherent to our biology because if we just look to our closest ancestors - the chimpanzee - we will see that they too are violent creatures that live in cyclical harmony but are fraught with war, infanticide, resource hoarding, and rape. We share 98% of our DNA with them, so this must be true. But what is frequently over looked is that the chimpanzee is not our only closest relative there are also the bonobos. 

Bonobos also share 98% of our DNA and they are free of war, rape, infanticide, and resource hoarding. They’re cooperative, have sex for pleasure and conflict resolution, and are matriarchal. Historically, pre-agriculture, we share more with bonobos than we ever did with chimpanzees. In our natural environment which we evolved for, not the current one we are living in, we share more with bonobos than we ever did with chimpanzees.

Anthropological and archaeological investigations into hunter and gatherer tribes of the modern day show that the predominant themes between them are that they are egalitarian, cooperative, friendly, and easy going. This can be extrapolated to pre-modern humans due to the fact that these tribes, as seen in aboriginals or the Inuits to name two, have lived a traditional lifestyle up until very recently. 

Hunter-gathering tribes consisted of up to approximately 150 individuals. Which means that everyone knows everyone which then equates to social accountability. These tribes, while there are always exceptions to the norm, shared resources and didn’t praise anyone above anyone else as everyone was doing their part in supporting the tribe. Those who might have been too aggressive, attempted to resource hoard, or were disruptive in any way were ostracized, isolated, or even killed when other means didn’t work so that social cohesion was maintained.

Agriculture, on the other hand, ballooned populations due to increase fertility of women (not really a good thing) to levels where no one could know everyone which led to decrease accountability. Agriculture invented property, first with land and water, and then people were seen as resources by those who needed more workers to plow their fields. Agriculture birthed the patriarchy and made women and children into property. Agriculture created classes of the have and have nots and that led to disparity. Agriculture invented slavery as “civilized” societies captured and drug in hunter and gathering societies by their feet into their communities for cheap labor. Agriculture caused those in power to hoard resources from the greater collective. Agriculture led to wars between societies looking for more resources. Agriculture is the root of zoonotic (influenza, SARs, chickenpox etc) diseases to spread through our species. Agriculture led to famines as climate patterns changed. Agriculture led to the balloon of mental health problems. Agriculture is what destroyed our egalitarian ways.

We lived for approximately 190,000 years as hunter gathers amongst our family and kin. We lived in an environment which we were evolved for and we as a species were better for it. As Darwin points out, altruism and cooperation was naturally selected for because it was better for the species and as social animals because protecting our communities was as important as important as protecting oneself.

So, no we aren’t inherently selfish like Dawkins tries to claim nor are we naturally violent as our chimpanzee cousins. These are both symptoms of a sickness caused by living in an unnatural system. Just as birds who are kept confined that pluck out all their feathers, we are losing our minds and what it means to be truly human because of modern society - something we are not evolved for.

TL;DR humans are not naturally violent and selfish as modern day evidence has led us to believe. We lived as egalitarian altruistic communities for 190,000 years before the invention of agriculture. Agriculture and the sedentary life style that it required is what has caused us to become who we are today and is not a true reflection of the human species.",notmepleaseokay,348,0.7699999809265137,247,1706802279,2024-02-01 09:44:39,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1agdy9r/cmv_humans_are_inherently_cooperative_and/,2,2024
1apbsy8,"CMV: Within 15 years, universal basic income will be a necessity as AI replaces the majority of jobs","We all know that AI usage has exploded in the last few years. While there is an undercurrent of fear regarding the eventual sentience of AI, the more practical and current concern is how AI will eventually change the job market.

Companies are now laying off employees and replacing them with AI, like [Google firing 30,000 employees](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/google-plans-layoff-30000-employees-fight-between-ai-humans-nath-esj8c/). While some have speculated that AI won't take over the majority of jobs, only improving workflow, I find this thought to be naive.

AI is not the printer press, the cotton gin, or the automobile. While those innovations did replace certain industries (the automobile made blacksmiths and ferriers unnecessary since everyone eventually stopped riding around in horse and buggy), they also created new industries that increased production within the overall job market.

This is not what AI does. AI does not simply make one or two industries obsolete; it has the potential to make the *majority* of human workers in most industries obsolete. It does not have the means to increase production beyond what it takes away from the job market.

This isn't simply, ""Oh you lost your job due to innovation? You should find new skills."" Because beyond labor workers (construction, trade skills, military, etc.), *all* skills can eventually be done by AI and done better.

And people are skeptical saying, ""Well, it can't write code write now."" or ""The blogs it writes are terrible."" While that may be so, the exponential growth means that AI will eventually be good enough to replace the majority of white collar and creative jobs.

It's not simply a new innovation. It will eventually be (and I presume very quickly) an entire restructuring of work. Why should companies pay actual humans that are falable when they hire however many workers to run the AI and produce whatever the organization needs for exponentially cheaper?

Eventually, and I'm guessing within 15 years, AI will reshape the job market to the point where universal basic income will become a necessity for people to simply get money and survive.

I'm hopeful that someone can change my view on this because I certainly don't want this to happen. I would like the majority of people to keep their jobs, but I currently don't see a future where one of three things happen:

1. UBI is mandated.
2. Laws are passed that require companies to have X% of human workers.
3. A combination of the two.",MiltonRoad17,336,0.7400000095367432,533,1707773885,2024-02-12 15:38:05,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1apbsy8/cmv_within_15_years_universal_basic_income_will/,2,2024

1azmbbp,CMV: Dating is objectively harder for men than it is women and women’s refusal to concede this one point is annoying,"
I’m not one of those guys that thinks women live life on easy mode. Of course they don’t and I would say on a macro level, men are more privileged than woman. However I think one of the few things women have over men is the ability to get dates, find a relationship and have sex and any combination of the three.

So I will start by pointing out when you’re talking about struggling with dating, for women it’s struggling to find mister right. Even the average looking woman gets male attention and typically it’s just not from the men they want. When they go on dating apps, it’s more of that with a twist. They see “Mr. Right” who’s typically the hottest looking guy on the app and there’s no guarantee if she’ll match, but there is a guarantee that she will have to swipe through a bunch of perfectly normal guys who just aren’t the hottest man on the app.

For men, it’s a desert. No attention, no likes, no anything unless you are exceptionally good looking. The funny thing is, for anything else that is a social gathering this same logic applies just at a smaller pool. Bars, clubs, parties, etc. if you are not one of the more physically attractive men, it’s not going to happen anywhere as easily as it would for the average woman.

Men are also the ones risking rejection. Many women like to say they face rejection too, but it’s not really much compared to what the average man does. In my experiences in trying to get a number, just a number, it took 40 no’s before 1 yes. You could not sit here and tell me that the average woman would have that same record or even close to it.

When it comes to sex, I’m not even going to get too into the weeds. A 5/10 woman can hookup with a 7/10 guy any times she wants. A 5/10 guy is going to have to fight to hook up with another 5/10 woman. Women sleep up but date across, men sleep down but date across.

Lastly I want to talk about the main rebuttal I hear, “it’s dangerous to date as a woman, they could be raped or killed” and while I understand women’s fears here and they are valid, that’s not a dating issue. It’s a woman issue.

A woman is more likely to be raped by a friend or by a family member than someone she’s going on a first date with. That fear women have is more about existence as a woman than it is about dating.

A parallel would be like me saying “well it’s harder to date for men because I’m more likely to be a victim of any violent crime ranging from assault to murder with the only exception being rape. So it’s harder for me to date because stepping outside is more risky.”

Either both of these statements are true, or they’re not since they’re not a result of dating.",GorrilaRuffy,308,0.5699999928474426,1619,1708862489,2024-02-25 06:01:29,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1azmbbp/cmv_dating_is_objectively_harder_for_men_than_it/,2,2024

1akitl9,CMV: Replacement level fertility is impossible in liberal urbanized populations,"The reason none of the world's freest, most prosperous societies have a replacement level birthrate is that once you have removed archaic cultural hangups that penalize female childlessness, barriers to women's education and career advancement as well as minimize the prevalence of rural lifestyles, thereby eliminating the free labor force incentive to produce multiple children exclusively present in rural settings — there are no compelling reasons for the average woman to produce at least 2 children. 

Therefore, the birthrate per woman in an urbanized liberal society will always be below replacement. Case in point: not a single Nordic country has managed to get to replacement level fertility despite their heavily subsidized childcare as well as other welfare programs.

The ugly truth is that replacement level fertility in urbanized populations can only be the result of society-wide cultural and/or economic coercion, so, for example, European countries' only choices are replacement migration and regression to a pro-family culture that would by definition stigmatize childlessness.",KitezhGrad,269,0.6800000071525574,830,1707249228,2024-02-06 13:53:48,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1akitl9/cmv_replacement_level_fertility_is_impossible_in/,2,2024
1b1m9yc,CMV: unconditional love is an impossible goal,"Context: I've recently had a conversation about this topic with an acquaintance. She seems to have very impossible standards for relationships (think of that awful quote that goes ""if you can't handle me at my worst you don't deserve me at my best"" type of thing), and is struggling to find and keep relationships. I tried pointing out some of her unrealistic expectations and she wasn't having it.

That got me thinking about the phrase ""unconditional love"" and that I really think all love is conditional. I think a lot of people would be happier and less frustrated if they accepted this as a fact. 

Additional context: I'm happily married and have a child. I love them dearly and they love me. However in my wildest, darkest imagination, I'm sure there are horrible acts and situations that could cause them to stop loving me and vice versa. I plan to never get into one of those situations but I think everyone has their limits. In fact, I think I act like a better partner when I acknowledge that my actions could negatively affect my partner to the point that they may no longer want to be with me (again, not planning to ever get to that point). 

I also think pushing for unconditional love can lead to pushing for unhealthy relationship dynamics. Like a person is allowed to make mistakes and not be  perfect, but they also have to take responsibility and make real changes to their behavior, if it's a serious and/or ongoing issue.

Perhaps I am too cynical or missing some other perspective, so there is a chance my view could be changed there.

1ay1eu3,CMV: Ned Stark should have told Catelyn Stark about Jon’s true parentage,"I get that it largely, widely, needed to be kept a secret for the stability of Ned and Robert Baratheon’s friendship, and the Stark/Baratheon alliance.

But Ned sort of tortured his wife with this lie, which lead to a shitty situation for Jon and Catelyn.  I feel like if Catelyn were ‘in on it’, she could have better endured the ‘indignity’ of The Honorable Ned Stark’s Bastard in her home. Catelyn wouldn’t have held so much venom towards Jon (a true innocent) for his whole life, and they may have even come up with a better plan for Jon than to simply ship him off to the wall.

I think Ned was not a shrewd operator, and emotionally stunted. But by sharing the burden of this massive, realm-shattering secret, he and Catelyn could have done better by Jon for Jon’s whole life.

So what was the downside? That Catelyn simply couldn’t be trusted? Would Catelyn have let the information slip in some way?  

Because I think Catelyn would have held the secret closely out of respect for Lyanna and love for her nephew. I think Catelyn would have raised Jon much more like one of her own, and been happier in doing so.

Is that the downside? That Catelyn would have been suspiciously warm to her husband’s bastard?

It has no moving parts and is incredibly sturdy (I’m talking the proper iron ones, I know the cheaper sand/plastic imitations aren’t as reliable). It takes up a very small footprint.

The big downside would be that you choose a specific weight and live with it for a while. I could see a user hitting a plateau after a time.

But I suspect the median academian is slightly to the right of Chomsky. We're including all the astronomy and econ professors, you realize. If your MAGA hat dad is afraid that Harvard Law is going to turn you into a Commie, I think the conspiracy has been stretched a bit too thin, you know?

You can change my view with survey data about college professors' political alignment. Any international region can get a delta, even if your data is not global. Let's say delta if I consider them Chomsky-level or leftward.",pavilionaire2022,244,0.5899999737739563,880,1708658567,2024-02-22 21:22:47,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1axqd0a/cmv_academia_isnt_dominated_by_radical_woke/,2,2024
