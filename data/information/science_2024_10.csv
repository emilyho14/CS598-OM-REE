>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2024 is about pro­teins,  life’s ingenious chemical tools. David Baker has succeeded with the  almost impossible feat of building entirely new kinds of proteins. Demis  Hassabis and John Jumper have developed an AI model to solve a  50-year-old problem: predicting proteins’ complex structures. These  discoveries hold enormous potential.

>This year’s two Nobel Laureates in Physics have used tools from physics to develop methods that are the foundation of today’s powerful machine learning. John Hopfield created an associative memory  that can store and reconstruct images and other types of patterns in  data. Geoffrey Hinton invented a method that can autonomously find properties in data, and so perform tasks such as identifying specific elements in pictures.",maximum_cats,427,0.9100000262260437,72,1728387293,2024-10-08 06:34:53,science,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1fyxla3/the_nobel_prize_in_physics_2024_awarded_jointly/,10,2024

>This year’s Nobel Prize honors two scientists for their discovery of a  fundamental principle governing how gene activity is regulated.  
>  
>The information stored within our chromosomes can be likened to an  instruction manual for all cells in our body. Every cell contains the  same chromosomes, so every cell contains exactly the same set of genes  and exactly the same set of instructions. Yet, different cell types,  such as muscle and nerve cells, have very distinct characteristics. How  do these differences arise? The answer lies in gene regulation, which  allows each cell to select only the relevant instructions. This ensures  that only the correct set of genes is active in each cell type.  
>  
>Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun were interested in how different cell  types develop. They discovered microRNA, a new class of tiny RNA  molecules that play a crucial role in gene regulation. Their  groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene  regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms,  including humans. It is now known that the human genome codes for over  one thousand microRNAs. Their surprising discovery revealed an entirely  new dimension to gene regulation. MicroRNAs are proving to be  fundamentally important for how organisms develop and function.
