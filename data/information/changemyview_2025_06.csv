1loiw06,CMV: Trump enacting Project 2025 was not left-wing fear mongering. It's now 42% complete.,"The project tracker is here, and cites each specific objective of Project 2025 and the Trump admin directive/policy that accomplishes it [https://www.project2025.observer/](https://www.project2025.observer/). The first year of his term is 6 months in, and they're getting close to being halfway through it already. A lot of it is has been through Trump's executive orders.¬†

When Project 2025 was all over the news, the main narrative from conservatives was that P2025 was just talk, it was just some weird policy fantasy from an alt-right group. Or they just stayed quiet. But a good amount of Republicans and Republican leaders said that Trump has nothing to do with it, they parroted him when he said he wasn't going to touch it, and any claims that Trump was going to do so was just far-left fear mongering. This is a quote from the [National Review](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/project-2025-director-leaves-heritage-foundation-after-criticism-from-trump-democrats/) last July when the P2025 director stepped down

1l89jr4,CMV: The right only cares about ‚Äúriots‚Äù when marginalized people protest something the government did.,"I‚Äôve noticed a pattern: when protests happen in response to state violence‚Äîespecially immigration raids, police brutality, or systemic injustice‚Äîthe right calls them ‚Äúriots,‚Äù zeroes in on a few looting videos, and dismisses the entire movement.

But when right-wingers protest (COVID lockdowns, school boards, January 6), they seem to expect nuance and understanding. Suddenly context matters.

Take the recent LA protests after mass ICE raids. The majority were peaceful, but a few people looted. Instead of separating protestors from criminals, many conservatives immediately lumped them together and accused ‚Äúthe left‚Äù of condoning lawlessness.

If you really care about law and order, why is the outrage so selective? Why do ICE raids that break up families not trigger the same passion as a smashed store window?

1l35ymt,"CMV: As a gay man, I believe the culture and attitudes pervasive in online female spaces judge men by extremely harsh standards they would find unacceptable if applied to themselves","Gunna get this out of the way before I continue: ‚ÄúWhy was mentioning you are a gay man important?‚Äù

Because if I say I‚Äôm just a man, I‚Äôm going to assumed to be straight, and my opinion dismissed as when straight men normally express dissatisfaction with how they are treated and perceived in online female spaces.

With that out of the way-

I think women in online spaces dedicated to women view and treat men in ways that if they were treated themselves would be derided as unfair, immoral, cruel, and unacceptable. Men in these spaces, especially if it involved romance or dating, are judged very critically and harshly by many benign and superficial things, such as:

- the way they look

- the interest and hobbies they hold 

- the way they speak or act 

‚ÄúBut, but, you have to judge people by those things to make sure your compatibility.‚Äù

100% agree. 

The problem lies in the double standards.

A clear example that comes to mind is that it is totally acceptable in female spaces to judge a man for being under six foot. There‚Äôs a derogatory insult that is played off as just teasing- short kings. But if you judge a woman by her weight, it‚Äôs deemed as body shaming.

Men who like fishing get judged. But don‚Äôt dare insult women on the hobbies they like because that‚Äôs misogyny.

If an ‚Äúunattractive‚Äù man shoots his shot with a girl, he‚Äôs laughed, called a troll, referred to as ‚Äúthat‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äù. But if boys were to do the same to an unattractive girl they‚Äôd be called chauvinist bullies.

‚ÄúWhere do get the audacity to-‚Äú is a common phrase, but if men generalize women they‚Äôre just continue  stereotypes of women.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have my man be girly or feminine.‚Äù But if you judge a girl for having masculine interests you‚Äôre just continuing the patriarchy. 

Like‚Ä¶do straight men and women even want to date each other at this point? You guys sound so miserable üò≠

1lfbd1x,CMV: Israel settlers are terrorists and by extension Israel engages in State Sponsored Terrorism.,"A Terrorist is defined as: a person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

The Settlements and the Settler movement are considered illegal under International Law. There is a well-documented mountain of evidence of Settlers using violence and intimidation (including but not limited to murder, rape and sexual violence, destruction of property, etc) against the Civilians of the West Bank and East Jerusalem with the goal of expelling the Palestinian natives and settling their lands as they believe the land was promised to them. Even the US Department of State has defied Settler Violence as Terrorism.

I define State Sponsored Terrorism as Terrorist violence that is carried out with the active support of national governments provided to violent non-state actors.

The Israeli government has been actively supporting Israeli settlements giving funding and giving subsidies to the settlers, arming the settlers, and even creating government sponsored programs to expand the illegal settlements.

Iran doesn't have allies that care about it (Russia could have been seen as that, but they've publicly washed their hands of the situation), to the point that their own proxies like Hezbollah aren't getting involved.
Ukraine has the backing of the West, but no country has agreed to commit troops, and while Russia is getting support from North Korea, it's both ineffective and stops there.

1ldftpo,CMV: Americans and people in the West who believe the Russian talking points about the war against Ukraine are some of the stupidest people in the world,"I understand the title comes across as harsh, but this is true as it gets. With Russians living in russia it makes sense why they believe the lies told, but for Americans and people in the west that have access to information free from the russian state, it just stupid.

Let me be crystal clear: I'm not saying that every single person who questions the war in Ukraine is stupid. Nor am I saying that questioning U.S. foreign policy will necessarily turn one into an ignorant individual. But when I hear people in the West‚Äîespecially Americans‚Äîparrot talking points verbatim from the Kremlin propaganda machine, I can't help but question that we're working with some of the most gullible, uninformed, and plain stupidest individuals on this earth.

You don't have to be a geopolitical sage to see what's going on. A nuclear power dictatorship ruled by a man in office longer than the majority of Reddit users have been alive bombs a sovereign democratic neighbor. It takes land, kills civilians, and targets infrastructure‚Äîflagrant violations of international law. And still, there are Western apologists for it.

Some of the arguments I continually hear:

""NATO provoked Russia.""
Even if you believe that NATO expansion was a failure, nobody can explain an all-out invasion of a country that did not pose a threat to Russia. Ukraine was far from joining NATO when the invasion began.

""Ukraine is corrupt.""
True, but so is Russia‚Äîon a far larger and more systemic scale. Ukraine was (and continues to) work towards reforms and conduct democratic elections. Russia poisons journalists, jails opposition, and occupies neighbors. If corruption deserves an invasion, half the world is up for sale.

""The U.S. does bad things too.""
Yes, America does have a dirty history. That is no reason for Russia to be given a free pass to commit war crimes. This is the most idiotic whataboutism. Two wrongs do not make a right.

""It's all fake news, Ukraine is losing, it's just Western propaganda.""
This is astounding. Westerners with access to free media fall for easily debunked propaganda from state-run Russian sources. They gobble up blatantly staged ""news"" segments, fake maps, and appallingly terrible military analysis. If you believe that RT or some Telegram account with a hammer and sickle avatar avatar is providing you with the ""real story,"" I've got a bridge to sell you.


To believe these talking points is to disregard mountains of evidence, credible reporting, satellite imagery, war crimes reports, and the lived experiences of tens of millions of Ukrainians. And for what? To feel like you're ""not like the sheep,"" that you ""know the truth"" when in fact you've been conned by one of the most well-documented propaganda operations of the last century?

This kind of idiocy is not innocuous either. It undermines democratic solidarity with Ukraine, emboldens authoritarian governments, and mocks the very principle of truth in the public sphere. It's not ""just an opinion"" when it is grounded on falsehoods, and it is openly calling for a war of aggression.

So certain, I'll say it again: if you live in a free country that can access facts and still choose to believe Putin's disinformation, then you're voluntarily ignorant, intellectually lazy, or woefully gullible.

1l9r3wh,CMV: There is no practical way for Israel to conduct operations against Hamas that Leftist/Progressive movements will find acceptable,"I am defining ‚ÄúLeftist & / or Progressives movements‚Äù as the dominating, majority attitudes and narratives of the leftist & progressive movements in western countries in regards to Israel. An argument that ‚Äúnot all leftists think the same‚Äù will not win me over.

I do not believe there is a way for the nation of Israel to conduct operations against Hamas that Leftist and/or Progressives movements will find acceptable. I believe this for the following reasons:

https://irp.fas.org/world/para/docs/880818a.htm 

In the founding charter of Hamas, it states the organizations goals are to eliminate Israel and to eliminate Jews. The founding charter rejects peaceful solutions, and states this goal must be accomplished via any violence necessary.

To accomplish this goal, Hamas has used the following tactics: 

- Suicide Bombings
- Hostage Taking and Kidnappings of Israeli civilians and soldiers
- Indiscriminate Murder when present in Israeli territory 
- Continual Rocket Launches
-  Utilized Palestinian civilians as human shields
- stolen aid intended for Palestinians
- destroy infrastructure meant to provide resources to the Palestinians instead to reuse as weaponry 

These tactics all by themselves are atrocious. However, there is the added caveat that **Hamas is the ruling government of Gaza.** This means that Hamas is using **state resources** that functioning states would use to build infrastructure, feed the population, and develop the nation, Hamas instead divert in order to conduct their war effort against Israel.

When looking at the options that Israel has at its disposal to deal with Hamas, there are **no options available that Leftist/Progressives find acceptable.**

- To prevent suicide bombings and the indiscriminate murder and kidnapping of its citizens, Israel has erected checkpoints and a border wall with the Gaza Strip. But this contributes to leftist and progressive arguments that Gaza is an ‚Äúopen air prison‚Äù.

- to prevent Hamas from acquiring advanced weaponry the Iron Dome would be unable to deflect and thus lead to the leveling of cities in Israel, Israel maintains a blockade of Gaza. Again, this has been met with cries from leftist and progressives that Gaza is an open air prison and stopping aid from getting through. 

- to prevent Hamas from continuing to launch rockets from a given location within Gaza territory, Israel exterminate the aggressor by liquidating the site with rocket fire. But because Hamas used human shields, Israel is met with accusations from leftists that Israel is targeting civilians with inevitably a hospital or school that is being used as a site to launch rockets ends up having civilian casualties. 

- to prevent Palestinians civilians from getting hurt in urban warfare, Israel has attempted to evacuate citizens from areas it plans to do these operations. But once again, Israel is met with accusations from leftists and progressives that Israel is trying to ‚Äúdeport/ethnically cleanse‚Äù Gaza.

I am making this post because Leftist and Progressives always are criticizing Israel in how it conducts itself against Hamas. These same groups, however, always fail to provide **practical alternatives** to how the state of Israel should conduct operations in away that guarantee its own safety as a nation while being deemed ‚Äúmorally / ethically acceptable.‚Äù I am open to hearing these suggestions, but so far no good answers have been provided.

If a blockade, border security, air strikes, evacuation zones, and military invasion are all unacceptable methods for dealing with Hamas and protecting itself **what solutions do Leftists and Progressives find acceptable**?

The vacations they post about, the restaurants they eat at, the games they play, the clean water they drink, all of it is made possible by people who show up to jobs every day.

1l38g9o,CMV: Calling all men predators is inherently sexist and puts off most men from wanting to understand your views.,"It is hard to engage in meaningful conversation with people from various popular subreddits when you already are being demonized as a predator under a generalized view of men. I don't want people to think I am saying that all men are perfect or anything. 

In fact far from it, an estimated 91% of victims of rape & sexual assault are female and 9% male.¬†**Nearly 99%**¬†of perpetrators are male. 

Anything even close to this statistic is insane and horrendous but to even pretend that a majority of men are predators is ridiculous and will just push people further away from understanding your position completely. 

Even the men who got SA'd by other men would be considered predators...

Also, you really think calling out all men for being predators is really going to make any kind of systematic change? You think the men that are predators even care that you call ""all men"" predators? 

I think if anything you are likely enabling them to be predators because now there literally is no difference between a non-predator man and a predator man because they are all predators.

Maybe people are more nuanced than I give them credit for and they don't actually think all men are predators and its just something to say in general to cope with the heinous crimes in this world but I think if you actually want to fix that inequality you wouldn't perpetuate gender stereotypes and making people feel bad for doing nothing and would instead try to have meaningful conversation and understanding. Not in a patronizing educational way but more having a clear understanding of what we can do as people to make sure everyone is safe because it seems like predators have tricks they use to try to isolate their victims etc.. and men can be a little bit socially inept so knowing when women need help when its less obvious is key I think.

This is also not exclusively women spaces or something before you think I am going into women's only subreddits and criticizing them for what they want to say to each other. 

TLDR: I don't think saying ""all"" for any group of people is really correct ESPECIALLY when its not even being used as a shorthand to refer to a majority. It just further distances understanding between men and women and leads more men to be burnt out or increasingly apathetic towards these issues and not think its even a problem when it seriously is a problem.

1lb86kj,CMV: Israel attacking Iran makes perfect sense.,"Iran built its entire Israel strategy around a network of proxy states and paramilitary groups. They spent tens of billions of dollars arming Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis and supporting Bashar Al Asads regime in Syria. 

The goal of this investment was to encircle Israel and grant Iran the ability to threaten Israel on multiple fronts while protecting Iranian territory. 

This strategy failed big time and faster than anyone could imagine. 

In less than two years, Israel has nearly annihilated Hamas, decapitated Hezbollah, precipitated the fall of Asad‚Äôs Syria, and is perfectly capable of handling the Houthis who turned to be more of a nuisance than a threat. 

Iran is now alone, reasonably broke, and at its weakest. 

Israel is winning on all fronts and has retained the military support of all its allies. Add to this the potential alignment of the entire Levantine region with Saudi Arabia. 

It makes absolute sense to strongly and aggressively attack Iran right now. This is the closest to the regime falling Iran has probably ever been, and the weakest militarily.

For over a decade now but really in the last 5-6 years the migrant crisis at the border has been really bad for a variety of reasons both outside the United States control and within it but regardless of *why* it happened the unavoidable truth to most Texans was that there was a problem. 

And for years most on the Left dismissed the complaints as racist hyperbole by white folk that didn‚Äôt want to share their precious, racially homogenous cities and towns with brown people. When Trump rode to power in 2016, many on the Left proudly declared themselves opposed to his anti-immigration policies and supported the creation of ‚Äúsanctuary cities‚Äù. 

Abbot‚Äôs response from to 21-24 was ‚Äúokay, you want them so bad? Take ‚Äòem‚Äù and began bussing hundreds upon hundreds of migrants to cities like Chicago and NYC. The rest is recent history. The migrants arrive and white liberals learn native black and brown Americans don‚Äôt like migrants anymore then their Texan fellow citizens, it becomes a toxic symbol of the immigration chaos of the Biden administration and on the Left more broadly.

This feeds into the growing consensus among Americans nationally that immigration is out of control and that we have a crisis at our southern border, which Donald Trump in turn helps use to take back the White House in 24. Greg Abbott turned himself into a darling of the Right by forcing liberals to put their money where the migrants mouth was, got rid of unwanted migrants and quite possibly changed the course of national history all for the low, low price of a bus ticket.

1li0ee2,"CMV: Trump's refusal to actively prosecute large employers of illegal immigrants reveals he is not running his deportation campaign for security, economic, or moral reasons.","Okay. Here's the deal.

There is a clear and obvious reason why most illegal immigrants come to the United States. It's not because they just love stealing all of our welfare and eating people's cats. 

It is because big corporations hire them. 

The reasons they do this is obvious. It lets them get cheap labor. 

But Trump is not going after them (sample citation: [https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-18/immigration-raids-employer-employee](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-18/immigration-raids-employer-employee) ). Why?

Now, letting a bunch of people into the country without any vetting is bad. We can all agree on that. And every undocumented person who comes in and is sheltered by these big businesses is a potential security risk. But Trump has made no moves to patch this hole or massively penalize companies for making Americans less safe. Thus, either Trump's current deportation plan is not about national security, or he is being extremely stupid and ignoring a massive hole in our national defense.

Let's move on to money, where the inverse is the case.   
  
Far from being a resource sink, Illegal immigrants are actually major economic contributors (sample citations: [https://americansfortaxfairness.org/undocumented-immigrants-contribute-economy/](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/undocumented-immigrants-contribute-economy/) ; [https://cmsny.org/importance-of-immigrant-labor-to-us-economy/](https://cmsny.org/importance-of-immigrant-labor-to-us-economy/) ). They also work jobs that American workers quite frankly are not able to fill: (sample citation: [https://www.rawstory.com/trump-farmers-2672410822/?u=eb87ad0788367d505025d9719c6c29c64dd17bf89693a138a44670acfdc86a46&utm\_source=Iterable&utm\_medium=email&utm\_campaign=Jun.21.2025\_8.59pm](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-farmers-2672410822/?u=eb87ad0788367d505025d9719c6c29c64dd17bf89693a138a44670acfdc86a46&utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Jun.21.2025_8.59pm) ).

Now, if Trump wanted to keep all that money flowing into our economy, he could just ignore the issue or start a generous work visa program that vetted the people willing to come into the country and work for cheap while still letting them come in. He wouldn't be hunting them down with constant, expensive immigration raids. So this can't be about money. 

Finally we move to move on to morals. A lot of people think it's just immoral to cross the border illegally and thus break the law. Even if I don't agree I can accept that. 

But Trump is actively deporting people who are refugees due to US actions (sample citation: [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/21/afghanistan-trump-deportation-threat](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/21/afghanistan-trump-deportation-threat) ). And human trafficking victims with essential jobs (sample citation [https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-teachers-aide-self-deports-with-us-born-twin-daughters/65089409](https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-teachers-aide-self-deports-with-us-born-twin-daughters/65089409) ). Those people never broke the law at all, and (generally speaking) committed no crimes. Thus there is no moral reason to deport them.

But do you know who is being immoral and breaking the law? Large companies that are aiding and abetting illegal immigrants instead of reporting them to the authorities. If this was about the immorality of breaking the law, then big companies would be causing way more moral harm than individual migrants. And they would be the primary targets. 

So with moral, economic and security reasons for the deportations out the window, the only reasons I can think of to conduct these massive raids is racism, security theater, and/or  as a cover for something else.

1l9v6g2,"CMV: There is no good reason, with the exception of special needs cases, to homeschool children in the US. Homeschooling is, again with that one exception, always a manifestation of the parent's desire for control, not of the child's best interest. Notes and Caveats in Body","The one notable exception is for a child with special needs, if you live in an area where the local public school system does not have adequate staff/training/facilities to educate your child. In that case, I would agree there is a good reason to homeschool. Otherwise, there are none. 

Common Objections-

1- But my school district sucks!: Unless you are a world class educator, which you probably aren't, even a fairly mediocre or overworked school system will still be able to provide your child a better education through the network of dozens of trained professionals your child will have access to over a given school year, than you can alone. Is the height of hubris to thing that you are equal to or better than a math teacher+ reading teacher+ history teacher+ social studies teacher+ science teacher+ gym coach+ guidance counselor, etc etc etc, even fairly mediocre ones. You are not.

2- But our schools are dangerous!: Then send them to a private school. Not all private schools are for rich people, there are middle class and even working class private schools. The tuition to these school will still cost less than the expense of your own training to properly educate, the materials, and your own time spent being a home educator rather than being out working. I get that maybe you WANT to be a stay at home educator, but again, if the best interest of your child and there education is genuinely your priority, even if your public schools are terrible, you will do better by them if you work a job and spend that wage on private school tuition. You are not a replacement for a school. If you are in a situation where you cannot afford even a low end private school, then you are not in a position to be able to afford to do a better job than your public school would anyway.

3- But my children will be exposed to (insert thing I don't like): Good! Social skills and learning how to navigate mixed company settings and social spaces with difference influences and cultures and ideas is just as important to be a properly adjusted and functioning adult as the book learning. In some contexts even more so.

  
What will change my mind: 

Some scenario, other than the single notable exception I listed above, where I am convinced that being homeschooled will actually result in a better education and better intellectual, emotional, and personal development than enrollment in a public school would, WHILE ALSO being a situation where a low end private school is also out of the question.

Trump has weathered scandal after scandal and emerged unscathed. Remeber 1/6? It seemed very clearly like that would be the end of Donald Trump's political career, if not more severe. That perception lasted a couple of days, until conservative media figured out how to spin it. Bad-faith actors. Not-so violent. It was justified because the Dems actually did steal the election. The cops allowed it. The excuses were nonstop, each as vacuous as the next, but were eagerly lapped up by the MAGA base. 

We'll see the same dynamic unfold here. In fact, it has already begun. Elon is ujst upset by the removal of the EV subsidies. Elon is mentally unstable. Elon is a plant. It never stops. Once conservative media gets a hold on this, they will come up with a nice narrative that their base will get behind, and the so-called moderates will follow.

However currently parents are provided an option to opt their kids out of sex-ed, and prevent them from receiving it entirely. This option is somewhat unique to sex-ed, as parents aren't typically able to opt their kids out of specific parts of a school curriculum because of personal preference (I can't just choose to exclude my kid from learning about fractions).

When Iserial or now US forces attack Iran these are referred to as ""strikes."" When Iran strikes back it is described as a ""barrage and an attack.""

When the United States bombs a sovereign country the leading quote included is ""America does not seek war,"" which is insane as America just committed an act of war.

Meanwhile the Israelis continue to bomb major metropolitan areas in Iran. Yet these attacks are described as ""hitting targets"" with no mention of the civilian causulities involved. Yet when Isreali metropolitan areas are are hit we get detailed civilian casualty reports, and almost no mention of what the ""target"" was.

After the recent US attack, it is being reported that a diplomatic solution is still what US high command wants and that a ""larger protracted conflict is unlikely."" This is clearly a lie, and for it to be reported with out any context pushback or counterpoints is pure propaganda.

1lk296b,"CMV: Americans shouldn‚Äôt call themselves Irish, Italian, German, etc., if they are many generations removed and don‚Äôt actively live and contribute to that culture.","I‚Äôm from Quebec and there, people tend to identify based on the culture they actively live and participate in. Even if someone has Irish, French, British, or German ancestry and maybe still cooks certain traditional meals, celebrate holidays or knows some family stories they typically say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Qu√©b√©cois,‚Äù not ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Irish‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm French.‚Äù The identity is tied to the culture they were raised in and contribute to daily.
That‚Äôs why I find it confusing that many Americans call themselves Irish, Italian, German, etc., when their connection to those places is often distant like a great-great-great-grandparent and they‚Äôve never been to the country, don‚Äôt speak the language, and don‚Äôt participate in the actual modern culture and society of that nation.
I feel like Americans often blur ethnicity with ancestry and heritage. Just because your family came from somewhere generations ago doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you‚Äôre ethnically that today especially if you don‚Äôt speak the language, follow the customs, or meaningfully participate in the culture and/or current events. To me, there‚Äôs a big difference between having Irish ancestry and being Irish. But in the US, those two things often seem treated as the same.
From my outside perspective, it seems like this happens because a lot of Americans feel disconnected from a specific national culture of their own. The US is a very diverse and mixed country, and in many cases, ‚Äújust being American‚Äù feels bland or culturally empty so claiming an ethnic label feels more meaningful, especially when talking to someone from abroad. It may come from a place of wanting to feel special, grounded, or connected to something old or ‚Äúreal.‚Äù I get that. But it also comes across as disconnected, surface level, cringey, cultural sampling and sometimes disrespectful to the people from that nation.
But when people like me from outside the US question this, some Americans react really defensively. It feels like they hear, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bland‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou have no culture,‚Äù when really we‚Äôre just trying to understand why ancestry is treated like identity even when it‚Äôs really far removed from current lived experience.
In Quebec, even when we still carry on family traditions, we don‚Äôt usually claim to ‚Äúbe‚Äù the ethnicity unless we were actually raised and lived in that cultural setting. To us, cultural identity is about your lived reality, not just fragments of heritage. It‚Äôs the language you speak, the region you live in, the worldview you share, and the culture you contribute to every day.
I‚Äôm not trying to mock or insult anyone. I understand people have pride in their family roots and traditions, and that‚Äôs valid. I just think there‚Äôs a difference between having ancestry and claiming identity, and I‚Äôd love to hear from Americans who see it differently. Because as someone who is also from a country that is a melting pot of cultures it‚Äôs very confusing.

Please keep it civil this isn‚Äôt meant to offend or dismiss anyone‚Äôs experiences. I‚Äôm genuinely open to having my view changed and understanding this better.

1lffpfd,"CMV: Israel‚Äôs attack on Iran was intended to draw the US into war, not prevent Iran from having a nuke","Israel claims its attack on Iran on Friday was about preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. I think that this is a pretty transparent lie for the reasons below.

Israel has been claiming Iran has been close to a nuclear weapon for 30 years. North Korea is significantly less advanced than Iran, but has successfully developed a nuke during that time period. 

Iran previously had a nuclear weapon program. That ended in 2003 to avoid getting attacked by the US. Since then, it looks like it‚Äôs strategy has been to use its nuclear capability for deterrence. (‚Äústop fucking with us; we can build a nuke pretty quickly‚Äù)

It is clear that Iran does not want a conflict with the United States. Openly weaponizing their nuclear program invites that conflict. 

Of course, they could pursue weaponization in secret. But the US, UK and Israel knowingly misrepresented evidence of WMD prior to the Iraq war. It is more than fair for the public to demand proof of weaponization since one party in this conflict has previously used this exact same lie as cover for regime change.

Israel does not have the ability to inflict significant damage to Iran‚Äôs nuclear program or pursue regime change in Iran on its own. Even if they had the capability to destroy Fordow, the enriched uranium is almost certainly spread out across the country. If Iran‚Äôs entire nuclear program including the uranium were destroyed, it could still develop a bomb in under 5 years.

The only ways to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuke is convincing the regime that a nuke is not in their best interest or changing the regime. 

It‚Äôs still early, but it seems like Israel‚Äôs attack has made the idea of having a nuke more appealing to Iranians and the regime. It looks like having a nuke is the only way to deter Israel and its allies.

So why would Israel attack Iran? I think the most straightforward answer is they were hoping Iran would retaliate in a manner that forced the US to enter the conflict and pursue regime change.

Iran hasn‚Äôt taken the bait, so now Israel is attempting to present Iran as neutered by their campaign. ‚ÄúIran is weak. Come over and help us finish the job‚Äù

Iran has been weakened, but they clearly have the capability to inflict more damage on Israel than they have demonstrated. The threat of offensive US involvement has constrained their response.

Once the US attacks, Iran will no longer be constrained by the threat of the US joining the conflict and will retaliate on US/ Israeli assets. The US will officially be in an offensive war that it did not initiate. This was Netanyahu‚Äôs actual calculation before Friday.

My view can be changed by concrete evidence of Iran‚Äôs nuclear weaponization and/or an explanation of how Israel thinks this bombing campaign will prevent Iran from pursuing a nuke without US involvement.

TL;DR: Israel doesn‚Äôt have the capability to meaningfully impact Iran‚Äôs nuclear program or pursue regime change on its own. They attacked Iran hoping that they could provoke a strong response that would draw the US into the conflict.

1ll1kuv,CMV: ICE workers and detention facility staff will become the next generation's shameful historical example of ordinary people enabling atrocities.,"I've been hearing reports of the conditions at Migrant facilities in the USA. They already have been terrible, but with the increased quota and lack of new infrastructure its going to get a whole lot worse.

Can it get worse than causing a Pregnant woman's 5 month old fetus to die and sit inside her for days? Absolutely. It is just a matter of time - time that the Trump administration has.

They have a minimum of 1.5 more years if Ds manage to take back the house and senate and frighteningly 3.5 more if they don't. This is more than enough time for atrocities to become normalized and have numbers rack up.

Maybe they will run out of money, but that hasn't stopped the USA from spending.

I believe that if this continues, the truth will eventually come out and there will be a lot of evidence that will eventually get shared. 

When stories come out, politicians will ask for people to be prosecuted. To my knowledge ICE does not have a special judicial system like the military, which can hide crimes because of special treatment. If Ds win the presidency, then the DOJ will prosecute everyone they can and I bet enough Rs will jump in to distance themselves from Trump that it could get bipartisan support.

In this scenario, most ICE agents will be identified and at the very least shunned by society and probably the world. Migrants will tell stories of specific people who abused them. I'm sure texts and conversations will be leaked. Paper trails of who abducted whom will be available. It will be hard to hide.

This all depends on whether or not Trump / Maga lose power and I have a feeling they will when the Trump admin's policies continue to hurt the working class. You can disagree, but with Iran, up-coming medicaid cuts, increased deficit spending for rich people, and higher prices it seems more and more likely.

I‚Äôve been not followed Hasan for a long time. I have recently started watching his videos. I agree with him on mostly all US politics. I respect this role as a critical and popular voice against trump. But recently there has been a search for the face of left wing media (a Joe Rogan figure) and many people believe Hasan fits this bill. I frankly strongly disagree.Here‚Äôs why:

1. Platforming Extremist Narratives

a. He‚Äôs hosted a self-described ‚ÄúHouthi pirate‚Äù who openly celebrated hijacking a commercial vessel for the Houthis (a U.S.-designated terrorist group) and largely praised that action as resistance.

b. On multiple occasions he‚Äôs given airtime to pro-Hamas or pro-Hezbollah talking points‚Äîlabeling them ‚Äúresistance‚Äù‚Äîwithout clearly calling out the atrocities those groups commit.
Any right wing figure will be rightly called out for such behaviour. 

2. Selective Criticism & Unacknowledged Bias

a. Hasan fiercely defends Muslims against Islamophobia but has never publicly criticized any Islamic organizations (even those linked to radical violence).
b. He‚Äôs quick to call out Christian nationalism yet seems unwilling to hold similar standards for an Islamist or extremist-linked institutions‚Äîsuggesting a religious or identity-based double standard.

For someone to be the face of diverse left wing they need to call out all extremists.
 
3. Journalistic Oversight & ‚ÄúBad Journalism‚Äù

 those claims and just platformed his views.

b. He often frames news as raw ‚Äútakes‚Äù rather than rigorous, sourced analysis, letting guests push one-sided narratives uncorrected.

4. Toxic On-Air Persona
a. I don‚Äôt find his style of masculinity healthy. It‚Äôs not better if a left wing man is shouting and showing off his alpha masculinity.

5. Is He Unique?
No. Sure, he does left-wing commentary on Twitch and reaches millions, but dozens of other commentators do the same without normalizing extremist violence or dog-whistling to their base.

My Position:
I believe a credible left-wing media figure should platform all sides responsibly, call out extremist ideology‚Äîregardless of religion or politics‚Äîprovide context and fact-checks in real time, and model respectful, non-toxic discourse. Hasan Piker fails on these fronts often enough that I can‚Äôt see him as a good representative of progressive values.

CMV: I‚Äôm open to the possibility that I‚Äôm being too harsh or missing broader context. As I said I just started watching him recently so what I have written is based on the videos I watched , Reddit threads (pro and anti) and factchecking with Chat GPT. I have done my due diligence without watching all his videos as frankly I don‚Äôt want to give my time to that. What am I overlooking? Are there examples where Hasan has consistently held all extremists to account, or moments where he‚Äôs moderated extremist guests rigorously?

1lkwnvc,CMV: anti-natalism achieves nothing besides ensuring that progressivism will die out in the west.,"Fairly simple premise, all data indicates that over the last 30 years increasingly the biggest predictor of a groups fertility rate in the west has been: religiousness, and conservativeness.

We know that temperament and ideology are heritable both in the form of social indoctrination, but also that literally someone's disposition and biology can lend itself to how religious or conservative they are. People rebel, but not as often as they don't.

All the doom cult of anti-natalism achieves is ensuring that over the next 100 years the majority in the west will have been raised in religious and conservative households and liberally temperamental people will have become a minority.

I genuinely think the rise of MAGA etc in young men and the recent reversal in the trend of the youth vote getting more and more liberal is in part due to this fact that has been bearing out for long enough now to procure the first generation where there was a measurable difference in fertility rates between democrats and republicans.",RatioFinal4287,1021,0.699999988079071,826,1750933661,2025-06-26 05:27:41,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1lkwnvc/cmv_antinatalism_achieves_nothing_besides/,6,2025

Many people who are pro-life actively support politicians and policies that harm low-income working-class families or even just have opinions contradicting their ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù stance. 


Cutting funds/ shutting down programs such as Medicaid, WIC, SNAP, early childhood education, etc., actively harms families and children. 
There are tons of people who look down on single mothers or parents trying to get child support from the other parents. 

Some other examples of the fake pro-life stance include:
There has been a push to stop free school lunches as well as to defund public schools. 
The denial of science (vaccines, global climate change). 

I understand that the political movement of pro-life is about stopping abortions, and I agree. The goal isn‚Äôt about the care of the child after it‚Äôs born. That doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre actually pro-life.

There are far poorer countries out there and yet you don‚Äôt see the level of unhinged, daily chaos that‚Äôs become normal in American cities. They don‚Äôt have the money. But they have something Americans don‚Äôt anymore: rules, community, shame, and cultural boundaries.

Grown men having psychotic meltdowns on public transportation while no one intervenes

Teenagers treating shoplifting like a TikTok trend

Commuters stepping over twitching bodies like it‚Äôs background noise

Cities turning into outdoor insane asylums and being told ‚Äúthis is compassionate‚Äù

This isn‚Äôt poverty. This is a culture that collapsed and forgot it‚Äôs allowed to say ‚Äòno.‚Äô
It‚Äôs the consequence of decades of:

Radical individualism (‚Äúyou do you‚Äù taken to delusional levels)

No-fault morality (‚Äúthere are no bad people, only misunderstood ones‚Äù)

Infantilization (‚Äúdon‚Äôt blame them, they‚Äôre just victims of the system‚Äù)

In the U.S.? There‚Äôs an entire class of people who are:

Raised with zero boundaries

Addicted to dopamine and self-pity

Trained to blame everyone else

And told by media and academics that rules are violence, and accountability is oppression

And if you dare question this if you say ‚Äúhey, maybe we shouldn‚Äôt tolerate people shooting heroin next to schoolkids‚Äù  you‚Äôre accused of lacking compassion. Because now, enabling dysfunction is treated as kindness, and expecting decency is considered ‚Äúpunching down.‚Äù

So no I don‚Äôt buy the poverty excuse. There are poorer nations with far less crime, far more public order, and far more functional people. You know why? Because they haven‚Äôt completely erased the concepts of shame, discipline, or civic responsibility.

The jury acquitted her of the more serious charges, leading to cheers from the crowd outside the courthouse, according to NPR. The OUI charge carries a fine and potential imprisonment. 

The case centered around the death of John O'Keefe, a Boston police officer, in January 2022. 

The prosecution alleged Read struck him with her car and left him to die in the snow, while the defense argued she was framed and that O'Keefe was killed in a fight inside a house. The first trial resulted in a hung jury, leading to the retrial. 

The retrial lasted over two months with testimony from numerous witnesses, including expert testimony on accident reconstruction, which the defense argued did not support the prosecution's theory, according to Court TV. The jury began deliberations on Friday and reached their verdict on Wednesday. Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and leaving the scene of an accident causing death, but guilty of OUI.

1lnz5gv,"CMV: Modern ""trad wives"" are the least like actual traditional wives in history.","To start the most obvious reason is that modern trad wives choose to be so. Historically speaking, wives often had no choice. Being a trad wife is what you had to do. 

They rely on tech & conveniences real traditional wives never had. Wvwn rhe washing machine was considered revolutionary, and there was talk at the time that it would destroy what it meant to be a woman, as a ""robot"" was doing her labor, which made her who she was. Today there are numerous other advances which make these modern day trad wives nothing like who they seek to emulate. They're not churning butter all day, they're on tiktok. 

Many trad wives hire maids and babysitters. It's become more common in much of rhe west to hire someone to come clean your house. Often times the women who claim to be trad wives hire cook, maids, babysitters, etc. to do the labor they are saying that wives should do. 

The labor of the past was often physically demsnding. Trad wives today are more of an aesthetic choice and lifestyle. Often rooted more in larping as something rather than being it. It's like a cowboy hat in a lot of ways. Someone can buy and wear a cowboy hat with no cows, or farm, but still the hat resonates with them for what it means aesthetically and historically. It's a larp (albeit a hat is a rather harmless one) 

Their focus is too much just on their family. Historically this isn't accurate. Raising children was often seen as more community focused and families were much bigger and intergenerational. Again, they're making a fictional fantasy of the past and trying to apply it to modern times. 

And of course. The last is the 
Irony which makes up their identities. The reason they can choose to be a trad wife is because of the advances women's rights have seen over the years. 

All in all. Trad wives are obsessed with nostalgia for a past which never existed, and their attempts to form their identities around this fantasy are delusional and not rooted in historical truths.

They do nothing to advocate for members of their own party, I see no justified rage, I see no action, no blame put onto republican politicians. These events are in the news for about a minute and then everyone forgets about it. 

Yet when Donald Trump gets shot in the ear by a right winger, the Republicans go off like rabid dogs in the media and blame rhetoric that came from the left and the Democrats BENT THE KNEE. The Democratic Party told their constituents to tone down their language for weeks despite valid criticism aimed at the Trump campaign. 

On top of that, Kamala Harris adopted Trump's immigration policy during the campaign and brought LIZ CHENEY on the road with her. She stopped talking about price gouging, they silenced progressive voices, they silenced Palestinian voices at the DNC, they did everything in their power to win over the imaginary moderate Republican voter. They betrayed their progessive base and expected them to fall in line due to lesser evil voting. Now seeing how much smoke Democrats have for Mamdani, I fear they have yet to learn their lesson.

Instead of countering right wing naratives, institutional Democrats have been adopting right wing talking points. Why would any Republican voter vote Democrat when for years, they've been on opposite sides of the spectrum? You come off as disingenuous when your go from ""No kids in cages"" to ""We can put kids in cages more humanely."" When you adopt right wing policies, when you campaign on having the strongest military in the world while supporting an active genocide, when you advocate for harsher immigration policies instead of talking about pathways to citizenship, DO NOT expect progressive voters to write you in out of obligation.

1lkydu8,CMV: The British Museum is over-hated,"It's a common refrain online to call the British Museum a building full of stolen artefacts. I don't think this is fair for several reasons:

1) Many of the items are from countries and cultures that no longer exist, or have changed so much as to be unrecognisable. For example, Mesopotamian artefacts were not created by Iraqis, Syrians, etc. but by a completely different cultures who have long since disappeared. Modern Egyptians are disconnected from ancient Egyptians by thousands of years of cultural change and multiple migrations or invasions into the region. In many cases, the case for a modern state claiming ownership over an item in the British museum boils down to, in essence, a 'blood and soil' argument- the idea that since they have a genetic and territorial link to an ancient people, they must have the strongest claim. And at which point does a historical link to a culture end anyway? Should we return Ptolemaic artefacts to the Greeks, since it was a Greek dynasty ruling Egypt at the time?

  
2) The British Empire is still part of British history. Although the Brits committed numerous atrocities during the period of empire, it is also true that the time of empire shaped and changed British culture as a whole. Artefacts that are often called 'stolen' represent a time period during which the British people were conquering and exploring the world, and bringing back their treasures to the British isles. The modern fields of archaeology and anthropology were pioneered in London during this time, using artefacts brought back all throughout the empire. Why is this period of conquest and trade, and the artefacts taken during this time, not considered part of British history? As an example, would it be fair for the Brits to demand the return of the Bayeux tapestry because it was made in Canterbury, even though it was paid for by the Bishop of Bayeux?

  
3) Many of the items weren't taken by force, but sold or gifted to individual Brits. If I dug up a pot of Roman coins in a field in Kent, and sold them to the Louvre, would the British government have a right to demand them back in 200 years? Of course this doesn't even cover the additional millions of pounds and thousands of hours spent maintaining, preserving and restoring ancient artefacts by staff at the British Museum. 

  
To be clear, I am completely open to having my opinion changed. I will concede off the bat that there are many objects kept in storage in the BM that will probably never go on public display, and in the cases of these objects, if returning them to their country of origin will result in them going on public display, I would support it. Additionally, there are some objects in the British museum, especially objects looted from African tribes, India, and other colonies, where the direct descendants (great-grand children or similar) of murder victims should be able to claim them. My point here is mostly about the truly ancient artefacts (several centuries or older) for which I don't believe any modern state has a legitimate claim to.",AroooonTV,627,0.7900000214576721,267,1750939435,2025-06-26 07:03:55,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1lkydu8/cmv_the_british_museum_is_overhated/,6,2025
1ldmwzr,CMV: Single Payer Healthcare is 100% better than what the vast majority of Americans are doing,"Popular opinion here, I‚Äôm sure. Not a karma farm, really looking for people to tell me something other than what I‚Äôm experiencing.

First, I‚Äôm one of the few Americans currently using a ‚Äúsocialized‚Äù healthcare system: The VA. I‚Äôve had cheap medical care previously (about $800 a year for three daily meds and roughly 8x yearly visits including ER and specialists) and I currently have free medical care (disabled veteran status)

Talking to my family about dealing with severe chronic illness before age 40, I got them to stop worrying about my health with one sentence:

‚ÄúThe biggest indicators of longevity are usually genetics and access to quality healthcare.‚Äù

Now I spent the last hour on the phone playing tag with the local hospital and the VA about a bill the hospital still thinks needs paying and the VA says is closed. That sucks. I was thinking about complaining about how much it sucks. But every single person I know who has to pay insurance and copays has had the same experience.

So, if you‚Äôre for the current American healthcare system: why? What are you getting out of it?",humanguy31,621,0.8299999833106995,651,1750166323,2025-06-17 08:18:43,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ldmwzr/cmv_single_payer_healthcare_is_100_better_than/,6,2025
1lbged5,CMV: Israel is conducting a psyop on Reddit right now.,"My evidence, how all of a sudden every post on CMV is about how its right for Israel to destroy Iran. And how Iran probably would use those nukes on Israel anyway so it makes it perfectly ok. Just go to the main sub feed. Theyre all the top posts.

So in a matter of 3 hours, there were many people who all got the thought that all of this was ok and wanted CMV to change their mind while producing a huge diatribe of reasons why its ok to bomb other nations unprovoked? And of course, not a single one of them having their mind changed cause thats not why theyre really here, is it now.
