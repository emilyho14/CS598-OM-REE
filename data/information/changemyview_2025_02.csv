1ing2ad,CMV: Elon Musk walks around with his son on his shoulders to deter assassination attempts,"In many of his recent public appearances, Elon Musk has been seen keeping his four year old son X Æ A-Xii on his shoulders.

I think that the main reason he keeps this child on his shoulders in so many public appearances is to deter assassination attempts. An assassin would be much less likely to attack him if the son is on his shoulders.

How to change my view:

1. Come up with a reason that makes more sense
2. Demonstrate that there is no reason to think that assassins would be deterred",razorbeamz,9321,0.8600000143051147,1756,1739325841,2025-02-11 20:04:01,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ing2ad/cmv_elon_musk_walks_around_with_his_son_on_his/,2,2025
1iht2i4,CMV: The new DNC Vice Chair David Hogg exemplifies exactly why the Democratic Party lost the 2024 election,"So for those who aren't familiar, one of the Vice Chairs elected by the DNC earlier this week is David Hogg, a 24 year old activist. There's nothing wrong with that aspect, its fine to have young people in leadership positions, however the problem with him is a position he recently took regarding an Alaska Democrat, Mary Peltola. 

Mary Peltola was Alaska's first Democrat Rep in almost 50 years, and she lost this year to Republican Nick Begich. Throughout her 2024 campaign, David Hogg was very critical of her, saying she should support increased gun restrictions, and then he celebrated her loss in November saying again that she should support gun control, in Alaska. This is exactly what's wrong with the DNC.

In 2024, the Democrats lost every swing state, every red state Democratic Senator, and won only three Democratic House seats in Trump districts (all of whom declined to endorse the Harris/Walz ticket). If you look at the Senate map, there is no path to a majority for the Democrats without either almost all of the swing state seats or at least with a red state Democrats. Back in Obama's first term, the Democrats had seats in Montana, Missouri, West Virginia, and both Dakotas, but in 2010 after supporting the ACA and a public option on party lines they lost most of them, and in 2024 after supporting BBB on party lines they lost all of them. 

My view is that the Democrats are knowingly taking a position that its better to lose Democrats in redder areas than to compromise on certain issues, something that has recently been exemplified by the election of a DNC Vice Chair that celebrated the loss of an Alaska Democrat. I think if this strategy continues, they will go decades without retaking the Senate and likely struggle to win enough swing states to take the Presidency again either.

1iu4qpq,CMV: the Democratic Party isn’t up for this,"For context, I’ve been politically active my whole life in the US and have pretty much always been a democrat, volunteered for campaigns, flew to Nevada for this election, etc. 

It pains me to say it, but the party isn’t up for the task of dealing with what’s happening right now and is essentially a failed party, in need of near wholesale change at the leadership level. 

Here are the main points:
1- they don’t know how to get media attention
2- they have no actual plan to resist the trump administration 
3- they have no clear articulate message for what they stand for, leaving a vacuum for maga to fill it in for them 

Chuck Schumer’s grand resistance plan was to release a new bill to counter the dismantling of federal agencies (and called it “stop the steal”) and it made zero news. 

The opposition party needs to be rising to the level of intensity in this moment. Sit ins on the house floor, getting arrested if need be. They need to be running ads and other paid media now like if they were running a campaign. They need to be a real political party. 

Every day that goes by without major fight is a lost opportunity and shows that they just aren’t up for it.

1imbzi7,CMV: Trump Will Mark the Beginning of the End of the U.S. as a Global Superpower,"For the past 80 years, the United States has been *the* dominant Western superpower—militarily, economically, technologically, and culturally. However, Trump's presidency, particularly his second term, has made it clear to the rest of the world that the U.S. can no longer be relied upon as a stable military ally or a self-regulating democracy with effective checks and balances.

For decades, much of the Western world has relied on the security and global leadership of the U.S., particularly through NATO. But now, many of us are waking up to the reality that this reliance is no longer viable. Regardless of the fact that a significant portion of Americans oppose Trump and everything he represents, the fact remains: the country elected him—*twice*. This suggests one of three possibilities:

1. A deliberate and conscious choice by the public to embrace Trump’s leadership.
2. The result of institutions so weakened, corrupt, or manipulated that public ignorance was effectively engineered—potentially by external forces that stand to benefit (it would certainly align with known Russian geopolitical strategy).
3. A mix of both—some voters knowingly supporting him while others were misled by systemic dysfunction.

I say this as someone from Spain, where, like many other European nations, we have neglected our own capacity for self-defense, relying instead on NATO and the security provided by an allied nation that spends more on its military than the rest of the world combined in any given year. But Trump's America has demonstrated that this reliance is no longer sustainable.

In just three weeks (!) since his second inauguration, Trump and his administration have already threatened military action in **Panama, Gaza, Greenland**, and have come dangerously close to doing the same with **Canada**—one of the closest and strongest alliances in the world. Instead of military threats, he has chosen economic coercion to undermine Canada’s sovereignty.

People are not stupid. You can call these tactics “negotiation strategies,” “distractions,” or whatever justification you want—but that doesn’t change the long-term consequences. Whether intentional or not, Trump’s actions have made it clear that NATO, Europe, and the broader Western world can no longer depend on the United States as the so-called “world police” (a sentiment that has existed since Vietnam and solidified with Iraq).

European leaders are already acknowledging this, openly discussing the need for greater military and economic independence. And while Europe has its own issues—particularly the resurgence of far-right populism—Trump’s second term offers a *real-time case study* in how democratic institutions can be undermined from within. This might, hopefully, give European governments enough time to reinforce their own institutions before a similar phenomenon takes root here.

Beyond geopolitics, Trump’s America is also self-sabotaging its academic and technological leadership. The U.S. has long attracted the brightest minds in science, technology, and research, but under Trump, those systems are being crippled. If you are a top researcher, why would you choose to work in a country where:

* Salaries might be higher, but the quality of life is worse?
* You have unrestricted access to guns but limited reproductive rights?
* Free speech is celebrated on social media but censored in academic research?

This will inevitably lead to *brain drain*, further accelerating the decline of U.S. leadership in innovation, science, and education.

Yes, in the short term, Trump’s aggressive trade policies might secure *favorable* economic deals, but they come at the cost of severely damaging U.S. alliances and international trust—possibly beyond repair. It does not matter if Trump comes out tomorrow, apologizing for everything, and saying he is sorry (lol). Why would any country *trust* the U.S. again in the next 20 years?

I don’t see a way back from this. CMV. ",hakezzz,5465,0.8399999737739563,996,1739209340,2025-02-10 11:42:20,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1imbzi7/cmv_trump_will_mark_the_beginning_of_the_end_of/,2,2025

If your goal is to increase waste, fraud, and abuse, you would fire the inspectors general (as the Trump admin has done). This makes it easier to avoid oversight. 

If your goal is to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse, you would not hire the world’s richest man to do alleged audits when his companies have billions in contracts with the government. Fat chance he is going to investigate any of his company’s contracts.

1izkhsl,CMV: The image of the US police force will never recover because of the mindset on using unmarked/stealth cars,"I firmly believe that the police force image in the US will never heal until they adopt a mindset similar to Europe. Most European countries use brightly marked cars for their police force because you're supposed to easily identify and approach them. 

 The US police force and their image will always be at odds with their citizens as long as they regularly use stealth/unmarked cars. Every encounter turns into a sneaky gotcha moment and are what keeps people distrustful. Extends to their uniforms too. Most wear some form of black or blue as it helps them blend in. There's no reason unless your mentality is to surprise.

There's a time and place for unmarked cars. That time and place is when you have a perp or bust you know about in advance. Not a random encounter with a citizen. They operate like every encounter is a sting operation. IMO they'll continue to fail unless that changes.

1ioyoy4,CMV: TikTok should have been permanently banned in the US,"When TikTok was temporarily blocked in the US back in January, I uninstalled it, thinking it was gone for good. Turns out, it was only down for a few hours, but even now, downloading it from the App Store or Play Store is still impossible. New users can’t get it, and anyone who deleted it—like me—was locked out.

Yesterday, I saw a post on Reddit saying that TikTok is now letting people install it again through [tiktok.com/download](https://www.tiktok.com/download), bypassing the app stores entirely. So technically, nothing is stopping me from reinstalling it… but I don’t want to.

I used to spend 2-3 hours a day on TikTok. When I uninstalled it, I expected to replace it with something else—another app, another distraction. But that never happened. I just stopped wasting time. Now, looking back, I don’t think I was enjoying TikTok as much as I was just stuck in it.

This whole situation made me realize that maybe the ban should’ve been permanent. If TikTok had stayed fully blocked, millions of people would’ve naturally moved on, like I did. But now that it’s creeping back in, people are rushing to reinstall it without questioning whether they actually need it.

1ip1btt,"CMV: MEN, if you want a stay at home trad wife, then you directly support alimony.","Men generally say they want a traditional wife, who stays home, raises the kids, and takes care of the household. At the same time, these same men complain that alimony is unfair to men in divorce cases.

They conveniently forget that alimony literally exists because women historically weren’t allowed to work, and even today, women still often sacrifices their career to be a full time homemaker, she loses years (or even decades) of work experience, skill development, and retirement savings. If the marriage ends, she’s at a serious financial disadvantage compared to her husband, who continued earning, advancing in his career, and securing his financial future.

The very tired rebuttal I always get from my fellow is essentially “women initiate most divorces, so they shouldn’t get anything.” If a woman spends 20 years raising kids, maintaining the home, and supporting her husband’s career, only to file for divorce (and you believe she should walk away with nothing just because she initiated the divorce) then you never truly supported the trad wives to begin with. You supported a system where she financially depends on her husband, but the moment she decides to leave, you think that dependence should be punished.

If you genuinely believe in the traditional roles, you also accept the responsibility that comes with it. If a woman devotes her life to supporting a man’s career and raising his children, why should she be left with nothing if the marriage ends?",Cajite,2250,0.8399999737739563,1327,1739503345,2025-02-13 21:22:25,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ip1btt/cmv_men_if_you_want_a_stay_at_home_trad_wife_then/,2,2025
1iqpkgw,"CMV: The increasingly vague usage of ""DEI"" as a term is to help enforce segregationist policy or silence/invisibility","Terminology is a powerful thing, when we stop using words'meanings we can start to divorce and lose the concepts. Diversity, equity inclusion, and accessibility are very generalized terms for potentially dozens to hundreds of different forms of programming and initiatives. Increasingly it has been used as a dog whistle term much like affirmative action to be a stand in for the Boogeyman of racial quotas. However that fails to really address the increasingly broad application of the concept by those seeking to destroy it. This broad application of the term appears to be used to essentially mean: Any acknowledgement of non-white, non-cis, non-able bodies, judeo-christian men is considered an extension of DEI.

Recently plaques were covered that the  Cryptology Museum in Maryland and women in STEM have found articles about their work or even mentioning their being highlighted have evaporated. How does acknowledging the hard work overcoming historical obstacles do harm? How does it detract from society and how does hiding them improve the federal government or save money? Rumors are surfacing that National Park Services staff are not only facing firing but are being asked to scrub local history, especially as it related to ""DEI"". As many may know cancer and other medical research *needs* a focus on gender, race, etc. (Data  doesn't care about whether the  population fits our ideals, data is data and not having that data is a problem for real people of all kinds). It simply appears that acknowledging unique history or the struggles of a group are being seen as innately un-American which was a common Civil Rights refrain. MLK, SNCC, was seen as just as un-American as the Black Panther Party or even their white allied organizations. To speak on Rosa Parks or to just state facts about the Stonewall Riot is framed as unnecessary in the context of anti-DEI and removed from historical and state documentation.

What furthers my belief is the release of DOGE's plan to essentially move from eliminating programs to an undefined description of firing any employee tied to DEI activity...without ever defining it oreven limiting it to ""Within their official role as a federal employee"". Based on that idea, going to a PRIDE parade, being a member of the NAACP, or potentially having been in a student union in college could be reason to let someone go. What's to stop a group of DSS workers from being fired for making their own little work group to trade tips for managing ADHD? What would stop an investigation from happening because a senior engineer decided to take three autistic new hires to lunch because that engineer also is autistic and just is happy to spend time with similar peers? Would an HBCU graduate speaking at an HBCU graduation be a problem? Increasingly the answer is all of these situations are suspicious and harmful because the definition is intentionally broad

 Quite frankly, there's no definition of ""DEI"" which is much scarier than affirmative action because it could be applied in incredibly sweeping generalizations.

If this anti Diversity and accessibility crusade was about unfairly focusing on historically marginalized groups harming people with more historical access to baseline opportunities etc. Why would we need to erase any mention of the past acknowledgememts or stop anything regarding research in the medical field? If this is about stopping unfairness then why isn't DEI more narrowly defined and why would they go after individuals generally involved in any ""DEI programming?

It is not logical to believe it is harming a white man to also study why prostate cancer is having X affect more often on Asian men. There is no tangible benefit to anyone in that example and perhaps general risk to both groups due to not identifying or isolating unique information that may further our general understandings.

1isgi09,CMV: Claims that Kamala should’ve “been more progressive” are out of touch with reality,"I'll be responding to a talking point  
  
**""Being more progressive would've energized her base"".** No. It would not have energized her base, it would have energized *you*. Progressives are not, and never have been, the base of the Democratic Party. Progressivism is something that was introduced to us 10 years ago by someone who wasn't even a democrat (Bernie), and both times (2016 & 2020) the voters said ***no***, decisively.

Now with that in mind, why would she try that strategy again? It's pretty simple lol.

1ig5g5l,CMV: Trump's focus on politically loyalty over expertise resembles Soviet-Era communist failures.,"Trump, today, is making no mystery of the fact he is firing anyone in government who would enforce a law he ""does not like"" or ""thinks is stupid"" (sorry, 47 admin's wording there). While you hear much about parallels to alt-right fascism, I am actually more reminded of the failures of East Germany and the USSR.

The mentality looks to be driven by two primary engines: the ""unitary executive/committee"" and ""rooting out intellectuals.""

For the unitary executive theory, the USSR and East Germany believed the government existed only to execute the commanding party's agenda. It was acceptable for the executive or executive committee to fire and retaliate against anyone in government who acted against the party's political agenda under this framework, even when the actions that instigated firing or retaliation were driven by legitimate laws there to protect society, the environment, etc. I'd offer that this is exactly the Trump/MAGA attitude today. Regardless if federal law dictates employers hire disabled or racially diverse people when they can, it is acceptable to fire the FAA director for following that long-established federal law, because it does not serve the commanding party's interests.

As for ""quieting"" and ""rooting out"" intellectuals, this again seems to be a Soviet-Era failed posture that Trump/MAGA are adopting full-steam. Real, premiere doctors and researchers look set to be stifled from innovation by a bureaucratic system RFK, Jr., will construct with party loyalists. The same can be said with cybersecurity and defense experts, who will face bureaucratic systems designed to stifle and perhaps even retaliate against real scientists any time they present an idea that is at odds with the MAGA-consensus view. I shudder to think what Trump might have in mind for intellectuals who would risk ""humiliating"" him for failed policies and directives, but at the very least we know he is willing to fire and ridicule them through public posts to social media...

All of this to say, people seem very eager to not repeat the horrors of WW2-era fascism in Germany, and certainly there are reasons to be concerned about that in today's climate. But what I see from Trump and Co. today looks very much more like bureaucracy designed to insulate the unitary executive and stifle intellectuals and their innovation unless it serves the political needs of MAGA.

1ijftfn,CMV:  Canada and other US allies feeling bullied by Trump should start to poach its skilled citizens and businesses.,"Trump has essentially thrown the gloves off and turned the US into an untrusted partner.   This is not something that will just go away as US allies know that the next 4 years at minimum and probably longer will show an unstable US that cannot be trusted to do the right thing going forward.  The reason for this is that the GOP now has full control of all 3 govt branches, SCOTUS has a conservative super majority, and no one is holding him accountable.   Any change that could happen in a 2028 election would be viewed as temporary given the US’ swinging pendulum back to right wing extremism.   

To become more competitive against the US, allies should start to look at how to encourage highly skilled scientists, medical professionals, engineers,  ex-military, businesses, etc to immigrate from the US that have either been targeted by Trump, feel endangered by fascism, or simply disenchanted with being a US citizen going forward.  Industries like green power,  tech, higher ed, medical research etc. that feel they don’t have a future would be prime candidates for targeted incentives and proactive recruitment.   

Creating a program like “Canada Wants You” could be seen as an inclusive way to bring more talent and create growth for their economies.   A master plan would need to be created to prioritize industries to fund incentives and recruitment while also considering location to not overwhelm existing infrastructure.  An example would be a country establishing or maturing a space industry and targeting NASA, SpaceX or Boeing engineers to emigrate to their country. 

 

Counter arguments may be: 

\-Canada or other allies don’t have the money to incentivize large scale immigration:  This would be a fair argument, but investing in the future to become more competitive would be worth taking on debt.

\-Other countries don’t have the same pleasant weather that states like California have:   This would apply to Canada and other countries in northern latitudes, but Spain, France and Italy have decent alternatives for those that simply can’t handle cold. 

\-Individuals may not take the incentive as they have a family: The program would need to take this into consideration that perhaps the immediate family (including adults) would be accommodated as long as they have the means to make money and pay taxes.

\-Trump would retaliate with additional penalties:  No doubt that this would be the case given Trump’s actions lately.   That said, this program would result in a better long-term situation for the country receiving top talent and businesses.   Trump could offer the same thing to the countries by encouraging immigration to the US, but I believe that scientists and skilled professionals seeing what is happening will be turned off by the anti-intellectual behaviors of the US. 

\- Countries can’t handle the additional stress on their infrastructure:  As already noted, a master plan for this program would need to include the infrastructure related improvements to accommodate the additional immigrants.

\- US salaries are much higher than many of the other countries:  This is probably the biggest blocker.    The countries would need to pay for top talent and the country would need to come up with incentives like no taxes for 5 years, bonuses for coming, equity stake etc.  This could also lead to some animosity by the country’s citizens, but like a franchise player getting paid megabucks, it should be worth it if it drives innovation and competitiveness.

1itzpg1,"CMV: The US is firmly now an unpredictable adversery, not an ally to the Western world & should be treated as such.","And we should have been preparing to do it since the previous Trump presidency. 

But with his labelling of Ukraine as a dictatorship yesterday & objection to calling Russia an aggressor in today's G7 statement today Pax Americana is firmly dead if it wasn't already. And in this uncertain world, we in Europe need to step up not only to defend Ukraine but we need to forge closer links on defence & security as NATO is effectively dead. In short, Europe needs a new mutual defence pact excluding the US.

We also need to  re-arm without buying US weaponry by rapidly developing supply chains that exclude the USA. Even if the US has the best technology, we shouldn't be buying from them; they are no longer out allies & we cannot trust what we're sold is truly independent. This includes, for example, replacing the UK nuclear deterrent with a truly independent self-developed one in the longer term (just as France already has), but may mean replacing trident with French bought weapons in the shorter term. Trident is already being replaced, so it's a good a time as any to pivot away from the US & redesign the new subs due in the 2030s. But more generally developing the European arms industry & supply chains so we're not reliant on the US & to ensure it doesn't get any European defence spending.

Further, the US is also a clear intelligence risk; it needs to be cut out from 5 eyes & other such intelligence sharing programmes. We don't know where information shared will end up. CANZUK is a good building block to substitute, along with closer European intelligence programmes.

Along with military independence, we should start treating US companies with the same suspicion that we treat Chinese companies with & make it a hostile environment for them here with regards to things like government contracts. And we should bar any full sale or mergers of stratigicly important companies to investors from the US (or indeed China & suchlike). 

Financially, we should allow our banks to start ignoring FACTA & start non-compliance with any US enforcement attempts.

The list of sectors & actions could go on & on, through manufacturing, media & medicine it's time to treat the US as hostile competitors in every way and no longer as friendly collaborators.

To be clear, I'm not advocating for sanctions against the US, but to no longer accommodate US interests just due to US soft power & promises they have our back, as they've proven that they don't.

1iz61ma,CMV: Trump’s $5 million “Gold Visa” is an invitation for drug lords to set up their base in USA,"Who has $5 million to run away from another part of the world to come to USA. If someone has $5M to spend on a visa, they probably are well established in their own country and the desire to uproot to move here would be minimal, because you can always visit here for free to nominal visa fee for tourism purposes.

Who has $5 million lying around in cash? What type of people are interested in this “Pay to Play” scheme? Here are some type of people I can think of: 

1. Drug lords who can throw money to establish operational bases here. Think the NY fentanyl bureau chief is a Gold visa holder.

2. Some really corrupt people in third world countries who have obtained their wealth illegally. Most probably being investigated or wanted in their own country

3. Terrorist and criminals funded by shadow groups from other parts of the world

4. Countries planting their spies

Who else could possibly want to be part of this Pay to Play scheme?

1iwnuxk,CMV: MAGA is a scam that exploits the working class,"The “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) movement was never about making America great. It was never about empowering working-class Americans or restoring economic prosperity for those left behind by globalization, automation, and corporate greed. Instead, it has always been a scam—a carefully engineered distraction to stoke resentment, sow division, and keep ordinary Americans too angry at the wrong enemies to recognize they are being systematically exploited.

Donald Trump and his billionaire backers built MAGA on the promise of fighting for the “forgotten Americans”—the blue-collar workers who saw their jobs disappear, the rural communities left hollowed out, and the families watching their wages stagnate while their cost of living skyrocketed. He made them believe their suffering wasn’t caused by corporate greed or billionaire tax cuts, but by immigrants, minorities, liberals, and a so-called “deep state” working against them.

It was all a con.

MAGA isn’t a movement for working-class Americans—it’s a branded identity, complete with red hats and rally chants, designed to make its followers feel like they’re part of something bigger while ensuring they never realize they are being exploited. Instead of helping struggling Americans, MAGA’s real function is to distract, divide, and exploit.

Step One: Exploiting Economic Anxiety with False Promises

From the start, Trump positioned himself as a champion of the working class, promising to bring back manufacturing jobs, stop outsourcing, and put American workers first. But every single economic policy enacted under MAGA did the opposite.
- The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Trump’s signature policy, overwhelmingly benefited the top 1%, giving billionaires and corporations massive tax breaks while offering crumbs to working-class Americans.
- Corporations used their tax breaks for stock buybacks, not job creation, further enriching CEOs and investors while leaving workers with stagnant wages.
- Factories continued closing, and automation expanded, eliminating more jobs—a reality Trump never addressed.

Meanwhile, MAGA supporters pay a higher tax rate than many billionaires. While everyday Americans see a chunk of their paychecks disappear to taxes, billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and even Trump himself exploit loopholes, offshore accounts, and special tax breaks to pay far less than the average worker.
- A firefighter or teacher might pay 22-24% in taxes, while billionaires often pay an effective tax rate of less than 10%—sometimes even zero.
- A 2021 report revealed that some of America’s richest people paid zero federal income tax in multiple years, while MAGA supporters were left covering the cost.

The working class is paying for the billionaire class to get richer—yet MAGA convinces them their enemy is a poor immigrant or a liberal college student instead.

Step Two: Manufacturing an Enemy to Hide Who’s Really Screwing You Over

The genius of MAGA isn’t just in its false promises—it’s in its ability to make its supporters blame everyone except the actual people exploiting them. Every time Trump or his allies betrayed the working class, they fed their base a new villain:
- Immigrants are taking your jobs! (Reality: Corporations are outsourcing jobs and automating labor to increase profits.)
- Minorities are getting all the government benefits! (Reality: The biggest beneficiaries of government subsidies and tax breaks are billionaires and corporations.)
- Liberals want to destroy America! (Reality: Billionaires on both sides profit from division while ordinary Americans struggle with rising costs and stagnant wages.)

Instead of uniting Americans against the people who actually rigged the system—corporate elites, Wall Street, and political insiders—MAGA encourages its base to fight a cultural war against their fellow citizens. If you can convince a struggling factory worker in Ohio that their real enemy is an undocumented immigrant in Texas or a lesbian barista in Brooklyn, they’ll never stop to question why their boss just got a massive tax cut while their wages stayed the same.

Step Three: Suppressing the Vote to Maintain Control

MAGA leaders know that if more people vote, their hold on power is at risk. So instead of winning elections through popular support, they focus on voter suppression tactics designed to keep working-class Americans, particularly minorities and young people, from voting.
- Closing polling places in minority neighborhoods makes it harder for Black and Latino voters—who tend to vote Democratic—to cast their ballots.
- Strict voter ID laws disproportionately affect lower-income Americans who may not have driver’s licenses or easy access to government offices to obtain IDs.
- Purging voter rolls under the guise of “election integrity” often removes eligible voters, forcing them to jump through bureaucratic hurdles to re-register.
- Gerrymandering districts to dilute the power of working-class and minority voters ensures that even when MAGA policies hurt the people they claim to help, the system is rigged to keep them in office.

Trump and his allies spread lies about voter fraud not because fraud is a real issue—it isn’t—but because they need an excuse to justify voter suppression tactics that keep power in the hands of the wealthy. If everyone who was eligible to vote actually did, MAGA would collapse overnight.

Step Four: Keeping Americans Distracted with Endless Culture Wars

MAGA is not about policy—it’s about emotion. It thrives on outrage and grievance because if Americans ever stopped fighting each other long enough to look at the policies being enacted, they’d realize they were being conned. That’s why Trump and his allies keep their base hooked on an endless cycle of manufactured outrage.
- Instead of addressing rising healthcare costs, MAGA tells its followers to be mad about trans people in bathrooms.
- Instead of tackling corporate monopolies and stagnant wages, MAGA wants its base obsessed with whether someone knelt during the national anthem.
- Instead of fixing America’s broken education and job training programs, MAGA convinces its base that the real crisis is “woke” teachers indoctrinating their children.

This is not accidental. The more energy MAGA voters spend fighting these battles, the less likely they are to recognize the real scam happening right in front of them.

Step Five: Keeping the Working Class Down and Powerless

The final piece of the puzzle is ensuring that working-class Americans stay frustrated, poorly educated, and economically insecure—because an empowered, informed working class would be a threat to billionaire rule.
- MAGA Republicans push massive cuts to education funding because an educated population is harder to manipulate with lies and propaganda.
- They work to gut workers’ rights and labor protections because if people had strong unions and higher wages, they wouldn’t be as desperate or easily controlled.
- They fight against universal healthcare because nothing keeps people more dependent on their jobs (and less willing to fight back) than the fear of losing health insurance.

The system isn’t broken—it’s working exactly as intended. Billionaires don’t want independent, secure, well-educated Americans. They want a desperate, divided, easily misled population that will keep voting for the very people exploiting them.

The Hard Truth: MAGA Is a Scam—But Its Victims Keep Defending It

The tragedy of MAGA is that its biggest victims are the ones defending it most fiercely. Millions of working-class Americans, manipulated by fear and resentment, have been tricked into fighting for billionaires who are actively making their lives worse. They cheer for tax cuts they’ll never see, fight for industries that will never return, and defend a system that ensures they remain trapped in a cycle of economic frustration.

And when the next election comes, they’ll be told once again that their real enemies aren’t the billionaires hoarding wealth, the corporations sending jobs overseas, or the politicians voting against their interests. Instead, they’ll be told to blame immigrants, minorities, LGBTQ+ people, college students, and “coastal elites.” And once again, the cycle will repeat—because as long as MAGA keeps Americans angry at each other, they’ll never turn their anger toward the people actually responsible.

MAGA isn’t about making America great again. It’s about making sure the rich stay rich, the powerful stay in control, and the working class stays too divided and misled to do anything about it.

1ijh6od,CMV: Trumps true agenda is to create outrage and confusion so people are distracted and scattered and the left is falling right into the trap,"Panama, Mexico, Canada, Gaze, Greenland, China. Every single day of every single hour, Trump and his admins are saying crazy shit that they have no intention of doing or no ability to do, in an effort to pass their true agenda which is siphoning off wealth from the United States. 

[Ezra Klein explains it perfectly ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s)here talking about Steve Bannon: ***""The opposition party is the media, and  because they're dumb and they're lazy they can only focus on one thing at a time all we have to do is flood the Zone. Every day we hit them with three things they'll bite on one and we'll get all of our stuff done bang bang bang these guys will never will never be able to recover""***



This is exactly what is happening. We are falling for it. The airtime that a lot of his verbal garbage has gotten in the past two weeks is a smokescreen for what is going on behind the scenes. 

  
People are falling into the trap of letting themselves be distracted (including myself). There cannot be any organized movements or coordinated efforts of masses of people listening to federal employees and appointed officials because everyone is spread thin between outrage and fighting about Gaza, Trump Coin, Greenland, Tariffs, Nata, Ukraine. There is no singular point to focus on.

  
Trump knows that a lot of what he says will not get passed, but it does not matter. Because the lying, deceit and corruption is so normalized. 



I just don't see how these past two weeks have been anything other than the democrats/non-maga people being anything other than helplessly playing into his hand. At every point he wins. Even when he looses he wins because nobody cares. He controls the spin. As far as he and his supporters are concerned he wins every single encounter. 

Trump is using the tinkerbell effect to certify himself as the winner. He won the tariffs because he has the largest microphone and everyone who is glued to watch his daily outrage are falling into his web. His ratings, his ""bad publicity is better than no publicity"". The mass confusion. 



Am I wrong? I feel that Project 2025 and Steve Bannon laid out that plan years ago. Like Brave New World, the true dystopian nightmare is that the truth is not some hidden conspiracy. It's out there in the open with everyone to see and hear. But everyone is so scattered and disjointed that no change can happen because the constant attack on our focus by fueling endless rivers of garbage idiotic manufactured outrage tricks people from proactively resisting this takeover.",Extension_Fun_3651,1309,0.8600000143051147,229,1738885546,2025-02-06 17:45:46,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ijh6od/cmv_trumps_true_agenda_is_to_create_outrage_and/,2,2025

As I've gotten older its very hard to ignore the obvious things i see around me. Almost all crimes in my area are by black people. In my schools the people getting in fights, disrespecting teachers, all black. When I'm walking on the street or in public transportation, only black people will threaten me, be obnoxiously loud on the phone, or play loud music disregarding everyone else.

So when i'm walking home at night and see a black person with a hood up coming towards me, I do cross the road, the past 20 years of my life have taught me that.

1izqtzv,CMV: The Economic Blackout Boycott will fail entirely.,"I believe the Economic Blackout Boycott on February 28th will fail entirely because the threat of no sales for a day is effectively null.

Let’s say the movement includes 100% of all adults in the US (It most certainly will not). Even if they all stop buying most large scale companies will have customers outside of the US. And for there to be any effect on companies it would need to at least last several months. They’re threatening literally nothing. Most people don’t even buy things every day so many won’t even do anything different.

Even if they decided to make it last 4 months most people can’t do that. You’ll find that every product you buy somewhere in the chain will have a mass produced item from a huge company. And most items can’t be made at home. This won’t be like the colonial times where people could make the goods at home with some decreased quality. You cannot simply make gasoline at home or build a computer chip entirely from scratch. 

Plus this only affects individual consumers not any of the companies that receive stock from them. And what about those little businesses you care about so much that receive some of their product from the large corporations. 

Once the boycotts over people will go back to buying what they would’ve bought yesterday. And if they were to continue the boycott for months then what happens when companies start to fire employees. People are now losing jobs because of your silly little boycott. You’re harming the people too. Obviously this won’t happen cause people aren’t gonna boycott literally everything except the Amish run companies who run entirely separate from the rest of society. 

If you want to make a change then you need to target specific companies that you can live without, are entirely based in the US, and boycott them for months to years. 

This entire “boycott” is barely even a boycott. Your not exercising your power over the mega corporations your showing your reliance on them and unwillingness to go without the essentials for more than a day.

1iy3g36,"CMV: Russia should be held accountable for invading Ukraine, and they shouldn’t be allowed to veto their own punishment","Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a clear violation of international law and sovereignty. The fact that Russia, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, can veto any resolution aimed at holding them accountable is deeply troubling. It’s like allowing a criminal to veto their own punishment—how can we expect justice when the perpetrator has that kind of power?

The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly condemned Russia’s actions (93 to 18), but the Security Council’s structure gives Russia the ability to block any real consequences. This is not just a flaw in the system; it’s a serious issue that allows a nation to act out wildly, without facing the repercussions of their aggression.

If Russia is allowed to continue this unchecked, it sets a dangerous precedent where powerful countries can invade others and avoid consequences simply because they have the power to block action. That’s not how international law should work. If we believe in sovereignty and accountability, we need to reform the U.N. and prevent Russia from using its veto to avoid facing the consequences of its actions.

How to change my view: 
If presented with evidence that Russia was not in the wrong in invading Ukraine, and that somehow it was Ukraine’s fault, I would be open to reconsidering my position. Also, if you can explain to me how having five permanent powers in the U.N. is more fair, especially when those countries are acting in bad faith, and how it’s justifiable for them to have a veto on being held accountable for their actions, that would also help change my perspective.",PoolShotTom,1238,0.9399999976158142,222,1740511643,2025-02-25 13:27:23,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1iy3g36/cmv_russia_should_be_held_accountable_for/,2,2025
1ir5tyk,CMV: Trump Misunderstands Trade Deficits and It’s Hurting Americans,"Trump repeatedly claims that a trade deficit means the U.S. is “losing” money to other countries. This is fundamentally incorrect. A trade deficit is not government debt—it simply means a country imports more than it exports. In reality, trade deficits can be a sign of economic strength, and Trump’s misunderstanding of this basic concept has led to misguided trade policies that hurt both American businesses and consumers.

**1. A Trade Deficit is Not Like Owing Money**

The U.S. trade deficit means Americans buy more goods from other countries than they sell abroad. But that doesn’t mean money is just disappearing. Foreign countries use their U.S. dollars to invest back into the American economy, whether through purchasing U.S. stocks, bonds, or real estate. The U.S. benefits from a trade deficit because it gets cheap imports, which lower costs for consumers and businesses.

**2. The U.S. Trade Deficit is Largely a Result of American Economic Strength**

The U.S. has a massive trade deficit in goods, but a surplus in services (like finance and technology). Americans have more disposable income than many other countries, so they buy more imports—that’s a sign of consumer power, not weakness. A strong U.S. dollar makes imports cheaper, which naturally contributes to the trade deficit.

**3. Trump’s Tariffs Backfired and Proves he Doesn’t Understand Trade**

Trump’s tariffs on China didn’t reduce the trade deficit—they actually made goods more expensive for Americans. Instead of fixing the deficit, Trump’s policies led to retaliatory tariffs, which hurt American farmers and manufacturers. The damage was so severe that Trump had to approve a $28 billion bailout for farmers during his first term to offset their losses. If his trade policies were actually working, why did U.S. farmers need a government bailout? The trade deficit with China remained high because businesses just shifted supply chains to other countries like Vietnam and Mexico. The U.S. International Trade Commission reported in 2021 that tariffs raised prices between 1.7% and 7.1% in the ten most affected sectors, including apparel, car parts, furniture, and computer equipment. These findings are one of the many studies that indicate tariffs often result in increased costs for consumers, as importers and retailers adjust prices to offset the additional expenses.

**4. If Canada Stopped Exporting Oil, It Would Run a Trade Deficit With the U.S.**

Trump loves to complain about the U.S. trade deficit with Canada, but he ignores that it’s largely because Canada exports massive amounts of oil and raw materials to the U.S. If Canada stopped exporting oil, it would run a trade deficit with the U.S. because it imports more U.S. manufactured goods than it sells back in other sectors. Said raw materials and crude oil are then refined and manufactured into higher-value products by American companies, who sell them for a profit. This means the U.S. isn’t just “losing” money to Canada—it’s leveraging Canada’s exports to fuel its own industries. Trade deficits don’t mean one country is “winning” and another is “losing”—they’re just a reflection of what different economies specialize in.

Trump sees trade as a zero-sum game where the U.S. “loses” if it imports more than it exports. However, that’s not how trade works. Trade deficits can actually be beneficial, and Trump’s ignorance on this issue has led to harmful policies that hurt American workers, businesses, and consumers.",ChazzioTV,1201,0.8700000047683716,232,1739748544,2025-02-16 17:29:04,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ir5tyk/cmv_trump_misunderstands_trade_deficits_and_its/,2,2025

Now Trump is repeating that same narrative, right when U.S. support for Ukraine is on shaky ground.

Many conservatives praised Elon Musk for taking over Twitter, saying he would restore free speech. But under his leadership, Twitter has banned journalists who criticized him, suspended accounts tracking his private jet, and suppressed posts from political opponents.

If it was wrong for Twitter to censor conservatives before, why is it okay now?

Some conservatives argue that businesses should be free from government interference. But in states like Tennessee and Florida, they’ve pushed for laws restricting drag performances and LGBT content, even in private businesses.

If conservatives oppose government control over businesses, why support laws dictating what people can perform or express?

Conservatives often defend companies rights when it comes to political donations or free market decisions. But when companies take stances they don’t like, such as Disney opposing Florida ""Don’t Say Gay"" bill, suddenly they advocate for government retaliation.

1iy695u,"CMV: White men and Christians are NOT being “attacked” or “persecuted”. They are just experiencing public backlash and being held accountable for the first time, and now, they are playing victim.","I keep seeing this rhetoric about how Christianity and the white male is under attack in America. I believe that these populations are just finally experiencing backlash , made possible with things like the internet and free speech. 

Take the “make loneliness epidemic” for example. Young men have began blaming everyone but themselves for not being able to find a girlfriend. With women becoming more independent over the past several decades and moving away from the trad wife role, they’re now able to be a little more picky . Theyre also making more money on their own. There’s no reason to settle for someone who isn’t right for them in the long term, whereas in the past, women felt much more obligated to men  because of the dependence dynamic. 

Because the trad wife / male provider idea has been around for a while, young men are still being raised to believe women need them, that women must be homemakers, and they feel entitled to a wife. Men never had to try very hard in the past too find a wife because , like i said, women were not in a position where they could be picky. Now, women are getting educated and working , and men are falling behind because they never saw value in that, and just assumed they would magically get a wife someday. There are so many men nowadays who expect a trad wife , but without themselves playing the role of the provider. They get pissed whenever women don’t like them , all because women have much higher standards and expect to be treated with the same amount of respect as anyone else. Men don’t realize they are not entitled to a wife, and there’s no reason for any woman to be with them if they don’t want to be. So now They just start blaming women for “asking for too much” , they blame the government for everything being expensive and not being able to make more money than their woman counterparts, they blame “woke” for everyone becoming “too sensitive and entitled”, etc. They blame everyone but themselves for the situation they’re in, they take no accountability, and now they’re playing victim. 

It’s similar with Christianity. Christianity was always , *AND STILL IS*, the majority religion in the USA. However, with the country evolving and being more accepting of lifestyles outside of the traditional Christian life, and with the internet giving more voice to people to express their disdain for the religion, they now think they’re under attack. All that’s really happening is that people are freely voicing their opinions about the religion , and how they feel the religion has been harmful to their existence in some way. There have been no laws or regulations passed that outlaw or hinder the practice of Christianity in any way, in fact, white Christian men are currently running the country. 

They just feel that the very existence of anything outside their view of traditional family values is an attack. Being allowed to fly a pride flag at a school is not attacking Christianity. Trans people simply existing in public spaces is not an attack on Christianity. Gay marriage is not an attack on Christianity. if the person certifying the marriage is a Christian, and is obligated by law to certify that marriage, that is not an attack on Christianity. Allowing other ideals and belief systems to exist in the same space as Christianity is not an attack on Christianity. If a gay man gets online and expresses his disdain for the religion , because his Christian family disowned him, that is not an attack on Christianity. That is someone voicing their opinion, which they are allowed to do, and that is someone who is having an emotional response to being harmed in the name of Christianity. Not everyone has to agree with or follow your religion. If you can’t take it, don’t dish it out. As long as an entirely Christian government can be elected into office by will of the people, the religion is not being persecuted. There is no reason to play victim. 

TLDR; White Christian men have finally been held accountable for all the oppression and harm they’ve inflicted onto everything they touch. Now, the world is figuring out we don’t need to depend on men or Christianity to survive, and they now must actually earn the respect of people. However, they still have the same sense of entitlement they had before, they aren’t trying at all to catch up with society and other part, and are now playing victim all because no one views them as superior anymore— hint, they never were superior. The “male loneliness epidemic” proves this , with white men feeling entitled to the respect of women,  and the Christian “traditional family values”.

1ihplop,cmv: Pro-lifers that carve out exceptions for rape are morally inconstant.,"I would like to start by saying that this is not a pro-life vs pro-choice post. That's not the point of this CMV, so I won't be engaging with the comments that are arguing for/against pro-life.

In the discussions on reddit about abortion, you'll often see pro-choicers demonize pro-lifers for not carving out exemptions  for rape when they are discussing their views. You'll see pro-choicers justify their view by saying that someone shouldn't carry their rapists baby. This is a completely fair view with in the context of bodily autonomy. The problem is that this view doesn't matter in the context of ""all human life has some inherent value"" the way that pro-lifers believe.

The life of someone who was conceived by rape isn't any less valuable than the life of someone who was conceived in some other manner. So for the people who believe that all human life has some inherent value and should be protected, why would it make sense for them to carve out exceptions for rape?

Why wouldn't it be considered morally inconsistent if they make those exceptions?

1ig96ua,"CMV: There will be a US presidential election in 2028, but it will not be free or fair.","As we know, in the final months of the last Trump administration, President Trump, along with many Republican politicians both in Congress and in his administration, tried to overturn the result of the 2020 election. This culminated in the botched coup attempt on January 6th 2021.

Trump did this without the support of the broader government bureaucracy or the military, and nevertheless got surprisingly close to succeeding, or at least to causing the greatest constitutional crisis since the civil war. As I write this, he and his new administration are working to reshape the federal workforce, rooting out, deliberately or not, all those who wouldn't cooperate with a second coup attempt.

Further, while the attempt in 2020/21 was unsuccessful, no one at the top has faced any real consequences, least of all Trump himself. Nothing has happened since 2021 that might convince him that a second coup attempt is not worth it.
  
As a result, I believe that Trump and his administration will try again, one way or another, and that this time there's a good chance they'll succeed. 

To change my view, you'd have to convince me that either:
1) Trump did not try to overturn the 2020 election result, or;
2) he did but has since changed his mind and would leave office peacefully in 2029, or;
3) another coup attempt would most likely fail. 

Clearly, as Trump's re-election shows, there are a huge number of Americans who don't agree with me on this - so what am I missing?


Notes:

I think for clarity I should point out that I'm aware that constitutionally Trump cannot run in 2028. I'm assuming here that the Republican candidate in the next election will be either Trump's anointed successor, be that JD Vance or whoever else, or even Trump himself utilising some kind of loophole.

Similarly, I've deliberately not discussed the exact mechanism(s) by which the 2028 election could be subverted. I think that a sufficiently powerful executive would have several viable options, and that the specifics of each are besides the point. Nevertheless, as stated above, I'm open to being convinced that it simply can't be done.

As events have gone on, I've had many discussions in person and online regarding things. I've been somewhat politically active in person, more than most, and I think that's where my hope is slashed - I've done the bare minimum and sacrificed little. And as far as I can see, there are less than 50k people in the entire country are willing to even get off their chair for a couple hours.
  
Most Americans won't take a penny out of their pocketbook to enact change. Hell 40% of them couldn't even bother to vote, even if they had their ballots mailed directly to them! 
  
Precisely nobody is doing anything to stop what appears to be a constitutional crisis, but hey, get owned eggs rose in price! That should get everyone out of their chairs. Cost so much it's unaffordable to doordash them!
  
Change requires sacrifice and Americans just won't do it. Costs too much to protest. Rush hour traffic. Might be seen by boss. 
  
And the haunting fact that 1/3-1/2 of the country approves of what's going on doesn't make me feel better. But a million of them showed up for their guy. None have shown up to stop theirs.
  
I hope someone can change my view. It makes me feel quite alone. I see someone here or there don't feel as alone, but then again, a million showed up to try to forcefully keep Trump in power.

1isdzij,CMV: r/Conservative posts are getting pushed to the front page with little engagement,"Posted this in r/nostupidquestions originally, but it was removed for being a rant, so hopefully I can get an answer here. So, like some others have also noted, I’ve been getting more posts from the conservative subreddit pushed to my popular page, and I noticed that there’s a big discrepancy between the upvotes on the post itself versus the top level comments.

Here's what I mean:

Political and current event posts usually get a LOT of engagement, a post that has ~4000 upvotes usually has a top comment with upvotes between 800 to 2400, but the r/conservative posts that are getting around 4k votes have top comments around 200. 

Why such a huge difference? Are people really scrolling through Reddit, upvoting the post but not reading or voting on any of the comments?

On top of that, the comments are weird too. I know it’s a heavily moderated subreddit, but the comment count versus the amount of comments you can actually see is an order of magnitude in difference, and when you click on the collapsed replies most of them have nothing there. Don’t removed comments show as deleted?

I realize that I might just be ignorant of how Reddit works, and I’m not trying to make this a political post. I’m genuinely looking for an answer here, and thanks in advance.

1igar20,CMV: DEI was a Trojan horse that killed affirmative action and acted as a midwife to MAGA,"DEI was used by corporations to gain social and societal currency. It has always been performative, virtue signaling lacking in intellectual rigor. It has been used as a trojan horse to force ultra leftist identity politics down everyone’s throats, and as a result inadvertently hijacked the black liberation movement. 

Affirmative Action (AA) was born out of the black liberation movement. It had far more teeth and had actual legal backing. DEI stripped it of its power by shifting the focus from enforceable systemic correction to voluntary corporate optics. With affirmative action, failure to act had real consequences. With DEI, failure to act means a company simply updates its branding.

AA mandated hiring goals, quotas, and enforceable accountability measures. DEI, on the other hand is voluntary, self-policed, and lacks any real enforcement mechanism. There’s no requirement to actually hire, retain, or promote diverse talent at scale.

AA was about outcomes, increasing representation through concrete hiring and admissions policies. DEI, in contrast, moved the conversation to “awareness” and “culture”, allowing companies to look progressive while maintaining the same power structures.

AA explicitly targeted **historically oppressed racial groups, acknowledging the need for corrective measures due to centuries of discrimination.** DEI shifted the conversation to include everybody else’s problems.

Since DEI isn’t legally binding, corporations easily and often manipulate it for PR without real investment. Many companies make grand DEI and ESG commitments, but internally have toxic work environments, lay off DEI teams, slow down diversity hiring, and maintain overwhelmingly white leadership. 

It alienated and fueled animus from white men— often making its biggest mistake of openly demonizing white men who were always the primary antagonist for every group. Many DEI initiatives framed white men as the default oppressors while elevating everyone else, often through surface-level representation efforts. Instead of fostering genuine coalition-building, DEI created an “us vs. them” dynamic. This is why I believe it can definitely take some credit for the birth of MAGA. DEI absorbed the language of justice without the obligation to deliver it, effectively neutralizing the radical potential of affirmative action.

DEI became a softer, more palatable alternative to AA. It was designed to placate demands for systemic change while maintaining corporate and institutional power structures. Its blindspot was always white men who were actively ostracized from its objectives.

1ij2io3,CMV: Conservative non-participation in science serves as a strong argument against virtually everything they try to argue.,"So many things we are forced to argue these days are talking points that scientific study has already settled. But since there's one side of the aisle that eschews science, we have to work against viewpoints like ""I just know in my mind that such-and-such is true"", which is, needless to say, incredibly frustrating and pointless.

Remember, of course, that even something as simple as collecting historical data and summarizing it counts as a study, and papers are routinely published on those lines. Randomized clinical trials are not the only form of study out there.

Some examples: immigrant crime. So many studies show definitively how immigrants commit FAR fewer thefts, rapes, and murders than native-born citizens, and yet we still have to contend with viewpoints that immigrants are more commonly associated with murder, rape, and theft than the average native-born US citizen. Studies show that gender-affirming therapy very, very rarely causes anyone, *even children*, to regret the therapy they were given, and yet we still have to contend with viewpoints that gender-affirming therapy is likely to screw people up for life. Numerous studies show the effectiveness of all sorts of different types of gun control implementation, and yet we still have to contend with viewpoints that gun control is, across the board, wholly ineffective. 

The most important part of all this, and the part that I hope to discuss the most, is this: if you think the data supports your opinion, *a study would have come out saying so by now*. It mystifies me that people think there are still major stones unturned in the study of everything. Do you realize how hard it is to find a topic of study these days, because of how everything has been studied to death? Why is it that we would all laugh and nod in agreement if I said ""seems like there's a new study coming out every time I breathe"", and this has been true for probably over a century now, and yet you still think maybe we don't have a study analyzing whether gender-affirming treatment actually works? 

It's not even a valid excuse to say that science has a liberal bias...looking at the vote counts of the 2024 US Presidential election, there are at least 75 million conservatives out there. You are really telling me that there was not a single one of those 75 million people who liked science, who had an aptitude for science, who went to school for a scientific field and chose to study some issue that was a big deal to his political persuasion? Not one of the 75 million conservatives did this? Really? *Really?* And if it were a matter of finding a place to publish, are there not numerous conservative research institutes like The Heritage Foundation who would publish your research? Is there otherwise some lack of funding and power amongst conservatives that restricts them from starting journals of their own where they can publish this research? (I hope there's not a single person on the planet who would say yes...)

It's hard to take any angle seriously when it is only argued from a place of internal mental reasoning, rather than from citation of evidence, ESPECIALLY when it is something we should be able to easily settle by looking at the numbers. I rarely, rarely see conservatives do this, and it seriously undermines their credibility. In my experience, they really will answer ""what evidence do you have that X happens?"" with ""common sense"" and they think they've actually scored points in a debate, rather than admitted that they have no proof to back up what they're saying. It's astonishing, really.

1iw2evt,"CMV: If the United States Wants to Raise Funds, It Should Start by Taxing Religious Organizations, Namely Churches","The U.S. has a massive national debt and frequently debates how to raise revenue—whether by increasing taxes on individuals, businesses, or the wealthy. But one major source of untapped funds is religious organizations, particularly churches, which collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars in assets and generate billions in untaxed revenue each year.

Religious institutions currently benefit from 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, meaning they pay no federal income tax, property tax, or investment tax, and members can deduct donations to them. This is justified under the principle of separation of church and state, but I’d argue that exemption is outdated and unfair for several reasons:

1. Churches function like businesses. Many run multi-million-dollar enterprises, own vast real estate holdings, and operate profitable ventures (e.g., book sales, TV networks, investments). Yet, they are taxed less than the average small business. Why should a megachurch be tax-free while a struggling coffee shop pays full taxes?
2. Some churches engage in political activity. Under IRS rules, tax-exempt organizations must refrain from endorsing candidates, yet some churches routinely influence elections and policy. If they want to play politics, they should pay taxes like PACs do.
3. Fraud and lack of financial oversight. Unlike other nonprofits, churches do not have to disclose financial statements. This lack of transparency enables fraud, mismanagement, and wealth hoarding under the guise of religious exemption. Examples include televangelists living in mansions and pastors flying private jets.
4. Taxing churches would be a fairer way to raise revenue. Instead of increasing taxes on middle-class Americans or small businesses, taxing religious organizations could generate tens of billions annually, easing the burden on everyone else.

To be clear, I am not advocating taxing individual donations to religious causes, nor am I saying all churches are corrupt. But if a religious organization accumulates significant assets, engages in business-like activities, or influences politics, it should pay its fair share like any other entity.

While people in impoverished countries were dying in droves, struggling to get access to vaccines, privileged North Americans—convinced by conspiracy theories—thought the government was ""out to get them"" and planned to throw them in camps. And now, those same people overwhelmingly support an actual fascist leader who is literally building camps and prisons for his opposition. The lack of empathy, the complete ignorance of global struggles, and the deep entitlement have turned many into unwitting pawns of right-wing ideology. The avenues of propaganda—from so-called “natural health” influencers lacking critical thinking, to incel culture, to marginalized communities who (rightfully) remember past government abuses but fail to see today’s reality—is staggering. And, of course, the openly bigoted groups who already aligned with right-wing politics only strengthened their position. All of these groups, from different backgrounds, were funneled into the same right-wing propaganda machine—one that thrives on fear, misinformation, and manufactured victimhood.",Forsaken-Feeling3481,507,0.7699999809265137,649,1740497176,2025-02-25 09:26:16,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ixxklm/cmv_the_pandemic_single_handedly_broke_peoples/,2,2025
1ifxdbo,CMV: Most Anti Immigration people are just racist,"I’ve genuinely never seen an anti immigration/ pro deportations person talk about the “issue” of immigration without using racist talking points or bringing up skin color. Whether it be right wing politicians, people in person or people online. I’ve seen politicians call these people “poison” and “vermin” just like how Hitler talked about the jews, and their main focus is Mexicans and South Americans and Africans. Never have I seen them talk about the thousands of Russians, Western Europeans and Canadians that are here illegally. Plus the propaganda about how all immigrants are rapists and gang bangers, which is just factually untrue. There are so many of them here just working to provide for their kids and then there’s a few bad apples in Colorado and they use it to push their agenda that these people are “dangerous criminals”. Miss me with that. 

On top of that, the MAGA party wanting to change “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America”, taking the Spanish option off of their website and ICE detaining people just for speaking Spanish in public seems pretty racist to me. They aren’t going after criminals they’re going after anyone who is brown and speaks Spanish. If they just want to deport the criminals then why are they trying to enter churches and elementary schools??

Trump now wants to start something up in Guantanamo Bay that is more or less a concentration camp. If it’s all about just getting these people out and having them come the “legal way” then why hold them in a camp on in a dangerous place. Also if they’re “pro immigration” as long as it’s legal why is this administration trying to make that process harder??

I’ve never heard a good argument against immigration that isn’t rooted from racism and stereotypes. These people add billions to our social security every year, they pick our vegetables, build our houses, create new jobs and contribute greatly to our economy. Anyone who knows this knows our country won’t be better by getting rid of them, but they’ll just repeat the “they’re all criminals!” And “they’re raping our women!” Until they’re blue in the face with no facts to back it up. Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, how does immigrants being here affect our lives negatively at all?? MAGA just wants them to believe that instead of focusing on the real enemy which is greedy corporations and billionaires.

1ihjhs3,CMV: CDC employees must release public health data regardless of what Trump has decreed,"People don't work for the CDC if they aren't fully committed to the public health of Americans. That commitment is not to the White House or any political party but to the American people.

Trump's insane and immoral executive order to muzzle the CDC threaten the health and lives of *all Americans* and must be ignored for the good of the country. Politics does not supercede public health.

It is the duty of CDC employees to release the public health data that we, as taxpayers, have paid for, regardless of the ravings of a madman in the White House.

A lot of talk is about Luigi and jury nullification, well this is a similar argument. Trump is endangering the health and lives of all Americans—the elderly, the young, working families—all of us.

It is time to rise up and resist this psychopath and do what is the right and moral thing for the country. Publish/leak the CDC data.",Interanal_Exam,469,0.8799999952316284,125,1738681011,2025-02-04 08:56:51,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ihjhs3/cmv_cdc_employees_must_release_public_health_data/,2,2025
1iqp0ed,CMV: There is zero reason for holding cells to be uncomfortable environments,"People can get arrested falsely, well as a matter of fact, they aren't guilty til they are guilty. So why make holding cells look like filth that only a criminal deserve  
  
It’s like being slapped with guilt as soon as you cross a certain line, regardless of whether you’ve even been given the chance to prove your innocence.

Sometimes you can stay in a holding cell for 96 hours before being let go which is a long time for one to go without any stimulation. 

Is there any actual good reason as to why holding cells are a cold damp cell with a rubber bed and a metal toilet other than it being cheap?

1inqpyr,"CMV: if Musk wants to actually fight government waste, he would look to the Pentagon","So far he claims to have discovered a few billion in waste, primarily around foreign aid and domestic programs that the right have associated with DEI programs. In contrast, the Pentagon has failed most if not all of its audits in the past few years. Trillions of dollars are unaccounted for with no tangible assets to back up the spending. Trump and Musk are likely too cowardly to take on the military industrial complex that has been mishandling our tax dollars for years (decades?) and make a real dent in budget deficits so have resorted to going after programs that represent <0.1% of the federal budget because they can use buzzwords that appeal to their nationalist base. There is hundreds of billions of dollars in waste each year at the Pentagon that will never be addressed.
