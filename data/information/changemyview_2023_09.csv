16glz0r,CMV: The right wing's obsession with trans issues is largely because they have nothing else to talk about.,"I'll be honest. I don't know what the hell is going on with the whole trans thing. I think having a thousand genders is silly and alot of the pronoun stuff also seems weird. 

But I just don't notice it in daily life (and I live in a very liberal city). Trans folk are such a small part of the population, but you would think that there's one in every neighborhood, just waiting to break in and mutilate your family's genitals, considering how the right wing talks about this issue online.

I'm sure that there are many who would genuinely take issue with this stuff anyways, but it seems pretty clear that the *obsessive* nature of the right wing's focus on this issue is because it's an easy, convenient one for them to use as a draw.

They can't talk about the economy

They can't talk about civic health or integrity in office

They have nothing else to appeal to voters, but they can run endless, contextless clips of needledicks like Ben Shapiro or Matt Walsh **""ABSOLUTELY DESTROYING""** some blue-haired college sophomore who doesn't know how to formulate an argument yet.

16tvzqy,CMV: The U.S. Government Should not be Allowed to Shut Down.,"Typically when an indispensable group of people have an upcoming deadline, they are expected to work day and night on a solution.  Instead, members of congress were sent home. 

This should not be an acceptable outcome.  Those in high levels of office should be expected to work as long as it takes until a solution is reached.  It is unacceptable for the ineptitude of 535 people to shut down an entity employing millions, forcing federal employees to go without pay.  

There should be harsh consequences for allowing this to happen. Members of congress should not be able to adjourn until a solution is reached, and those who choose to leave Washington during important negotiations should forfeit their right to participate in all future discussions.  If there is to be a shutdown, Congress should be expected to work day and night until a budget is passed. 

As a side note, it is also absurd that members of Congress continue to be paid when there is a shutdown, but I can accept that risking loss of pay might force people to make hasty decisions and so changing this would do more harm than good.",CabalRamona,1859,0.9399999976158142,579,1695848626,2023-09-27 16:03:46,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16tvzqy/cmv_the_us_government_should_not_be_allowed_to/,9,2023
16cpu33,cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”,"There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

16ig7al,"cmv: 9 times of 10, “cultural appropriation” is just white people virtue-signaling.","There’s a big difference between appropriation and appreciation, and should be fairly easy to distinguish… unless you yourself lack an appreciation and then can’t tell the difference. 
Wearing another culture’s clothes is not “appropriation” if it’s coming from a place of appreciation… in the same way as eating another culture’s food or listening to another culture’s music isn’t “appropriation”. Appropriation would be to APPROPRIATE another culture’s clothes, food or music, by claiming is as YOUR OWN or making a mockery of it.
Drinking tea is not appropriation, claiming it as British is.
See the difference? If you can’t, I think that says more about you. 

Side note: I have had the fortune to travel to many countries, have often worn the clothes of the country I’m visiting or living in, and NEVER ONCE has anyone from that culture been even close to offended… in fact the reactions I have received have ALWAYS been positive. People around the world are so happy and grateful to see someone celebrate and embrace their culture. The only people who have ever acted “offended” are, and I say it as a white person myself, almost always white people getting offended “on behalf” of another culture. Classic virtue signaling, and also what an insulting position to take. I couldn’t possibly enjoy that culture and therefore must be mocking it? Did appreciation just not occur to you?

16sc1lv,CMV: Police should have to be exemplary members of society and constantly abide by the law or lose their job.,"This isn't a debate on law breaking or if its ever ok. It's calling out the double standards of law enforcement.

Everyone can agree that police should at minimum have sound judgement, not be racist, as well as be trusted to protect and serve their community.

Unfortunately that's not common enough. But let's not stop there.

How many cops have you seen driving around on their cell phones? Speeding without their lights on? Illegally parked and not on a call? Making illegal uturns? Expecting free/ discounted food? When I worked in customer service I even had a cop have a tantrum that I couldn't give them the police discount when they were off the clock (I recognized them, as they were a regular)

Yet when starving, hungry people steal food they throw the book at them and put them in jail. They park where nobody else is allowed to park looking for others speeding, when that's all they do all day. Giving tickets for not stopping long enough for right on red and they don't even brake at the red light when nobody's coming. Etc. But it's a hell worthy offense if anyone else does any of this.

Imo an officer should have a dashcam on them at all times in addition to body cams. If they're speeding with no cause, they lose their job. Riding around holding their cellphones? No job. Any offense they ticket others for, if they are caught doing it, no job.

They can't even follow the law and they're supposed to enforce it? The hypocritical cops should just get fired. If they don't care enough about the law to follow it themselves they need to find a new line of work.",JollyMcStink,900,0.9100000262260437,406,1695696792,2023-09-25 21:53:12,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16sc1lv/cmv_police_should_have_to_be_exemplary_members_of/,9,2023
16f3ker,CMV: Writing a letter to a judge as a character reference does not imply you don't believe someone did the bad thing they were convicted of,"This is spurred by the backlash to Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis writing letters as a character reference for Danny Masterson, but it can be applied to many things. 

People convicted of many crimes have others write character references to the judge prior to sentencing, and I don't believe that when that happens they necessarily think the person is innocent.  They are speaking to how they know them outside of the crime committed.  All this is so the judge can get a better picture of the person outside of the crime they have been convicted of and that can influence sentencing.   But at no point is that saying the person is innocent. 

I feel like a lot of the flak Ashton and Mila received is a bit unfair.   They were asked to do this as people who have known him for 20+ years.  They could have said no of course, but he was already going to jail for some period of time.   It didn't say he was innocent.  It didn't say they didn't believe the women who accused him.  All it said was that ""this is the person I know and this is what he did for me"".  

If you feel that these character references have no place in the justice system, that is fine.  But I think being upset that people write them at the request of lawyers is a bit much. 

I also feel that many people would do the same for someone they have known for 20+ years, and people are being a bit hypocritical.    I know if my little brother or close friend committed a crime and was going to jail, it would be hard for me to refuse to do it, even if I agree that they deserve to go to jail.",illini02,777,0.7099999785423279,849,1694360865,2023-09-10 10:47:45,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16f3ker/cmv_writing_a_letter_to_a_judge_as_a_character/,9,2023
16q2x1q,"CMV: All schools should have a mandatory subject about ''after school life'' which cover topics such as student loans, politics and basic law/rights.","The reason for a CMV about this is because to me this sounds like it's obviously a good thing and should most definitely be done, but I'm also fairly certain that there's a reason it's not. I just can't think of a *good* reason as to why it isn't compulsory other than the education system as a whole is outdated and needs an overhaul but it doesn't happen for whatever reason. I don't know too much about this, so excuse the ignorance.   


A subject like this should be compulsory for all students, but passing/failing it has no impact on whether or not they pass school. It should however impact whether or not they're able to apply for a student loan. If they're unable to pass a basic test about how student loans work and what they'll end up paying and the laws about it, then they simply should not be able to get it. It seems irresponsible to have an 18 year old kid take out a contract like that without them understanding the basics of it.   


Other topics covered by this subject should include stuff like basic politics and how the political system works. The consequence for failing this part should be that they're unable to vote ( or at least unable to until a certain age ) with the ability to retake the test as many times as they want, at no cost. I understand some people would strongly disagree with this because they may feel like it's some kind of discrimination and I imagine these would be the same type of people who disagree with voters requiring ID, but I'm fairly certain that the vast majority of people would agree to this. Oh, and also a government ID should be issued to them too at school. Absolutely no reason to not have one. I'm from South Africa and got my ID in grade 10. And if a country like that can get this right, I see no reason for a ''first world'' country to mess it up.   


Of course, this isn't a perfect list of topics that ''should'' be covered, but this is a rough idea on my thoughts. Nitpicking at an oversight or tiny detail is not going to change my view, rather fault the idea itself. The reason I believe this to be the right thing to do has nothing to do with discriminating against illiterate people or people one might believe to be stupid, it is simply there to help someone better understand the world they're stepping into. Failing to understand the basics of something like a loan should be viewed in the same way as failing to understand the contract you're signing where it says '' sign here to  confirm you understand the T&C '', except that this is a test to ensure that you do actually understand the basics of the T&C's

169qn9x,CMV: Politicians should be subject to perjury as a part of their official duties.,"Politicians can have an incredible effect on the lives of people in the country, whether those people are constiuients or otherwise.

When politicians can knowingly lie without fear of consequences it creates a rift on uncertainty and inherent mistrust between the Civil Servant and the people they represent.

I believe that a sworn in Politician who at any time they are acting in an official capacity should be subject to perjury charges if it can be shown that they knowingly lied.

My first thought regarding this is freedom of speech of the politician, however there is already a precedent for temporary removal of that right with members of the Armed Forces, so I don't see why Politicians can't have a similar requirement.

""United States v. Caldwell, 75 M.J. 276 (in the context of freedom of speech in the military, servicemembers do not possess the same broad rights of expression that civilians enjoy; this principle holds true even in regard to interactions between superiors and subordinates).""

I don't think this can be applied to Canidates prior to being sworn in as they haven't yet made an Oath of Office.

I also acknowledge that there are members of Congress, the President, etc who have access to sensitive information that shouldn't be exposed to the public. Under this system, ""I'm not at liberty to discuss that.

16n2hy7,CMV: The only way someone can believe in a religion like Christianity is if they deliberately hold it to a much lower standard of evidence than they hold everything else.,"Most people who are religious practice perfectly sound judgment and fact-based assessment in most other aspects of their life. 

For instance, if you were a car dealer and you tried to sell a Toyota to a Christian, saying, *""This Camry can give you 300 miles per gallon,""* that Christian wouldn't believe it - and rightfully so. The Christian would demand, ""Give me a tremendous amount of evidence before I'll believe such a wild claim."" 

Same if a finance manager told a religious client, ""*Give me $10,000 today and I'll invest it and make it become $1 million in five years.""* The religious person would be rightfully skeptical. That sort of return on one's money would be well-nigh impossible, barring all but the most extreme circumstances or massive fraud.

Yet somehow, when it comes to all the far-fetched claims - that the Red Sea were literally divided in two so people could walk on dry land, that a Flood drowned all humans save eight but also that animals walked pair by pair into the Ark (including several million species of insects and spiders as well - imagine that), that dead people can resurrect, that Jesus was God Himself on Earth.........many Christians believe those to have literally have happened as well. (Yes, I know, not all are Biblical literalists, but many are.)

Then the only logical way to describe this is that these people hold their own religion to a much looser, lower standard of evidence than they demand of everything else. They hold everything else to a strict standard but hold their religion to a loose standard. (Except for religious people who are also conspiracy-theorist quacks - they hold *everything* to a loose standard.)

16n1skp,CMV: Lauren Boebert's most profitable career move right now is to actually launch an OnlyFans page,"With the attention this video has received coupled with her dwindling hopes for a meaningful position in the Republican party, I believe Lauren Boebert has a huge opportunity to mimic the success Joe Rogan made through podcasting by launching an OnlyFans page and embracing adult content creation.  I base this off the following:

1.  She nearly lost her last election and likely has a more difficult one coming up where she's probably lost a significant amount of support after this fallout. Losing her Congressional seat could be the end of her tenure in DC which also diminishes her national profile. 
2. Politically she seems to be in a hole that may only be put past her by becoming Trump's VP. It's possible Trump would enjoy the optics of being next to her on the campaign trail (and I mean this in a literal sense since it seems insiders have labeled MTG to ugly for him) but I think this is a long shot.
3. Sex work has never been more accepted in this country and it's possible Boebert abandoning politics could quickly win people over by championing the legitimacy of adult content. This kind of brand change would get massive attention and be the wind behind her new platform. This country loves giving celebrities second chances and there are PR firms that could turn her into a folk hero in just a few weeks. 
4. I can tell you as a matter of fact that there is nothing more non-partisan than a penis and you are in denial if you don't think people from every political affiliation would not be interested. The amount of interest and money she would bring in would be astounding right now and may be an easier and less stressful career for her.

16wfk2f,CMV: I am a 16 year old Incel who believes he will always be single and wants to change his toxic and misogynistic views on women and dating and let go of my resentment and envy.,"\[Last post got removed due to title not being descriptive enough or something. I got permission from mods for a repost\]  
I dont even know where to start. I decided to make this post because school has started again and I often see people my age and even younger kissing and dating and it upsets me so much. and I dont have anyone to turn to and ask for advice.  
I am 16 years old and havent even kissed a girl yet. I know people say i am too young to worry about that but im sick of it. so many people have sex and date in their teens when they are around my age and when they are even younger. the average age here in the UK is just 16!  
and people all over other places like the usa also have sex and date and it just kills me to know that so many people are easily able to experience what I struggle with so much.  
I fucking hate it when family members, friends, and coworkers ask about who im dating. i hate it so much. I overheard 2 women in a store talk about their sons and one of them said their 13 year old son is a big boy and already has a girlfriend. fuck that just made me seethe so much with envy.  
I have discovered the incel movement and couldnt help but sympathize with them. and I dont mean the psychopathic murderous things. I dont wish harm on anyone.  
Women/girls are the choosers and they always seem to choose some of the douchiest, stupidest, biggest fucking losers and its hard to respect women because of it. its why i have grown to resent them. Some of the girls i have known have cried and complained to their friends how their boyfriend left them, cheated, or doesnt give them much attention. girls for some reason, always seem to go for the brutes that really dont care about them.  
and I wanna make it clear I do not think I am entitled to anything (gosh i despise it when people just throw that word at us). I just feel envious and perplexed at how guys, including some of biggest jerks, easily get girlfriends while i am stuck with my hand and virtual girls. it feels so pathetic.  
I hate having desires to kiss and date girls. if i could turn gay or get rid of these desires i would in an instant. so many guys seem to take it for granted. it seems amazing to be able to hold hands, kiss, and even have sex with girls. girls are just pretty.  
There was this senior girl I had a HUGE crush on. When I walked past her I heard her talking with a friend about her having sex with a guy at her house and how he said he loved her neck.  
I later found out it was this fucking nerdy looking freshman. I saw them kissing outside of school and then I found out she slept with other guys. Before graduation, I planned to ask her out or try to flirt with her and I did but guess what? she fucking rejected me.  
The dudes she slept with werent even anything special. They werent in some band, or in the sports team, nor were they talented or rich.  
yet this fucking loose, shameless, disgraceful, skank of a whore still chose to have sex with these absolute losers.  
as much as i wanna have sex with one, I would happy with just kissing and dating. some of the things i wanna do is take a girl out to a very fun place like a bowling alley, zoo, a carnival, or an aquarium and see sharks and sea lions or even take her to eat ice cream with me at a park. i wanna have fun and live a normal teenage life but i cant because the universe seems to fucking cuck me so much. Girls seem so dirty and horny as guys yet none of them are ever interested in me. NONE. its like im destined to stay single and a virgin.  
not only do i feel pathetic and less of a man and human being in general for not being able to do what billions of people have done and what millions of people, including teens are doing as we speak, but i feel like theres such a void in me that i cant fill. i just wanna cuddle and kiss with a girl who likes me back but none of them do.  
i dont wanna date and have sex when im older. it seems boring and much less fun because you have much less free time and grownups seem so miserable all the time. i wanna do it now that im still young and have lots of free time and energy.  
Plus, I know that not ALL girls are shallow or like toxic assholes. but the ones that dont are always taken. all the good, smart, beautiful girls always have boyfriends.",_Furry_Potato_,645,0.6600000262260437,1055,1696102207,2023-09-30 14:30:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16wfk2f/cmv_i_am_a_16_year_old_incel_who_believes_he_will/,9,2023

I live in MN with some of the worst winter's in the country, so while I appreciate the need for all-wheel drive, I know with certainty it's not an absolute need. And if it is for the rare case, most families have 2 vehicles, other another SUV with AWD capabilities.

Most American families live in the suburbs and do not go off-road. The purchase of an SUV is therefor mostly for show. Minivans sit as high as SUVs, so sight is not an issue. The carrying capacity of minivans is equal to or greater than most SUVs. The gas mileage is equal to or better. The technology and safety features are equal to or exceed SUVs. The ""styling"" or ""craftsmanship"" is, to me, a dubious excuse due to the following: the only thing most SUVs for families has over a minivan is simply a reputation. So, I beleive most families purchase an SUV to impress others or signal a status to other people. 

Great redditors of CMV, help me understand why a family would choose an SUV over a minivan that is simply not a styling or perception issue.",Simple-Young6947,634,0.8500000238418579,485,1695918708,2023-09-28 11:31:48,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16uknvh/cmv_the_majority_of_families_with_suvs_would_be/,9,2023
16ii0kt,CMV: Bad moms don't deserve their child's forgiveness and their presence in their lives,"Even if they change later in life, what happened can't be erased and they basically ruined a huge part of their child's life. 

I know there might be a debate about what a ""bad mom"" is. I would say that if a person considers that their mom played a big part in their unhappiness during their childhood/teenagehood then she is to be considered a bad mom. 

My mom is definitely one of them and I don't think she deserves to have a good relationship with me today, or any relationship at all. 

Around the age of 11 she stopped being affectionate with me. No more hugs, no more kisses, no more cute nicknames, no more good nights in bed.

In middle school, she would criticize my only friend and call her weird, and told me I was becoming weird like her (I became insecure)

She called me an idiot very regularly during that period, compared me to others, belittled me.

She constantly criticized and judged my personality, the way I ate, the way I spoke, the way I behaved, what I talked about, the fact that I was close to my friends...

She wasn't the type of mom who talked to me, asked me how my day was at school, laughed with me, was affectionate, smiled at me... when she spoke to me it was only criticism and negativity.

She was always grumpy and moody. I very rarely saw her smile at home and she always looked at me with side eyes and disgust when I passed in the living room. Because of that, I stayed in my room a lot and almost never spoke to her. She blamed me a lot for that.

I wasn't allowed to invite friends. I wasn't allowed to go to my friends' houses. I wasn't allowed to go out with friends after school, on weekends or during vacations even when I was 20 (or even alone, I never went out except to go to school). I wasn't allowed to have a phone or wear makeup until I was 18. She never gave me money so I couldn't buy anything on my own until I was 18 when I was finally financially independent. I was never allowed to cut my hair. I wasn't allowed to dye my hair either. I wasn't allowed to go to parties even when I was in college. I wasn't allowed to have a boyfriend, especially if he wasn't Muslim. My life was just school and home, I could only go out with my older sister or my mom and my aunt. I would do things behind her back and lie to her because all I asked was ""no"" 90% of the time. No concerts, no trips, no movies, no sleepovers, no beaches, no festivals, no parties, no birthdays even when my friends invited me. She deprived me of many of the pleasures one experiences at that age.

Every time I did things that went against her, something she didn't like, she became very aggressive. She screamed, insulted me (whore, crazy, scum..), grabbed my neck or my arms aggressively, squeezing, spat on me and became even crazier when I held her arms to stop her from hurting me. Sometimes she closed the shutter and the door of my room and forced me to sleep even at 7-8 p.m. after her tantrum.

Her grudge would last for days. She would remind me that she is the mother and that she has all the rights, that I must respect her and do everything she says. She threatened me that I wouldn't go anywhere and that if I tried to escape, she would find me. She had her crazy moments where she would tell me that she wished that I would get sick and disappear so that she would be alone, or that if I tried to escape, she would take a knife and  would stab me and go to jail for that. She's already had phrases like ""you're not my daughter anymore"" (when I was in middle school) or ""shouldn't I have aborted that one?""  in a fit of anger.

Today I'm 26 and I no longer live with her. She changed and became nicer, she has made efforts to sort things out and wish to have a good mother/daughter relationship with me. I still don't think she deserves to have me in her life. Same for other moms who did similar things.

16cj4ib,CMV: Most people's religious beliefs are largely influenced by their societal and familial upbringing rather than a personal search for truth,"I've been thinking a lot about the influence of culture and family on our personal beliefs, especially in the realm of religion. It seems to me that the majority of people tend to follow the religion of their parents or the dominant religion of the region they grew up in. For instance, someone born in a predominantly Christian region might naturally grow up with Christian beliefs, while someone born in the Middle East might be more likely to adopt Islamic beliefs.

While I acknowledge that many individuals do undergo personal spiritual journeys and might change their beliefs over time, I can't help but think that for a significant portion of the global population, religious beliefs are more a product of upbringing and societal constructs than personal exploration.

16nnc07,CMV: Bills to weaken child labor laws are undermining the US's advancements in worker's rights,"I believe that certain bills that are being introduced, such as Florida's HB 49 ([https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/49/BillText/Filed/PDF](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/49/BillText/Filed/PDF)), are a concerted effort to take away worker's rights. 

Florida law currently prohibits 16 and 17-year-olds from working before 6:30 a.m., after 11:00 p.m., or for more than eight hours when there is school the next day. The bill would do away with those restrictions, as well as the requirement for a 30 minute break after four consecutive hours of work.

I believe these types of laws would allow employers to pay less and offer less benefits, under the guise of providing 'spending money' jobs to teenagers. This is effectively rolling back all of the progress that US workers have been fighting to gain for over 100 years, and is moving us down a path of further class separation by offering unequal access to education for children.",ivannabogbahdie,573,0.9100000262260437,165,1695221669,2023-09-20 09:54:29,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16nnc07/cmv_bills_to_weaken_child_labor_laws_are/,9,2023
16ia8w6,CMV: Changing Snow White's race is parallel to changing Black Panther's race,"A new remake of Snow White is currently being made and they've, controversially, changed Snow White’s race. I disagree with this; it comes off as virtue signalling. The character's race was changed to be more diverse, presumably.  
  
Now, I don't see what makes the change in Snow White's ethnicity any different to changing Black Panther to a different ethnicity or race. Snow White’s ethnicity and complexion are integral to her character, hence her name. One relatively 'big' part of the story is her complexion and how she is the ‘fairest of them all,’ and unique because of it. Similarly, Black Panther’s name originates from the Black Panther party and his race is relatively important compared to most characters. \`  
  
Even as a person who leans left (essentially centrist), there is the double standard that much of the left holds. The double standard is the opinion or view that changing a white person’s race is okay, or perhaps even great, but changing a black person’s race is racist and deemed whitewashing. I understand there is some nuance here but I still believe the two things are on a similar level. Whitewashing is bad because it pushes forward the message that being black is ‘bad’ or not desirable. Blackwashing should be seen as bad as it pushes forward the message that whiteness is not desirable. Perhaps the intention of blackwashing in media is to be diverse, but again, I find this to be virtue signalling and there are better ways to go about this… just make new characters or new movies.  
  
In my opinion, race should not be changed if it’s an original and old character, particularly if it’s relatively integral to the character’s identity. Just make new characters.  
  
I assume that I will get replies that point out that Snow White is not Disney’s story and there are many different versions, thus, it’s not necessarily race-swapping characters. But that’s wrong:  
  


>  
Snow White is a live-action remake of the Disney animation classic ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" which debuted in 1937. However, it appears that Disney is approaching the seven dwarf characters in a new way in order to avoid reiterating prejudices from the first animated feature. The lead actress Zegler also hinted at the story's contemporary revisions meant to appeal to the progressive audience during the D23 event.[\[1\]](https://collider.com/snow-white-disney-live-action-remake-release-date-cast-plot/)

  
  
The issue is that Disney and other massive corporations are making *\[x\]* and then advertising it as *\[y\]*. The only reason for this is because these corporations want a bigger audience so they grab nostalgic stories such as Snow White and other classics and then reboot them to get a guaranteed audience. For example, Velma, a TV series where they race-swapped Velma, is hardly the original character- neither are the rest of the characters, really. They marketed the series as Scooby-Doo characters to gain instant and free traction despite the fact they are hardly even the same characters.   
  
So yeah, that’s basically my view. I just don’t agree with the race-swapping of random characters and I think that race-swapping Black Panther is of the same nature as race-swapping Snow White.

16mnb8a,CMV: Millennials and Gen Z are Screwed. Perhaps Irredeemably So...,"In the past decade and a half, the media has been full of stories about how [entitled](https://incafrica.com/ryan-jenkins/this-is-why-millennials-are-entitled.html), [lazy](https://africa.businessinsider.com/careers/gen-z-workers-are-lazy-some-bosses-say-they-dont-do-anything-unless-every-second-of/57pqptd) and unambitious the millennials and gen z cohort are. I do not believe this is entirely accurate for the following reasons:

1. **Academic Inflation (Modern Job Market > Kumite) :** The increased number of kids going to college has been a double edged sword. On one hand, the increased amount of college educated kids means that we have a more sceptical and literate populations which may be good for society. However, while research does seem to suggest that Gen-Z and Millennials are by some metrics the [most educated generation in many countries history's](https://www.businessinsider.in/policy/economy/news/millennials-have-struggled-to-find-well-paid-jobs-despite-being-the-most-educated-generation-its-because-there-are-more-college-degrees-but-fewer-jobs-that-require-them-/articleshow/93913920.cms), it also means that there is suddenly an abundant supply of talent for companies. And all of this ignores the effects of automation, introduction of minorities into the workforce and immigration. The end result of this process is academic inflation which that it has gotten a lot more difficult for the young to secure [jobs](https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/gen-z-set-more-qualified-29264859). Most people that know a Millennial/Gen Z have probably heard of one horror story of how tough it seems to be to get into employment in the modern job market. I believe that this situation is unsalvageable because increasingly we start to see power law distributions being caused by a Matthew effect (i.e. Those lucky enough to gain experience are hounded for jobs while those without are stuck in a loop in which they become more and more undesirable as candidates.) 
2. **Wage Stagnation (Where'd All The Good Jobs Go?):** Following up on my previous point of there being an oversupply of labour, companies have felt no real incentive to hike wages to keep talent. If talent is no longer scarce and can be obtained for cheap due to market . All this has been going on while the cost of living has been on the rise making it a lot [harder](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/wages-have-fallen-43-for-millennials-no-wonder-they-ve-lost-hope/) for people working in these positions to keep up with the cost of living. 
3. **Climate Change (Don't Look Up...No Really):** This one is a lot more controversial. It is well known that our climate is changing. Most of this change is being driven by human activity and is set to have [devastating effects](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/04/harvard-experts-discuss-climate-change-fears/) on life as we know it unless something is done about it. However, most big polluters seem [disinterested in slowing down](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/china-avoids-climate-change-discussion-despite-extreme-weather-2023-08-11/) any pollution efforts if it comes at the cost of their prosperity. Such trends mean that short of a string of very successful scientific breakthroughs, the younger generation seems condemned to live in a world that has far less habitable land area and more susceptible to extreme events. Geoengineering remains a deeply controversial area of research [for many reasons](https://time.com/6264143/geoengineering-climate-scientists-divided/). If things remain as they are, it means we are only left with few other alternatives, the main one being, accept that the situation is irreversible (at least for now,) and buck up and take it.
4. **Sex Recession (An Indicator of Deeper Problems)**: It has been discovered that [marriage](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/does-marriage-make-you-happier/675145/) provides human beings with happiness that is unsurpassed by very few things. This is yet another facet of life in which Millennials/Gen-Zs have been caught lacking by circumstances outside of their control. Due to some of the reasons mentioned above and a lot more that I have left out of this argument, [younger folks are not marrying](https://sundial.csun.edu/168571/print-editions/fact-check-why-younger-generations-are-saying-i-dont/) at the same rates or even showing any interest in performing acts that would make it easier to have a family [(such as engaging in sexual activity.](https://nypost.com/2023/06/01/gen-z-is-having-a-sex-recession-and-here-are-the-reasons-why/)) The impact (and presence, frankly) of hook-up culture has largely been [overblown by the media](https://time.com/88092/hookup-culture-myth-study/) and current statistics show that Gen-Z/Millennials [have a lot less bedroom traffic than their predecessors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2016/08/16/millennials-are-having-less-sex-than-other-gens-but-experts-say-its-probably-fine/?sh=4bc66ee6d958). As [Japan](https://www.newsweek.com/japan-population-decline-births-deaths-demographics-society-1796496), [South Korea](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Work/South-Korea-looks-to-foreign-workers-to-solve-demographic-crisis) and even [China](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/upshot/china-population-decline.html) will tell you, this is a very difficult trend to reverse. Once men and women are not interested in coming together and starting families, population collapse is almost a certainty.

To end I wish to give the definition of the word, ""entitled"" which is ""Believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment."" From this information, it would seem that such a label cannot apply to Millennials and Gen-Z.  In the words of John Burn-Murdoch, chief data reporter for the Financial Times, ""They have done everything they were told to do, yet the fruits of their labours are proving elusive.""",Zero-zero20,534,0.8100000023841858,448,1695119280,2023-09-19 05:28:00,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16mnb8a/cmv_millennials_and_gen_z_are_screwed_perhaps/,9,2023
169vziy,"CMV: If you wear MAGA swag, chances are you’re an asshole.","Not saying all Trump voters are assholes (I know many, including in my family, who are great people.) 

But if you believe in Trump’s message so fervently that you’d deck yourself out in Trump/MAGA iconography, it’s more likely than not that you’re probably a dickhead who believes in the worst, most emotive parts of his message. 

Many republicans/independents voted for him the past two elections either because he was the closest one to their position, not necessarily because they liked him. More of an anti-Democrat, pro-Republican vote than a pro-Trump vote.  If you’re sporting the red hat, or the bumper sticker, or have the flag pinned up somewhere though, it likely indicates that you’re a fan of the man himself, and by extension the more venomous elements of his platform (rabid anti-immigration in particular), rather than just lowering taxes. 

Totally open to changing my mind on this - I know that probably the counter-evidence would be anecdotal in nature and that’s fine (seeing as how my argument is based on anecdotal evidence as well - ive yet to come across a MAGA-branded person who, accounting for my own bias, wasnt a prickly cunt).

It’s not good enough, though, to just say “My dad is a good man and he loves Trump and wears the hat” - many racists/assholes/fuckheads are great with their family and neighbours.

16u7f78,CMV: the expansion of NATO is NOT what prompted Russia to invade Ukraine,"More specifically, my current position is that the expansion of NATO would have been an insignificant factor in the decision to invade, even if it did enter into a cost-benefit analysis. 

My reasoning for holding this belief is that:

1) NATO's expansion was not carried out actively or with aggressive intentions, but was a passive process of allowing countries in central and eastern Europe to join, due to their own security concerns. It is unlikely that the Kremlin could have seriously perceived this as a threat, since NATO is fundamentally not a war-mongering organisation, and would only ever engage in *retaliatory* combat.

2) Invading Ukraine would have been an idiotic - indeed nonsensical response, if it *was* a reaction to the NATO threat; and I don't think it's plausible that Putin and his advisors could have gotten it so wrong. Here's why it doesn't make sense:

* It always ran a significant risk of strengthening NATO (which it in fact has)
* Since the Crimea annexation, it has driven Ukraine further into the arms of the west (since they rightfully fear for their own security)
* A diplomatic approach to wooing Ukraine would have been feasible (since a majority of Ukrainians were against joining NATO prior to the Crimea annexation)
* Supposing Russia is successful in claiming Ukraine - this doesn't really help their security situation anyway; they are still directly adjacent to NATO countries.

A secondary belief, which you can engage with or not, is that the main driving force was Putin's personal desire for glory and respect, and to leave a Peter-the-Great-like legacy. I don't hold this view very strongly - so I'll also give deltas to anyone who can provide convincing arguments that it *is* correct.",CaptainQueero,479,0.7400000095367432,843,1695878942,2023-09-28 00:29:02,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16u7f78/cmv_the_expansion_of_nato_is_not_what_prompted/,9,2023

Also, all of his decisions with checkmarks, and bans, and renaming are flexes. People may complain, but they're not leaving. All the impotent hate probably amuses him and stokes his shitty ego.

And I can bet he will continue using his fortune to keep on subsidizing Twitter even if it's losing money. In the greater scheme of things, keeping it is probably good for his bottom line.

This is a common counterargument against people who argue that college should be less expensive, shorter or less burdensome than it currently is

* Most good jobs require a college degree

* Most people go to college with the intent to get a higher paying job than would otherwise be available 

* Most people do not have enough generational wealth to make a family or have a comfortable standard of living without a good job

* Many people would opt out of college altogether if not for the fact that many jobs require a degree, even if someone without a degree could do the job well

16waaqx,"CMV: The (subset of) Christians who claim that Hell is eternal torment do not, in fact, actually believe it - given how lackadaisical they are about it.","First off, I recognize that not all Christians claim that Hell is eternal torment. Some claim the afterlife for unsaved people is annihilationism, some claim it's purgatory, some claim something else altogether.

That being said, in the religious circle that I grew up in (charismatic and Baptist-type denominations,) this was by and large the default viewpoint that was preached from the pulpit - that those who die unsaved will burn in Hell. I attended a Christian college that required all students to agree with their 'statement of faith' which included a section that stated that those who die unsaved are in ""conscious torment for eternity."" And this viewpoint isn't rare at all; I'd wager that many millions of Christians - in America and elsewhere in the world - claim to ascribe to such an interpretation.

What always struck me as particularly hollow about this claim, though, was that **hardly a single Christian behaved as if this was real.**

Think about what the implications would be if Hell were *really* that - being tortured for eternity. It would mean something far *worse*, and *longer*, than being tortured for 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years. Think about the agony that people in the World Trade Center who were in the inferno-vicinity of the jet-impact points suffered - for probably no more than a few minutes - as they were roasted alive in the flames on 9/11. Or think of the people who were immersed into vats of nitric acid by ISIS, or skinned alive in some ancient societies, or who burned alive in the firebombing of Dresden or Tokyo, or - well, really, the most horrific physical fate or gruesome torture you can think of. 

Now multiply that length of torture/suffering by *trillions* of years, and you haven't even gotten *close* to the length of time Hell is (according to such theology.)

Now, most such Christians don't believe in universalism either (the belief that all will be saved.) Indeed, it is a very common view of many Christians that relatively *few* people will be saved (they often cite the verse where Jesus says, ""Wide is the path to destruction, and many find it; narrow is the path to life, and few find it."") Let's say that ""few"" means 10%, and even that's considered generous by many such Christians. This means that 90% of the world's population is going to Hell - forever - the most horrific torment. And what this also means, is that **94 people in the world are going to Hell every single minute,** given the number of people in the world who die per minute. It also means your unsaved cousin, boyfriends, classmate at school, uncle, coworker, friendly neighbor, etc. are all at imminent risk of falling into torture that goes on forever and forever. I mean, all it takes is for a drunk driver to hit them at an intersection one day, or a heart attack. (Again, I don't believe this - I'm just saying, that's what many Christians **claim** to be true.)

But - *the vast majority of such Christians spend perhaps no more than half an hour every year in evangelism.* They live their lives as if people are **not** going to, in fact, be roasted, shrieking and screaming, in flames forever. They spend 99.99% of their time watching TV, working, having hobbies, fun, traveling, reading, etc. - like anyone else - as if they're totally chill and fine with the prospect of 270 out of their 300 friends on Facebook being sentenced to a fate so terrible that it's barely humanly imaginable. Sure, you see the occasional street preacher who shouts with a loudspeaker ""Turn and burn, you are all headed to Hell!"" - but that's the rare exception.

So, the only conclusion I can draw from such behavior is that over 99% of Christians who claim that Hell means horrific torment for all eternity do not, in fact, actually believe their own theology.

16m0711,"CMV: Under a totalitarian regime, most of us would not be resisters.","A lot of people want to believe that if they had 'been there', in Nazi Germany for example, that they would have resisted. They would have risked their lives to help ordinary people escape a murderous totalitarian government. 

And some people did. Oskar Schindler is an example of that. They made a movie about him because he was an outlier. What he did was very unusual, and that's why it was so interesting. He was in the right place at the right time to help a lot of people. Many ordinary people resisted in small ways, or even in incredibly courageous ways.

But as far as I know, the majority of people either complied, looked the other way and let it happen, or were themselves active agents in the atrocities of that regime. Remember also the extent of the government propaganda at that time. I find it unlikely that most regular people were *fully* aware of what was going on and/or why it was so indefensible. 

This isn't to say that none of you would have stood up to the government. If you have ever said ""no"" to a policeman who was pointing a gun at you, or if you have ever knowingly committed a capital crime in order to save someone's life, you may well have had the courage to be a resister. But if you have never been in that kind of situation, how can you know what you would have done? We don't live under that kind of political system, and I don't think we can really imagine how afraid people were.

None of this excuses what people did. Choosing to harm someone in order to save your own life is still a choice. My opinion is that we cannot truly know what choice we would have made under those circumstances unless we have experienced a very similar situation in our own lives. It's hard to look that truth in the eye, isn't it?

To change my view, you would have to convince me that under a genuinely totalitarian government comparable to the Third Reich, in which resistance is punishable by summary execution, generally more than half of the citizens are resisters. Not only in the beginning; it is easy enough to resist before a regime seizes extreme power. I am talking about resisting even after the government has begun openly killing dissenters.

I'd love to be wrong about this.

16hxvf8,META: Transgender Topics,"# The Rule Change

Beginning immediately, r/changemyview will no longer allow posts related to transgender topics. The reasons for this decision will follow. This decision has not been made lightly by the administration of this subreddit, and has been the topic of months of discussion.

# Background

Over the past 8 months, r/changemyview has been inundated with posts related to transgender topics. I conducted a survey of these posts, and more than 80% of them ended up removed under Rule B. More importantly, a very large proportion of these threads were ultimately removed by Reddit's administrators. This would not be a problem if the topic was an infrequent one. However, for some periods, we have had between 4 and 8 new posts on transgender-related issues per day. Many days, they have made up more than 50% of the topics of discussion in this subreddit.

# Reasoning

If a post is removed by Reddit or by the moderators of this subreddit under B, we consider the thread a failure. Views have not been changed. Lots of people have spent a lot of time researching and making reasoned arguments in favor of or against a position. If the thread is removed, that effort is ultimately wasted. We respect our commenters too much to allow this to continue.

Furthermore, this subreddit was founded to change views on a wide variety of subjects. When a single topic of discussion so overwhelms the subreddit that other topics cannot be easily discussed, that goal is impeded. This is, to my knowledge, only the second time that a topic has become so prevalent as to require this drastic intervention. However, this is not r/changemytransview. This is r/changemyview. If you are interested in reading arguments related to transgender topics, we truly have a thorough and complete treatment of the topic in this subreddit's history.

# The Rule

Pursuant to Rule 4, any thread that touches on transgender issues, even tangentially, will be removed by the automoderator. Attempts to circumvent automoderation will not be treated lightly by the moderation team, as they are indicative of a disdain for our rules. If you don't know enough to avoid the topic and violate our rules, that's not that big of a deal. If you know enough to try to evade the automoderator, that shows a deliberate intent to thwart our rules. Please do not attempt to avoid this rule.

# Conclusion

The moderation team regrets deeply that this decision has been necessary. We will answer any questions in this thread, or in r/ideasforcmv. We will not entertain discussion of this policy in unrelated topics. We will not grant exceptions to this rule. We may revisit this rule if circumstances change.

16ghk9f,CMV: Pirating abandonware is ethical,"No copies are being made. It isn't selling anymore. So retro horror for example. It can cost £800 for a copy of Kuon or Rule of Rose. Titles like Parasite Eve, Project Zero/Fatal Frame are expensive too. The only person making money from this is the person selling it second hand. You have two options, allow somebody who has it exploit how rare it is to own a copy and mark up the price by 500% or emulate it. Also if you pirate physical copies of them like what's happening with older Pokémon games, less people are getting exploited paying £140 for a copy of Pokémon SoulSilver. A game that only costs that much because it isn't being copied anymore. That £140 isn't going to Nintendo, it's going to the seller taking advantage of the customer selling a game for more than it's RRP. More physical copies of abandonware = less people being scammed out of their money because the game becomes less rare. It's basic supply and demand but places like eBay and second hand stores like Cex are taking full advantage of the low supply and high demand. 

Tl;dr the team who developed the game aren't losing money from you pirating it and people who do own the game and are selling it are extorting as much value out of it as the demand will let them.",deviantmoth,368,0.9100000262260437,307,1694492709,2023-09-11 23:25:09,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16ghk9f/cmv_pirating_abandonware_is_ethical/,9,2023

There are of course some differences, but for the most part, I think any of my friends could live in the US, UK or elsewhere in Europe and generally make friends and have a great time.

Of course, everything I'm saying is anecdotal, but polling also shows that Europeans have [generally favorable](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2023/06/27/overall-opinion-of-the-u-s/) views towards the US, and that Americans have [generally favorable](https://news.gallup.com/poll/472421/canada-britain-favored-russia-korea-least.aspx) views towards Europe.

16wg0hb,CMV: Unpaid internships should be illegal,"The most obvious reason that unpaid internships should be illegal is because this violates the spirit of minimum wage laws, if not the letter. People should be paid for their work.

The other reason is that unpaid internships exacerbate inequality by offering people with no experience a way to gain a foothold in a given industry only if they can survive for the length of the internship without earning any money. 

For people who need to work so they can survive, an unpaid internship is usually not an option. And so these people are often caught in the catch-22 situation of needing experience so they can get a job, and needing a job so they can get experience.

If companies paid interns at least minimum wage, this would level the playing field considerably and enable more working-class people to gain experience in their chosen field.

To change my view, you would have to convince me either that unpaid internships do not exacerbate or perpetuate inequality, or that it is reasonable for a company to not pay a person for their work.",LaserWerewolf,349,0.8799999952316284,280,1696103333,2023-09-30 14:48:53,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16wg0hb/cmv_unpaid_internships_should_be_illegal/,9,2023

Case in point euthanasia. Just today I saw a story about how the President’s dog has bitten numerous secret service agents in the past 2 1/2 years of the Biden administration.

Unfortunate? Yes. But wildly different from how human life is viewed. Most countries outlaw the death penalty for convicted criminals let alone for the mentally ill, which is what I’d put the human equivalent of a dog showing anti-social behavior. 

Second of all, sterilization. We strip animals of their agency and remove their sex organs in the name of breeding, health and overpopulation. That’s called eugenics when done to human beings and it’s not too popular nowadays. 

Nobody would dare tell a grieving parent that you understand their pain from losing a child because you’ve lost a cat/dog before. It would be insulting to them. There *is no* comparison between the loss of a human child and a fur child.

16ryt7y,"CMV: There's nothing wrong with paying people to donate blood, as long as they are monitored to ensure they are not donating too often.","The most common 2 arguments I've heard against paying people for donating blood are:

&#x200B;

* People - especially poor people - may cheat the system to gain more income by donating blood more frequently than is permitted, and thus endanger their own health/safety in the process.
* Paying people for money comes across as mercenary, and ruins the ""generosity"" spirit of the thing - what is supposed to be selfless giving that comes out of the goodness of one's heart is instead motivated by $$$.

&#x200B;

The first objection is one that I fully concur with - there are plenty of people who are desperate enough for money that they might try to donate blood more frequently than is safe for them to. We can't have a pay-to-donate system without it being very comprehensive and rigorous to prevent cheaters.

But the second objection, IMHO, has no merit. We already pay people to donate plasma, and you don't hear many objections about how the money ruins the feel-good nature of the thing. 

Even more importantly, though - the blood shortage is always a serious issue. Given the short shelf life of blood, blood banks and hospitals are always in a situation of need. I don't think that any patient who has just lost a lot of blood in a severe accident and is in danger of losing their life without immediate blood transfusions is ever going to object to blood because ""It was donated by a donor who was just in it for the money, as opposed to being motivated by generosity and kindness."" Need is need.

So if paying people for blood donations is what it takes to solve the always-present blood shortage, I'm fully in favor of it, and I can't see why society should be against it - unless the objection is that such fees would cost too much, but given that America already spends $4 trillion on healthcare every year, I think that paying donors a couple hundred dollars per blood donation would be only a drop in the bucket - and may in fact even *save* money, considering the improvement that increased blood supply would bring to the healthcare system.",SteadfastEnd,299,0.9200000166893005,92,1695664055,2023-09-25 12:47:35,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16ryt7y/cmv_theres_nothing_wrong_with_paying_people_to/,9,2023

16p8ny1,CMV: US Immigration policy is a total shitshow,"I’m the definition of an immigration dove — I love immigrants. I love seeing the varied cultures people bring with them and learning about the values that people of those cultures bring with them. I love hearing the different inflections in the voices of immigrants. I love being able to access foods of dozens of countries in my community. I love the idea that my country could be so great that people uproot their entire lives and those of their families to come here and start over and improve their well-being. 

There are also numerous objective benefits immigrants bring to the USA. I remember one of my college history professors saying that one of the major reasons that the US didn’t undergo a revolution or major social upheaval in the 30’s was the large immigrant population. Our national unemployment is roughly non-existent and our companies need people to work jobs to continue to grow and prosper. If there was ever a time in the last century to have a generous, functional, effective immigration policy, this is it.

Which is not what we have right now. What we have is a total free-for-all at the border, that ultimately serves neither the immigrants hoping to establish a new, better, life in the USA, nor the country as a whole. Let’s start with basic questions of security:

Our federal agencies have very limited operational control of the border. People constantly cross between ports of entry. It’s widely known among federal agencies that cartel operators funnel migrants to mass and cross at particular locations in order to occupy Border Patrol, so they can smuggle contraband in the vacated crossings. The shear mass of numbers of migrants crossing overwhelm the ability of Border Patrol to vet them, allowing only the most cursory of background checks, which will completely miss any criminality in their home country. And this is only for the migrants who surrender themselves/are caught by Border Patrol. Some of the contraband that the cartels smuggle over are human beings who, for one reason or another, want to stay off of the federal government’s radar.

The way most of these migrants are hoping to normalize their status in the United States is the asylum process. Many of them are unaware that at best this is a temporary patch on a system that will eventually leave them in legal limbo. It is easy to claim asylum, but not so easy for it to be granted. To claim it, you pretty much just have to say that you have a credible fear of being persecuted back in your home country. At this point the migrant will receive a notice to appear (NTA) before an immigration judge where that claim will be adjudicated. At the point, the migrant is generally free to go where they please. They may apply for a work permit six months after making this claim. So they can start their lives, get a job, etc. while they are waiting to be actually granted asylum, but what many do not understand is that asylum is only granted for credible fear of persecution based on a narrow set of criteria. Even though it takes years for those asylum claims to be adjudicated, at the end of the day only about 15% of claimants are granted asylum. Because ICE only prioritizes deportations of serious criminals, those who are denied asylum still generally remain in the US, but they have no legal status and are extremely vulnerable to changes in policy or political leadership.

Both of these are batshit crazy ways to run a country: a functionally open border, and a pathway to status normalization that fails 15% of the time. The alternative for a migrant, of course, is to apply for a visa in the legal way, but this is a laughable solution. There is no visa category of “economic immigrant.” You either need to have a family member who is already a citizen, highly educated, professional job qualifications in specific fields, or lots and lots of money. There is NO legal pathway for someone who wants to just come to the United States to be a roofer, or a restaurant worker. Actually, that’s not totally true. There are H2B visas. However, the US only gives out 66,000 of those a year, and they are by statute temporary visas with no pathway to permanent residency. 

This is no way to run a railroad. I have no problem with the number of immigrants coming into the United States, but I do want the government to be sure they are the right ones. Certainly most who are coming are decent people, but the government needs to at least have the ability to sort out the few bad actors and deny them entry. Allowing bad actors and contraband through is a great way to radicalize public opinion against immigration and stoke racial and ethnic resentment and paranoia. It also needs a sane visa process for economic migrants. Having millions of rejected asylum-seekers living underground lives, open to exploitation, and in a precarious legal condition is a terrible way to bring in immigrants. 

I hated the idea of Trump’s wall when he ran on it in 2016, but it pains me to say that I think it needs to be built. It’s definitely not a solution in and of itself, but it can at least start the process of creating an orderly immigration system. Some might ask how the US would pay for improved border security and visa processing (I don’t see this as an ingenuous concern considering US federal spending practices, but it can at least be addressed and knocked down). Well, cartels are charging virtually everyone who crosses the US border between $5000 and $10000 each (taking advantage of our ineptitude to enrich their coffers). Even if we undercut their prices by 50% to charge immigration fees to applicants, these fees would offset much of the cost, and allow migrants to use the remainder of their savings to take routes from their home countries to the United States that are safer than a trek through the Darien Gap and a 1000 mile ride on the top of a Mexican train.

This is long enough already, but one final thought I need to include is that another direct result of this ineptitude is the enabling of the explosive enrichment and growth of the cartels. It’s created an opportunity for them to charge these enormous travel fees to migrants and smuggle contraband of all kinds across the border. Their annual revenue has ballooned into the billions of dollars and the US runs the real risk that in the future they could completely overrun the Mexican government and establish a true narco-state just across the border. (For those thinking that I’m being hyperbolic, Mexico’s annual tax revenue is $22 billion. The cartel’s estimated annual revenue is $13 billion. I know who my money is on in the long term, considering how much more the government has to spend money on other than security compared to the cartels.)

Maybe that’s the kind of thing that will be necessary before the United States takes immigration seriously, but at that point any hope of the sane, generous, orderly immigration policy that I think we need will be lost. There’s no way that’s happening once our southern neighbor become the Republic of Sinaloa.",solishu4,288,0.800000011920929,457,1695384714,2023-09-22 07:11:54,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16p8ny1/cmv_us_immigration_policy_is_a_total_shitshow/,9,2023

16kcvv6,"CMV: it is morally and logically inconsistent to advocate for two murder charges in the event of the homocide of a pregnant woman, and to be believe that abortion should be legal at the same time","

So, I’m not against abortion  and I’m certainly not defending murderers of pregnant women, I just think this is an interesting test for moral consistency. Also, moral tests are inherently not easy situations, so there’s gonna be an outcome that feels shitty to a lot of people if moral consistency is achieved in this case, at least in my view. I’ve realized this also applies to cases where miscarriage is brought on by physical violence, I’m not gonna edit the whole thing to say that but just know that it is is included in every point unless it’s specifically about abortion. And to clarify, in this case I’m obviously not saying it’s morally inconsistent to charge the person who violently caused the miscarriage with *any* crime, just the murder of the fetus. 

I think it’s pretty simple reasoning: if someone believes the murderer should get an additional charge for the death of the fetus, that means the fetus should be classified as a human being in the eyes of the law. If someone gets an abortion the fetus goes from being alive to being dead, if a fetus is classified as a human being, there’s no reason this shouldn’t count as a murder. In fact, it seems like it would fit the criteria of solicitation of murder, with the mother (and anyone else who supported the abortion) being the solicitor, and the doctor who performed the operation (along with anyone who willfully aided specifically the abortion) being the actual murderer. To claim that it’s different when the mother does it while carrying the child would mean that the perpetrator of a killing determines whether it is lawful or murder. Apply this to self defense and it gets… real bad real quick. I understand that there is a difference, that difference being that the mother is carrying the fetus in the womb, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a human life being killed, if we accept that premise from the charges of murder for the fetus.",LEMO2000,283,0.6899999976158142,1208,1694884829,2023-09-16 12:20:29,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16kcvv6/cmv_it_is_morally_and_logically_inconsistent_to/,9,2023
16sssne,CMV: The Ukraine war shows that the much-hated military-industrial complex is in fact a very good and necessary thing to have.,"Few industries are despised more in the West than the military-industrial complex. Prior to the Ukraine war, progressive politicians (and some conservatives as well) constantly railed against the defense industry, questioning why the United States was spending $800 billion a year on the military when that money could have gone towards \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert your cause of choice: education, healthcare, social cause, etc.) instead. Western European nations, by and large, spent relatively little on defense (despite a NATO pledge for each member to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense). When you asked liberal voters what government item they wanted the most to see big budget cuts on, they would almost invariably say the military.

But the Ukraine war suddenly changed the tunes of many such folks. The same folks who decried the billions of dollars spent on weaponry production suddenly fretted about whether the U.S. would be able to manufacture enough 155mm artillery shells in time to assist Ukraine. The same people who thought of the U.S. defense industry as a useless pit for taxpayer dollars to be wasted now complain that we're not sending enough Abrams tanks, ATACMS, Javelins, Stingers or F-16s to Ukraine. The Daily Kos, a very left-leaning publication, has suddenly featured numerous pro-Ukraine articles detailing the need for U.S. military support of Ukraine and the amount of such.

And not to take anything away from the courage and ingenuity of the Ukrainians, who have fought more bravely and cleverly than perhaps any nation we've seen in decades, but it can clearly be seen that if it weren't for the massive amount of Western military assistance that had been given to Ukraine in the form of artillery (Ukraine was on pace to run out of its small Soviet-type artillery arsenal a year ago,) intelligence, portable anti-tank and anti-air missiles, anti-air defense (Kyiv and other major cities were repeatedly vulnerable to Russian air attacks until recently, when Western Gepards/NASAMS/Patriot/IRIS-T arrived), Ukraine would be in a far worse position than it is today. None of that would have been possible without a substantial military-industrial complex in the West.

You can't get this sort of thing on short notice. If the West had neglected defense and a war like the Ukraine conflict had broken out, it would have been impossible to spool up in time. Modern advanced military systems take years to develop. 

All of this shows is that the defense industry of the West - particularly the United States' - is in fact a very good and necessary thing to have. The whole point of a military is similar to that of the function of a fire department - it's not something you **want** to have to use, but you need it to be there for emergencies. (Assuming your military is used for defense, not offense, of course.) Furthermore, the same progressives who complain about $800 billion spent on the military often overlook the fact that the United States spends far **more** than that on healthcare, Medicare, Social Security every year. The military is actually a relatively small component of the U.S. federal budget.

Of course, there are major issues with over-pricing and bloat in the U.S. defense industry (there's no excuse for F-35 development and production to have been the SNAFU that it was,) and much reform is needed. But the Ukraine war has shown that a military-industrial complex is something people like to hate in peacetime, but learn to grasp the value of in wartime.

But since then, any conflict America has been in were conflicts they arguably shouldn't have stuck their nose in. Whether they were trying to make a statement, were overblowing the threat, or were using it as an excuse for some alternative motive, they were all conflicts that posed little to no threat to America.

It's all BS, no different than a cult who recruits their members by telling them exactly what they want to hear even if it's a lie. They are giving these kids a fake purpose just so that they will make sacrifices to accomplish their greedy ambitions. 

It's so messed up and I wonder why no one else sees through it. We blindly praise veterans and active duty personnel for their service, when, in reality, I don't think their service is anything I should be thanking them for. The only people who should be thanking them are the higher ups who gain from their sacrifices. But us, the average American citizens, have never reaped benefits from the men and women who ""serve our country,"" and I feel horrible for those who think they have.",cmoriarty13,267,0.6100000143051147,655,1695827022,2023-09-27 10:03:42,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16tmynl/cmv_you_did_not_defend_or_protect_our_country_if/,9,2023
16tscm2,CMV: I think inceldom is simply an extension of our society's current relationship with personal responsibility,"As opposed to being directly caused by various forms of sexism. Sexism is obviously present in incel communities, but the state of inceldom would still exist absent sexism.

The basic logic:

'I want to have sex with people' --> 'I have not been able to have sex with people' --> 'This is because of various factors outside of my control' --> 'Society should change because this is unfair'

In this case, the change incels would like to have happen is the gender they are attracted to (usually women) should change their standards so that the incels could have sex.

\------

This logic is consistent with other aspects of our society as well:

\- 'I should not have to lose weight, instead society should change their standards of beauty' (and also airlines should increase the size of their seats to accommodate me so I'm more comfortable)

\- 'Something someone said offended me, and therefore it is bad. Rather than just not consume the content anymore, the person should change'

\- 'I was triggered by something someone said. Anything that triggers me is bad. Rather than manage my emotions, the trigger should no longer exist.'

&#x200B;

\------

Finally, I think while there would certainly still be critics, if the issue of incels being associated with a protected class were removed, it would be much more acceptable in mainstream society.

EG - 'White women are often scared of black men for no reason, thus it is unfairly difficult as a black man to establish romantic relationships'. The logic is the same, including the sense that the black man is ""owed"" romantic relationships common in inceldom, but this is much more palatable to modern society than incel culture is.

Thus, it isn't the base logic and reasoning society finds so distasteful; Rather it's the association with white men. A class that is seen as having the most privilege complaining that things aren't fair isn't going to win over a lot of people.

&#x200B;

\--------

Things that would likely change my view:

\- Explain how my understanding of incel culture is completely wrong

\- Explain how there is no valid relationship between incels lack of personal responsibility and the examples I listed; Besides claiming one is less moral/acceptable than the other. Explaining how the examples can be rationalized or are more just wouldn't really address the main point.",ZeusThunder369,259,0.7699999809265137,381,1695840109,2023-09-27 13:41:49,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16tscm2/cmv_i_think_inceldom_is_simply_an_extension_of/,9,2023
16wf0c3,CMV: Credit checks should not lower your credit score,"As far as I know, soft credit checks are when you check your own credit score. These are not punished. Hard credit checks are when creditors check it when you're applying for something. This is absolute horse shit. The only way to really know what interest rate you're going to get is when the creditor runs a hard credit check. So if you want to be cautious and responsible by only applying for a loan/credit which you can afford, you get punished for checking it. Especially if various creditors offer different rates and you want to check with all of them. The idea of getting punished for being responsible is dumb. 

While we're at it, paying off a loan early should not negatively impact someone's credit score either. Being responsible and paying off high interest loans should not be viewed as a negative.

Change my view. Tell me why exactly it's a good thing to punish people for hard credit checks and paying loans off early. I understand that it's setup for the creditors to profit, not the consumers. I want to understand the bullshit justification used for it.

16clz7l,CMV: Cheating is always wrong.,"Before we start, I want to talk about abusive relationships. This is what people have brought up to defend cheating to me. In my opinion, cheating is defined as being able to safely leave the relationship, but choosing to betray your partner anyway. An abuse victim cannot leave safely and easily. Their partner has already betrayed them by abusing them. Thus, it is impossible for an abuse victim to “cheat” on their abuser. 

This situation is different from a person who would feel really bad if their relationship came to an end, or if they have kids. They’re not putting their life on the line- they’re just shuffling their misery onto their partner/family. 

And that’s really the core of my view. It is always possible to end the relationship before you cheat. It’s not a fun choice, and it can impact your reputation or finances, but it’s a choice you can make. When someone cheats, they’re really just trying to eat their cake and have it, too. 

“What counts as cheating” is a complex topic everyone seems to disagree on. For me, it’s cheating when sex and intimate cuddling is involved. Being friends with someone isn’t cheating. Neglecting your spouse is a bad thing, and something to fix/break up over, but not cheating. 

As for alcohol fueled cheating…I honestly don’t know. I do not drink, so I feel that I don’t have the experience to judge. I’ve heard mixed opinions from those who do. The only thing I’d say is that, if you have control over yourself, it’s cheating.",PercentageMaximum457,253,0.8399999737739563,276,1694108669,2023-09-07 12:44:29,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16clz7l/cmv_cheating_is_always_wrong/,9,2023
16jqlft,CMV: I feel that xmen being oppressed isn't realistic,"Hopefully this is a fresh topic. 

Now I'll be honest I never read the comics. Maybe some issue addressed this... but movie and TV show xmen is kind of lame.

I feel like reality is that if xmen type exist the x men wouldn't be persecuted. They wouldn't even try to hide. people with like magneto powers would just level the world.

yeah magneto isn't a god or invicible. But I really don't believe at least some country there wouldn't be someone who just forcefully take over the already unstable government. Like let's say Afghanistan. Or smaller communities Wouldn't prop themselves up as gods and make themselves a militia or something. 

Like it might be me but I'm sure some people would fear them enough to be submissive to them. I also feel xmen would give me a winning edge.

And if I was a power hungry madman I'd definitely collaborate with the xmen. Let's say I am someone (I'm not) who is Russian or whatever who wants to see my country conquer the world, I'd oust the weak human and make sure the xman is the leader. (or woman) then we employ an army of men.

I also don't believe that tech could develop fast enough to neutralize the mutants. we couldn't get covid under control.

16w65yu,"CMV: Gun violence in the United States will continue to increase, and there is nothing we can do.","My argument is basically a two-point case. I believe the following:

1. Gun control will never be passed in the United States at a federal level, which is the only way it could work, because otherwise someone truly determined to commit a mass shooting can just go to a neighboring state with more lax gun laws.
2. Even if gun control were passed on a federal level, it wouldn't work.

POINT 1: 

Look, it's no secret that the massacres keep happening more and more frequently. I tend to agree with that British journalist who said that Sandy Hook was the end of the gun control debate. Gun violence has gone from a generation-defining tragedy to something that happens every day in America. Events like Uvalde that remain in the news for a few weeks are the exception, not the rule. Plus, the general public seems to care less and less about the fact that the US is a total warzone. As an example, Greg Abbott, a very pro-gun violence politician, won 60 percent in the vote in Uvalde County even after the Robb Elementary massacre. Other countries have started putting travel warnings against the US, and still nothing ever changes even as our foreign relations suffer. I don't have any serious expectation that things will change enough for gun control to be passed federally. However, that's not even the biggest obstacle to putting an end to this plague.

POINT 2:

To those who would say that other countries have solved this problem, I'm not going to deny that. However, Canada, Australia, Germany, and other countries never had the same gun culture that we did. The US has twice as many guns per capita as fucking YEMEN. If gun control were passed tomorrow, I expect gun sales to massively increase the way they do after every high-profile mass shooting. The Second Amendment people will say ""They're trying to take our guns!"" and they'll arm up even further. Even if that doesn't happen, there are still too many guns floating around, so the only real solution is for the government to forcibly confiscate them, which would probably end in even more violence. *Even in the best-case scenario, gun violence would continue, it just wouldn't increase as exponentially as it is right now.* 

As you can imagine, I desperately want my view changed, because I don't want to believe that I have to move to another country. I just hate seeing the US devolve into a civil warzone.

16ujn7u,CMV: Israel and Palestine are both victims of bad actions by Arab countries,"Time is 1948, Britain decide they had enough and pull out of the middle-east, dividing the land between Israel and Palestine, under the ""UN Partition plan"". 

Israeli government accepts and declares independence. Palestine government rejects and declares war on Israel. Surrounding Arab countries: Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria - declare war on Israel and invade both Israel and Palestine. 

Short version, the war ends with Jordan ruling the West Bank (most of modern day Palestine), Egypt ruling the Gaza strip (Southern Palestine where Hamas is ruling today), Israel surviving and leading an offensive campaign with territorial gains. 

Biggest losers of the war, and the reason for the crisis today: 750,000 Palestinians expelled, no more Palestine. 

Israel was fighting an existential war, so while I cannot justify the atrocities, I can imagine doing whatever is necessary to survive. But Egypt and Jordan were under no circumstances at risk of being invaded by Israel, yet they decided to take advantage of the war and expand into the two most significant areas of today's Palestine. 

The crazy thing is that both Egypt and Jordan made peace with Israel, but never took responsibility for what they did to the Palestinians in 1948.

Imagine a world where the Arab countries don't invade Israel/Palestine in 1948. Israel is not in existential war and can behave rationally. And Palestine is not forced into an all-out war with Israel by its Arab neighbors. This ends with peace, I think.

16ah8yk,"CMV: The current system set up benefits only a few is not a conspiracy. The media is owned by wallstreet. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act gave banks too much power. They should've reinstated Glass-Steagall in 2008. Banks became too big to prosecute, a perfect example is JPMorgan. Also Hedge funds are shady.","The banks are out of control. They are the main reason for the growing wealth gap. They own the companies that own the shares in these companies that govern how they operate. All of the major media outlets are owned by a small circle of people. Look at the institutional ownership of some of the media corporations like comcast. Even reddit is compromised, given some of it's weird rules coming out about brigading and cross-posting. 

As someone who has spent the last 3 years following reddit, the markets and news, I have witnessed firsthand the alarming activities of hedge funds and banks that pose a significant risk to our financial world.   
  
The Glass-Steagall Act served as a crucial safeguard against excessive risk-taking by banks. By separating commercial banking from investment banking, it prevented banks from engaging in speculative activities that could endanger depositors' funds. However, its repeal has allowed banks to enter into risky ventures such as hedge funds without adequate oversight.  
  
One of the most concerning aspects of this repeal is that hedge funds are exempt from anti-money laundering rules set forth in the Patriot Act. This exemption creates an environment where illicit financial activities can thrive unchecked, posing serious threats to our national security and economic stability.

The recent history of JPMorgan Chase serves as a stark reminder of why reinstating Glass-Steagall is imperative. JPMorgan's ""too big to fail"" status has shielded it from prosecution for its involvement in various scandals and illegal practices. This lack of accountability not only undermines public trust but also perpetuates a dangerous moral hazard within these powerful institutions.

The concentration of wealth among a few powerful entities exacerbates social inequality and threatens our democratic principles. Reinstating Glass-Steagall would help restore integrity to our markets by curbing excessive risk-taking and preventing further consolidation of power within these institutions.

*""No single regulator has the authority or information to comprehensively assess the risks posed by hedge funds.""*

Janet Yellen, Secretary of the Treasury

Can't link it but this is from WSOP.

*""Take, for example, what happened on June 22 of this year. The SEC issued a Cease-and-Desist order against the securities unit of JPMorgan Chase for permanently* ***deleting 47 million emails****, many of which were under* [subpoena](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2023/34-97787.pdf) *or document requests from its regulators, including the SEC. (One could be forgiven for thinking that sounds a lot like obstruction of justice by a serial lawbreaker. JPMorgan Chase said Deletion-Gate was all one big accident.)*  
*Despite the unprecedented criminal history of this bank – which garnered it a comparison to the Gambino crime family in a book by two trial lawyers – the SEC imposed a minor fine of $4 million for disappearing 47 million emails.* ***That’s 8.5 cents for each permanently destroyed email*** *that might have brought more criminal charges against the bank.""*

All that said I usually try not to paint with too broad a brush. I know not every hedge fund is criminal. Guess I'm just looking for why people wouldn't think the system is rigged in favor of the rich and banks and hedge funds is how they control the economy/markets.

I'm aware I've eaten a lot of tinfoil. Just trying to get out of my echo chamber and see what other people think.

16m25zs,CMV: Far-left “tankie” media is harmful to democracy.,"I know the word “tankies” has had a lot of meanings throughout history. For the purposes of this post it refers to the modern way it’s commonly used, i.e. far-left “anti-imperialists” who tend to hate the nebulous West. 

I’m talking about the Grayzone/Multipolarista types, the Max Blumenthals, Ben Nortons, and their ilk. To them, the concept of democracy is secondary to the demise of Western power. 

They present themselves as anti-imperialists because they ostensibly support the liberation of smaller “global south” nations under the grip of global hegemony. Now, I’m all for anti-imperialism in principle, every country should have the maximum amount of self determination possible to shepherd their people into as prosperous a future as possible without some big power boot on their neck. 100%. 

The problem I have with tankies in this context is that anti-imperialism should be pro-democracy. But that is not what’s emanating from these circles. 

In practice, what it looks like is simply being anti-West. If the US, Europe, or their allies are in *any* way even tangentially involved in some geopolitical conflict or dispute, it doesn’t matter what the conflict is, or where it is, or what the motivations are, or who is involved, or what they are doing, the other side is *always right* to these people. 

They seem to giddily support all manner of autocratic brutality as long as it is done in the service of damaging the West’s influence in the world. Everything is a zero-sum game, and the West must never win it no matter what the cost. 

They deny atrocities and push any manner of conspiracy theories (White helmets being false flag terrorists. China not committing atrocities against Uyghurs, no chemical weapons use in Syria, etc.) that would put their favorite dictators in a bad light and, by extension, advance the Western position. 

Look at Syria, Russia, China, Venezuela, Cuba, etc. There is seldom even the slightest, most tepid condemnation for the crimes that these governments impose on their own people and others, because they are “fighting” or “resisting” western influence, and by virtue of that, they can do no wrong in the context of this great power struggle. 

I have yet to see any evidence that they would be willing to forcefully condemn “non-west” dictators for anything they do, as long as the US/Europe oppose them, or any evidence that they would support a democratic cause if it would somehow benefit the west at the expense of great power rivals, but I'm open to hearing opposing views.",BrokkenArrow,234,0.6399999856948853,469,1695059287,2023-09-18 12:48:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16m25zs/cmv_farleft_tankie_media_is_harmful_to_democracy/,9,2023
