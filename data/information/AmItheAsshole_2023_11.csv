1834tvx,AITA for not changing my dog's name when my new neighbor's child had the same name?,"I (36M) am the owner of a Great Pyr/Australian Cattle Dog mix named Charlotte (6F). I live in a lower-middle class suburb in an unspecified United State. I have lived here for about a year now, and I let Charlotte out to go potty roughly six or so times a day. It's always the same routine: I open the back door, Charlotte runs outside to pee and ""patrol"" the yard (apparently it's a Pyr thing), and doesn't typically come bounding back to the door until I poke my head out and call her name.

About a week or two ago (maybe longer if I didn't notice) new neighbors moved in across my back alley. I had no intentions of interacting with them whatsoever, like ever, except today when I was executing the last step of Charlotte's aforementioned potty protocol.

I stuck my head out and called her name, but this time, alongside the familiar sounds of my dog galloping up the porch steps, was an adult human voice shouting something along the lines of ""WHY ARE YOU CALLING MY DAUGHTER??"" At first I thought it might just be my new neighbors getting into a spat, until a couple minutes later I heard pounding on my front door.

I opened the door to an angry man about twice my size glaring me down. He said something like ""Why the eff are you calling my daughter into your house"" and I responded ""Your daughter's name is Charlotte?"" and he just kind of kept glaring at me?? In absence of a response I followed up with ""Charlotte is my dog's name, dude"" and he rolled his eyes at me and said I ""better"" change my dog's name because he doesn't want his daughter (2F) getting confused and running into my house.

I told him that's not going to happen because not only did my dog have the name first, we also lived here first, plus I don't like strangers making demands of me before even attempting to be polite. What I DIDN'T say but really wanted to say is that teaching his child stranger danger is his responsibility, not mine.

He called me stupid and said that a human child obviously has priority over a dog for a name. I shut the door in his face and stared at him through the peephole for a moment before he eventually walked back to his house.

This last potty break, I went out with Charlotte and stayed in the yard with her until she finished her business, but this guy just kind of stood in his yard with his arms crossed and glared at me the entire time.

TLDR: I think it's unfair that this father demands I change my dog's name just because he chose the same name for his kid \[RUDE AND UNNECESSARY COMMENT REDACTED\]. But on the other hand, most humans think humans have priority over dogs for just about everything. AITA?

18729yz,AITA for brushing my daughter’s friend’s extremely matted hair out so she avoid a drastic cut?,"My daughter has a friend, A (13F), who has been going through some health issues that I don’t want to put here. A’s mum passed away when she was little so it’s just her and her dad. Since he has started dating his girlfriend (we’ll call her C) A’s needs have been pushed to the side a little and he’s just not noticed that A has been struggling. She’s doing better now after getting the help she needed.

However, A’s hair has been extremely matted as it had not been brushed for months. A had been hiding her hair under hats and hoods at home and trying to disguise it at school in buns. She stayed over at the weekend and I only found out about her hair when they came downstairs after getting a comb stuck in A’s hair trying to fix it. I comforted A as she was ashamed about her hair but had hoped that she and my daughter could fix it. My daughter convinced her to tell me about it as she had been scared to say anything to anyone as she thought she would be judged as her dad’s girlfriend has made comments about her appearance when she was going through her health issues. When A was going through her issues, I made it clear to her and my daughter that our home is a judgement free zone and if she ever wanted to come to me or my husband for help then she would get it. A then asked for help detangling her hair. So that’s what I did. We put on some films and worked on detangling A’s hair. It took hours, but it was doable.

When A went home on Sunday, her hair was completely detangled and neatly braided into two dutch braids. She was happy and thanked me for helping with her hair. Then Monday I got an angry phone call from C because she was meant to be taking A to get her hair cut due to how matted her hair was. Apparently C and A’s dad had noticed how bad it was and C had told me that she would get it sorted. C is mad because the salon they were going to had charged her a cancellation fee for cancelling the day of the appointment. C wants me to pay her back for the cancellation fee as it’s my fault for fixing A’s hair when they were going to get it cut out. I told her that I wouldn’t be paying it, I just did the right thing by A instead of going to the extreme option straight away. C then said that A was no longer allowed to be friends with my daughter and they would sue me for the cancellation fee. It was £60 (half the cost of the cut).

My daughter told me that A knew about C wanting to cut her hair and A didn’t want the hair cut which is why she went to my daughter for help. A like my own daughters has long hair, so cutting the matted hair out would have meant her losing well over half of the length of her hair.

AITA for brushing out A’s hair so she avoided getting a drastic cut.

Update: This got more attention than I thought it would. I would just like to clarify a couple things. 1. While I am not going to go fully into A's health issues, the matted hair is the result of a depressive episode. Once things got better, she was just very embarrassed by the state her hair was in but didn't know how to fix it. So she hid it and it got worse. She is able to brush and wash her hair when she's ok. 2. A isn't being neglected by her dad. He knows he hasn't been the best dad to A and is trying to be better when it comes to her. Since A's health issues, he has been seeking help. I'm not going to report a man who I can see is trying to get better as a parent.

A's dad (I'll call him J) came round earlier as he wanted to talk to me. A and C had gotten into a shouting match yesterday because of the cancelled appointment. C had told A that she wasn't allowed to see my daughter anymore until I paid the money I owed - this was news to J - and A told C that she was going to continue seeing her friend. A also told C that she hated her and that if anyone was going to take the place of her mum it would be me because I care about A as a person not just her appearance. J wanted to know what had happened with A and why I owed C money. I explained it all to J and he was horrified to learn that C was going to cut A's hair short instead of helping her. He had been under the impression that the appointment had been to get her hair detangled and wouldn't have consented to A getting a big chop. He hadn't realised how focused C had become on A's appearance with her hair. He told me that he wasn't going to stop A coming around as he knows how important my family is to her. When her mum died and he fell apart, we provided the stability they both needed. I told J that A is always welcomed here and she knows it, but it's her dad that she needs. She needs him to be there for her and to support her through whatever she is going through, having her dad will mean more to her than having me there. J agreed with this, and that he knows he's not been the dad that she needs and is going to try and be better for her. He's asked if I could recommend a family therapist who could help them, and I gave him a few names. Since A started going through her issues, J has stepped up. He's not the same dad that he was when they started but he does still have a way to go to be dad of the year. 

Since speaking with J I've had angry texts from C, furious that I 'went behind her back' and spoke with J when she was dealing with the issue. In the string of angry texts she sent me, she said horrible things about myself, A and my daughter. I'm not engaging with her anymore, she's a walking red flag. I screenshotted them before blocking C and sent them to J's work phone (J gave me his work number when he started dating C because she had been screening and deleting messages before he saw them. She doesn't have access to his work phone.)  My daughter has been messaging A making sure she is ok, and she will be coming to stay at the weekend as she doesn't want to be at home when C collects her stuff. I'm not sure what is going on with that relationship, nor do I want to know but it does sound like J is finally putting A first.",NiorNightingale,7449,0.9700000286102295,806,1701297605,2023-11-29 16:40:05,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18729yz/aita_for_brushing_my_daughters_friends_extremely/,11,2023
17rqn50,AITA for asking Future MIL not to tell my toddler they make her sad?,"My (28F) oldest son is 3yo My fiancé’s (32M) Mom came over few weeks ago & when leaving, asked my 3yo for a hug. He initially said “no” & walked away. Came back unprompted & hugged her. She said “oh good bc I was going to be sad”. W my fiancé’s, aunt’s &bestfriend’s edits, I sent her this:

(Summed up):
“We’re teaching 3yo that he’s in control of his own body & self-defined boundaries regardless of how it makes someone feel. If he’s trying to make someone upset on purpose, that’s a different story. We don’t want him to go against his boundaries to make someone feel better. I’m sure you just want to show he’s important to you but we’d appreciate it if you could show it in a different way.”

FMIL: “OP, I’d appreciate you not sending me these kinds of messages and we have these conversations in person. Thank you”

OP: “I don’t really see a difference to be honest. I would’ve said the same things in person. I didn’t see this topic as one that needs to be discussed too much. If you have a response I’m obviously open to hearing it, but it won’t change the fact that saying things that could make my kids feel guilty & responsible for other’s feelings will be accepted. Again, you can show that you care for the boys but not in ways that make them feel bad.”

FMIL: “Bc having adult conversation via text I believe are pretty cowardess. When you address me or any other adult, via text, it’s not really appropriate, so I will end this conversation with if you can't talk things over with me instead of telling me what ""not"" to do then that in itself is a problem. So I'm done.”

OP: “Again, I would say the same words to you in person, nothing cowardess about the method I choose to say these words. The reason I didn’t see it made sense to do it in person is bc I’m essentially asking you a favor & it’s your choice to acknowledge it or not. I wasn’t looking for a debate about it, just asking that you please not make certain comments to my babies.”

I’m alright if she’d prefer me to discuss something like this in person, but why ignore my initial message? Seems like blameshifting/diverting to me.

She then went to my fiancé & txted him “so by now I’m sure “OP” told you she was messaging me, if you guys have something you need to say to me just say it”. They had a 30min phone call & my fiancé told me she said:

- she’s already distanced herself from coming over & she’ll distance herself more if she has to
- it’s not something she was doing intentionally (I never said it was intentional, just bringing her attention to this and potential repercussions)

Chose to message her bc I’m HORRIBLE at having deep/stressful convos in person (I have ADHD so can’t process what I want to say & what other person is said & formulate responses,etc) also this is a boundary so not rly up for discussion or debate. Either she chooses to stop or doesn’t.

182c7m2,AITA for braiding one of my students hair without her mother consent?,"I am an art teacher for 14 to 15 years old students and recently I noticed that one of my students had really messy hair. I didn't say anything but the time passed by and it just seemed to get worse and worse. One day I saw her mother at the end of the class. For the record my students is black girl. She was adopted and her parents are both white. When I asked her about her daughter hair she just responded that she wasn't going to try to learn how to style them cause there is no point. I didn't respond to that and just told her I could do it if she gave me the product , I was already doing it for an other student and it didn't bother me at all. I am withe but I learn to braid hair with my stepmother cause my stepsister has a lot of hair and she needed help.She said  no . I had no right to touch her daughter and if tried to she would report me to the principal. 
Now last week we went on a trip to France with my students. I wasn't supposed to come but my colleague was not feeling well so I took her place. Because I'm French and my other colleagues don't speak a world of French I was made responsible of most of she students during the time of the trip. At the hotel my students let's call her Tessa ,saw me braiding her friend hair and ask me if I could to the same with her. I remembered what her mother said but she seemed really embarrassed and I noticed some students making fun of her because of her hairstyle so I did it anyway. She was really happy and told me that her mother was always straightening her hair, one day she had enough and asked her for braids instead . She said it was not a ""white hair style "" and left her with messy hair . When we got back her mother actually reported me to the principal and even threatened to sue me .

184n60w,AITA for telling my BM that I’ll die before our kid graduates high school?,"Alright it’s probably a weird story but I really need the second opinion.

Me (23M) and Kate (22F) are parents of Mark (4M). We split up before he was born, and to be honest I’m not very involved with the parenting besides being generous with child support and occasionally having Mark over.

I have a chronic and terminal condition that recently landed me in hospital. I had a really horrible flair up and had to be admitted to ICU. To make it worse, it happened during the time I was supposed to have Mark over. I was unconscious and on life support and so I couldn’t answer Kate’s calls.

When I woke up, I checked my phone and saw all the missed calls and messages. Kate was very upset as I basically ghosted her, and she sent a lot of rude and judgemental messages. So I snapped a pic of me in the hospital bed with all the tubes attached and sent it to her with the caption “sorry was busy trying not to die”.

Kate obviously freaked out and apologised, and I, being high on meds, told her that “it’s okay just a normal day having X”.

Turns out Kate didn’t know about my condition. We didn’t really have a relationship, she was just a girl from my school whom I hooked up with and it didn’t end very well. And we don’t have much contact aside from Mark-related stuff. I don’t know why I didn’t tell her, probably forgot or something.

Obviously it made her freak out even more. Kate called me and started crying and yelling at the same time, basically having a breakdown over the phone. She said I should’ve been upfront with her about it back then, that it’s my fault if Mark ever gets sick (it’s not a genetic neither a transmittable condition so he’s okay btw). She also said it’s unfair that we made a baby who will lose his dad at a young age, and this is where I might have been TA. I said “you know what would be more unfair? Fucking dying before my only son graduates high school.”

It upset her even more and she said that I’m the asshole for making her and Mark go through this. I said it’s not my fault, she said it is because if I was upfront with her, she wouldn’t have hooked up with me. I told her it’s too late and she called me an ah, hung up and told everyone I was an AH to her.",No-Marketing4660,5438,0.9300000071525574,617,1701038434,2023-11-26 16:40:34,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184n60w/aita_for_telling_my_bm_that_ill_die_before_our/,11,2023
17sguih,AITA for deliberately ruining my housemate’s romantic date night with his boyfriend because they planned to use my bathroom?,"I (21f) live with my best friend (John-21m) in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom flat. I have the main bathroom and John has the en suite bathroom. My bathroom has a shower/tub combo, sink and toilet and John’s bathroom has a shower, sink and toilet. When we first moved in, I didn’t have a preference about which room so John took the bedroom with the en suite. 

The issue is that recently, John has been using my bath without permission. Normally I’m not super territorial about my space, but here’s my issues:  
1-	John is having baths that last 2+ hours  
2-	He moves my stuff around (shoves them into draws) and puts my loofas and flannels on the floor which is just unhygienic  
3-	He doesn’t clean up after himself  
4-	I’m not allowed to use his bathroom when he’s occupying mine because he doesn’t want me to go into his bedroom

I’ve brought these up to him and he always says he won’t use to bath anymore but he always goes back to it. He claims his knees are acting up (he’s being testing for arthritis in a couple of weeks) and that the commute to and from work kills his joints. It's been like this for 2 months. Every time I get home from work, John is soaking in my tub so I can't shower, pee, etc. It might seem like a small thing but it's incredibly annoying.   
  
Fast forward to a couple of days ago and his boyfriend (Sam-19m) is visiting. He’s seemed pretty sound and has always been nice to me. I go from the kitchen to my bathroom and see the bath has been turned on so I turn it off. I go into my bedroom to grab my towels and clothes and when I get back, Sam is in my bathroom, sitting on the toilet seat watching the bath fill up. I ask him what he’s doing and he tells me him and John are planning on having a ‘romantic bath together’. I turn the bath off again and say ‘well this is my bathroom and I need a shower so get out.’   
He stands in the doorway for a few minutes texting John. I managed to push him out and I had a nice, long 'everything' shower. The entire time, John is texting me asking me to 'hurry up' because him and Sam had plans and I was ruining them. I responded and said 'I'm in my bathroom. I've told you not to use my bathroom because you leave it in a state and you spend hours in there.'   
When I get out the bathroom, John and Sam are sitting on the sofa watching a movie. As I walk past them, John says 'are you happy? You ruined our date night.' I just shrugged and got food.   
  
However I guess John went and vented to our mutual friends who are split on who is right in the situation. But the general consensus is that I should have just sucked it up and let them use my bathroom for their date night.  
  
So, AITA?",ExcellentCard3723,5394,0.9599999785423279,1004,1699658569,2023-11-10 17:22:49,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17sguih/aita_for_deliberately_ruining_my_housemates/,11,2023
17vg85i,AITA for saying to my wife that I’m the one who gets to make decisions about my niece?,"My (43M) niece (14F) is being raised by my wife (40F) and I - it’s a long story, having to do with my sister getting herself pregnant from a deadbeat and proving overall unfit to be a mother. Bottom line is, I see my niece as my daughter and love her just as much as my own biological children (11M/8M). I know my wife also loves her the same way, however I’m legally my niece's sole legal guardian.  
  
My niece has practiced gymnastics for the past 10 years, and when she was about 7 or 8 one of the coaches at her gym took notice of her potential and suggested she could really make it as a professional athlete. I personally believe my wife and my niece/daughter were taken by this promise of future glory (“can you imagine if she competes in the Olympics one day?”, my wife said). I was always VERY cautious because I do realize the shots are slim; I also knew that could cost us a lot of money going forward, but the coach believed so much in her that they managed to cover some of the costs of her training on the gym’s dime.  
  
And when I say training, I mean TRAINING – some serious hard work. I told them I was fine with the idea as long my niece was happy doing gymnastics and it didn’t majorly impact her life. And then, last month, she tore her ACL during practice. We do have insurance, so the medical costs were covered. However, she’s going through a painful recovery, all the while wondering when she’ll be healthy enough to get back to the gym. But I told my wife I don’t want her to do this anymore. Seeing her get hurt and in pain made me realize this is a dangerous sport, and the toll it's taking on her body is simply not worth it.  
  
My wife said I couldn’t make this decision without considering what my niece wants; I said I can because I’m the adult here and she’s still a child. So my wife said there was still the matter of her disagreeing with my view, and that we were supposed to make this parenting decisions together. I then said that's true regarding our boys, but not when it comes to my niece. All I meant is that I'm the sole guardian in the sense of being responsible for her; what my wife got is that I was undermining her as a surrogate mother. AITA here?

17z9yjw,AITA for telling a coworker she isn't Native American?,"I was speaking with coworkers and the topic of a nearby town came up. The town has a difficult to pronounce name and my coworker made a comment about what kind of idiot came up with the name. I pointed out that it was a word is from a Native American language. My coworker replied with ""well, I'm allowed to make fun of it then. I'm part Indian, Native American.""

My coworker appears very white. From what she has told me, her family has lived in the same rural area for years and this is the first time she has mentioned anything about this. Curious, I asked her what nation she was from and she said she had a Cherokee ancestor. I ask if she is registered with a Cherokee tribe and she says no. I ask who the ancestor was and she said her great great grandmother was a Cherokee princess.

Here's where I might be the asshole. I am white and know very little about Native Americans but I DO know that white people love to claim to be Cherokee without any evidence to back it up. And that the Cherokee nation doesn't have princesses. I know this because my estranged aunt used to say the same thing while everyone else in my family said they had literally NEVER been told about Indigenous ancestry. A DNA test of another aunt proved this later on. We're just white. 

So (and this is where I might have been rude) I tell her that the Cherokee don't have princesses and she's probably wrong. She got really defensive and insisted it was true. I told her that lots of white people claim to be Native and aren't, and that with DNA tests there isn't really an excuse not to look into it. Needless to say the vibe became awkward quickly and this coworker has been ignoring me since and seemed pissed at me.

Another coworker said I should have just let it go and not said anything. My reasoning is if she's going to say ""I'm Native American so I can make fun of them"" she better be damn sure she's ACTUALLY Native American. And if she is Cherokee, I feel like she still can't make fun of a DIFFERENT tribe's language anyway! So AITA?

1871n7d,AITA for not taking the baby as soon as I was asked?,"Our daughter is 7 weeks old. My wife is a full time SAHM (both of us want this until our daughter is at least 5, starts school and can openly communicate with us). I work full time making $25 an hour and while the pay is good, I've been looking for something a bit better just so we have more fun money, basically. I get home from work today at 3pm and she asks me to take the baby.

It was an interviewer and he wanted to do an over the phone interview and asked if it was a good time. I said yes.

About 40 minutes later I go back in and my wife is cooking dinner with the baby strapped to her chest. I said I could take the baby now and she said ""looks like I've got it"" and dismisses me completely.

185hwxa,AITA after my daughter wet herself in the car?,"I’ll try to keep this as straight to the point as possible. My family and I (39M) traveled to visit my wife’s parents for Thanksgiving which involved a 5ish hour drive one way. My daughter (13F) had gotten the new Zelda game for her birthday a couple weeks ago and spent the drive playing basically nonstop. On the drive back home, we stopped about 2 hours in for gas and a bathroom break. My wife and daughter went inside while I gassed up before going with my son to the men’s room. When we got out, my wife and daughter were already in the car, so we got back on the road.

Not even half an hour later, my daughter announced that she had to go to the bathroom and asked if we were stopping soon. I’m not a dickhead (maybe an asshole?) so I wasnt *mad* but I was confused. I asked her if her stomach was okay, and she said that yes, she felt fine, and that she didn’t have to pee when we stopped but had to pee now. I gave my wife a look, and she stammered that she (daughter) said she didn’t have to go. Fine. Whatever. Dumb, but whatever.

I asked my daughter if she needed us to stop right this second, or if she could hold it for a bit. She said that she had to go, but could wait.

Another 10 or so minutes passed before she frantically asked if we could stop because she really couldn’t wait. I told her I would get off at the exit with a bathroom.

Needless to say, she didn’t make it. My wife is annoyed with me for not stopping immediately, I’m annoyed with her for letting her say she didn’t have to go when I suspect she just wanted to get back to her game, and we’re both annoyed with my daughter for wetting herself when it was easily, *easily* avoidable.

17qz4iv,AITA for telling my friend she is ungrateful about being a stay at home mom?,"The other day, I went to lunch with 4 mom friends of mine. I'm a SAHM and so is one of the other moms. Of the other other three, one works part-time and the other two full-time.

One of the moms that works full-time mentioned about how they had started to pay for a cleaner to come in every other week. They both work full-time and have two kids and were finding they couldn't keep up with all the chores. 

The other SAHM was agreeing with her about finding it difficult to keep the house clean when her husband does only a few chores inside the house. She told us her husband's main jobs are cooking dinner, cleaning the bathrooms, and looking after the yard. 

In my opinion that's a more than fair distribution of chores considering her husband works full-time. They have one child (10F) and no pets. I mentioned to her that it actually sounded pretty fair and that my husband has zero cleaning chores and mostly only cooks on the weekends if he wants. 

I told her as he works full-time to provide for our family, I consider it my job to do the majority of the household chores. This isn't gender related in my opinion, if we both worked I would agree about splitting chores equally or if I worked and he didn't I would be expecting him to do the majority of the housework. I have five children, the youngest two aren't in school and I'm a carer for my husband's grandmother yet still it's easy to set aside a couple hours a day for household chores. 

She strongly disagreed with me and she thinks her husband should be doing more and told me couples should split housework equally. I told her that I think she's being ungrateful to her husband who allows her to be a SAHM even now their child is older. 

In the end lunch was ruined, she called me anti-feminist and an asshole. Two of our friends took her side telling me off for judging her(?). Was I the asshole here?

17vf9b2,AITA for “dressing up” too much at my kids school.,"I F42 was told by my husband M51 that I shouldn’t dress up to go to our child’s elementary school. 

I love fashion and do tend to dress up. I don’t like wearing jeans ( I don’t like the feel and it’s hot we’re I live). So I wear a lot of skirts(usually tea length or to the knee and trouser type pants. I love finding interesting prints and cuts. I usually wear heels and only wear active wear to the gym.  I’ve spent a lot of hours cultivating my wardrobe.  I volunteer at my daughters school often, am on the PTO board,and do pick up and drop off so I’m there a lot and the teachers know me pretty well.  I’m also one of the older moms in elementary and my husband is the oldest dad. 

We were at an awards ceremony. I was wearing a printed jumpsuit with an asymmetrical neckline. One of the teachers told me I always look like I just walked of the set of Sex and the City.  I took it as a compliment, since it’s an iconic show. My husband said it wasn’t and she is saying I’m always over dressed.  He also said the other parents don’t appreciate me trying to show off since they mostly wear jeans or active wear. 

My husband is retired and rarely dressed up. Which is fine with me, especially since he had to wear a suit everyday for 30 years. It’s all personal preference I think.  I just prefer different.  He use to love my style, but seems over it since he retired.  So should I be dressing more like other parents?",Fitboss68,4625,0.949999988079071,1392,1700003722,2023-11-14 17:15:22,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vf9b2/aita_for_dressing_up_too_much_at_my_kids_school/,11,2023
1802hkh,AITA for telling my dad’s wife that she’s getting her karma and to leave me out of it?,"I (15f) am my dad’s affair baby. My mom didn’t know he was married and broke it off when she found out but she was already pregnant. She decided to have me and has always been a great mom to me. A lot of my friends don’t get along with their moms but mine is really cool and I wouldn’t trade her for anyone. My dad takes me out on the weekends to do things and visits on holidays, but I’ve never lived with him or anything. When I was younger he had to take me to his house for a few hours one time when my mom was really sick and his wife yelled at him and I had to stay in a bedroom away from her because she was so mad. My mom explained the cheating when I was older and realized how weird the situation was compared to friends with divorced parents. I have feels about it, but he’s my dad so I try to not think about it a lot. I know my dad’s wife hates me and is the reason I can’t see him more, so yeah, she has a reason to be mad at him, but also screw her.

So a couple of months ago, my dad started asking if I would like to spend whole weekends with him. I said I would be ok with it if it wasn’t at his house. He said his wife wants me to come and she’s had a change of heart. Sounded really sus so I said no. Then this weekend she wanted to come have lunch with my dad and me. She said that she realized how important I am to my dad since they can’t have kids now and that she would like to make up for it all and be my step-mom if I would let her.

It really made me mad because my whole life she’s made it really hard to see my dad and now she wants to be nice? I might be TA because I told her that if she can’t have kids that’s karma for how she treated me and she’s never going to be anything but my dad’s wife. She started crying and my dad told me later that was a terrible thing and I need to apologize. My mom said that she put me in an unfair situation and I should probably avoid talking to her right now because she’s having to deal with infertility and hasn’t really gotten over things.

185gfj7,AITA for not letting my autistic BIL hold my newborn?,"My fiance (24M) and I (19F) had our first baby last week. He was born healthy but giving birth was very traumatic and hard on me mentally/physically. I had an emergency c-section after being in labor for three days. I still feel extremely foggy and out of touch with reality.

I only wanted my fiance's parents present to meet the baby in the hospital. The rest were welcome to Facetime us, but they would have to wait to see our son after we'd gone home and had time to adjust to having a newborn. 

I'm not close with my family because I left home at 18 to escape their abuse. Almost none of them are allowed contact with my child because of the way they treated me and my siblings. 

My fiance's family are a very close-knit group, and all of them have been very kind and welcoming to me up until this point. I wouldn't be marrying in if they weren't. The only one I've had issues with is my fiance's brother (30M) who has autism. He makes a lot of offhand comments and jabs that get passed off as 'dark humor'. 

When my in-laws got there, they brought my fiance's older brother who they care for and let live with them. He's diagnosed with autism but does not have any severe disabilities. I wasn't happy that they'd brought him against my wishes, but I didn't say anything after everything I'd gone through. 

My fiance's brother was adamant about holding our son. He was loud, had an attitude, and smelled terrible. His clothes were dirty and his hair was covered in grease. It was like he hadn't showered in weeks. Again, I didn't comment on his hygiene, but I tried to preface that I didn't want anyone holding the baby right now except my in-laws. I was as kind as possible. 

My in-laws told me that he didn't mean any harm and that he could wash his hands. I told them no again, and my fiance backed me up when they didn't calm down. My FIL law took his son home and my MIL stayed and apologized, but my fiance's brother is apparently 'deeply hurt' and texted my fiance to tell him not to marry me because I'm ""driving them apart"" and ""a bitch who wants to keep him from his nephew"".

I'd like to preface that my fiance himself has confirmed that his brother was not always this limited, and was fairly normal until high school when he seemed to start to play up his diagnosis for sympathy.  He hasn't worked a day in his life and lives off of his parents. He does not shower or even bother to apply deodorant before leaving the house. He would literally live in the same clothes for months if not for his mom doing his laundry. I have no ill-will for people with autism or disabilities (my youngest brother had down syndrome and cared for him as a identified child.)

17yhsua,"AITA for reminding my brother (42m) how old our mom was when she died, after he mentioned trying for a child?","My mother and father had my brother at 20 but waited on me until they were 40.

My dad died a few years after that because of health problems. My mom also had a long line of issues between and her family that resulted in immobility and lack of capacity. I was never really a kid because she needed someone to care for her and we didn't have the money for outside resources. She died when I was 19. Because I want fair judgment, I'll admit I'm resentful of my parents for having me when they did health-wise (not age wise - if they did not have so many health issues and had me at 40 I would feel differently). The roles just felt reversed. Maybe that's clouding my judgment. 

Many of their issues were genetic or a combination of genes with also negative health choices. My brother is now 42, in similar health as they were, and has expressed no desire to change or take steps towards reducing his risks of certain diseases. 

Him and I do not talk much and when we do it's very quick. He told me recently his wife and him were trying for a child. I didn't say anything because I didn't know how to reply. He later text me what was wrong? He said to be honest because it was clear I didn't like what he admitted and I told him both our parents died very young because of health reasons. I don't say that to scare him, but I was barely adult when mom died of things we are susceptible to. It's not up to me and he can do what he wants, yet consider how tough it can be to lose parents at such young ages and the impact it can have. 

There was no reply, but both his MIL and wife text me to say my mom was a brave woman and I need to get over what happened because she loved me, just like my brother will love his potential child. 

My brother wasn't around when our parents became very sick so I don't think it had a similar impact on him.

187vzpq,"AITA for not being happy that my parents invited my son to my ""welcome party""?","I'll try to make everything as easy to understand as possible, but of course I can answer questions if I have to. 

So, when I (m29) was 21 I got a scholarship to study in Japan (I was a college student in the US). I was very excited to go, however a girl I was seeing ended up pregnant (we were not together, but were exclusive). Of course I didn't want a baby with my fwb, and also it would ruin my opportunity to go to Japan. 

I begged her to have an abortion, since why would any of us want that baby? We were definitely not committed to each other. We had discussed abortions before (as many other subjects), so I knew that she didn't have a problem with abortions. However, she decided that she was going to keep the baby. I told her that honestly I didn't want to be a father, but that I'll wait until the baby's birth because maybe I'll feel different then. I didn't change my mind when the baby was born. So we agreed that I wouldn't be an active father, but I'll fullfil all of my responsibilities. 

I had to cancel my trip to Japan to get a better job so I could pay child support. Thankfully my parents also helped me so I moved in with them, I almost had to drop out of college but thankfully I was able to graduate. I still wanted to go to Japan, so when one of my ex classmates moved in there to work I asked him to let me know if there was any vacancy at his company. I got a job there and moved in October 2019. 

Ever since, I couldn't come back to America, because of COVID and also because the rhythm of work there is harder, so I was always working and trying to advance in my career. Of course I continued sending the money for my son. 

Well, the thing is that I have vacation now and I travelled for Thanksgiving. I got here the week prior to thanksgiving and my parents prepared a ""welcome party"" with our family and friends. They apparently got very close to my son when I was not here and they invited him and his mother. To be honest I don't have any problems with them, but we don't have a close relationship either. 

When I went to the backyard (where the guest were) I greeted them both, but I was feeling awkward and we didn't talk much. When everyone left my parents told me off because they expected me to be way happier about seeing my son. We got into a bit of an argument and now my mother and father are upset at me for being so cold? I don't understand why they expected me to be happier, I don't know my son too much, he wasn't very excited to see me either. But it's been far too long and they're still upset, si I need some outsider pov since my friends are agreeing with me, but they might be doing it just to not argue with me.


Edit: I'm sorry, I didn't realize this was not clear in the post. But I didn't kick my son or his mom out of the party, they stayed till the end. I greeted them, I asked him about his school and his martial arts classes and he told me he's doing fine, so I congratulated him. His mother hasn't texted me at all to tell me that the kid's sad after seeing me.

My sister recently went through a miscarriage on her seventh pregnancy, and I understand this can be a painful experience, but as I was talking about this with her, I told her at least she has other 6 children in her life already and that maybe that’s enough. She got very offended by my comment and told me I was being very insensitive and that her family choices have nothing to do with me. (Actually it has because I had to loan her and her husband money in more than one occasion so they could support the household, but I didn’t tell her that as to not make things worse).

Anyway, am I really the AH here?

17qxw6f,AITA for giving my adult daughter money to make up for missing out on her senior trip?,"I have three kids we'll call Brock (24M), Misty (21F), and Ash (19F).

Misty graduated from high school in 2020.  Due to world events, her senior year was spent at home.  Things like her senior trip, spring break, and prom got cancelled.  Her school never planned a ""make up"" trip or prom for her year and instead went back to business for the class of 2021. 

Misty, props to her, never complained about it.  She accepted things with a sense of resignation, if that makes sense.  Regardless, I can see that it hurt her to see her brother and sister get to do the things she couldn't do.

A few weeks ago, Misty reached out and asked if I can help her out with something.  Her favorite actor is going to be performing on Broadway next spring and she desperately wants to see that show.  She's in college and has a job, but needs help paying for a ticket.    

She made it clear that I didn't have to pay her if I didn't want to.  But given what happened three years ago and how she took it, I felt bad for her.  What she went through wasn't fair.

So I bought Misty a ticket for opening night.  It was expensive, yes, but frankly it was about the same amount that was spent for Ash's prom or Brock's letterman jacket and banquet.  

My husband doesn't agree.  He thinks that I'm spoiling Misty.  He doesn't see how it's fair to give our adult daughter money for a trip but not do the same for the other kids.  To him, what happened in 2020 happened in 2020 and you can't do anything to fix it.  

I disagree.  Brock and Ash got to go on trips, banquets, and prom for their senior year and Misty spent hers under lockdown.  She really had nothing to commemorate senior year.  And if anything, the money I spent on her ticket came out to less than all of the senior year expenses for either of our other children.  

I need an outside perspective.  AITA?  Or is my husband in the wrong?

I(29F) have an older brother (32M), we were raised by a single mother, and don't have any extended family, so we grew up pretty close.

I moved across the country 11 years ago to attend college, then stayed in the new state because it has better job opportunities for my field. My brother, on the other hand, remained close to my mother.

8 years ago he introduced his girlfriend to us over Christmas, and also told us that he got engaged. She asked me to be a bridesmaid and I accepted, but when she told me that their wedding date will be close to my finals, I warned her that I might not be able to do everything she needs me to do. She was very sweet, and said that that's ok, she just wanted me to be involved.

3 months before the wedding, my brother called me, he said that my ""lack of involvement and enthusiasm for being a bridesmaid"" was stressing his fiancée, and that they decided that I should just be a normal guest. I said that that was fine, apologized to him, then called her to apologize too.

Fast foreward to when they finalized the seating chart, and apparently I was seated in a back table, with some of my brother's coworkers, not even close to the family table. I was upset when mom told me, but didn't want to make a scene. My mom on the other hand demamnded they change my seat, which resulted in me being uninvited. I renember my brother telling me that his wife deserved the wedding of her dream, and that I was ""stressing her"". I asked my mom to back off, didn't go, but still sent a congratulations text and a gift. 

But I also stopped reaching out to my brother, and it became obvious that I was the only one keeping us in contact. We rarely met after that, mainly because they spend holidays with his in-laws, and then COVID hit.

I met a man during COVID, we hit it off, it became serious, and he proposed last year. I asked my mom to only tell my brother if he asked about me, and she respected my wishes. Also I don't have social media at all, so there was no announcement or anything like that.

We just sent out invites, and my brother got his, and for the first time in years, he called me upset, because I didn't tell him that I had a serious partner, let alone a fiancé.

I let him rant and rave, then just told him that it was not a secret, and if he bothered to ask me or my mom about my life, we would have told him. He said that I should have reached out to tell him, but I said that I did not want to stress him or his wife with my presence.

He called me an AH, and said they would not attend, to which I said ""it's your choice"", which made him even angrier, so AITA?",Charming-Corner-6235,3281,0.9700000286102295,311,1700348605,2023-11-18 17:03:25,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yin8d/aita_for_not_telling_my_brother_i_got_engaged/,11,2023
181ltdb,AITA for doing what my wife told me to yet she claims I threw her under the bus?,"Simple story - happened yesterday.

We have a 7 month old baby that is watched by a nanny most days but on some days, my parent's come over during the day to help out. Yesterday was a busy work morning as I essentially had to run out for a few meetings just as they arrived so I handed off the baby and gave them a quick status update. Wife is upstairs at home sitting on Zoom meetings.

I get a text mid-morning from my wife saying that she's hearing the baby fuss excessively for over 20 mins and for me to call my parents to suggest that the baby may just need a bit more food. I do just that - I call mom and say that my wife hears the baby fussing and that he's probably hungry. Mom says that dad was already prepping a bottle and that the baby was fussing just for a few minutes since they came back inside. Mom asks why my wife didn't come downstairs to say anything or check up if she was concerned and I just tell her that she's in a work meeting. I carry on with my meetings and carry on with my day. Nanny switched parent's off later on that day per schedule.

In the evening, wife asks me what I told my parents - I told her that I conveyed what she told me. ""Wife says baby is fussing, he's probably hungry, probably a good time to make a bottle, she's in a meeting and can't come down to check up."" That made wife very upset, says I threw her under the bus and made her seem insensitive and inattentive. My response was simply - ""But I did what you told me to...""

My brother Chris (37M) and sister in law Rachel (33F) have two kids 4F and 2M. I’ve taken an extended maternity after my most recent delivery due to some complications and won’t be back at work until after the new year. My husband went back when our little one was 4 months. 

Chris and Rachel came to my husband and I about 2 months ago saying their daycare could no longer keep them as the center was closing unexpectedly and they were in a bind and asked if I could watch the kids while they worked. I told them I would be willing to so long as it was temporary and not long term. Both assured me they were seeking out a new center that could take them both. Both were appreciative of our help as they were told on a Wednesday the center’s last day of operation would be that same Friday.

The first few weeks were fine but as it’s been longer and longer, my husband and I are staring to doubt they are actually looking for a new center. They’ve never offered to pay me for watching the kids, but I’ve never asked either. Until this past weekend. We took all the kids to a park on Saturday and I spoke with my brother about whether or jot they had found a mew daycare. He said they had done some tours but were told there weren’t spaces for the kids yet and had been wait listed. I told him I completely understood and reminded him me keeping the kids was supposed to be temporary. I asked him if he and Rachel could start paying me $100/week for both kids. He called me outrageous for even asking citing “we’re family.” 

I tried explaining how much more money my husband and I were spending having them in the house 5 days a week and he called me lazy for still being on leave when my baby is 8 months old. At this point, I told him I would no longer be watching the kids and not to bring them Monday (yesterday) morning. Since Saturday, Chris and Rachel have blasted Dustin and I on social media which has caused all kinds of friends and extended family to reach out, many calling us assholes amongst other things. Their post made them look like victims. When my mom reached out I explain the above and she’s now on on mine and Dustin’s side. Rachel, Rachel’s sister, and my brother have continued to text Dustin and I about what selfish assholes we are for not helping them in their time of need.

17n6ozb,AITA for ruining my wife’s friendship?,"My wife(34F) and her friend have been friends since high school. They are pretty close and she was a bridesmaid for our wedding. Recently another friend invited them to go to Italy to their family’s vineyard as their family was going to Spain for the month. So accommodations are free but the flight, food etc were extra. They left for 2 weeks. 

I was not aware of this trip until a month before it was suppose to happen(they booked it 2 months out). Recently I lost my job and had to get another one. It pays around half what my job originally did (120k>66k). My wife only has cashier experience and barely makes more money than it would be worth it for her to work as we have 2 kids (4 and 1). My wife isn’t the best with money, she does spend without thinking and she agreed to this trip without telling me. She had to beg her mom to look after the kids after she said yes to the trip and her friends booked the tickets. Her mom is from another city and came to live with me for 2 weeks as I had to work and couldn’t take care of them when I’m working.

I was extremely mad at her but allowed her to go as I know she’s been depressed since the baby and it was too late anyway. She asked her friend to cover her for the flight and she would pay her back. I knew it was hard for us to pay her friend back but it was a non refundable anyway.

She came back from the trip very happy until her friend asked for the flights. She had spent $1400 on the trip not including the flight and her friend wanted the $1200 that was the cost of the flight that she had put onto her credit card. We had $300 left in our account and already have credit card debt. We are thinking of downsizing our house to an apartment but it’s hard because as soon as landlords hear that we have kids they don’t want to talk anymore. It really sucks but I told her we can’t pay her friend back until I get a better job.

It’s been 3 months since the trip and her friend is getting angry because she promised to pay it back and we no longer have money. It’s not like her friend needs the money back, she makes six figures and has a house already, she’s not struggling. I told my wife we don’t have enough to pay her back and she will have to explain to her friend. They clearly did not have a good conversation as her friend blocked her and told their other friends about her refusing to pay her back. She cried and is mad at me for losing my job (I was laid off I had no choice) and I got mad at her and told her to get a job then because I’m trying my best.",Working_Ad639,2947,0.9300000071525574,962,1699049920,2023-11-03 17:18:40,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17n6ozb/aita_for_ruining_my_wifes_friendship/,11,2023

17rpoot,AITA for showing up to the wedding even after bride said she didn't want me there?,"This involves me, JJ (Bride) and Calvin (groom). 

Calvin and I grew up together as sandbox kids/neighbors. Took baths together, spent every waking moment of the first 14 years of our life together from preschool to trips our parents would take us on. Our parents always said we were destined to get married and even as kids, Calvin would always say I'd be the one he'd get married to. High school, we grew apart. There was no bad blood, we just had different interests and I was an unattractive nerd while he was star of the football team as cliché as it sounds. We'd still see each other on occasion through holiday parties and neighborhood dinners. 

Now we're 30. I feel much better about myself and have found success in my single life. Calvin then announced he was engaged a year ago to JJ. There was a holiday party with our families again and my parents went (I was out of town). Apparently both families and Calvin mentioned me when sharing his baby photos and that they always thought it would be us engaged. It didn't seem to be in a bad way, just kind of a joke. According to my mom, afterwards, JJ seemed to be really intimidated by me and the past. 

Apparently the families are still hanging onto the idea that I still wanted to marry Calvin. Sure, I was a tiny bit disappointed but it was like letting go of a childhood crush on Peter Pan, I'm not heartbroken about it and don't feel like anything was taken from me. 

Move on to JJ. She found me on facebook and contacted me saying that she would appreciate if I didn't go to the wedding because she saw me as an 'ex' despite us never having a relationship. I left it on read and went anyway to support my friend and he was thankful I was there. Wished them well at the dinner table and went back to minding my own business and chatting with the other neighbors, Calvin's family, etc. 

JJ reached out to me again and told me she was really disappointed in me and that me being there ruined her image of having a perfect wedding. I haven't shared this with anyone and don't think I will. I don't feel close enough to Calvin anymore to put a damper on his relationship. She seemed nice enough from what everyone's said, so that had me thinking if I really did ruin her wedding by being an AH and showing up anyway.

17twd4x,AITA for crying after I didn't like what I got for my birthday?,"It was my (16M) birthday yesterday and I was opening the gifts that my parents had bought me. 

I've never been interested in sports I find it really boring. I like painting and art way more and my parents know that. Almost every birthday they give me sport related gifts, footballs, some team merch, etc. I don't even know what some of it is because I couldn't give a shit about sports.

I asked my parents to get me a specific set of pens for my birthday, I've wanted them for ages.

I opened my present and every single one of them was sport related. I just sat there and started crying in front of them. I didn't mean to cry it was embarrassing but I feel like they never listen to me. They've spent all of this money on expensive gifts that they know I hate and will never use. I told them this and they accused me of being ungrateful and said that I've ruined the day.

They sent me to my room and I haven't really spoken to them since.

184nwuy,AITA for having our neighbor move their fence off our property,"Throwaway. My son helped me create an account to post this AITA.

A neighbor hired a contractor to build a wood privacy fence.  I came home after the posts were set and immediately suspected the fence posts were on my property.  We live in brand new homes and so I asked her to meet me outside with her survey.  I had already staked out the property line, and it was clear to see the posts were on my property.

 Before I could say a word, she said ‘you can’t tell where to put a fence with a survey’ which astounded me and left me shaking my head.  After a few minutes of trying to explain that a survey is absolutely the way to determine where your fence should be, she threw her hands up and said ‘my contractor has my survey’ and walked back in the house.  

The next week, the contractor continued to finish the fence without moving anything.  We emailed her and called her and she ghosted us.  I paid $900 to have a surveyor do a site visit and write a report that clearly showed the fence was on our property.  We sent that to her from our lawyer and she finally responded ‘there must be some mistake’.  Only after more legal threats did she get her contractor back to move it off our property.  

Meanwhile she trash talked us to everyone she could and labeled us bullies etc and has half our new neighborhood believing her.  She won’t talk to us, which is actually fine by us, but it really pisses us off knowing she has created this negative impression about us. 

 I should mention that our lots are pretty small and we had a very large backyard project done this summer and the fence was taking up valuable real estate that we needed to fit our plunge pool in.  We tried to deal with this in a polite neighborly way and she forced us to bring in our lawyer. So, AITA?

**edited to add relevant information: in the survey I paid for, the fence was measured at 12 inches into my property line. Not an insignificant amount if you ask me!** ",AITAthrowawayFence,2662,0.9700000286102295,324,1701040264,2023-11-26 17:11:04,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184nwuy/aita_for_having_our_neighbor_move_their_fence_off/,11,2023
17xqlvd,AITA for asking my daughter to take in her grandmother for a few days?,"I (55M) live with my MIL (82F,) wife, and two sons in the suburbs. Recently, my MIL has had trouble meeting her friends in the city, and her whole day has been disruptive. She spends most of the day at home either getting in the way of chores or watching TV. It's not healthy for her, since she doesn't really talk much to anyone or go out. 

I remembered that my youngest (30F) lives alone in the core of our city in an apartment, so I asked  MIL if she'd want to move in with my daughter so she can see her friends more often. MIL liked the idea and even seems excited.

Next time I spoke to my daughter, I asked her if she could take MIL in for a few days just to try it out. My daughter kept saying no, that she has no room and she can't move anyone in, but I said that she could just put out a mattress and let MIL try living there for a while since she likes the idea. She asked me if I told MIL about the idea. When I said yes, she just hung up on me and she hasn't picked up any of my calls since.

When I asked her where he really was she gave me a confused look. When I realized she was serious I told her to give him his phone back. I told her she was not to punish him for any reason even if it was justified. She told me that was stupid and she should have equal say. This might make me an asshole but I laughed at her response and told her that was the dumbest thing I heard. I told her just because she’s his new stepmother doesn’t mean she gets equal say in punishment, especially if she’s going to wrongfully punish him. She told me a b is nothing to be proud of. I told her that’s subjective and I doubt he is proud of it. She called me an asshole for not letting her be a mom.

First we thought about what they needed so we gave them that. Study table for her sister, washing machine for her mom, an AC for my mom, fridge for my parents house, etc. Then I invited my parents and hers on separate days to ask what they’d like to have and make a list for us. The lists came out that everybody wanted everything. 

Then we made our decision together and told them who gets what which of course isn’t ideal for either party. 

Now both my parents and hers are appealing to emotional side of us, telling each of us how the other one is facilitating their family more. They also claim they are not materialistic but the other family is. At the end of it, both sides are unhappy and both sides are blaming me for inequitable division. Her family thinks I took advantage of her and didn’t value her efforts. My family thinks my in-laws are materialistic and taking my hard earned money and things for granted.

17rpk5j,AITA for telling my friend we don’t care about pics of her cats right now?,"I (29m) am going on an early group “Friendsgiving” trip to Colorado in five days. All together there are five of us going but the one person I may have been an AH to is Sarah (28f). We have a group chat where we discuss planning for the trip and we all agreed to keep this chat exclusive to trip info so we don’t have important info being buried by random conversations. Two days ago we found out our Air BNB was canceled due to snow damage breaking a hole in the ceiling and we’d been scrambling to find a new place to stay. We couldn’t find another Air BNB so we settled for two, joining, rooms at a hotel that Sarah managed to find a deal for. We asked Sarah to text us the info for the hotel and she said she would, five minutes go by and instead of the hotel info we get a bunch of pictures of her two cats as well as a video with the caption “My two widdle fur babies are so precious, I’m gonna miss them so much.” Another friend reminded her to keep the chat relevant to trip info and asked again for the hotel information. Sarah replied with “Well screw me for missing my cats.”

Here’s where I may be the AH; I replied with “Sarah I’m sorry but we don’t care about your cats right now, when we’re trying to put our trip back together, can you please send the hotel info?” She sent the info and tagged it with a “F*ck you” to which she’s received heat from everyone who will be attending the trip. She has since apologized but I feel like my comment has put a damper on the vacation before it’s even started, AITAH for saying what I did?

Edit to add: All five of us were looking in to new hotels or Air BNBs, Sarah just happened to be the first one to find a good deal on something that we all agreed on, she wasn’t the only one looking.

Edit 2: To answer the question I’ve been seeing asked; why was it so urgent we get the information if we had five days. I apologize but I misspoke in the post. Sarah hadn’t actually booked it, she found a deal for it on one of those booking sites and we needed her to send it so the guy handling finances could pay for it.",AITAH_Viewer,2444,0.9200000166893005,251,1699570644,2023-11-09 16:57:24,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rpk5j/aita_for_telling_my_friend_we_dont_care_about/,11,2023

17qx9vr,AITA for holding my husband to the same standards he holds others too?,"I (F31) have been with my husband (M37) for 4 years.  He is constantly complaining about my two kids and how they always do the bear minimum when it comes to chores. But never says anything to his son about his chore being done minimal. For example he was complaining to me about my daughter's (F13) clothes still being in a basket in her room but has said nothing to his son (M14) about the clothes that are all over his room and not even in a basket. He also complains my daughter is on her phone to much mean while his son is on the Xbox from the time he gets off school (he is in a video game club at school and stays after twice a week to play games but even on the days he don't stay he comes home and jumps on) until it is tome to shower which he has to be told to do. Mean while I work a full time job and deal with all the finances and he is a stay at home dad. I then come home and have to finish the dishes that are not done and sort through the laundry that he has washed that day and give the kids theirs then fold the towels and my own clothes. ( I refuse to put my husband's clothes away and they sit in a basket in our room). So I finally tell him ""look until you can tell your son to do all his stuff properly and make sure his stuff is done properly don't tell me my kids are lazy and don't do what they are supposed to do. Also until you as an adult can put your clothes away don't complain about my kids clothes. For me here is the real kicker. I tell my kids daily what chores they need to do and if they are not done they get grounded. I also tell my step son what chores he needs to do and when they are not done I try to ground him and then get told ""no I'll have a talk with him it will get done"" and it don't get done.

17nyame,AITA for saying what I said to my sister because her and my wife are leaving me out of their trip and expecting me to pay the bills when they are gone,"
I (29m) and my wife (27f) moved into my sister's (31f) house about 8 months ago when I lost my job, against my will. My wife decided that we couldn't afford our life anymore despite her making a sizeable income and accepted my sister's invitation to move in, and has been spilting the bills with my sister since. Even though we are only two people and she has her children (3m and 6f) in the house as well so should be paying for 3 peoples portions, which I've mentioned several times.

  Yesterday they told me that in December they are going on vacation for two weeks. My wife, my sister, my sister's kids, and my sister's boyfriend.  When I questioned why I wasn't invited my sister rolled her eyes (passive aggressive as always) and my wife said that since I didn't have a form of income that I wouldn't be able to afford it, but they know that if I had enough time in advance I could've lent money from my mother, which is why I suspect they hadn't told me sooner but they say they just decided.

   I told them that it was completely unfair to go on a trip now that I have no money and never before when I could've come too. My sister loudly, i assume to embarrass me (this was in the front yard), implied I wasnt trying hard enough to get a job even though I have been trying and even louder told me not to go begging to mom. My mother doesn't mind lending me money she usually says don't even worry about it,  and I think they left it to now because she doesn't make a lot so if I need to borrow that much i need to let her now a couple months in advance.
  
  I asked my wife if I could get some help from her if I could get the plane ticket covered by my mother, and she insisted she couldn't despite her large savings account (it was over 10k last year) so now I'm thinking they just don't want me there and I got upset and here's where I may be the asshole I said maybe if she wasn't covering half the bills while my sister is not paying appropriately for her children's power and water usage she'd have the extra.

  My sister blew up and screamed at me for what was probably minutes, calling me a loser and a bum and many other hurtful things and said that if angry about whos using what i can pay the bills for the 2 weeks they are gone, despite me obviously not having the income to.

17q8foj,AITA for reporting my kid's teacher for being stupid?,"I got a call from my son's school on Thursday that he was being taken to the ER. His PE class was playing baseball and he got hit in the face with a ball and got knocked out. 

Fortunately the ball was a soft foamy texture. He had CT, MRI, and a host of other exams. They diagnosed him with a slight concussion and had a gnarly black eye and abrasions on his cheek. 

He was cleared to go back to school and looked a little fucked up. Everyone knew what happened and some of his teachers emailed us to see how he was doing. We emailed them to keep an eye on him.

Today my son came home and said his teacher asked what happened to his face. He was confused. Like everyone knew. He's a 6th grader and even the 7th and 8th graders and their teachers knew. The fucking ambulance came to the school.

His teacher held him at lunch  today. Ms. D said he could tell her the truth because his face didn't look like a baseball hit it but ""someone"" did. He said no, it was a baseball. She asked how he was being treated at home. He said fine. She said she didn't believe his story and would have to tell the principal. My son said okay.

When my son told me this, I started to laugh. No way is his teacher this fucking dumb. Well, sure enough I get an email a couple of hours later from the VP saying a staff member submitted a report that they were suspicious of my son's face. The VP assured the staff that it was from an injury at school. Like everyone knew.

I was so mad that I emailed Ms. D and told her I knew she submitted this report trying to start shit. How could she be that fucking stupid? She knew about the accident but she didn't think a baseball to the face would leave a blackeye. This caused all of us so much needless stress. I think she was trying to get brownie points and look busy. 

I also replied to the VP that my son now has extreme anxiety going back to her class and we're worried that he'll start experiencing headaches from being stressed out over his dumbass teacher. This could had gone real bad. He replied that he was taking this seriously and she won't be in my son's 3rd period class tomorrow.

181mnhy,AITA for bringing up my aunt's ex-husband after she kept pushing me to get married?,"My (32F) aunt (55F) is one of those nosy ladies you'd think only exists in romcoms. When I was a teen she asked me when I’d get a boyfriend, when I was in a steady relationship she asked me when I was getting married, and the marriage inquisition became even more invasive after my younger sister (28F) got married this month – which probably gave my aunt probable cause to label me as the family's “spinster”. 

In the wedding party, she kept asking me why I had broken up with my ex-boyfriend, she said how she always thought we’d ended up married soon, and she advised me to get serious about this if I ever plan to have kids, because I’m not getting any younger. It came to a point where I couldn’t keep my mouth shut anymore. Granted, I could have just asked her to stay out of my business, but since she was bringing up things about my personal life, I assumed it was fair to do the same. 

So I said something like: “even getting married is not a guarantee you’d be with someone forever, look at you and Uncle X, I’m sure you thought it would be eternal love yet now he’s with someone else”. It was the same as slapping her in the face; she accused me of being disrespectful and left the table on the verge of tears.

184okt4,"AITA for ""ruining a child's Xmas"" cuz I refused to sell my doll?","I(36f) love thrifting. I'm also I kid at heart so this summer when I found several bags of American Girl doll clothes- I bought them. I collect old dolls that sometimes need clothes but was really hoping an AG doll would show up. Against all odds, one did show up on the shelf a few weeks later. As a kid I wanted an AG doll so badly but they have always been pretty expensive so I never got one. I paid $35 for her took her home and enjoyed dressing her up. My son joined in, dressing up his stuffies. It was so cute that I took a pick and put it on FB. Also, while researching her I found out my doll is a Just Like You #11 which are a bit rare & go for $100+-$300+ online. always fun to find valuable things at the thrift store for cheap!

Fast forward- today, a few days after Black Friday I got tagged in a friend of a friend's post. ""Kay"" is asking if anyone has an AG doll to sell. She had tried to buy one online for Black Friday but couldn't find anything within her price range. I instantly had Kay in my DMs offering me $50 for my doll. I declined.  telling her that I don't know why my friend tagged me cuz my doll isn't for sale. 

She replied about how she had promised her 6yr old granddaughter ""Mia"" a doll for Xmas. She was now worried if she ordered a more expensive doll online it wouldn't get to her in time & offered me $70. I again declined & said my doll was something I had wanted at Xmas as a kid & waited a long time for.

Kay immediately countered. ""See you know what it's like not getting the AG you wanted so badly. Please! You could make this Xmas so special for Mia! You can use the money to get a brand new one!""

I thought about it. I really did but I told her no thanks. Finding mine at the thrift shop felt special- like it was meant to be. I suggested if she was worried about the doll not getting to her in time she could get one of the much cheaper AG knockoff Walmart dolls & have it ready just in case & return it if the AG doll makes it in time.

Kay didn't want to get a cheap doll. She then switched tactics. Asking me if I would even be able to look at my doll again knowing that not selling her meant I ruined Xmas for a little 6yr old girl?

Yes I can Kay because when you decide to be manipulative is where I draw the line. I immediately blocked her. maybe this makes me the a-hole but I don't really care. I'm sorry little Mia.

A time or two my husband has asked his mom for help paying a bill,  and she has reluctantly helped us. While I am extremely grateful  for her help, and have expressed my gratitude wholeheartedly..she's the type of person who will never ever let you forget about every cent she's ever helped out with.  She would constantly bring it up, and  it just kind of felt demeaning in a way. Especially because I  HATE asking anyone for help, but these were times when it was a last resort.

Fast forward to a couple Christmases ago, she mailed us a $200 gift card for Christmas. I work retail and Christmas is kind of a crazy time of year for me. I work late nights and long hours. When the card arrived I was at work, and my husband FaceTimed his mom with our kids to thank her for the gift. I intended on personally thanking her, but I just got busy and forgot.

A couple weeks of my life consisting of  basically just working and sleeping go by, and my husband mentioned that his mother hadn't called him in a while. He ended up calling her to make sure everything was okay and she WENT OFF.

She asked my husband why I hadn't thanked her for the gift card. He told her that when he thanked her, he was thanking her on my behalf as well, and that I've been working a lot.

She said it was unacceptable, and that I needed to thank her, because, to her I looked ungrateful.

When he told me that his mom was angry and that I should just thank her I flat out refused. Not because I wasn't grateful, but because she made such a huge deal about   it. She obviously only sent it as another thing to throw in our faces, and not out of the kindness of her heart. 

Since my husband defended me, and I never thanked her, she blocked both of us on social media and hasn't attempted to contact us or her grandchildren in years. 

My husband knows she's ridiculous for  taking it that far, but every once in a while he'll say something like ""you know,  you could have just sucked it up and thanked her"".

17pfiz6,AITA for using a disabled bathroom without a physical disability?,"I (f16) was studying in my local leisure centre while my sister and dad were swimming, and instead of going into the regular bathroom I went into the unlocked disabled one, it isn't one that needs a key, I've been diagnosed with tourettes for about 8 years now, and I feel uncomfortable in the regular bathrooms because I get loads of weird looks and just kind of like ""what the fuck is wrong with her"" kind of whispers behind my back from girls my age

I didn't see a problem however whenever I left a woman (about 30 or so) started telling me off, saying that I was ""a disgusting ableist for using the disabled bathroom without a disability"" I tried to explain that tourettes was a disability but she wasn't hearing it, I told her if she needed to use the bathroom she could and I was sorry if I inconvinenced her, but she told me that she didn't need the disabled bathroom because she ""wasn't disabled and didn't want to take those resources like I did""

I ended up walking away but she got a member of staff and the staff member asked for my proof of diagnosis, I didn't carry it with me and I explained that, the member of staff ended up telling me off and not to use the bathroom, and any time I ticked throughout this, she'd point at me and go ""she's doing it again!!"" 

But now I'm not sure whether I made the right choice in using the disabled bathroom for my own comfort without a physical disability

17t71hr,AITA for refusing to host an all-vegan Hanukkah?,"My partner David and I are in an interfaith relationship and host both Hanukkah and Christmas every year. We enjoy hosting and especially cooking, and have zero problem catering to people's dietary needs. A few members of my family keep kosher and my cousin Ruth is vegan – all of them get a full meal (main, three sides, dessert) and drinks just like those without dietary restrictions at all of our holiday celebrations.  

My cousin offered to host Hanukkah at her house this year, which of course meant an all-vegan menu. The vast majority of the family said that they would prefer to have our normal arrangement at our house, as they were not interested in celebrating a holiday with a vegan menu, as they'd be missing out on many traditional family foods and recipes – many of which have been in our family before the Shoah. 

Ruth then came to us and asked if we'd be willing to cook an all-vegan Hanukkah, especially as we're both good cooks and she was sure that people would come round to the vegan dishes we made if they gave them a try. My partner and I politely declined, but asked her if there was anything we could do, prepare, or cook to make her feel more welcome. She said a lot of very hurtful things in response and has not spoken to us since.

183waoi,AITA for refusing to go the fanily dinner?,"Me (30f) and my twin brother live in different cities. Before last Christmas, I was speaking about gifts woth my brother and he was unsure what gift to get his wife (30f). During this conversation, I mentioned that I got her a book she really liked in a library when they came over on a previous visit. He asked if I he could pay me to have the gift for her, and I would get her something else. I agreed. But since the next day I was travelling to their house for the Christmas dinner, I got her a last minute bath set.

During the gift exchange, she absolutely loved the book from my brother, and was polite about my gift. However, later during the evening she mentioned how she ""understands when money is tight"" and that I ""could get more thoughtful gifts next time"". It did not feel good. Then we travelled back home and never spoke about this again.

Today, I am speaking to my brother on the phone and discuss about Christmas gifts. I tell him that for my sister in law, my gift is a wool sweater that she specifically mentioned she liked a while ago. My brother asks again that I let him give this gift to her and that I get her something else.

I said no, especially after last year. He had no idea that my sister in law made any comments and said that maybe I interpreted wrongly. The he said he actually remembers my sister in law speaking privately with him afterwards and saying that gifts are a reflection of love and that I clearly don't put much thought in her gifts. I asked him to just get her something else because I put thought in my gift, and have no idea what to get her otherwise. After some back and forth I agreed to let him have the gift, but I told him I am not coming for dinner this year as I don't want to hear any more comments. He said that I am a baby, and to think about it.

I am quite upset that he does this thing of asking for my gift. I also don't put that much pressure on myself when it comes to gifts, but I make an exception with my sister in law as she often discusses the gifts she normally gets.

17t6e4x,AITA because I “stole” someone else’s table?,"Spouse (40m) and I(35f) were out shopping in our local Indian market. At a small cafe/restaurant while spouse and I ordered things at different counters for a quick dine-in bite, someone else placed a bag on the last open table, “claimed” the table as his and went somewhere else. 
When I was done with placing my order, I came and sat myself on the “claimed” seats since no one was physically sitting there except a lonely shopping bag on top of the table. 
Then my spouse came, sat himself and we started chatting while waiting for our food to be served.

This guy who had “claimed” the table earlier, came and angrily told me that he was sitting there, even though no one was sitting there except the shopping bag. I told him off by saying, “I didn’t see anyone sitting here. Besides, this is an open cafe not a DTDC bus where you get to claim a table by placing your belongings on it.”

Had he asked to share the table, I wouldn’t have mind it. But the tone he used, pissed me off.

17q6i3h,AITA for not wanting my MIL to fly over to visit when my baby is born?,"My MIL has no job, no savings, no husband, and lives in a different country. She divorced my FIL when my husband was a kid and have only remained in touch via Facebook. When she heard my husband and I were getting married she started messaging my husband more and more often and was telling him everyday how he is her favorite son (my husband has several half siblings -same mother different fathers). My husband paid for her trip to our wedding because she allegedly told him that her money was “tied up” at the time. 

Fast forward to now, we are expecting a baby in the new year. When she heard the news she immediately told my husband that she’s going to visit us to take care of the baby. When I heard my anxiety just went through the roof. 

1. I don’t want “help” from her. If anything I would rather have my mom here - I have no plans on entertaining this woman while I am recovering from child birth and learning to be a first time mom, especially when my husband has decided not to take any paternity leave 
2. She will somehow need us to pay for her trip here AND the food while she’s here - my husband and I are already worried about living on a single income while I am on leave 
3. I have a gut feeling that once she is here, she will never leave and we will be stuck

I told my husband it is not a good idea and I don’t want her to come visit but he turned it around on me and asked “how would you feel if your child told you not to come?”.

17qzhj8,AITA for raising my voice and saying my husband's nephew was being unthinking and selfish?,"My husband (26M) and I watch his nephew Seth (10) one weekend a month while my husband's sister Anna (30F) works extra or takes a weekend to herself. She's a single mom, so the family tries to help her when possible. My husband and I agree that both Seth and Anna are very self-centered. When we can, we try to help Seth learn to see other's perspectives and break out of his self-centered-ness, while acknowledging that he is 10 and this can be a challenge for a child. We had him an extra day yesterday because we were both off work and he was out of school.

We limit the beverages Seth has at our apartment. If he wants something to drink that's not a cup of water, one of us has to get it for him. This is because we've caught him guzzling multiple sodas in a matter of minutes after telling him he can have *one*, or he'll drink our chocolate milk from the carton, etc. He can't control himself with sugary beverages.

We had just finished eating lunch and Seth asked if he could have a cup of milk. My husband said he would get him one in a few minutes. Unfortunately, my husband ended up blacking out and had a short convulsive episode This happens occasionally, so I tried to keep myself together to get him on his side, time it, etc. I was also trying to tell Seth to leave the room until it was over because it's distressing to see, but Seth stayed in the room. Thankfully, my husband woke up right after the episode subsided. He was alert but said he wanted to lie on the floor for a while. As I was getting him a pillow, Seth asked my husband, ""Well, can you get my milk first?""

My husband didn't respond to him, but I did. I pulled him into the kitchen (where I could still keep an eye on hubby) and told him he was being ""unthinking and selfish."" I will admit my voice was raised, in part due to the stress of the moment leaving my body but also, admittedly, out of anger at Seth. I permitted him to get his own milk for the moment because I thought I would lose my cool if he asked again.

Anna apparently heard of this after Seth went back home. She has been going back and forth with me and my husband through text (and one very angry voicemail) saying how dare I scream at her son (which I did not do) and how it was our fault for having ""stupid rules"" for him. My in-laws are trying to play referee but they want me to apologize to Anna because ""it would make things easier for everyone if she wasn't angry."" I said it would be easier for everyone if Seth (and Anna) were taught to be a little less selfish. She hasn't shown any interest in how her brother is doing.

17n7q7t,AITA for telling my BIL to leave my children alone?,"My wife and I have 3 children and this situation involves our 2 oldest. Back when they were young, we had crazy work schedules. On the other hand, her brother has a job and position where he can come and go as he please so he helped with our children. The three of us took turns taking the kids to school and picking them up. The kids sometimes stayed with him for a day or two. When they grew older, our work schedules stabilized so we didn’t rely on him as much. However, the kids are incredibly attached to their uncle to the point it seems like I’m being replaced.

Once when our daughter ran out of panty liners, she called her uncle to ask him to pick her up some. My wife was at work but I was working in the yard and she didn’t think to ask me. A year ago our son was questioning his sexual identity and instead of coming to me or his mother, he went to talk to his uncle and then my BIL told my wife about their conversation. I was the last to know about it. On our daughter’s last birthday, she was most excited about his gift because he got her the exact model and color tennis racket she wanted. She didn’t take a second look at my present. The last straw happened earlier today when our son was sick at school.

Instead of calling me or his mother, he called his uncle. BIL texted us about the situation and asked my wife to call the school so that he could pick up our son. I was home and no one asked me to do it. I was very angry when BIL dropped our son off. I confronted him about over stepping our family boundaries and we got into an argument. I told him to leave our house and leave our children alone. My wife just got home from work and we got into an argument. She doesn’t like the way I talked to her brother but I don’t like the way I’m being left out of my children’s life. She said we’re lucky to have him help us out but I don’t want his help anymore.

184oall,"AITA for going against my boyfriend's ""family rules""?","I've been dating Marc for the past six months and he's been a nice guy so far. Has all the qualities I would want in a partner. He's nice, kind, an amazing cook. We do everything together and have never had problems in our relationship thus far. 

Marc took me to meet his family for the first time ever two days ago. My period was a day or two late this month so I wasn't surprised when I started menstruating in the middle of playing with Marc's neices. I didn't think much of it and told Marc's mom (who was playing with the neices alongside me) that I needed to use the bathroom since I've gotten my period. I was not expecting to see disgust on her face. 

She looked really panicked and disgusted when she stood up to lead me to the bathroom. The whole time, she kept telling me not to touch anything or anyone, and to maintain a safe distance from the food on the dinner table. It was bizzare to me but I kept my mouth shut until I could get a tampon inside me. 

When I came out, I noticed that Marc's mom seemed wary of me. I asked her if everything was okay and she said that everything was fine but that I couldn't touch certain things in the house, especially the items made out of cloth. This included the couch. I had to sit on a random wooden chair. I would not have minded if not for the context. 

This whole situation made me extremely mad as she was treating me like I was impure and untouchable. The other women in the house did not say anything and the men pretended to not hear the commotion. I told Marc's mom clearly that I was not going to be following these rules and would much rather prefer to be out of the house. 

Marc had gone out to get ice creams for everyone so I did not get the chance to tell him before I stormed out and went back home by cab. He wasn't upset with me but he did say that I could've waited for him to come back even though it wasn't completely necessary.
