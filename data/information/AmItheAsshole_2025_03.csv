1jhkq9l,AITA for agreeing with my daughter it is weird her friend's mom has access to their conversations?,"My daughter is 14 years old and has a friend ""Chloe"". She and Chloe have been friends for a little over a year now. Chloe's mom ""Gina"" is someone I'd consider pretty strict. I was aware she'd check Chloe's phone (and I know a lot of parents do this), but I found out a few months ago through my daughter that she'd respond through Chloe's phone to Chloe's friends, including my daughter. It was never anything overkill, just ""Chloe can't talk right now, she's busy with homework"" or whatever. I thought this was odd but didn't say anything to Gina about it because that's her life and her business. 

I got a call from Gina earlier this afternoon. She was very pissed off and told me that my daughter was rude, I needed to start monitoring what she says, etc. I asked her what exactly happened and she said my daughter gave her an attitude via text. I was still very confused and asked why they were texting. Gina became exasperated and snapped ""Through Chloe's phone!!"" I told her I'd call her back and asked my daughter specifically what happened. My daughter willingly showed me her texts. She had texted Chloe something. Gina had responded (using Chloe's phone) saying Chloe was busy. My daughter replied asking when Chloe would be available to talk. Gina told her ""When she's ready, stop texting her"". My daughter replied ""You don't have to be so rude"". Gina said she wasn't being rude. My daughter said yes, Gina was, and also called her a weirdo for using Chloe's phone. 

I told my daughter next time, just don't engage. I did also say it wasn't kind to call someone a weirdo and not to do it again, but that I also understood her frustration. I didn't punish her, she seemed receptive to the talk and I left it at that. I called Gina back and told her I had spoken to my daughter and handled the problem. Gina started ranting that I need to monitor my daughter's phone and have I seen some of the things she talks about? She started on crushes, rants about teachers, saying there were times my daughter badmouthed me when frustrated. I said that's all fine, I'd rather her have a safe space to vent with her friends, after all, she's a teenager. Gina kept pressing on the issue and what would be done. I told her nothing, I spoke with my daughter and handled it. Gina said ""But she insulted an adult!"" I told her I handled it, but my daughter also didn't say anything that wasn't true, Gina \*was\* acting like a weirdo.

Now, Gina is angry with me, My daughter doesn't care that I said all of this. However, my husband thinks that I shouldn't have said it, as it didn't solve anything, and Gina can parent how she wants. I said I never commented on Gina's parenting, until she tried to undermine/insult mine.

1jc77j4,AITA for calling out my husband's friend after he made inappropriate comments about my son's paternity?,"I (23 F) have been married to my husband, Alex (27 M), for 2 years, and we have a 10 month old son, Dylan.

Alex has a friend named Mike (27 M). They’ve been best friends since high school. From my first encounter, I did not like Mike. He is really childish, likes to be the center of attention, and has a crude sense of humor. It’s like he never got out of his frat boy phase. All of my husband’s friends are married or in long-term relationships, whereas Mike has never been in a long-term relationship or has brought any woman around. He has also made some weird comments toward me that made me uncomfortable. My husband has a deep bond with Mike, and they often go on hunting trips or have boys' nights. I’ve never tried to keep my husband from hanging out with his friend, but I have limited my contact with Mike as much as possible since we’ve been together.

Mike came over to pick up my husband to go golfing. I was holding our baby when I answered the door. Mike greeted us at the door, asked to hold my baby, and was cooing at him. Then he said, “Hey there, man…come to poppa,” and my husband and Mike started laughing. A bit of background: I have brown hair and blue eyes, and my husband has black hair and brown eyes. Our son’s hair is coming in blonde, and he has blue eyes. Mike has blondish hair and blue eyes. I was a bit caught off guard by it but ignored his comment. Mike then said, “He looks like me. Maybe he's mine,” and my husband and Mike continued to laugh. I was obviously not amused. I told Mike to hand me my son and then told him, “Not in a million years, and no woman with sense would want you.” Neither my husband nor Mike laughed at my comment, and Mike just made a face before he and my husband left.

Later, my husband told me I “took it too far” with Mike, that Mike was just joking, but I made it personal. I told him those comments were disrespectful to me as his wife and the mother of this child. He then said it’s obviously not true, so why am I so upset when I know how Mike is.

1j6u713,AITA for telling my client my birthday and she shamed my coworkers for forgetting my birthday?,"I was hired last May into a company that is all about celebrating everyone. I was asked and paid into collections for my bosses birthday, 3 coworkers birthdays were everyone got flowers and cake and cards and balloons and free lunch. I sung happy birthday and participated in pictures, etc. I also participated in collections for coworkers when family died and my boss for the Christmas party. My birthday was last week. I had mentioned I was excited for my birthday the week before. Nothing. No one said a thing. Noone wished me happy birthday, or a card or anything. It hurt, but I ignored it. So, my client knew there was someone on the staff with a birthday near hers and she was trying to figure out who the Pisces on staff was. Every day for 2 weeks. The day after my birthday I told her. She had lots to say to the staff about not celebrating my birthday in our usual fashion. It hurts I was forgotten, but I don't think I did anything wrong. Somehow, my coworkers are blaming me for not giving them time to celebrate my birthday. (It literally is in our computer email system...wish your team member a happy birthday!)

1j59byb,AITA for feeding my family a fish dinner while I eat steak and potatoes,"So apparently we don’t get many characters so I’ll try my best to make this short and simple and straight to the point. 

I am three months pregnant and almost everyday I’ve been craving steak and sour cream baked potatoes. I never really cared for steak I’m more of a chicken fingers and fries girlie but I’m guessing the baby must’ve loved steak in its past life because that literally all I crave when I don’t even care for it. 
Today I made my family baked pizza spaghetti with fried catfish a lunch eat salad (salad with chopped deli meat) and dinner rolls. I of course am making the same dish I’ve been eating for almost everyday these last few months. I pretty much make 2 separate meals each night for my cravings. 

Last night after I served the kids and was getting ready to make my finances plate he expressed he wanted steak and potatoes like me. Mind you he was aware of the menu because I have my meals planned night before . I told him I only had that one steak for me. He said “ well we can share” I politely told him that I will need to eat all of my food since I am feeding for two and this is all I have for the night knowing I’ll most likely still be hungry whilst you guys have a meal you can come back for seconds. I am now, in his words a “selfish woman using pregnancy as an excuse to be selfish”. I asked what’s different about today than all the other days when I’ve been literally eating the same shit almost everyday with no complaints? He said nothing but shook his head and said “ it’s the principle bae” and just walked off. We’ve barely spoken since. Just a dry good morning and goodbyes. AITA? 

Maybe if he expressed that he wanted the same thing as me I would have prepared for it but he literally always eats what I make.

1jf933s,AITA after telling my Aunt they can't respect my decisions then my kid can't come over anymore?,"I(33F) have an Aunt(53F) who sometimes picks up daughter (6F) for over nights at her place. My daughter recently returned from one of those trips. During so I got a phone call about my daughter's toes being red and maybe the shoes being too small. My aunt was wanting to throw them out but I was going to pass them on to my younger niece(2F) as my kid hasn't worn those shoes much. My aunt's boyfriend said he was worried I would put them back in her, which I said I wouldn't if they were small but wanted them back to pass down to my niece. Turns out she decided to go to my mom (53F) for permission to pitch the shoes. My mom gave the blessing since she didn't know why I wanted them back. When my daughter was dropped off, my aunt dropped he and her stuff off quickly then bolted which was weird for her. As I was emptying my daughter's luggage I noticed said shoes were not in there. Daughter sad that they told her they were keeping the shoes for safe keeping but I found out the truth shortly after. I tried calling my Aunt but she is not answering. It's not just about the shoes but this has happened multiple times with other things because my mom said it was ok and her being my mom negates my decisions for MY daughter.

1jamw4y,WIBTA for not going to my sister’s wedding because her venue is not wheelchair accessible?,"My (24F) sister (30F) is getting married soon. I’m very happy for her and there are no issues between the two of us.

She really wanted to get married in a specific location and she got it, which is great, but that location is pretty much not accessible to wheelchairs. I have a significant disability (paraplegia) and cannot move at all without a wheelchair, so going there would be tough.

She told me that I could be carried up any stairs and then stay at the tables, but that’s not something I’m comfortable with. Getting carried is very uncomfortable and dangerous, especially when done repeatedly by someone that isn’t used to it, and I really don’t want to have to be carried to the toilets at a wedding full of strangers… or even worse, have an accident.

Then I also wouldn’t expect people to just sit with me while the celebrations are going on, but the idea of sitting there and watch for hours feels wrong, especially that after a few hours sitting hurts a lot and skin becomes a concern, but I wouldn’t ask someone to leave the wedding just for me.

I’m not upset about the fact that they picked that venue, it’s their day and I don’t expect them to plan it based on my needs, but I also don’t think she understands that it’s not as easy as she thinks. There are so many things that could go very wrong.

I intend to get them a nice gift and propose to maybe spend quality time together afterwards/before. One of my cousins told me that it’s just one day and that it’s very important for my sister, so I should make an effort and “get out of my comfort zone”, but I feel like endangering my health isn’t as simple as getting out of my comfort zone…

So, WIBTA for not going?",Ataleiia,6034,0.9800000190734863,766,1741900295,2025-03-13 16:11:35,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jamw4y/wibta_for_not_going_to_my_sisters_wedding_because/,3,2025
1jg2tqy,AITA for not loving my sister's children the way she and her husband do?,"TL;DR - On a recent visit to see my sister and her threr children, told me she was hurt and disappointed that I don't love her children in the same manner that she and her husband do. I told her this was an unreasonable expectation...AITA?

The past two years I (43f) have traveled to spend a week with my sister (40f) and her family. She and her husband and have three young boys - a 3.5 year old and twin 2.5 year olds. It's about a 6 hour flight, so it's not a trip I can make on a regular basis.

When I visited last February, it was a great trip. Good mix of sister time, hanging out with the kids and her husband, a night out, a house party, just all around enjoyable. Her husband is great and is a stay at home Dad. My sister works from home and is a successful business woman. I was genuinely excited to go visit again last month.

I'm not a kid person and I never have been. My partner and I are intentionally childless and we love our quiet, low key life. I'm good with kids. I'll play with them with their toys, I'll crawl around on the floor with them, I'm down to do whatever goofy thing they're into - but for only about 2 hours at a time. Then I have to tap out and recharge.

I'm also not great with the constant noise kids make. I understand that's just what they do, but I've got a low threshold for it, especially when it's the full blown meltdowns. For the first 3-4 days I was at my sister's, the three kids were screaming and crying nearly every 25 minutes. So when the temper tantrums started, I'd go outside or at least leave the room.

At one point, the kids and husband are out of the house and my sister took the opportunity to tell me how she's disappointed that I ""don't love the boys the way (husband's name) and I do."" 

I said that I do love the boys and I asked if there was something I did or didn't do with the kids that upset her. She said no, that I was great with them. I asked if she thought I was paying enough attention to them. She said I was, but brought up my low tolerance for the fits. I apologized and reminded her that I'm really not used to it and that it's kind of stressful, so I just remove myself from the situation.

Things kind of devloved from there, but we recovered and the rest of the trip was fine enough. Am I the asshole thinking that my sister's request is way off base? I love my nephews, but I don't think anyone can love children in the way that child's parents do. 

Edit: Thank you for all the feedback! It gave me a lot of things to think about and reflect on. I've come to think my sister's criticism that I don't love her boys like she does is not an actual, literal expectation. I think it might be a weird, kind of manipulative way of saying ""I need you to think I'm a good parent.""

It's entirely too much to get into here and of course details and context are missing. But, I think I need to call her so we can talk about this and what's going on.

Thanks for confirming that I'm NTA and that the perspectives of my family and friends were not just super biased in my favor 🙃",happyhappy_joyjoy11,5734,0.9800000190734863,348,1742512993,2025-03-20 18:23:13,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jg2tqy/aita_for_not_loving_my_sisters_children_the_way/,3,2025
1j606lg,AITA for leaning on a nearby wall after being denied use of gym equipment by a woman doing supersets?,"So my apartment building has a small exercise area including a cable crossover machine, an adjustable bench, dumbbells, some treadmills, and a small side room for yoga or other bodyweight/kettlebell exercises.


The gym was empty this morning except for one woman doing row exercises on the cable crossover machine. I noticed that she had placed her phone next to the bench with a couple of dumbbells. For context, I’m a tall-ish guy and she’s shortish and appears nonbinary (which is fine by me, I’ll refer to her as “she” here because I don’t know her pronouns or how she personally identifies). I specify this because it seems like that plays into the dynamic from her perspective.


“Can I use this bench?” I ask.


“No,” she replies. “I’m doing supersets.”


I was a bit taken aback. There is room for two, maybe three people in the resistance/weight training area, and she was using every piece of equipment.


Not sure what to do, I lean on a nearby wall and start looking at my phone. I’m a bit miffed and I look up every so often to see when she’ll be done. She takes her earphone out and says something to the effect of, “Are you just going to stand there?” and we get in a big argument.


I say something to the effect of “What else am I supposed to do? You won’t let me work in.”


“I don’t want you up in my space. Go do something else,” she says.


“So I can’t do pullups on the cable crossover while you’re using the bench?” I reply.


“No. I don’t want you up in my space,” she says.


“That’s just bad etiquette,” I reply.


It then continues like this for a bit. I accuse her of being rude, she accuses me (verbatim) of using my “male privilege.” Eventually she finishes her sets and leaves.

In every gym I’ve worked out at it would be considered rude to bogart multiple pieces of equipment while others have to wait. I lived abroad for years before this - is this still the case in US gym culture? AITA for leaning on a nearby wall and waiting, rather than going and stretching or running on the treadmill?

1j7itfg,AITA for refusing to change my bachelorette trip date and shutting down a friend’s attempts to reschedule?,"I’m getting married this year, and my friends (a group of 16) and I have been planning my bachelorette trip. To make scheduling fair, I asked everyone to send me the dates they were not available so I could pick a date that worked for the most people—especially since some friends are traveling from other countries.

After going through everyone’s responses, there was only one date that worked for everyone. So, I announced it.

That same day, one of my closest friends suddenly said she had been planning a trip around that time. However, she had never mentioned it before, hadn’t booked flights, and was only reconsidering her dates because someone told her her destination might be crowded.

Since the condition for choosing my trip date was to prioritize the availability of the most people, I explained to her three separate times why that date was final. Despite that, she kept trying to change it. She even created another poll in our group chat to see if others could move their own important plans to accommodate her.

She also started privately messaging people, trying to convince them to say they could be flexible. At first, I didn’t directly call her out in the chat, but after she made a second poll, I sent a general message stating that the date was already chosen and wasn’t changing. Now, she’s upset and claims I embarrassed her by “calling her out” instead of speaking to her privately—even though I had already tried three times.

I feel like she put me in a tough position, making me choose whose availability mattered more. I understand she really wants to be there, but I also think it was unfair for her to disregard everyone else’s plans.

I have no intention of changing the date, and honestly, I’m not planning to apologize because I don’t think I did anything wrong.

1jcwo15,AITA for not doing an art commission I was not told about?,"Title sounds a little confusing, wasn't sure how to best word it. Hopefully this all makes sense! 

I (F33) do a lot of art in the needlework medium. Embroidery, cross-stitch, weaving etc. I'm going to toot my own horn here, I'm very good at it. I've won first prize at a couple of our state fair competitions, and the one tapestry piece I had in a gallery sold for a good bit of money.  

A few years ago I made a choice I would no longer take commissions. The deadlines, back and forth between clients and all that jazz made me hate what was once a hobby I could do for hours shutting my brain off. I'll still make presents on occasion (my wife's bff just had a baby, and I made a cross-stitch birth announcement for the nursery, for example) but anything outside of that is not happening.  

This past week I got a message on my Instagram from my friend ""Mike's"" friend ""Abigail."" Abigail said Mike recommended me for an embroidery she wanted done, and how soon could I get to the process. I told Abigail I was sorry, but I no longer take commissions and Mike knew that already. Abigail was a little pissy, but Mike- omg. He texted me in a fury saying he really buttered up my work to Abigail and he was trying to date her and I've fucked things up for him.

I'm sad that Mike is acting this way, but I also wonder that since Abigail was ""misled"" about me not doing commissions- should I just do it? My wife says absolutely not and I 85% think she's right, but I just wanted the perspective of people who aren't married to me, lol.

1jnnggj,AITA for turning away my partner's grandparents when they showed up unannounced?,"My partner and I had twins in February. We're currently living in her parents' neighboring house because they acquired it after the neighbor passed away, and we're renting/renovating it with them. We have set clear boundaries that we don't want surprise visitors, and we would like it if they only came over once or twice a week so we can have some privacy. 

Today, my partner's dad texted her while she was trying to nap, letting her know that her grandmother (his mother) had shown up at their house unannounced. We appreciated the heads-up, and she continued with trying to rest, as the twins were finally fed, changed, and no longer being fussy. About 10-15 minutes later, her phone starts ringing, and I see it's her dad. I answered, and he let me know her grandma and grandpa were walking over. I told him I would turn them away, as everyone was finally sleeping and it wasn't a good time. He said ""You shouldn't do that, because it will start a fight."" I said ""Oh well, it's not a good time.""

Her grandparents rang the doorbell twice during that phone call, almost back to back, waking her and one of the boys up. I told her to just keep sleeping, I'll deal with it. I answered the door, and her grandma could tell I was exhausted, because she asked if we were sleeping. I said ""Yes, we all are."" She said ""Too bad,"" and tried stepping towards the door. I pulled it shut a little more so it was barely open enough for me, and told her ""No. It's not a good time. They haven't been sleeping good, and I don't want them waking up since they're finally asleep."" She pretended she was ok with it, and parted ways.

A few minutes later, my partner called her dad with the boys screaming in the background, telling him we turned them away. He did what he usually does when he's mad, and kept giving short, one or two word replies. Then, after she was done talking, he blew up, talking about how he's going to have to deal with her grandma being pissed off now, and saying something like ""I might as well fucking broadcast your damn rules to everyone to not show up unless they call ahead!"" along with some other stuff I didn't catch, as I was in the other room. She started crying, said bye while he was still yelling, and hung up.

Now I feel like I shouldn't have told her grandparents to come back another day, because her dad apparently can't deal with his mother's (or his own) emotions, and it would've been easier to just deal with them coming in and disturbing the peace that we had just managed to establish.

Tiffany won the steps competition.

After I spoke with Matt he tried to clear things up with Tiffany but in his words she was “combative and rude” so he ended up looping in our HR rep, Jill. Jill decided that Tiffany could keep her 65,000 steps and the rules would just be clarified for everyone going forward.

Well going forward Tiffany continued to post 35,000-40,000 steps every single day. Less ridiculous then 65,000 but still ridiculous considering we all sit at desks 8 hours day. It was still a tight race between the 4 of us, because we (Dave Jenna and I) had been posting higher then Tiffany prior to the 65,000 step day. Then Dave got sick. He only posted 4,000 one day and that was enough for him to fall too far behind. Then I had something urgent and time consuming come up at work and only got 10,000 steps that day. That was enough for me to fall too far behind too. So it was basically up to Jenna at that point and she was really working for it. Even got up at 4am the last couple days of the competition to try and max out steps. The highest she ever got to was about 41,000 and in the end Tiffany beat her by about 250 steps overall.

Tiffany had zero issue happily accepting her award at the next company wide meeting and gave this super annoying speech about how “everyone did so great” and how in the end she’s “just glad we all became more active and healthy.”

I never responded to the message she sent me about being depressed about her dog or whatever.

1j22f6e,AITA For telling a friend isn’t not her business how me and MY husband parent?,"My husband has a friend Erica. I don’t like her. She always seems weirdly judgmental of the way we do things. Most of that judgement being on me.

Anyways the last time she was over, my husband and her were talking about kids (Erica and her so have kids, as do we) and mornings got brought up. 

For some information, I don’t do mornings, my husband does. He works 9-6 and I start at the same time as him but end earlier. He does mornings because he doesn’t mind waking up earlier, and I get more sleep and less on my mind in the morning. It’s an arrangement that works for us and I always do mornings if he’s sick or physically can’t.

When Erica found that out, she started with judgement. I was in the same room as them but just wasn’t adding to the conversation.

1joe3w9,"AITA for charging an “entry fee” for a family dinner on April 1st, leading my aunt to think it was an April Fool’s joke?","I (26F) am the go-to host for family dinners, and I usually enjoy it. But my aunt (55F) has a frustrating habit: she shows up uninvited with extra guests like friends or random relatives without telling me. It’s happened too many times, leaving me to stretch food and space on the spot. I’ve asked her nicely to give me a heads-up, but she just says, “Family should be spontaneous,” and ignores me.

With today being March 31st, I’m hosting a family dinner tomorrow, April 1st, for my parents’ anniversary. Knowing my aunt will likely crash it with extras, I decided to try something new. Last week, I sent a group message saying that because hosting costs keep rising (and the guest list keeps growing), I’m asking each adult to chip in $10 to cover expenses. I figured this was a fair way to handle it without pointing fingers.

Tomorrow’s the big day, but I can already picture it: my aunt will roll up with three unannounced friends. When I ask for the $10 contributions at the door, she’ll probably laugh and say, “Oh, great April Fool’s joke!” I’ll have to explain it’s not a prank and that it’s about respect and planning, especially since she keeps doing this. I’m betting she’ll get mad, call me “stingy,” and storm off, which has happened before when I’ve set boundaries.

The family’s already split. Some think I should let it slide since it’s a special occasion (and tomorrow’s April Fool’s Day might confuse things), while others say I’m right to stand my ground. I’m worried my aunt will spin it as me pulling a “mean prank” if she takes it the wrong way.

TL;DR: AITA for charging an entry fee for tomorrow’s dinner, even though it’s on April 1st?",Content-Pressure4241,3735,0.9399999976158142,464,1743455009,2025-03-31 16:03:29,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1joe3w9/aita_for_charging_an_entry_fee_for_a_family/,3,2025
1j4exew,AITA for keeping my door locked so my roommate doesn’t snoop in my room?,"Hello all, I F26 live with M28, M25, This particular event is about M25 (John), I’ve lived here for about a year and I’m moving out at the end of June (yay!), over the course of the year John has been an okay roommate and I haven’t had any real issues with him outside of the random weird/creepy comment about my gym clothes up until now, So recently I started noticing things in my room being moved or just in general it just felt like someone had been in my room, it’s hard to describe. But I ended up installing a lock on my door and locking it before I left for work or anywhere really, now cut to today I get a text message from John and I’ll copy and paste it: “Hey I noticed your door is locked, what’s going on? We need all of them unlocked, it’s a fire hazard.” Now keep in mind this has never been an issue before, I even asked my other roommate M28 if he locks his door and he told me he does and John never said anything to him about it. Now I’m like super creeped out and convinced that he was in fact, going into my room. I texted him back saying “No, if there’s a problem with my room being locked during the day it needs to be told to me by the landlord” all I got back was “okay I’ll tell him to tell you”.  AITA here?

1j59fnv,AITA for snapping at my boyfriend's friend for touching my hair?,"

I'm (15M)  black and I live in a predominantly white area and go to a mostly white school and I'm pretty introverted. I have a fro and the amount of people who will just up and try/ start touching my hair is wild. It's gotten to the point where it pisses me off.   I met my bf Colt (15M) at a wrestling meet a few months ago and I let him play in my hair and I play in his curly jewfro.  It's just kind of an intimate soothing thing between us.

We go to different schools so we don't hang around each others friends a whole lot. Saturday he was having like a movie marathon with some of his friends and he wanted me to come. While there one of his friends some white girl named Madison starts just playing in my hair saying it's softer than she thought. I immediately jerked back and asked her WTF are you doin? She tells me she just wanted to see what it was like. I snapped at her that I wasn't a damn dog and she gets all defensive saying she saw Colt doing it and thought it was ok. I yelled at her that I'm not dating her and went home.

Colt came over later and apologized for her ,but he says I didn't have to get so upset and go off on her like that. He says people come up to him trying to touch his jewfro to see what Jewish hair feels like all the time and he never took it that seriously.. I tell him it's kinda different but he still thinks I overreacted. AITA?

1jjxve6,AITA for refusing to go to the store when my significant other cooks meals for me?,"My signifiant other (M38) and I (F35) have lived together for over a year. His mother and our daughter (F13) are also in the home. He is the primary cook in the home as he prefers to cook and is picky about how the food is prepared. He also does the majority of the shopping because he prefers to shop at certain stores. I do also cook occasionally and pay for meals when we order out. Additionally when I give him money to assist with bills I give extra to help pay for food costs. I do also clean the kitchen after each meal which is not a small task because he doesn't clean as he cooks and typically any thing he touches in the meal prep process is left out. None of this bothers me so much as when he asks me to go to the store for last minute ingredients. For some reason he never has all the ingredients right before the meal needs to be cooked. For instance tonight, he starts cooking pasta at 6:45pm and right before he cooks he forgot that we did not have noodles. He started planning dinner at 10am. He then expects me to drop anything I am doing to go to the store to get the items. When I say ""no, you could have asked earlier or planned better"" he accuses me of being lazy or not helpful. He does this during holidays too. Days before the holiday I asks several times does he need me to go to the store. Every day leading up to the holiday he says no, then inevitably the day of the holiday he needs a few ingredients. I ask him all the time just to be thoughtful of my time because I could end up having to make trips to the store everyday due to his poor planning. I am starting to feel he does this as a way to make me earn my meal.

1j60urv,AITA for changing my legal name ?,"Hi! I was born after my mom had a stillborn baby. She was supposed to be named Angélique (a French name because my mom’s French). My stillborn sister was born and died on December 6th, 2004. Then my mom had me on May 6th, 2006, and named me Coline (another French name, like Colleen).

Listen, so the problem is—when I was told this story, I was about 14. I had never known before, but I had always hated my name due to bullying and really dumb jokes about it. But then it started getting weird for me because, in France, you have a name day, which is basically a celebration of your name for a day (because of Christianity or something—I don’t really know, I’m not very Christian. I don’t know if other countries do this).

I discovered that my mother gave me the name Coline on purpose because it was celebrated on my stillborn sister’s birthday. That made me feel like I was just a replacement for her since Angélique was supposed to be my mom’s last kid (she said that to my face, yeah).

What made it even worse to wear my name was my father. I won’t go into details, but he’s an asshole. He straight-up said they were supposed to have an angel—referring to my sister—but had the devil instead (me, lol). He also said he would have preferred if I had died instead of my sister.

Around that time, I started talking to my friends about it and asked them to call me by a new name I picked, which had nothing to do with my sister—Lyx. They all agreed and have never stopped calling me Lyx since I was 14. I’m now almost 19. They even call me Lyx when talking to my mom, but she got mad at me and said she would disown me if I dared change my name to Lyx.

So, AITA for wanting to change my name?

In addition, I worked full-time. It was a lot, so I used the services of someone who cleaned every few weeks.  After my husband's surgery, his sisters decided to visit, and I welcomed them into our home. After their visit, I learned that they'd entered parts of our home that were not open to visitors, looked through things, and commented about its cleanliness. Granted, the private spaces were not as tidy as the public parts of our home, but I was doing the best I could. This was especially hurtful to my husband because there is shame associated with this topic in their family. Fast forward, and we have a family event coming up. My husband has suggested that the family stay with us, and, based on the last experience, I said no. I'm in school and have a full-time job, and he may say he's going to clean, but he won't and will become angry with me because it's not done.

1jg3cvi,AITA for not inviting my pregnant sister in law to my wedding?,"My partner and I are due to get married soon. My brother David has always been viewed as the favourite in my family, and so is his wife Jill. I on the other hand am always viewed as the problem in my mothers eyes

A few years ago, we celebrated my step brothers wedding with our family.  David, Jill,  my fiance and I  stayed in an apartment and had breakfast together the next morning and all was seemingly great. That was until later that afternoon when I received a call from my mum saying Jill was at her house in tears because I insulted her appearance at the wedding. I have zero recollection of this but my fiance was with me the whole night and was adamant that I did not say anything, plus Jill showed no signs of being upset or annoyed with me at any point. I was disappointed that my mum did not ask me and jumped to conclusions that I was in the wrong. I apologised to Jill and that was seemingly the end of it. 

Our relationship with Dave and Jill has been icy since then and Jill has made no effort to engage with my fiance on our upcoming wedding at family events. At Christmas, when we were visiting my mum and step dad, Dave and Jill both arrived and announced that they are expecting a baby (first grand kid in the family) and that’s it’s due on our wedding day. After a few drinks my step dad made a remark that ‘our big day is now about Dave and Jill aswell’ I spoke to my mum about this and she assured me that this wouldn’t be the case and that they would be celebrating us, my step dad disagreed again. Our wedding day is really important to us and our friendships. We have a two day wedding, the first day is a ceremony and a meal in an upmarket restaurant for 30 of our closest friends and immediate family. The next day is a party for all our other friends and extended family. David and Jill are invited to both days but given the long day and that she is due to give birth on the day, we did not have the space to accommodate Jill for the evening meal. She also said she didn’t want to go originally as she doesn’t like that kind of food but has changed her stance since on wanting to attend. 

My mum has now demanded that we invite Jill to the meal and has been pretty aggressive towards me and my fiance. We have stated that we don’t have the space (my fiances close friends and step mum aren’t going) and that we don’t think it’s suitable, the ceremony at the meal is very intimate and we only want our closest friends there. My mum has now said that they need to be there for Jill in case she goes into labour and so she needs to be at the venue. I should point out that Jill also has family albeit they are a 1 hour flight away, and not all of our family are going to the meal. We are paying for the wedding ourselves too. I just feel like this should be a day to celebrate me and my to be wife but my family have made it clear that they want it to be about Jill,who has made it clear she doesn’t even like us.

Basically, I told my family I wasn't going to drive Grandma to church on Sundays anymore. Reason being is because Grandma tries to use it as a matchmaking service for me. I really don't like the guys she tries to set me up with. 

I told her to stop it and that I wasn't going to take her if she keeps trying to set me up with her friends' relatives. Problem is that Grandma insists I stay with her, and I just want a day off to myself.

After last week, I told Grandma I had enough and that was the last time I take her. She and my mom are upset because she doesn't have another way to get to church. Mom can't drive and we don't have reliable public transportation.

So far, I've been holding my ground but Grandma is upset. Sunday is coming up and she's sad she won't get to attend. I told mom she needs to figure something out because I'm sick of being the unpaid chauffeur.

To be fair, the images were pixelated, but I told her thats a part of the gift and it means something to me. So I wouldn't want to replace the photos, even if they're exactly the same (ship of theseus?). 
Today she went ahead and printed the new images (exactly the same image, dimensions etc.) and replaced those in the frames from my friend. She said she'll still hold on to the photos my friend gave with the frames. I had no clue she was going to do it despite my explicit disapproval when she originally proposed the idea. 
This led to a huge argument between us and she feels I'm being unreasonable because she's trying to improve the look of the photos while keeping the same image.

1j7hy7m,AITA for telling my husband his mom can't live with us for months-long stretches,"My husband and I have been married for almost 2 years and our son is 10 months old. My parents live nearby which has been invaluable during my pregnancy and since. My mom comes over regularly to help us out, my husband and her are on good terms too so it's been going well. His parents live in another country. We have visited them once since we got married, that was 7 months ago. The time prior to that was our wedding itself which took place there.

My husband had been talking about my MIL visiting soon for a long visit which I was happy with. We recently moved into our new house, I've done a good job decorating it, we have a large guest room, and I was looking forward to hosting her especially since it would make my husband happy. A couple of days ago he was complaining about how detailed her visa application was. I told him I was surprised it was so thorough. He told me that it's because while regular visa forms allow a stay of 6 months max, this one allows 2 years. I asked why would she need a stay of more than 6 months. He said that she had been thinking of winding up her medical practice and basically retiring, and this would then allow her to stay for a longer visit if we all decide that it works.

I was stunned. I told him he should just do the regular app because his mom won't be staying for anywhere close to 6 months. I had it in my mind that she'd be staying for like a month. That's how long we stayed for when we went there. He said that's his mom, she tells him how alone she feels, she can't go to my BIL's because he lives with roommates, and we can't just put a timer on her visit here. He said she's been looking forward to helping us out with our son. I told him we don't need help we manage fine on our own and with my mom's help. I wanted to host his mom as a guest not as a part of our household. He complained that how was it fair that my parents could visit whenever they wanted while his can't. I was hurt by that because my parents have helped us out a lot and I asked him if he wants us to limit how often my mom comes to visit. He said no, that's not what he meant, that he likes her but it wasn't fair to his parents. My reply was that when my mom comes, she goes at the end of the day. That wouldn't be the case with his. I ended it by saying he should look into the easier regular form because she can't be thinking of staying for that long. He chose to sleep on the couch that night and has been cold with me since. I hate that. We've never been cold to each other like this. 

I talked to my mom too. She said that having his mom live with us for long stretches would definitely affect me. That this is worth fighting for.

I haven't seen him working on the application since. Last night he went out when his mom called. When he came back I asked him how she took it. He told me he had told her he's looking into what application best suits her. He asked me if I'd changed my mind. I said no. He just shook his head and started watching TV.

1jmxadw,AITAH? Told my girlfriend not to use my electric face razor on her vag but she did anyway.,"So long story short, in the past my gf (me 27, her 26) admitted to using my razor on her coochie. I told her to never do that again and even gave her my old electric one to use. Fast forward to recent and I found out she used it again. Along with that, I have been telling her for months to stop showering without the fan on or door open a bit as it’ll cause water damage over time. Well, at the same time of finding out about the razor, she had made the bathroom walls wet with water again and I blew up a little bit. She has a hard time taking any criticism and has a hard time admitting fault so this went over not too great. Now a week or so later I was asking where something of mine was and if she possibly used it. Her response was, “why do you always assume I’m using your stuff???” I threw back, “says the person that was asked to not use my razor on her vag yet she did anyway!” Now for the first time she has decided to go spend the Saturday on her own instead of having me come with. I’m not worried we’re drifting apart, however I don’t want these things to keep happening without change.

For reference the ONLY thing we really bicker about is chores and who has done what (I really wish this would stop but we both keep on keeping track). We have also been together for about a year and 2 months.

1jg2rbt,AITA for not letting my dad's gf walk through the front door that's in my room when she was upset?,"I (23m) live with my dad, his gf (when my dad hasn't kicked her out after one of their spats), and my youngest brother for the past 3 or 4 years. We recently moved into a new house around August of 2023 and my new room is like a mudroom but we only use it as a bedroom for me, but it has the front door which is fine bc my family only uses the back door really, and I can just grab whatever food or packages are delivered and distribute them.

Anyways, my dad's gf, let's call her Stacy (34f), and my dad always get into arguments when he's drunk. We have a small house so she has no where to go but outside when they argue or their closet. Well sometimes my dad is on the back porch drinking with my uncles and even though they will ignore her when she walks through them to go around the house to sit on the front steps, she would rather go through the front door.

Well since the front door is in my room, Stacy needs to ask since yknow, privacy and things and bc I would have to move a bunch of things and leave the door and screen door unlocked and open for her, and she always does ask.

I normally let her, but a few months ago, when this incident happens, she asks me and I said no, bc I just didn't want to have to move all my stuff and I was stressed and wanted to have personal convos with my friends without worrying she's snooping (she likes to eavesdrop and had stolen my sister's gf's things when my sis and her gf lived with us). Also, I have anxiety of leaving the front door unlocked and open (PTSD things) which increased with my stressed state. Anyways, when I said no, she cursed me out and said I was being inconsiderate before storming out of my room and almost slamming the door.

My friends said I wasn't an asshole and that it was my room so I have the right to say no and it's just my people pleasing personality making me feel guilty.

1jbglie,AITA for refusing to be the main caretaker for my elderly parents?,"My parents are both in their 80s and live about two hours from me. For reference, I have a sibling that lives right down the road from them. Neither of them have aged well- they always refused to be active and have lived very sedentary lives in their retirement so aging has been hard on them. My father especially has struggled with type 2 diabetes and dementia/alzheimers. He is very combative and mean about everything, which is how he has always been, but dementia and old age has made it worse. He directs a lot of his anger towards me and is especially mad that I am trying to get them to move into assisted living because they fall constantly and need so much help. Anytime he disagrees with me about anything he starts screaming and calling me names including “ fat-a** and “the thing.” “The thing” hurts especially hard because I am his daughter and he is reducing me to something that is hardly human. He will say “ don’t look at the thing over there, she’s so ugly she might break your face” or just ridiculous stuff. He does this when he is completely lucid and remembering everything/everyone. Or he will say “ don’t feed the thing,” when my mom tries to offer me food. I tried so hard to ignore this treatment, but once he did it in front of my kids I put my foot down and stopped visiting. My mother now wants me to come to her 3+ times a week to help with cooking,cleaning, helping dress my father, etc. i have said no because the way he treats me is terrible and I have to look out for my own well being. She says I just need to ignore it because he is old and grumpy. She says I take things too personally and I am obligated to help them because they raised me.

1jbew6q,AITA for “sneaking” vegetarian food into my FIL’s meal?,"Not a throwaway but a private because my fiancé knows my main. 

My fiancé (23M) and I (23F) plan to get married in October of this year. I'd like to start off by saying i'm not looking to end my relationship with my fiancé. 

I'm a vegetarian, my fiancé is not, nor are his parents. This has never been a problem for me, my him, or his mother. But my father in law has always been weird about it.

For example, whenever we all go out to eat and I order something vegetarian, he always gives me weird looks. He also always tries to convince me to eat meat, saying things like ""You're really missing out."", ""You know you want some of this."", ""That fake meat will never be better than the real thing."", Etc.
 
Yesterday, my fiancé and I invited his parents over to our house for dinner. I made spaghetti & meatballs for my fiancé and his parents, spaghetti & vegetarian meatballs for me, I put them in two different pots and put them both on the table.

When his parents were grabbing their food, his father happens to grab the spaghetti and meatless meatballs instead of the real ones.

Now here's where I might be the A-hole, after I see him put the meatless meatballs on his plate instead, I decide not to tell him. He sits down, finishes the whole plate, and even gets a second helping.

Once his parents left and me and my fiancé were cleaning up, I tell him about the whole fake meat thing. My fiancé gets really mad at me and immediately calls his dad.

His dad then calls me and starts berating me on the phone, saying i'm a psycho and my fiancé should leave me for trying to ""poison him""???

I try to defend myself by saying I wasn't the one that gave him the fake meat, and he grabbed himself (which is 100% true) 

My fiancé says I should of told him which was which, but I genuinely don't see the problem. I know he isn't allergic to soy beans or anything, so I don't see the harm in trying vegetarian food once.

I think I might be the A-hole because usually my fiancé always defends me when his father and I get into arguments like this, but the fact that he isn't worries me. So reddit, AITA?

Update: A bit of a quick update, but after reading your comments i've decided i'm going to apologize to my FIL, whether I was in the wrong or not it wasn't right to not tell him what he was eating.

Also, I've seen a lot of comments saying if it was the other way around i'd be screaming at him or something. Just wanna say no I wouldn't, sure i'd be a little sad but i've accidentally eaten meat a few times (been vegetarian since I was 16) and I don't really care.

My sister and I have never been close growing up, to the point where this summer we went no contact after another argument. My partner and I will have been married 3 years this August, and after my partner proposed my sister messaged me saying she did not want to be involved in the wedding or even hear about wedding plans. Although hurtful I complied, and now that she is getting married she has begun to make contact again. Today while talking to my mother she mentioned that my sister had said she wants to wear my wedding veil. I told her that was okay as long as I could give it to her with a box stating “something borrowed” as I have already offered it to two other friends with upcoming weddings. Then my mother informs me my sister and her partner are getting married the weekend of my and my partners wedding anniversary, that they are booking the same photographer, that she wants her photos taken in the same location as mine- and then asked if my sister could wear my dress (which she would have to have fitted so it would never be my dress again). I expressed to my mother I wasn’t sure about using my dress and how I wanted to keep it. However, my father chimed in to the phone call saying I should “just give it to her”. AITA if I say no?

1jj3l3t,WIBTA If I refused to pay a cat rescue for fixing my foster cats?,"Personally, I felt I was scammed by a rescue. Which is a statement I never thought I’d make, because usually I regard a rescue as a very honorable and respectable organization that only intends on helping. 

However, I ran into a particularly unfriendly rescue helper who responded to a post I had made requesting help with two kittens I had rescued from outside. (In AZ, where temps get up to about 120 degrees). 

I had mentioned in the posts that I am a young mom who just bought my house and cannot afford to spay/neuter them and if there’s anybody out there who could help me help them, to please reach out. 

She contacted me, asked me to explain why I felt that I needed the help, and then proceeded to ask me to bring the kittens for the procedure. I thanked her profusely, and she never mentioned once requiring that I pay her back.

She also blew up my phone the day of the procedure telling me I must call her back NOW or else she will not see the kittens, even though I had sent her a text message the night before letting her know that I would be there. 

Anyways, now that the kittens have found a new home she sent me an invoice saying that I owe her $120 for the spay/neuter. She charged me more for the male kitten than the quote I got at a local clinic, and I would have definitely declined her offer for “help” had I known she would charge me and at this price. 

So, WIBTA for ignoring her texts or reaching out to tell her I didn’t agree to pay her back at this price?

1j3lg3q,AITA for crashing out cause I’m not invited on the family holiday,"Hi guys (23F). My family recently booked a holiday and asked if I wanted to come I said I couldn’t afford it and that was that. Recently was talking to my mum and she said that both of my younger siblings are bringing a friend that she is fully paying for. My brother is 20 like he lives at home and she is paying for him and a friend. And my sister (15) and her friend to go on an all inclusive holiday to Spain. 

It was the same last year they all went on holiday without me but last year they didn’t bring anyone else. I was fine with it until I heard my mums paying for other kids to do but wouldn’t bring me so I’m annoyed with her. I do so much for her as well like way more than my other siblings. I live 10 mins down the road so always picking up/ dropping to school or doing things around the house for her but I’m butt hurt that she clearly had this extra money to spend to bring other peoples kids on holiday but not me. 

Am I the asshole? 

EDIT: I initially asked a few weeks ago for her to tell me how much it would be if I booked on cause I would have went if it was affordable. She got back to me saying it’s 900 and I just said I couldn’t afford that anyways and that was it. Until I found out she’s paying for 2 of my siblings friends. She said in convo who was going and I just said “what you could have paid for me to go but instead ur paying for 2 other children “ and she ignored that comment.

1jicfiz,AITA for calling friend’s penis decent?,"I (19F) am currently on spring break. Me and my friends (as well as some of their friends) decided to go to a nearby beach. It was a two day trip where we go swimming, eat out, and do a little shopping before heading back. While we were on the beach, some of us got hungry. A few people decided to go to a nearby gas station to grab some snacks and bring it back, while others stayed. I stayed and so did B (20M). B is a friend of a friend, and we aren’t that close, but we did get along. We stayed to watch over everyone’s stuff in case it got stolen or anything. 

The two of us were chatting and sitting. Now I want to note, he was wearing a *really* short trunks, which wasn’t a problem. Until he moved his legs and his penis peeked through his shorts. He didn’t realize and I felt awkward to point it out because I didn’t know this guy that well. I had only met him a few days ago. But after a minute or two, I kind of hinted for him to look down and he got shocked. He fixed the issue and we sat there awkwardly and didn’t say anything. 

That night, I get a call from B. He told me he was embarrassed about the situation and that he didn’t mean to flash me. I said to not worry about it because it was clearly an accident. Then he asks me what I thought about his penis. I was shocked and unsure how to respond. So, I just said that it was decent. Now, in hindsight, I genuinely do not know what I meant by decent. I just blurted it out since that was the first word that popped in my head. He got upset and was wondering why it was decent, and I didn’t have a response. We hung up. 

The next day, I saw him at breakfast and could clearly see he was upset. He wasn’t upset at anyone else and made it a point to completely avoid me, not sitting or standing near me. I assuming it was because of what I said about his penis. 

Now, I haven’t told anyone about this event, mainly because I don’t want to embarrass him or anything. But I feel like I was being an asshole for saying that and I could’ve like approached that better.

1j2uu65,AITA for removing my brother's GF from our Life 360?,"I (24F) have a younger brother Matt (21M) who has a GF (21F) named Selena. They got together back in 2021 and have had 2 babies during their relationship who I love dearly. Throughout their relationship, I have tried to be cordial and friendly towards Selena, I have heard many times of how people don't get along with their sibling's partner and I didn't want to be one of those people. Throughout the years though, I have heard countless gossip from Selena about what she thinks about people in my family, including my mother. At the time, I would argue with my mother and sister (25F) in her defense, which now looking back I regret deeply. 

My younger brother currently works a food truck that my parents have loaned him to make a living for his family while Selena stays home with the kids. During this time, my mom (52 F) and I have been working with him, sometimes without pay since some weeks it is too slow. While working with my brother is fine, I have felt that Selena sees herself as a boss and sees my mother and I as only employees. There are times when my mom asks my brother if she can spend time with her grandkids, but he says no because they are with her family. We set up a life 360 a few years ago when they only had one kid and I would babysit, so it was Matt, me my mom and my sister. 

  
Recently, I noticed she paused her location sharing (since jan 28). I didn't think anything of it but she would still monitor everyone's locations, since when my brother and I are working the weekends he lets me know when my mom is near as soon as he gets off the phone with her. I didn't think this was fair since she is still able to view our locations. This morning I was talking to my mom and she was sharing how she wants to see her grandkids and how she invited Selena to an outing on Saturday Morning(she she ghosted my mom on). That was my final straw and I removed her from the account.

1j4gw7k,AITA: opened a jar of sauce to use some and put the rest in the fridge,"So to preface this: my (18m) mom (47 F) usually has no issue with opening jars of red sauce, using a little, then putting them in the fridge and using them for a meal later on. My dad does it, I do it, she does it, my grandma does it. She has never expressed a problem with it before. This is important. It is also important to note I am autistic. 

So tonight, I opened a jar of Alfredo sauce. I asked my brother (12 M) for help with opening the jar, and mom starts freaking out and saying not to open it- but by the time she said anything, it was already open. So I used the sauce in my pasta and she starts complaining that it can’t be used for a meal now. 

Thankfully I had the self control not to say my immediate response out loud, and instead said “Yes it can?? It’s not like I stuck my fingers in the jar.” 

And now she’s moping on her phone and acting like I’ve committed a federal offense. 

Did I do something wrong?? Am I the asshole or is this stupid…
ETA: I closed the jar and put it back when I was done with it. Because it’s Alfredo, once it’s open you’re supposed to fridge. She’s never had a problem with this before, even with other cream based sauces. She never said I couldn’t open the Alfredo UNTIL it was already open.

1jiagdc,AITA for refusing to go to my grandma’s house on my birthday?,"It was my birthday recently. Usually, my family goes to my grandma’s to celebrate each other’s bdays. However, I didn’t want to do that this time. I told my parents I’d rather it be simple: stay home and get takeout. I also have a complicated relationship with my grandma, as I think she can be manipulative, guilt trips, and not respect my boundaries at times. I’ve also realized that I’m not big on making a huge event out of my bday and getting a lot of gifts. I told my parents about my plans, and they said that I could do as I wished.

I visited my grandma a week before my bday. During this, I told her I didn’t want to come over on my bday. She looked confused and didn’t say anything. Fast forward to the night before my bday, and my parents ask why I don’t want to go to my grandma’s. I thought this was odd, as they previously said they were fine with my wishes. I stated that I still didn’t want to go. My bday comes, and they repeatedly ask me to go.

My grandma then calls my mom at 11:00 a.m. and says, “What time are you guys coming over? I have gifts.” My mom tells her I’d rather not come over, to which my grandma breaks down crying. The call ends, and my mom says, “Well, it’s like you put a knife through her heart.” I felt both bothered and terrible. I texted my grandma that I could come over the day after to hang out and open the gifts. She left me on read. Throughout my bday, my parents continued to make me feel bad about not wanting to go.

I lay in bed, felt like a monster, and caved into going even though I didn’t want to. I texted my grandma, “I guess I can come over in two hours. Is that okay with you?” at 4:00 p.m. She responded at 5:30 p.m., and my mom and I got there at 6:00 p.m. I then opened the gifts, which I honestly believed were thought about at the last minute. I later went into her kitchen and saw a Walgreens receipt on the counter stating the gifts were bought 20 minutes before I came over. I felt some of the other stuff she gave me were things she had lying around the house. I also told my mom I didn’t want to stay more than 2 hours.

I wanted to still have time to go home, relax, and clear my conscience of the drama. This wasn’t the case, as my mom and grandma wanted to watch a Netflix show. I stayed in another room by myself until they finished. We went home at 10:00 p.m., and I quietly cried in bed because I was stressed out the whole day.

1jfz99i,AITA for telling my coworker to “freshen up” for an important event?,"Throwaway account since the people involved use Reddit. 
I (32M) work at a company with the occasional events. I take them as chances to network with people from other companies and so on. 

My coworker [33M], who we’ll call Ben is pretty scruffy. Showing up to work in the same outfit he wore the previous day and even sleeping at his desk sometimes. I’ve never interacted with him 1-on-1 per se but we’ve been on the same projects and I’m friendly with him. 

Here is where the issue is: Recently, there was a company event, and, for once, Ben didn’t really participate or speak about it beforehand, so most of us assumed he wasn’t going. I didn’t expect him to come of course, but he did in the most unprofessional outfit. He was wearing wrinkled clothes and colors that didn’t match. Like he rolled out of bed. He walked up to my circle and we locked eyes and I joked that he should’ve freshed up a bit to an event like this and there were some chuckles but everyone was mostly silent. 

He soon walked away and my other coworker pulled me aside and told me that I was way out of line, and her and my colleagues think that I shouldn’t have spoken about his attire especially since I don’t know him very well. I thought I was just making a joke to lighten the mood. I haven’t seen him since and he’s been actively avoiding me. mostly everyone in my circle is expecting me to apologize to Ben, AITA for making a joke?

1jef5sa,AITA for not chipping in for my friend’s Uber after he felt uncomfortable sleeping at my place?,"I (26m) have been friends with Josh (26m) since college. We were basically inseparable then, but only stayed in touch intermittently since graduation. Recently he moved to NYC (where I live), and we have been hanging out like old times. 

Josh mainly comes near me because there's some bars we like to go to there. I've offered to go to his neighborhood (he lives in a different borough), but he says there's no fun places there. The only issue is he has to leave pretty early because the trains get wonky at night and Ubers are expensive. I've offered to let him crash, but he says he didn't want to be a burden. 

Anyway last Saturday Josh wanted to stay out and asked if he could crash. I told him of course. We went back to my studio (he knew it was a studio) and he asked if I had any pajamas he could borrow. I told him no because 1. I genuinely own no pajamas and 2. I have some sweatpants but I'm weird about people wearing my clothes. Can't explain why just am. A germ thing. 

Anyway I suggest to Josh he just sleep in his boxers and he got annoyed. He said he wouldn't have stayed if he had known I'd be so accommodating and I said all I offered him was a couch to crash on. He ubered home and it was about 100 dollars. 

The next day he Venmo requests me 30 and says it's because he would've gone home earlier if he known I was going to be ""weird.""

1jkqimr,AITA for not offering to split gas on a road trip I didn’t want to go on?,"Last weekend, I (24F) got dragged into a spontaneous hiking trip with my friends Jason and Lily (they’re a couple). We were hanging out Friday night at their place—I was already half-dead from the work week and had too much wine, so I just crashed on their couch.

Saturday morning, I was super hungover, like dry mouth, hoodie-over-eyes level. All I wanted was some water, maybe a hash brown, and no human interaction. But Jason was already up and buzzing about this hike four hours away. Lily was into it too. I said, very clearly, multiple times, “I’m down to hang but I’m not hiking. I feel like crap.”

They were like, “Oh come on, you’ll feel better once we’re out there,” and “It’s mostly flat.” I didn’t push back hard enough, I guess. I wasn’t trying to be a buzzkill. Next thing I know, we’re in Jason’s car, and I’m wedged in the back with my hood up and a bottle of Gatorade.

Spoiler: I never hiked. We got there, I walked to the trailhead, and then just sat in the car with the windows cracked, reading a paperback I found in the backseat (I think it was Lily’s copy of Circe? Good book though). They were gone for three-ish hours, came back sweaty and glowing and very into themselves. I clapped politely. We drove back.

Then—on the drive home—Jason says, all casual, “So if y’all could Venmo me like thirty bucks for gas, that’d be great.”

I hesitated and said, “Wait, seriously?” I told him I didn’t really feel comfortable paying for a trip I didn’t want to go on and didn’t participate in. I said it as lightly as I could, like I even added a half-laugh so it didn’t sound rude, but neither of them responded.

It got weirdly quiet after that. Like… not just “we’re tired” quiet, but stiff, polite quiet. Lily scrolled through Instagram the rest of the ride. Jason turned the music up and didn’t really talk to me again until they dropped me off.

I texted later that night just to say thanks for driving anyway, and Lily replied with a thumbs-up emoji. Not even a “np” or anything, just 👍.

I’ve been replaying it in my head because I do get that gas isn’t free, but also—I didn’t want to go, I said that, and I barely even left the car. I felt like I was being held financially hostage for a vibe I wasn’t part of.

1j4hpft,AITA for not telling husband he could get a form notarized instead of going with me in person to get our baby’s passport,"Yesterday we were in line at the post office for our baby's passport application appointment. We had a 12:30 noon appt but there were still 3 applicants ahead of us since they were backed up (meaning at least 30-40 min wait on top of the 20+ we'd already waited). The lady in back of us asked if she needed both parents for her baby's renewal; I said 'I think yes both parents need to be present or you can submit a notarized form on behalf of the dad.' My husband heard and started to get really angry that I hadn't told him. Then he said 'let's go home' and we proceeded to have a huge argument where he yelled at me and said I ""hid"" the fact from him and wasted his time. I explained that it didn't even cross my mind as we are together and both local. He said I should have at least mentioned the notary option to give him a chance to decide. I didn't know that the wait would be so long since we had an appointment. He called me ""negligent"" for not knowing that these things take a long time. I told him the passport process is his responsibility too, but he thinks that since I'll be waiting in line anyway, I should have respected his time and made it as quick as possible for him by giving him the notary option so he doesn't have to go and interrupt his day to come in person. So now he said he'll do the notarized form on HIS TIMING ""I'll do it when I do it and I don't want you asking me about it"" and then I have to go back a third time AGAIN on my own to apply for the passport. 

For context this was our second time at the post office because the first time we didn't have an appt and the line was so long we left and made an appt to come back. I honestly did not know the lines would be so long and backed up; who knew so many people would be applying for a passport at any given time? Husband thinks I should apologize for not telling him about the notary option and “not respecting his time”. Looking back, that would have been the way to go given that its been so difficult coordinating times with him to go (he's been dragging his feet on this because he doesn't care to go on any international trips anytime soon and I do, which is another issue). He's very protective about his time, especially on weekdays and mid-day events as it ""interrupts his flow."" Meanwhile I think it's crazy that he feels so entitled to me mentioning the notary option. I'm annoyed at him for being such a maniac about this. I think we should have just waited and finished the task; the argument + getting the notarized form + going back is going to take way more time than if we had just waited. AITA?

1jc65zv,AITA for taking away my keys from my grandma?,"Bare with me because this is a long one.

My grandma came ""to visit"" today while I was at work and just wrote to me to say that she was horrified at how much rubbish was flying around my house. I was very surprised by the message and wrote to her telling her not to break into my flat when I'm not there and certainly not to criticise my non-existent mess. I just have a lot of stuff, but everything has its rightful place, the floor is clear and there's only what's supposed to be on the table.

Three hours later, I came home and realised that both my desk and the dining table were completely empty.


For context: I paint a lot of miniatures in my free time and have a whole desk full of paints and equipment for doing so. 

I found the paints, brushes and tools for my miniatures in a drawer under my bed, neatly lined up. The new Emperor's Children codex was on my bed. What was missing, however, were the plastic frames and bits from various Warhammer figures. On the dining table were all my new Emperor's Children figures, which I had received the day before yesterday and had just put on the table and admired with great anticipation. On my desk were three squads of Terminators, 700 points of Stormcasts and two Phoenix Lords. A total value of around €500! I searched through all the drawers and by now I was really panicking. After a very long search, I called my grandma and asked her what had happened to the grey plastic that was lying around. Her answer was:
""I threw the rubbish away. What was that anyway? Packaging material?""

I repeat again: she threw away stuff of mine that she didn't even know what it was! 
I asked her again whether she was really serious and whether she had any idea what ""this rubbish"" was for, to which she simply said that I should be grateful that she had finally tidied up the place and couldn't understand why I was calling about something like that.

... I then just said that I'd come round tomorrow and pick up my front door key and hung up.

I didn't raise my voice once during the whole conversation once and was simply in shock listening to whatever this was and then lay down on my bed, exhausted, and thought about what my next steps might be. After about 20 minutes, I put my shoes on, threw on a jacket and set off to go through the rubbish in the apartment complex.
It took a really long time, but I found the bag again, in the residual rubbish, on top of the remains of eggshells, a banana and a piece of gamy cucumber. After cleaning all the plastic frames and looking at the clock, I realised that this process alone had taken me two hours.



Am I the asshole in the act of wanting to take my flat keys away from my grandmother?

1jnnufe,AITA for telling my dad’s fiancée I’m not her family?,"2 nights ago, I (15f) was eating dinner with my dad (40m) and his fiancée (41f) when we got into an argument. My dad and his fiancée have been together for a year so I didn’t really know her well before she moved in (My father also never told me she would be moving in). Me and his fiancee dislike each other, she was raised Christian and expects me to go to church with them even though Im not religious, this isn’t really a problem anymore because I told my mother I didn’t want to go but his fiancee still likes to make snarky comments about religion like saying I can’t celebrate Christmas if I’m not Christian. So, I’ve been on the edge with her.

I really hate onions, my father and his fiancée know this but they still decided to put a ton of onion in the dinner so I had to pick onions out of my food. I was complaining about them making something with a ton of onion when they know I hate onions. The fiancée started talking about how in her family whenever someone didn’t like something for dinner they would have to make a different meal for themselves. I got really pissed off and told her that I wasn’t her family so that didn’t apply to me and she started saying that when she and my dad got married she would be my stepmom. I told her that didn’t make her my family and then she started talking about if she and my dad ever had a child (which they won’t because he already has a teenager and she’s over 40) that I would be her family. I told her I wouldn’t be interacting with that child and then she stopped talking.

EDIT: Added context, I was doing homework so that’s why I couldn’t help out with dinner. It’s usually all three of us but I was busy so it was just them.",Legitimate_Honey_537,1268,0.949999988079071,152,1743372007,2025-03-30 17:00:07,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jnnufe/aita_for_telling_my_dads_fiancée_im_not_her_family/,3,2025
1j1cv51,AITA for telling a family member off for purposely triggering my OCD?,"

Hello I am 23F and I had a disagreement with a family member 60M over an incident. I am living with them and overall we have a very good and supportive relationship, but something that happened today really upset me. I was diagnosed with OCD as a child and have been in therapy/on medication for it since. It’s something I’ve spent a lot of time working on and I’m very proud of the progress I have made. 



My OCD is about contamination/germs. My FM has known about my diagnosis since I got it and I have spent a lot of time talking to him about it. I even bought a book about living with someone with OCD as I know it can be difficult. He has been a huge supporter of my recovery even though he doesn’t fully understand it. 



However, today as I was making coffee I saw that he came out of the bathroom without washing his hands. I playfully gave him a hard time and encouraged him to wash his hands. He did and we both joked about it and it felt like it ended fine. 



Later, when I was making lunch he came out of the bathroom again without washing his hands. I could hear him approaching me and I asked if he washed his hands. He laughed and said no before wiping his hands on the sides of my sweatshirt and pants. I was so shocked I ran out of the room to go change. 



After, I came back down and said that I thought it was a mean thing to do and that it was very upsetting and that not washing your hands after using the restroom is inconsiderate as well as an immature habit to have at his age. He begrudgingly apologized, but acted like I was lecturing him for no reason. To be clear, I never raised my voice- I was definitely a bit stern but I felt it was necessary. 



While I don’t expect him to keep track of all my triggers I feel like that is something that would upset anyone- OCD or no OCD. Especially within hours of our first conversation about the importance of washing hands after using the restroom. 



AITA for lecturing him about doing something he knew would be upsetting?

1jlgkud,AITA for not giving my dad money he says he gave me years ago?,"AITA for refusing to give my dad $20,000 for a business, even though he now says the money was his all along?

A few weeks ago, my dad (62M) asked me (32M) for $20,000 to help fund a gas station business he wanted to start. I said no, respectfully, because over the years he’s started 30–40 business ventures—none of which have succeeded. He rarely takes advice, changes his mind constantly, and gets defensive when challenged. I’ve supported where I could emotionally, but I’ve seen this cycle repeat itself too many times.

After I declined, he sent me a message saying how shocked and disappointed he was, saying he was waiting for me to “wake up” and help him. Then, a few days later, I got another message—this time in Arabic—completely changing the story.

He now claims that back in 2015, he deposited $30,000 under my name, and that this money came from his government retirement package. According to him, it was meant to be shared between me and my siblings to help with living expenses and education while we were abroad. I did use that money during my time studying to pay for exams, licensing, rent, etc.—which is exactly what he told us the money was there for. He never said it was a loan or that I’d need to repay it.

Now, almost a decade later, he says I owe him the rest of the money and that he needs it—not for the gas station anymore, but to support my siblings’ education. The reasoning has completely changed. What’s worse is he knows that I’ve been carefully investing my savings for my own retirement, and he’s essentially asking me to sell off long-term investments to fund his latest business idea. He retired in 2023 at age 60 and has since refused to return to work to help support the family.

What’s frustrating is the story keeps changing depending on what might convince me: first it was a business, now it’s for the family. It feels manipulative. I’ve worked hard, earned my degree, and tried to support my family where I can. But this shift—framing past help as a “debt” and guilting me—feels really unfair.

I’m also honestly worried that if I “repay” this supposed debt now, it won’t stop here—what’s next? Is he going to come back asking me to reimburse him for diapers he bought when I was a baby, or the bus passes from when I was in high school?

I want to set boundaries, but now I’m torn. Would giving him the money just enable this cycle? AITA for saying no?",BreadnPaper,1202,0.9700000286102295,64,1743116712,2025-03-27 18:05:12,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jlgkud/aita_for_not_giving_my_dad_money_he_says_he_gave/,3,2025
1jnn72a,AITA for cutting off all personal communication with my ex and only allowing co-parenting contact through a court app?,"I (30f) co-parent my daughter with my ex, (39m), and I’ve reached a breaking point. I need to know if I’m the asshole for cutting off all personal communication and only using the court-ordered co-parenting app.

When our daughter was four months old and I returned to work (I don’t work from home, he does), I chose a daycare near my job so I could breastfeed on lunch and be close in emergencies. I told him, and he said, “If you think it’s good, fine.” No input, no tour, no research. Later, he pushed to cut her from 5 days to 3 to avoid full payments—even though we’re court-ordered to split childcare 50/50. That change left me with only 2 days I could use for work.

The daycare charged weekly on autopay from my account. I told him he could make his own account to pay directly, but he didn’t. Instead, he reimbursed me whenever he felt like it—sometimes late or partially. Eventually, he started blaming me for choosing the daycare “without his input” and even threatened not to pay at all.

To keep the peace, I agreed to pick a new daycare together. But when I asked what he wanted me to do, he yelled that I “needed to fix it” without saying how. Eventually, he asked for a list of 5 local daycares. I did the research, sent him the list. He ignored it for over a week, then told me I was making him do “all the homework.” Finally, he said to pick 2, and he’d choose one. I did. He chose one.

I scheduled a tour. He demanded it be during my work hours so I’d be “making a sacrifice.” I don’t work from home—he does—but I still called off work. After the tour, we got the enrollment forms. I gave them to him to complete. We were in the last week of her old daycare and he was about to leave for a work trip, so timing mattered.

That Friday, I asked if he’d filled them out. He told me he “wasn’t sure we liked the daycare,” because I supposedly rolled my eyes at the food options. I hadn’t. When I calmly told him that wasn’t true, he accused me of lying, slammed his car door, and drove off mid-convo.

I messaged him later to say this behavior isn’t acceptable. He denied everything and acted like I was overreacting. After months of yelling in front of our daughter, slamming doors, twisting facts, blaming me, and storming off mid-discussions, I finally set a boundary.

I told him: from now on, unless it’s about Amelia, contact me only through the court app. No more personal calls, texts, or access to me.

Now he’s calling me controlling and unreasonable. I feel like I’ve done everything I can to keep peace for Amelia’s sake, but I’m tired of being disrespected and manipulated.
