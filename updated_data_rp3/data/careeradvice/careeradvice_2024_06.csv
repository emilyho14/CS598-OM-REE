1dsebjm,Management not respectful of my time.  Am I out of line here?,"Work remotely in IT Operations, but I have a varied background. Salaried FT Employee in US. Been with the company over 10 years.

My company has been laying people off left and right. Some have been replaced with cheaper labor overseas (India), some not replaced at all.

Earlier this year, my team size was reduced. Unfortunately, this meant that I had to step down from leadership to become a ""coverage"" person, covering hours slightly later than the ""9-5"". Not really a problem as I have always worked a bit later than most.

Recently, I was volunteered by upper management to attend a daily status meeting that starts 2+ hours before I'd normally log on, to cover for a completely different function (engineering) whose staff has been decimated by lay offs.

My manager seems afraid to stand up for me.  My response is that they need to pick, whether I am flexible, or I am a coverage person. I do not think it is fair to be both and extend my day 2+ hours for a useless meeting.

Does this seem out of line?",Dusty444444,2,1.0,4,1719789059,2024-06-30 23:10:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dsebjm/management_not_respectful_of_my_time_am_i_out_of/,6,2024

1dscz7j,"Rethinking what career I want to go into, not sure what to do (STEM student)","I am pursuing an undergrad degree in neuroscience (halfway done) and up until recently I had been planning on working as a scientist. After discovering the reality of being a scientist, I was a bit deterred from entering such a field and considered other options. I then decided to go into the field of medicine and am now starting to rethink this. Now, I'm unsure what to do and am a bit concerned as to what I'll end up doing in my future. Any advice would help and I'm always happy to provide more information if necessary. I haven't given up on either of these fields, and as of right now I still plan to pursue one of them, but I'm exploring other options and thinking about what my ""backup"" career/field might be.

I'll elaborate on why I'm changing my mind about these as well as why I was (and still am) interested in each.

Science:

I wanted to go into science because I love it and I had never been as passionate or excited about any other subject. It still never fails to fascinate me and I enjoy learning more about it. I recognized the importance of science overall and how much it has contributed (and still contributes) to the development of what our world is like today. I wanted to participate in the progression of scientific understanding and thus figured it would be fitting for me to go into research. 

The reason I began to question whether or not I wanted to go into science came after I spoke to some people who work industrially *and* people who work in academia. Long story short, both are pretty crappy options. Industrial jobs, from what I understand, are very difficult to find and pay quite low. (Obviously money isn't everything, but it certainly wouldn't be fun to be broke for the rest of my life and struggle to pay off any debt accrued from college.) Not only this, but scientists are constantly begging for funding to conduct experiments and thus it is difficult to make significant progress quickly since everything is limited by people who aren't scientists. (I could expand a little bit but for now I think that's enough.) What's the alternative? Academia, which is arguably much worse. I don't think any amount of money could convince me to go down that path. 

Medicine:

I considered the field of medicine because it interests me and I became fascinated with surgery. But I think the main draw for me is the fact that I would be able to witness the effects of my work and would know that what I'm doing is making a positive change in the world. Physicians don't just help people, they save lives, and I wanted to do just that. 

Aside from the fact that medical schools are *extremely* competitive and it's entirely possible that I won't get a single acceptance, I'm a bit nervous about pursuing medicine as a career due to its incredibly high demands and the fact that there's essentially no escape. Not only this, but most physicians are unhappy and I'm starting to wonder if this is worth it. But still, I am perfectly fine with sacrificing my own wellbeing so that my patients would be able to have theirs. 

So, I'm just a bit worried about my career goals and was wondering if anyone had any advice for me. Are my concerns valid? Are there other fields I can consider? Are there other options available that can provide what I'm looking for?

P.S.: I am still set on the path to pursue medicine. After over a year of contemplating I have decided that I would rather pursue this field, mostly because I believe it will allow me to make a greater impact in the world.

1dscjtd,Looking to change careers,"Long story short, I’m about to graduate with an engineering degree. After having some internship experience, I don’t really know if I can handle the competitiveness in my field. That and I just don’t really feel like the work I will do will make any real impact on the lives of people. I want to do actual work with my hands that isn’t completely physically debilitating. I want to directly see the lives of people improve as a result of the work I do. If that means I earn less money, so be it.

I’ve considered the military route, but after reading horror stories, I don’t really know if I want to make such a big commitment. Plus, I don’t really want to be surrounded with the kinds of people you find in the military. So that’s off the table, leaving either the standard corporate path or the trades route. My dream obviously would be to do something in the arts (theater, music, etc) but it’s definitely not easy. I need financial security first and foremost, so until then I have to do something more sensible.

I suppose I’m just curious to hear from anyone here who may have been in a more technical field and transitioned to something else, including the arts possibly.

1dsb8av,How can I better myself to be more suitable for entry level remote positions?,"How can I better myself to be more suitable for Entry level Remote positions?

**Context**: I am 23 and am currently a Civil Engineering student from Brazil. I am from the public university of my state, which in a Brazil means it is both completely free and way more prestigious than a paid college. I basically traded my highschool years for this opportunity and thought once I got in I'd be set for a good starting job.

That is, of course, not the case. I found out the market is completely overloaded and thus salaries have dropped drastically for entry level engineers and stayed the same for the experienced ones despite inflation.

And just to make things worse, I found out my degree is essentially useless unless I have work experience prior to graduating, so I applied for internships. Eventually, after many failed attempts and one bad work experience, 3 interviews and 2 written tests landed me an intern position at my dream local company. Keep in mind, this is not a summer intern program, I think it'd be best described as a ""temp"".

Surely this is it, right? I get paid below minimum wage but at least I have a chance at landing a full time position at the end of my contract.   
  
**No**. I get paid 1400 BRL/250 USD(started at 900 BRL/160 USD), just below minimum wage in Brazil. Also, in reality, they work me as a full time employee and I get so much stress I can barely focus on anything else. And of course, it has been completely detrimental to my degree, every semester has been worse and worse as I was already doing a hard degree and now I don't even have time to properly sleep, let alone study.

And this brings me to where I am today, completely unsettled as my contract is reaching it's end and my manager won't even guarantee I'll get a full time position and it is as an assistant, mind you, not as a full fledge engineer, which would be ok, if it wasn't for the salary being 2000 BRL/355 USD(lower than a bricklayer at the same company) and the fact it can take up to a decade until you actually get promoted to engineer, if at all.

And I don't even enjoy my work, I get berated and screamed at by my boss for any minor mistake, despite being an intern, he literally expects from me the same results the full time employees deliver without actually paying me for such. It is honestly just so degrading and punishing and meeting with my highschool friend who chose Design and is now working at such a rewarding job made me see how I don't need to cage myself in this industry.

**End of context.**

This was until I stumbled on a full remote position at Twitter/X as a Product Operations Associate  with a base salary of 2600 USD/14540 BRL, which is more than I'd ever make at my current company.

I'll be honest, even just 1000 USD per month on full remote would be enough to headstart my life and then work my way up, but I have no experience in the field, both my job experiences are for my current company:

- 9 months as a Client Experience Intern. I essentially would inspect the apartments the construction team had finished and hand them over to the clients. I inspected about 230 apartments of about 30 square meters and handed over 160 of those.

 - 1 year as a Construction Team Intern. I pretty much oversee the construction of a building alongside the engineer(my boss), checking and reviewing projects, ordering materials and financially planning the next months. I honestly do a lot of my boss' work but I don't complain since it's supposedly good preparation for one day getting the role.

Considering I have no experience in my resumee for this especific role(they asked for 3 years experience), how can I make myself suitable for a Starting position? What softwares should I master, etc. Please be specific if possible. I'm already good at Excel but I currently don't use SQL or Python, but I consider myself a quick learner, I learned the basics of Photoshop at abut 12 for fun, but never followed up on it to focus on my studies(and that clearly didn't pay out).",Matt-Felix,2,1.0,0,1719780620,2024-06-30 20:50:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dsb8av/how_can_i_better_myself_to_be_more_suitable_for/,6,2024

1ds6ood,Salary negotiation after probation period,"
Hey everyone! I graduated a few months ago and was desperately looking for a job. The job market is absolutely horrible. I finally ended up receiving an offer more or less related to what I studied. During the interview nobody asked me about my salary expectations and unfortunately I received a pretty low salary offer. I ended up accepting the offer because I was desperate+they had good benefits like private health insurance, remote work, 25 paid vacation days and workations. Also, they had no issues with the fact that I had 0 experience in the field and agreed to train me. So, I thought it’s a good chance to get experience since I don’t have much (even though I have previously worked).

It has been almost three months, my manager is pleased with my work and during one of the meetings with him he said that he would discuss my pay with the higher management to see if they can increase the salary after my probation period. The past three months I have been working really hard to prove I am a good employee, so that the higher salary request is justified.

I am assuming there will be an one on one meeting with my supervisor next week. Should I bring up the pay? How should I address that I would want a higher salary. Because frankly speaking the job is harder than I had expected.

Also, I am the youngest in the whole company and that is why I feel intimidated sometimes. I understand I need to stand my ground and ask for what I need, otherwise nobody will give it yo me. 

Any advice on how to approach this and make them pay me more? Thank you!

1ds55xv,"""Your talent is wasted in the role you are in"" - yeah... but where should I be?","Let me describe you briefly my last project, which is a pretty good example of how I usually work...

My (huge) company bought another (very small) company with a production plant a couple of years ago. Integration fell into the midst of a certain pandemic and included mostly IT related stuff. Fast forward, we've had high turnover, absenteesm through the roof, massive drop in productivity, and the new asset wasn't profitable, but ended up accumulating debt. Millions of it. I was given the task as a project manager to fix this. Nobody believed I would move this forward. 

  
 Mainly by driving production volume into that plant. But it was pretty clear right from the start, that things weren't that straightforward. It was all a big mess, that I had to untangle. First of all I had to win the trust of a very frustrated team and get them to collaborate with me.   
Then I worked with them in numerous Kaizen events to fix their processes. While I was at it, there was another derailed project lingering around, which was an enabler for mine. So I basically picked up the slack also there. With the trust of the team and their newly found motivation, we fixed what wouldn't have been finished by now, with no end in sight. I demanded the impossible and as the team trusted me, they delivered the impossible. We changed raw materials, upgraded one of our machines, fixed the process end-to-end. I also fixed a derailed process for products transfers from another plant, because people didn't communicate. I fixed IT issues and I am nowhere near being an informatician. I fixed product management issues. Which is not my role at all. I was doing the job of several people.

Next, for bringing in that desired volume, some serious businss growth was needed, but for this, the sales team had to approach new customers. So I single-handedly organized a training event in the plant, so they could get familiar with the products coming from there but also know the people and the asset and built trust. 40 people, a handful of exectuives included came to learn. I orgnized the travel, the food, the demonstrations, almost everything by myself, until I eventually got help. It was a big success.

And then I got the compliment from several people, that my talent was actually wasted in a project manager role like mine. And this is what is throwing me off right now...

Well, I'm for sure not your ordinary project manager, ticking boxes or following any approved method. I go all in, untangle things, build trust and then lead people through change, encouraging to basically help themselves. No other project manager I have met in my company does things this way. Usually they have a very stiff approach (like PRINCE2), with lots of documentation and useless meetings. Which I hate...

If I would be squeezed into a corset like ""proper project management"", I would not be able to perform. But I also somehow agree with my boss, that I should be in a leadership role. 

But... where? In what field? What would a leadership role for someone like me be called?

I'm so lost... I love this tricky kind of projects. To fix things. To help people out of whatever situation and get stuff back on track. Sleeves up and let's go!  I'm maybe looking for something, that is like untangling the messy situation, but once the worst is over, I would like to hand things back off and deep dive into the next ""mess"".   
Is there a name for such a role?

Any ideas would be highly appreciated!

Long story short: My partner has 2 years left in their residency program, after which they will make be substantially more money. We plan to live in a HCOL area after they’re done, and I would like to develop knowledge/ a skill that would bring in extra money once we make that move to help support our future house/kids. 

When I say extra money, I mean something along the lines of $40K - $80K per year. I currently make $100K in my job, which averages about 30 hours per week of real work; 20 on a slow week 45 on a busy week. Ideally, this other skill would allow me to be a self-employed contractor so that I can pick and choose hours that work around my job. Would spend about 15-25 hours per week on this other work. 

The question: What skill should I learn? I plan to use the time that I used to put towards studying for grad school (evenings) towards learning this new skill set.

I’ve done web design, but not sure if the money or longevity is quite there. Software dev/machine learning seems like a solid choice. Have thought of trying some sort of business consulting (maybe 1 year of learning and 1 year of charging clients a very low price to get live training). Going deep into finance/financial models and being more of a quant has also crossed my mind. Im decent enough at math, so I do think a dedicated 2 years would be enough time to build the skill level that someone would be willing to pay for. Would just want something that won’t be obsolete in 5 years time due to AI, but obviously there’s no good answer there. 

The only real requirement I’d say is that I’d need to have the ability to do the work remotely on my computer. 

So, what (money-making) skill would you learn if you had 2 years to dedicate yourself learning it?",Brilliant-House6433,44,0.9599999785423279,31,1719759731,2024-06-30 15:02:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ds3h21/what_moneymaking_skill_would_you_learn_if_you_had/,6,2024
1ds3d8g,Feel like I'm losing my dignity after promotion,"Hi all!

  
May sound a strange post, but long story short I have found that after being promoted to a team lead at my workplace (only because of the previous TL leaving and my tenure and knowledge of the business, mind you) I have found that living this almost double life is exhausting and giving me a feeling of a loss of dignity. Might sound rather bizarre as this should be a great thing in terms of career trajectory but there is unfortunately this culture in management, now that I am closer to them, where all their jokes should be laughed at; all their frankly quite ridiculous ideas should be celebrated; there is an awful lot of brown-nosing that is expected. It's quite honestly like I have to live this double life of (I hate to say it, but it is expected of me) barking orders at my sub-ordinates whilst dancing around like an excited fairy once anyone with a higher position walks through the door and treat them like they are royalty. I've tried myself to give a subtle bit of pushback but have found it only causes problems with my position now.  
  
To be fair, it isn't something I would class as a toxic workplace as such. Many of the employees hang out socially and get on but there is this pull within me to just leave this ridiculous nonsense behind by leaving or asking to be put back on the floor. Is this a common thing and should I just accept this is all really just part of the 'having a job' game? It effects my performance either way, I think. Has any one else been in this position?

I’ve been in this role for about a year and a half, but I feel my growth and learning have plateaued.

1ds184r,"Thinking about uprooting, starting over but I'm seeking advice first because I'm scared","Thinking about starting over, current job will never pay me enough

I currently work in local news in Production. I run telepromtper, cameras, and learning audio.

Position only pays $15, I've been told there are NO raises. NO BENEFITS. No holidays off unless I luck into a day off coinciding with one. I have my weekends off always. Must work days with severe ice storms and snow.

I work 4 am- 9 am then 11:30-1:00 pm. No pay during shift split. But I'm still at work during those 2.5 hours. Home is 30 mins away so I don't drive home.

Only way to get a raise is become full-time, but the company I work for makes it hard to move up, and I don't even think I want to. 

Only moves up at the company for me are audio engineer or producer, but I have learned I don't really want to do either for this company. 

I wish I wanted to be a producer, BUT they are stressed, disrespectful to each other, and have to sign 3 year contracts. They also HAVE to write in certain content/run bullshit stories.

I've done this job for 1 1/2 years now and I have changed as a person. I think the news affects my mind.

I was in a shortlived relationship and noticed I'm less emotionally available lately, have less libido, I've noticed I have a harder time keeping plans I make with friends and dates, and it makes me feel like a flake.

I don't know what I want to do now. I like the studio atmosphere, but the shows/the content we run is kinda slowly draining the blood from my body. It's like a toxic relationship, a part of me doesn't want to leave. 

The big media conglomerate I work for produces whatever they get paid to. We have a religious show, an agri show, and ads we have to help shoot for a shady chiropractor/pain clinic. The company is so obviously greedy and they don't care about the content, just the money. 

The chiro ads are disgusting actually, he brings in a bunch of older women and men who believe he changed their lives and that God sent him to them ad its sad, claiming his treatment even helped them to lose weight. He's a quack. The content is just so strange.

I have the job on my resume. I'm thinking about leaving with no job lined up. I have some savings, live on my parents property. I want to make them proud still but this job is holding me back.

Sticking it out with this job isn't getting me anywhere in life. I have some savings again now, but thats it. 

Any advice for starting over? I'm feeling lost and kinda shattered that I need to leave. There aren't TV jobs galore here where I live.

For the past two years I've been gone during fall and spring for college. I would work winter and summer break. I am taking a few semesters off from college and therefore will be working more. However, the hours are inconsistent and there are some weeks I do not work. 

For a while now I've been considering asking for another raise. I train new employees for my position every so often. 

The reason I am hesitant to ask for a raise is due to the fact that I do love my job. There is also the fact that almost every time I've asked off, I have gotten off. 

Would it be recommended to ask for a raise? I was also wondering how much I could ask for if they want to know what I would like. ",StarryNightLight121,2,1.0,8,1719753057,2024-06-30 13:10:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ds15x8/when_should_i_ask_for_a_raise/,6,2024

1drz5zl,Advice for Learning a New Language Fast?,"Hi Everyone,

I recently discovered that I can learn languages very fast. I'm on the spectrum and highly verbal and also love talking to foreigners. I'm 28 (so not in high school or college) and want to be able to practice with someone. Currently, I'm working on Thai and Vietnamese because I would like to eventually move to Southeast Asia. I would need to speak the language to ensure a good paying job (like an English teacher) The only problem I have is that I get lost with knowing *where* to try and learn. Obviously, there are apps, books, websites, youtube videos, but I get lost in the paradox of choice that I get overwhelmed and neglect trying to learn. Also, because the language is very tonal, you need a native speaker to really identify how accurate your pitch is. I've been looking for accelerated language schools/programs but am having trouble finding any. I live in the New England area where there is a dense Thai/Vietnamese population and I'm about to just start asking people at restaurants Lol. If anyone know a strategy for learning this tougher languages please let me know.

Also, does anyone know of any good programs for teaching English as a foreign language?

I sat for no longer than 1 minute before my manager showed up and said I’ve been sitting all day and if I continue he’ll have to clock me out. Mind you the dishes were done and my area was clean so I basically had no work to do at that time. This was the last of the many digs I received from the managers during my 3 months working there. I know for a fact it’s a dig because everyone including the managers sit outside for sometimes 15 even 30 minutes. I just had enough and clocked out. I then received a message from him saying I’m fired and that my hours from today were withdrawn. That doesn’t sound very legal to me.

1drvhbs,All I've known is physical work and now I have spondyloarthritis,"So all my jobs have been life affirming and satisfying, but poorly paid. Well, not all my jobs, but most of them. Forestry, timber framing, milling and now brewing. I've jumped around either due to a lack of work or something similar, but largely because I've struggled to figure out what it is I want to do. I've also had pretty bad luck in a number of ways and I am now at 35 and have £10k debt from car and home related things, mostly. I don't even remember anymore, but they were always a necessity, I don't pay for games consoles or something on a credit card.

Problem is, back in March I was diagnosed with a hereditary autoimmune condition, Axial spondyloarthritis. This means any real heavy lifting is now out. But so is sitting at a desk typing as it's not just my lower back that is affected but also my hands. Typing at a keyboard for more than an hour and I can't properly close my hands the next day. So an office job with much typing is out the window.

I am now facing temporary work, basically minimum wage. I am not in a position to move house and honestly, we have a good deal here and we'd be mad to move. This sort of rental is incredibly uncommon (includes land for growing our own food and some animals, and a workshop).

But I have no idea what to do for a new career. I want to clear my debt but I'm also not interested in ""getting rich"". Getting by and not worrying about money is enough for me. I have something of an engineer's mind, it runs from my dad's side to at least his dad if not beyond, and a great deal of interest in a variety of sciences, but indebting myself further for education is neither feasible nor sensible.",jezzetariat,1,0.5600000023841858,0,1719730129,2024-06-30 06:48:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1drvhbs/all_ive_known_is_physical_work_and_now_i_have/,6,2024

Boss also seems to work extremely late hours. Once I stayed at work until 4AM, and the boss was still there. Boss usually likes to play music at a decently loud volume, but I'm okay with that.

He seems to be buying a lot of postmodern art and furniture and art for the office. I literally work at a pink plastic desk. This is all on the company's dime.

1drru5x,Changing careers to financial advisor,"I (40f) responded to a chance ad and scored an interview with a national bank as a financial advisor. They’ll pay for me to get my licences and a salary for a few years.

On one hand, I feel like it’s the perfect opportunity. On the other it seems too good to be true - why would they have to pay to train people?

1drqvo6,How to protect my work while interviewing? ,"I don't know if anyone else has experienced this, but over the past few years while interviewing for various senior level strategy jobs, I've had at least 50% of the interviewers ask for a ""case study"" final interview presentation that is basically just ""do an essential part of the job/answer an important question for us without actually being on the payroll."" 

At my current company, my boss literally told me that they use the case studies as free market research and strategy consulting, and that they weren't even sure if they were going to green light my product until my case study. Several of these assignments take easily 20-40 hours of preparation with little to no guidance on what the assessment criteria are. To test my theory, I put together a reasonable, but high-level presentation for a final round interview asking to outline a strategy for differentiation. It was still 20 slides on market size/growth, trends, competitive landscape, barriers to adoption, and a proposed roadmap, but the feedback I got from the hiring manager was ""he expected more,"" but he still asked for a .pptx version of my slide deck instead of the watermarked PDF I provided as a pre-read...

Has anyone else had any success navigating these types of interviews? If the expectation is to put in 20-40 hours of work into basically doing the job on my nights/weekends, I feel like it is fair to expect to be compensated for my time, or at least not have my work used as free consulting in the event that they don't hire me.

I know sometimes getting an outside perspective can help align things and see where our blind spots make us oblivious to some truth. I'm hoping that whoever reads this post can think of career suggestions based off of the information I give about myself.

I went to college for radiologic sciences, and currently an X-ray tech. While I was getting my degree, I was in the Army National Guard as a chemical specialist.

Health and wellness, philosophy, creative thinking, the outdoors, nature, motivating and uplifting people, music (I play a little), staying active, and sports are a big part of my life. I placed at state for track in high school and graduated top of my class in the army for physical fitness. Speaking and singing makes me feel invigorated.
I am terrible with math and my reading honestly isn't the greatest when it comes to retention, so analyzing and computing information is not my specialty, nor interest.

Are there any jobs that come to your mind when you read over my profile?
Any suggestions would be great as I am planning to make a career change away from the medical field.

1drqf40,Job potential-looking for advice,"Job change-needing advice/different perspective

I’m looking for some different perspectives on my current employment situation. 
A little about me: 
Mid 30s, married with two kids (3 and 6) 
I have been working with my company over 10 years and I had taken a back seat on advancing my career to have a better work/life balance when kids were young.

I have been in my current dept for over 4 years, and because of Covid we became fully remote wfh. Mid last year, the company decided to have us go back in the office 1x a week which to me was doable. I love working in my dept as I have a great manager, work load is manageable and a great team. 
A few weeks ago, an opportunity on our job line opened for another dept that I have always had an interest in. I know someone who currently works there and after chatting with them I have a better idea of the work that they do and from what I can tell workloads are more time sensitive and may be quite demanding. I know this is the path I want to go down career wise  but it is essentially the same pay grade level (I know I can renegotiate my salary for higher) and the kicker is that we would have to be in office 2-3 times a week, more than what I am required to right now. 

I’m torn because 1) i want more money and at the position where i am now it would be next to impossible to get a salary raise (other than our bonuses but it’s capped) and 2) I would like to eventually advance my career to that direction 

But I would be losing the 1x a week in office flexibility, being comfortable in my dept and knowing everything 
My spouse’s work is pretty stable, they can cover the days that I need to go in the office by doing the drop off/pick up but I’m worried about being selfish and putting more responsibility on them

*as a side note, this salary renegotiation most likely will not result in any more than a 5k raise - as mentioned before since this role is the same pay grade level 

Is this move worth it?

I have a paralegal job which pays me 1,000 a month which is not enough to move out anywhere so I live with my parents and i still help out around the house soo I’m essentially saving nothing and have no savings.

I’m looking to retrain. ( retrain as in go through education systems again and not just learn online or do boot camps) not because of money but because law and working in law is draining my soul and I’m dying 💀(dramatic) 

I’m looking for a tech sector/ IT sector that’s in demand and it’s easier to break into at entry levels ( I’m aware entry levels roles are almost nonexistent anywhere, but some field will be packed more than others if you understand what I’m saying) (just clarifying that I didn’t say easy, I said easier compared to the other tech jobs)

I want to research about this sector to see if it’s in my interest. And see what education pathways would be best for it

1drpxut,Should I stay or quit?,"Sorry It is so long but I wanted to get all the info out, I want to know if my emotions are ruling my train of thought or not.

I recently embarked on a role caring for creatures. The seasoned leaders in this domain have dedicated three decades to this pursuit. They oversee a farm where they breed dogs, offer training for clients' canines, and breed horses for showcases. During the interview, one of the overseers guided me. Few questions were posed to me regarding the hiring form I had to complete, but nothing else, such as days off, payday or the amount I will be paid hourly. It was noted that their young stallion playfully rears, yet has not caused harm. However, I learned from the other overseer that a former staff member, not fully attentive, was injured by the horse in the stall. I am the lone employee present, tending to around 53 animals, 34 of them are dogs. I clean up waste, feed the dogs, then let them out for a brief exercise, while I feed another group of dogs. There are five groups of dogs. I repeat this before lunch. After lunch, I let them out to exercise, feed them, then let them out again. Any spare time is spent cleaning up waste, assisting with tasks, or sweeping and mopping. In the morning, I feed the horse & goats, check on the birds. In the evening, I feed the horses once more. While the overseers offer help, they often engage in tasks or work with clients' dogs on Saturdays. It is a 10-hour day. I retire around 9:30 pm, rise around 5:40 am to prepare and care for my animals, arrive at work around 7 am, return home at 5:20 pm, and have little energy or appetite. They grant me autonomy in my work. I have been urging myself to persist, but my interest has waned.. It has only been four days, but I have my own animals and one of my fears is transmitting an illness to them. Since starting this job, my appetite has diminished. Although I adore animals, I was initially delighted to work among them, now I find no pleasure. I feel detached from the role. Unbeknownst to me, I portray a cheerful demeanor to my family, leading them to believe I am hastily contemplating quitting. The boss may not have meant to lie but did. Us works have to sign a liability form before we even begin working. I understand why for the form & horses you have to keep an eye on them if they acted up. When I get home my body feels hot & my feet throb, I make sure to drink plenty of cold water, it is a half gallon & I have another gallon water. I have flat feet but have insoles to deal with it. I live in Colorado, getting paid $14 an hour, I live with my mom, have a small hobby  farm. Right now it is easy but when it becomes winter I will not have a break.

With a master's degree in robotics and AI, and four years of experience in autonomous warehouse robotics, I'm concerned about the stability and future prospects of my career.

My expertise includes classical robotics algorithms, perception, computer vision, C++, sensor calibration, and fusion.

1drotpj,I handle account receivables but I don't know if it's easy or I'm only doing half the work. ,"I work at a car dealership and I handle AR payments and extended warranties. I also handle  employee training but that doesn't matter. 


My main issue though is that I make about 17 an hour, but I'm worried that the reason I don't make more is because I only handle a limited amount of the responsibilities the role has. 

I handle statements each month, enter in checks to accounts, make follow up emails and phone calls. Also once in awhile make phone calls for new accounts my manager request that I review. Overall, I found it to be very easy to micro manage with my other responsibility. Often to the point my manager struggles to find work for me. I'm not a employee to milk my work, that just isn't me. However, hourly work doesn't care how well you did. 

There are other responsibilities I am aware of that I'm still being trained on like open account or fleet. Also any action I take often has to be approved apon by my supervisor. 

I handle about 40 ar payments a month and 40 extended Warranty payments a month as well. 

I have only been doing this job for about year after college and I want to explore better paying options, but I'm worried that if I say I can do this job and work at the ""better paying"" locations I'll be given several things to handle that they expected me to already have experience doing it.

They just infanticize adults on the spectrum and enable the parents of those on the spectrum to keep them down. I don't have any parents (deceased), family or anyone to stay with. I live paycheck to paycheck doing retail living alone in a horrible apartment the past 5 years. I can't stand it. 

I desperately want out of customer service. I tried switching to restaurants several times and hated it. I am not interested in all the usual suggestions like security guard, maintenance/janitor, warehouse and data entry. It all feels dead end to me. I want a career. I have no retirement or investments. I take the bus and Uber everywhere as I have no car. And work is ten miles away. Im tired of long commutes and going home and having no motivation or energy to do things. I make $16 an hour and its so frustrating to read stories about people my age who have the life I want.

  
Writing is the only thing I enjoy doing but I don't want to do it as my career as there is not enough money in it and I don't want my only passion to be a business.

 I tried getting lab assistant jobs in the past but was turned down. I tried Honeywell as an assembler but was turned down. I'd like to get into tech but it's hard for me to learn things on my own. I really need something where I get hands on training. The trades wont work because you have to go to peoples houses and that makes me extremely uncomfortable. I only learned when I had tutoring in school. My special needs keep getting in the way of being successful and I hate it. What would be a career I could do that would take me from a 30k a year annual salary to at least 60k? I want to pay off debt, invest and build wealth so bad. I suck at math but I actually dream of being an investor and look at that as the career you'd get into once you get your ""regular"" career. But no way for me to invest now.

I'm already looking around for another job but this makes me want to lower my standards a little bit. But at the same time, if he got fired for some non-performance reason he likely wouldn't tell me the real reason. 

  
I just don't know how much I should let this flavor my view of the company and management.

1drnkrl,Questioned work ethics ,"This is my first job and I’ve been just over a year at this company. My manager has a very rude and condescending tone and after our last meeting where I was accused of not doing enough (we’ve been doing a lot of unpaid overtime which I think is not right yet we are not allowed to claim that), all in all I cannot work with a colleague who questions my work ethics. I’m looking for another job but meanwhile the manager scheduled a 1-to-1 to discuss future of my role, where I see myself in x year etc but I believe this is to further insult me (manager has the tendency to drag endlessly the passive aggressive, snarky  comments if we ever did a mistake until we’re beaten down enough for their sadistic satisfaction).

How should I respond to this? Do I bring up their rudeness from last meeting and directly confront that? Since I’m less than 2 years at this role, I don’t think I’m protected in any way and can be simply fired. I lost any respect for that person and my team feels the same but they gave up and just tolerate that. Since I’m new I’m not willing to subject to such work abuse on daily basis. We already lost a new colleague earlier this year.

Should I let them speak first and depending on what they say respond accordingly? Do I talk about the elephant in the room or nod for now, stay professional and leave when I find another role? Is there any point reaching out to HR? This manager is well disliked here but I wonder if I want to escalate this into full blown conflict. I’m angry and don’t want to act too impulsively if I don’t want this to stain my professional carrier.

Thank you for any advice

1drl6ms,Found out I am being severely underpaid - quit or negotiate?,"I work as a paralegal for a small personal injury law firm in the Metro Atlanta area. I was hired on 3 years ago at $36,000, which I accepted to get out of retail. Last year, I was cross-trained and then promoted and bumped up to $40,000. Starting pay for this job position is around $65,000, btw, but our office is very laid back, flexible schedules, etc, so I haven't thought much about the low pay because of those benefits.

My managers are very anti-workplace pay discussions, but thankfully my co-workers are not. After chatting with the group last week (our annual reviews were last week), I found out I am getting paid the same amount as a brand new employee who started 7 months ago with 0 experience. Others work the same exact position I do, same amount of experience, and are getting paid $15-$20k+ more than I am.

I am constantly praised for my work-product and production by my managers and the attorney I work for. I'm reliable and loyal. I never took time off when my mom died. I was diagnosed with cancer last year and have continued to work the entire time. My attorney and I are a high performing team, bringing in over $1 million in the last month alone. And yet here I am at the bottom of the totem pole.

I had my annual review last week and was told I will hear back on Monday on how much of a raise I'll be getting. After thanking and appreciating my managers, I told them that I know I am underpaid and I would like to respectfully ask for a $12k raise. This still puts me as the lowest paid paralegal in our firm, but closes the gap a little bit.

I am nervous for Monday. I truly do not think I will be given the raise I've asked for, at which point I am contemplating quitting. Mainly based on principal, but also my husband and I will be relocating later this year anyway. I have enough in savings to warrant quitting. My husband is fine with it. 

Can anyone provide any thoughts or opinions? Am I being dramatic for feeling insulted?",RespondNo6933,14,0.7200000286102295,28,1719695549,2024-06-29 21:12:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1drl6ms/found_out_i_am_being_severely_underpaid_quit_or/,6,2024

1drhq57,At a Crossroads in Career - Seeking Advice,"I’ve been with my current employer for about 4 years now. Let’s call it Company A. I hold a senior level position but it’s a relatively small company in my industry (approx. 30 employees). Really like my boss, I have tremendous flexibility (work  from home) and autonomy from the sweat equity built up after 4 years. To be honest though I am not being challenged anymore and mostly cruising at this point. 

I recently received an offer to a job of similar seniority but at a much bigger organization that is more respected in my industry. Let’s call it Company B. Although it’s a lateral move in title, the position would would be much more respected and open other doors for me in the future and the pay would be an increase of about 20-30%. 

I am undecided about accepting the offer because of the flexibility and autonomy I would be giving up. I really value the flexibility I have at Company A in my current role especially since I am the sole provider for both of my aging parents who are becoming more and more dependent. My wife is also pregnant and while on paper an increase in salary would be a no-brainer when you’re expecting, we’re actually doing OK financially. Of course like anyone more money could always help but I’m just worried that if it will be a more stressful job and the first year I will have to work long hours and prove myself, is it really worth the extra salary, especially when so much going on with my family life is benefited more by the flexibility I enjoy at Company A. On the other hand, is it worth it to suck it up at Company B for one year for the sake of laying the ground work for setting myself up for bigger opportunities down the line 2-3 years from now?",tcrowne33,1,1.0,0,1719685947,2024-06-29 18:32:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1drhq57/at_a_crossroads_in_career_seeking_advice/,6,2024
1drhbyq,Seeking advice as someone looking to proceed with I/O Psychology,"Hello everyone!

I am a Bachelor of Arts Psychology Major student in my 3rd year (3rd year is final unless I extend it into Research, I plan to, as 16 years of education is a requirement, depending on situation) with electives in English and Physical Education, studying at an A+ accredited University in India, with CGPA of 8.7 as of completion of my 2nd year. About to start an online Diploma in Data Analytics. I have recently started planning my future career path, because psychology was something I chose cause I didn't know what else to do. So I went for something with more options to choose from.

Might have also had a professor tell me *“if you’re only doing your coursework and course reading, you're going to be disappointed.”* I decided to get my shit together and focus.

After 2 years, I’ve narrowed down my choices. I love working with people, but I also love the business/financial side of things and how they work. I also have to be transparent in that I have the financial and moral support from my parents so that is a huge relief for me.

Now, I want to pursue my masters in Industrial and Organisational Psychology(2/1 year), followed by an MBA in HR(1/2 year, more like HR Consulting) and find a job there to settle down. These are both, on a level interconnected, so I thought my chances on landing a job would be higher. (Though I do feel doing both is probably not worth it. For HR, I feel like an SHRM certificate would be the same, as getting into an MBA program without experience would be hard. Not to mention, from what I've heard it seems, somehow, people from I/O end up doing HR?)

I wanted to go abroad for these courses (preferably UK, and preferably with a Scholarship), so I was thinking, *'what can I do to make myself stand out?'* (I know internships are an option and I am looking into that, but what else?)
How do I tackle the issues? What are the issues? Is it as easy as the multiple websites that I have read describe it? (90% of them are like, 'you won't know until you try', I don't want a 'if', I want a certain level of confidence)

Anyone studying these particular courses have any insight? Please let me in on the secret.

I have been researching the scenario for job search as well the scopes for these courses and the more I do that, the more daunting and bleaker the situation seems.

That's why I am starting to ask ahead of time. Please share some of your opinions and advice on how I should proceed further, please enlighten me, folks.

I don't hold any grand ambitions, just want to make money and live a good life.",Next_Somewhere4078,1,1.0,0,1719684886,2024-06-29 18:14:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1drhbyq/seeking_advice_as_someone_looking_to_proceed_with/,6,2024

2. Take FINRA 7 & 24? I think i can self study even take courses online but not sure if this is a smart move?

1drh9v2,Stressed and burnt out. Feel like calling in sick for presentation...advice needed ,"I've been completely checked out and burnt out at work lately. I've been working in my current job for 3 years.

My boss is *very* insecure, spineless and tries to suck up to higher-ups in a snivelling and cringey way.

(Also enduring narc abuse from another coworker whom I work closely with so it's adding to my stress at work. I've been avoiding him as much as possible.)

Recently, our boss has made us do endless 'brainstorming sessions', 'research tasks', 'presenting our findings to our team, virtually'....and now he's organised for our team to do in-person presentations for the CEO of our company.

He gets our team to perform for his superiors by getting us to do 'research' (trying to look like he's driving 'innovation'...but it's really just him wanting to take credit for our work).

The thing is, these presentations/research tasks are NOT relevant to our team's work *at all*. They're really more suited to senior staff and other departments like marketing.

I'm not good at presenting and am very nervous so every time these events have popped up, I've worked on it, stayed up late to prepare, practice and finalise slides. It eats into my work week. Afterwards, I thank God it's over...then another follow-up is scheduled.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Today (with a presentation next week), I'm now suffering with repeated pounding headaches, dizziness and feeling a bit nauseous. I think it's due to stress and not looking after myself lately.

In our group, one person has found a way out of the presentations and our boss said he won't present either so now it's down to me and a few others.

But I'm feeling unwell now....partly due to the headaches and dizziness, partly due to being burnt out.

I think at this stage, I may call in sick. Then I have leave coming up. I feel bad for abandoning my team but I really just don't have it in me anymore. I don't even care if my boss and others are annoyed.

Would like advice on how to proceed. Thank you in advance.",Quick-Breath-5178,1,1.0,0,1719684723,2024-06-29 18:12:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1drh9v2/stressed_and_burnt_out_feel_like_calling_in_sick/,6,2024

I've been working for a a surgeons office for a year now that offers a lot of non invasive treatments which is nice. I was looking for that when I applied. The pay is just not enough right now and I never have enough money to go out.

Although my boss purchased a machine for facials recently but I am not the one performing the facials. I also travel to two locations with my current job both 45 min away from me. The pay is not terrible but the commute is starting to add up between gas, MTA and ubers once in blue.. I find myself not having extra spending money since my employer takes out money for my health ins. My health ins now is the best ins I ever had, however. My boss is also really kind. I do have a rare congenital heart defect so health ins is very important to me. I don't know if they would consider hiring more staff but the commute to one of the locations is hard.

I recently was given the opportunity to go back to my old job but it would just be me and a manager working there only. I would be cleaning the rooms, checking in patients. doing auths, collecting medical clearances, scanning, entering, and billing (which I didn't have to do before) but I get to work closer to home and some days from home. Possibly esthetician stuff my old boss said. I am thinking about going back. If I go back it is a 12k increase since my old boss is now hiring again and willing to pay more but the fact there would be only two staff members is nerve wrecking to me.

1drgkp4,"Got surprised with a ""Needs Improvement"" rating for my half-year review at work.","I (31/F) had started with this company as an intern almost 4 years ago. Worked my way up from making $65k to nearly $100k, got promoted to Software Engineer I many months later than I feel I should have. (Multiple engineers on my team have said so, unprompted.) 

A male engineer who joined after me got promoted before me a while back for no obvious reason, which definitely made me feel a certain type of way, but I put my head down and continued to work. (Even he felt a certain kind of way about it, and he was the one getting the promotion.) I got a cost of living pay bump, and after a large voluntary lay-off, I was finally promoted, which I was pretty happy about. 

During our half-year review, I got requests from multiple team members to fill in peer reviews for them. I took many hours out of my day to get them all done. They never got around to doing mine. (I get along well with my team, so that's not the issue. One of them had apologized when I asked if they had gotten my peer review request, and mentioned that they hadn't been feeling well lately.) 

My team leader, who I typically get along with very well, had been pulling me aside in order to give me feedback for a few things: 

- During a push, I mentioned that I was ready to deploy the code. One of the seniors needed to make an SSM parameter first via AWS console in order for the code to work properly (only seniors have access to do this in our Production environment). The senior went ""Well hold up, I have to make that SSM parameter first."" I went, ""Oh, duh! Thank you."" It was in our push plan that I had written up, but I had stupidly forgotten to peek at it first, and forgot about that step. Unfortunately, my team leader was there, and he made a note of it. Nothing went wrong with this push. 

- I had upgraded a package that aided in encryption. I did my due diligence in terms of testing everything in our lower environments, and we set up a production push. Unfortunately, I couldn't keep my mouth shut during said push, and my team leader was present. I mentioned that the package was encrypting one thing, but it turns out that it was encrypting something else. Nothing went wrong with this push. 

I got hit with a surprise Needs Improvement today for the first time. All of my previous ratings were Meets Expectations. 

My leader's reasoning involved the above two instances, but most recently: 

- I picked up a story that involved giving a few more fields to a client. This involved a bit of additional logic, but nothing crazy. I tested everything and let the team working with the client know when we were going to production with this data ahead of time. Turns out that they also needed the data backfilled, which they failed to mention until after the push was done. Okay, no worries. I offered to do this on a Friday night when they said that it may be the best for them and their system. I asked if we can test the backfill out using one of their lower environments, if they have one, just in case things went wrong, as it was a lot of data. The other team never tested anything with their Beta environment, and were having issues setting that up. I got pinned for it. (Am I meant to babysit them and remind them to test in their lower environments???) Once again, nothing went wrong with this push. I had done exactly what the story had asked me to do, and I tested everything I was meant to. 

The above were mentioned in the document outlining why I'm getting a Needs Improvement.

To add on, he also said:

- My PRs take a while to wrap up, and this is mainly because I have senior engineers that have a habit of asking me to try different solutions (for the same result.) Recently, I was asked to put some logic in a utility file, only to be asked to revert it because they didn't like how it looked; things like that. I also end up with a lot of scope creep because of the seniors' asks during PR that have nothing to do with the story itself. The seniors are also busy, and many days typically go by where I ask around for reviews but nobody is available. My PRs are neat and not huge or anything, and I don't get any complaints regarding them. I've only ever done what was asked in the story, there are no instances where that's not the case. 

The final nail in the coffin: Because my peers never gave me written reviews (which have typically been stellar coming from them), my team leader went around to the seniors to ask for their opinion of me. He said that they feel I rush at times and am ""overconfident."" (???) Who knows how he phrased his questions and how those conversations went. 

My team leader was all ""You're not getting fired, we're going to get through this together,"" but I'm now feeling pretty upset about the whole thing. The description for Needs Improvement mentions ""frequently producing work that does not meet the quality and expectations of the role, impacting the business outcomes."" I just...

I was asked to come up with plans to mitigate two things: slowing down and doing analysis on stories, and ""living a production mindset."" 

Sure, I make small mistakes from time to time, but I'm only human. 

I'm mentoring an intern (very successfully) and always lend a helping hand to other teams if they need it. 

I've decided that I'm not picking up a piece of work until I double-check that the client / partner team will be done with their part of the work, because I'm typically stuck waiting on them. I'm going to go over my plan of action with seniors so there are no surprise disagreements on how we go about the solution. I'm going to make the seniors look at my work AGAIN before PR after I'm done with development and unit tests. (I will be bugging the shit out of them.) I'm not allowing any more scope creep unless the ask can be done in under 15 minutes-- if not, I'm writing another story for it if it's so necessary. I'm not moving anything to our Prod environments unless I know the client / partner team has tested in their lower environments.

1drc1q9,How should I transition from technician to engineer?,"Hello, I (28M) live in NYC currently making 120k a year annually. I work as an audio, electronics, and fabrication technician at one of the top automotive customization shops in the world. I’ve worked in this industry for about 6 years and feel that I’m capped in income as well as location because there is no better company I could work for in this field by a long shot in terms of pay and prestige. **The real problem is the work culture, which has been taxing on my mental health and I have a strong urge to leave.** Transitioning to engineering would open up my career prospects and give me a degree of flexibility that I currently do not have. Given my background and interests, **my dream career would be something between an industrial designer and a design engineer**. I love the creative and aesthetic aspects of design, but also the technical details and applied science behind engineering. A specialization in either audio or automotive engineering would be preferred, but not necessary. 

I originally came into my current career due to my love for music and hobby in car audio. This pushed me to dive into automotive design, electronics, and advanced audio tuning (using digital signal processing). I’ve gone on to build some of the best sounding cars in the world (won multiple national level sound quality car audio competitions). In recent years, I’ve branched out into more general aspects of automotive design such as custom interior design and classic restoration/retrofitting. Here’s a description of my current workflow and skillsets:

Each project starts with me brainstorming system designs for a particular client's needs. This is typically done on paper via rough sketches/diagrams and later refined in **CAD (Solidworks).** This ranges anywhere from simple cardboard mockups and micrometer measurements to full interior **3D scanning**. Once the general design is modeled and approved by the project manager, the hands on fabrication begins. This involves using the **3D printer, CNC router table**, or building the parts by hand using typical shop equipment (**table saw, drill press, bandsaw, sanders, shears, brakes etc**). I work with a variety of materials and hardware such as **steel, aluminum, ABS, acrylics, wood, and fiberglass composites.** The final step involves finishing work with paint or upholstery before it is ready to be installed in the car. Most of the systems that we build utilize a wide variety of electronics, so I have a firm understanding of automotive electronics (**OEM wiring standards, circuits, fusing, relays, resistors, diodes, troubleshooting, etc.)**. The end result is a part or system that looks and functions as if it came from an OE car manufacturer. We go the extra mile to achieve these types of outcomes.   

It feels like a lifetime ago, but I do have a **formal education (Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry** 3.9 GPA) from a state university. Some relevant coursework would include: 

* General Physics
* Advanced Chemistry
* Physical Chemistry
* Molecular Biology
* Calculus III

In closing, I’d like some advice on how to best transition from my current job towards this new career goal. While leaving the comfort and pay of my current job is tough, I am prepared to do so. 

1. Can I even get my foot in the door without a formal degree in engineering? Are there alternative paths that would lead to a similar salary as what I have now (120k/yr)? 
2. Should I leave my job and go back to school? If anyone else has done this mid-career, how did you manage the financials?
3. If I do go back to school, should I pursue a Bachelor’s or Master’s? Do recruiters look for specific target schools when hiring, or is any ABET-accredited university sufficient?
4. When I’m applying for engineering jobs/schools, what are some good/relevant extracurriculars to have?

Thank you for reading my story and I greatly appreciate your advice and feedback!",Snoo93188,1,1.0,1,1719670232,2024-06-29 14:10:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1drc1q9/how_should_i_transition_from_technician_to/,6,2024

1drb1wb,Switching,"Hello everyone! I have an interesting opportunity within my company to transfer to another property and I’m considering it. I’m currently a property manager and at my current property I run the entire show. I like being in control of everything and mostly reaping the credit for all the success. The issue is I don’t like most of my coworkers other than a few. The option to transfer is intriguing. Ever since I joined my company, another property and their workers have been basically begging me to join them. When I see them at big meetings they always embrace me and we even go to lunch together at times. They been asking the regional to move me to their cluster. I’ve been given the opportunity to join them and leave my current place. The pay and benefits are the same. It seems like a slam dunk, but I’m skeptical with losing some of my power although I’m in the same role and also lowering the amount of responsibility and credit I will get in the new team since they’re more competent. At my current posting the success is entirely considered to be because of me. I’d share that at the new posting. This may not seem important but I value it and envision myself winning our company’s top award. On the flip side the new team may embrace me and make work feel more like a family environment with less responsibility which I also value for mental health purposes.

1drb049,At a crossroads - do I stay or go?,"Hi all,
I’ll try to be succinct. I’m at a severe crossroads in deciding whether leaving a toxic boss for a potentially other toxic boss is worth it. I’m in a true “devil you know” dilemma. 

- Had a really hard week at work a few weeks back. I hate-applied to a few roles. 

- within a couple weeks I found myself having a 2nd interview which has now led to an offer. This new role would come with a $12k increase and I’d be making $94k. The role would come with a pension if I stay in the sector 5 years. This is the incentive for me going. 

- my present role pays $82k. It has an amazing 401k match (higher ed). I am beloved in the role and am doing meaningful work. However, my boss is truly unsupportive and seemingly personality disordered. It’s a walking on eggshells situation. 

- I love my coworkers for the most part, but they are VERY intense. It’s sort of due to the field (social work). Every week there is drama and fires. I am very adept at choosing peace and staying out of it all, but it’s a lot emotionally. So much so that a third party is helping with the organization and culture. 

- I have hesitation to take the new role due to red flags in the process, and tepid interest in the role. New boss emailed several times on weekend and at night during the interview scheduling. When I asked about work life balance (what I value most) - they had a pretty crappy answer which could be summed up as “most people take
An hour lunch.” This, coupled with her time stamps on emails has my gut saying she’s intense. She also is coming off as a micro manager. When asked for references I was given 24 hours to provide 5 heading into a holiday week where most of my references wouldn’t even be in town. The speed by which they’ve moved is something I’ve never seen in public sector.  

- even though my present role is a shit show, I’ve now dialed in exactly what I need to do and I have the respect of my directors to the point where my boss basically leaves me alone. 

- I actually turned down the offer for this new role. But the hiring manager wanted to talk about it and max-offered me
On the role. She described some of the challenges of the predecessor and it included them asking other people too many questions and that whomever is in this new role will need to go through her as a middle man. 

- realistically I can do my current role at about 30 hours a week. And I have the fog of war to take my time. I’ve done great work there and I don’t need to grind anymore. 

- new role is not exciting. I would have zero colleagues that do similar work. I would most work in isolation aside from daily check ins with my new boss. 


Long story short, my close people advise to stay put. I don’t have the energy or spirit to want to hit the ground running in a new role - but getting into the state has been a long term goal of mine. 

Do I take the opportunity , or do I trust that I have the equity and skill set to wait for when it feels right? Is $12k and the chance for a pension enough to take a role with a boss that could be tough?

I am sick with worry. ",MentionMaterial,2,0.6700000166893005,8,1719667070,2024-06-29 13:17:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1drb049/at_a_crossroads_do_i_stay_or_go/,6,2024

1dr8ixk,Should I have resigned? ,"
I was a weekend manager at a high-rise building and generally well-regarded for my work. One weekend, I came in and the concierge mentioned that the general manager should check the cameras due to some incident. Later, a porter informed me that someone reported a man jumping over the fence, which I documented. I had no idea about the severity of the incident because I wasn’t there and wasn’t informed, only that there had been a disturbance.

The following weekend, the assistant manager told me the general manager wanted to see me. In the meeting, the general manager played the security footage. It showed a resident arriving with another man, and a third man shooting one of them in the back before driving off. This was the first time I learned about the shooting. I felt ambushed as the general manager questioned me about my whereabouts during the incident. He asked, ""Do you like your job?"" which felt like a weird thing to say to someone who wasn’t there. He then asked me to detail what I do when I arrive. He also said they would have to reevaluate my position. Why reevaluate when I wasn’t there and didn’t even know about it? I could only go by what I was told.

It seemed like they were trying to find someone to blame, and I didn’t like being talked to that way. The assistant manager, whom I respected, seemed uneasy. After the meeting, as we were walking out to the other building, I said I didn’t know anyone was shot. He just said, ""There was blood on the ground, dude,"" and walked away, which was very unprofessional and left me really upset. I had to decide if I was going to continue to stay there. We're talking about some very small speckles near the sidewalk, not the front door. I thought it could be but it was so minor, I didn't know for sure. 

I felt unfairly targeted and didn’t like how I was treated. I was already working seven days a week and had sacrificed a lot for this job. I had three jobs and was giving up everything for them. I decided to resign immediately. It still bothers me the way I was talked to, even though I wasn’t the manager on duty when it happened.

Always criticises the team and has told me off in front of customers.","First time posting here. My manager has consistently messaged me on my days off since she started. Never anything good always “why didn’t this get done” “that’s not what the plan was” (the shelf was as to plan as it could be with the lack of stock) “why is this person not performing” (it’s a new starter who’s been here less than a month)

She never believes that we get busy after she leaves, we do, then complains when tasks don’t get finished. Then complains when we try and get tasks done because “you need to focus on customers” 

It’s always criticism after criticism. She’s been here 3 months. I can count on one hand the positive things she has to say. She criticises us in front of customers. The last time she asked “Are you with that customer?” To which I replied yes. Then went in to criticise and tell me off like a child in front of the customer. The customer even commented on how unprofessional it was.

It’s not just me though. It’s all but one of the team. It’s getting to a point where one of them left after only a few months. Another who’s been at the company for almost 20 years now is getting to a point where she’s said to me she doesn’t see the point, she doesn’t like coming to work and struggles to get out of bed on work days as a result and I’m getting concerned about her wellbeing.

My own mental health is tanking and I feel like I can’t be present for my team. She prints out our individual KPIs, which all team members agree is demoralising (we’ve told her as much) I can’t relax on my days off because I’m on edge expecting messages from her telling me all the things that she doesn’t think are good enough for her impossible standards. 

We’re being reduced to numbers and percentages. We’re not even people anymore.

The long and short of it is I don’t know what else to do. We’re a small team in a busy, VERY customer focused, business in the health and wellness industry. Her attitude means staff morale is nonexistent. I’m trying to counteract the negativity by drawing attention to what the team does well, where they’re excelling and making a point of telling them how pleased I am with what we’ve done. But it’s not a healthy environment and I don’t know whether to raise it with the regional manager (with the messages as evidence) or just leave before my mental health tanks anymore or I get ill because of the stress. My hair has started falling out for goodness sake. I’m at my wit’s end.

1dr72ow,Manager excluded me from an opportunity and took credit for my idea,"Hi everyone - to keep anonymity I will limit the details on this to a minimum.

So, I work with a lot of external clients and do some development work for my role, but I do not make commission. A part of my job is to strategize and set up meetings with potential business partners and clients for my company. I had brought forth the idea of reaching out to a large organization who I am a member of (but nobody else at my company is, but they knew their brand and how impactful working with them could be). I drafted the email to them, set up the initial meeting with my boss and colleague and we are moving forward.

A very high level executive got wind of this and was excited. He asked to schedule a meeting with my manager and his boss (director level who had zero involvement) to give his input and kudos. My manager told me this meeting was coming up and I was patiently awaiting for details.

Come to find out, I was the only one excluded from this gathering. My colleague (same level), my manager, and his boss (director) all met with the executive and received the feedback and kudos without me. I was really disappointed to learn this and confused as to why. I have been with this company for a little over a year, so it didn’t make sense why I wasn’t being included.

When I talked to my boss during our biweekly 1:1 earlier this week, he just came up with a bunch of excuses as to why I wasn’t invited too. He claimed the meeting wasn’t that important, and yet, I heard our parent company is now getting involved and there is a possibility of a follow up meeting next week to raise it to their attention. When I expressed my disappointment, my boss didn’t seem to understand why I was upset despite this being my idea he essentially took all the credit for, me being the only one excluded, and missing out on the opportunity for very rare time meeting in person with this executive to learn from him.

This is the first time something like this has happened with my manager as I really like him otherwise, and I’m not too sure what to do. Any advice?",sunflowers_j,0,0.33000001311302185,1,1719651893,2024-06-29 09:04:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dr72ow/manager_excluded_me_from_an_opportunity_and_took/,6,2024

1dr5iy2,"Struggling to consolidate my skills into a cohesive career transition, how do I get clarity and move forward?","I have a humanities degree and over my 20's I juggled multiple jobs in customer service and social media marketing (creating posts, managing platforms). I studied and got a master's in management but realized I needed to center myself more skill wise. My interests and skills I've learned led me to consider marketing (in more research based roles, analysis). I already have knowledge of excel and I've been teaching myself SQL and RStudio but have not gotten any promising roles.

Then, from here and from what I hear outside, it really does seems like the marketing industry is going through a lot of layoffs. I talked to someone from the industry who advised me to 'follow the money' if I were to stay in marketing (paid ads, email marketing, e-commerce). Email marketing does sound super interesting to me so I've trying to get some experience in this, be it through volunteering, but its been difficult finding emerging businesses or orgs that are willing to allocate tasks on email marketing to a volunteer. I feel stumped in this sense.

I am volunteering as a fundraising marketing specialist and, while we're not doing tasks that I'd like to, I've been interested more and more in fundraising and grant writing. But again, I'm not sure how to start to gain some experience (I said I was interested in taking this on but they want someone with experience). I feel like I'm again struggling to find work due to not having the right skills/wanting to ""grasp too much at the same time"".

I'm not sure if RStudio is the correct program I should be studying for the roles I want to land (although I do enjoy learning it), and I'm not even sure how good I am at it.

Can anyone give me any advice in this? Industry/Skill/ wise?

Am I going in the right direction?",Ladida745,1,1.0,0,1719645190,2024-06-29 07:13:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dr5iy2/struggling_to_consolidate_my_skills_into_a/,6,2024
1dr5fxi,My job requires me to sit around and do nothing,"Heres some context first. I live in a country where it is very common for teenagers to search for work over the summer holidays. It's actually more discouraged to not have a job because it can be seen as 'lazy' or 'unproductive.' So being somewhat pressured, I went out of my way to try and find the most entertaining job I could think of. There weren't that many options since I live on a small island but one of them stood out to me... An amusement park. I went into this job thinking that my days would be productive and fun but that couldn't have been further from the truth. 

My job is standing in a booth and waiting for people to come spin a wheel of fortune. Which, let me say, is the most ridiculously boring thing I've ever had to do. Remember when I said I live on a small island? Yeah, putting an amusement park in a secluded place has to be one of the stupidest business decisions ever. Because who the hell decides to go to an island to visit a boring ass theme park? So what I do is wait. 
My day consists of me waiting for someone to even walk past my booth, let alone spin the wheel. And the worst part of it all is that I am required to constantly smile and am not allowed to look down. This means that I can't use my phone, read a book, or do anything that makes this job feel worthwhile. All it is, is wasted time out of my day. 

 My boss has pointed out that she isn't satisfied with my performance and has tried to get me to call out to the guests. She says that it encourages them to consume our product. But for me, it feels more like harassment than encouragement. ""HEY YOU OVER THERE!! COME WASTE YOUR MONEY FOR A 1 IN 300 CHANCE TO WIN A BAR OF CHOCOLATE!""

I simply refuse to do it... and my boss is aware of that. However, she refuses to give me any other job because she 'believes in me.' I swear I would be more efficient scrubbing the toilets instead. 


I'm unsatisfied, and I think I've made that pretty clear. My job is draining me both physically and mentally. When I get home my head aches from me needing to listen to loud obnoxious radio music all day. My neck and back hurt to even move because of the lack of physical activity that I need to endure every day. The first thing I do when I get home is lie in bed and I don't make an effort to get up for the rest of the afternoon. 

Does anyone have any tips on what I should do? I feel like im wasting my summer. Is there anything I can do to make the time go by faster? Maybe a discreet hobby I could pick up? I don't want to quit because I'm making money but I don't think that my work is healthy for me.

I’d like to become an independent contractor in the next few years and this experience would be great to have once I venture down that road.

1dr31qz,How to get started with Data Analysis?,"So I'm 28 and I've never really had a career. I almost got an associates for Social Work  but became disillusioned. Since then I've had housekeeping or maintenance jobs, which I like, but don't exactly pay well. I'm kind of a nerdy guy and my girlfriend has encouraged me to do stuff related to computers and statistics. While I hated math most of my life, for some reason statistics really stuck out to me, and 7 years after that class I was able to use what little knowledge I had to help my girlfriend with her marketing consultations - basically I put together some data from instagram ads, organized it and visualized it with Google Sheets, and threw in some helpful findings about the audience.

Well, that's cool and I'm sure it helps and people need it, but it took me quite a few hours to find some rather basic numbers. Partly because I was in need of a refresher, partly because the process was not automated. 

So what would be a good way to get started and get somewhere with this? Should I take some online courses in statistics and marketing, and SQL? Where do I go from there? How long might it take to break out of <30k/year income?

Just to clarify, I don't HATE math, but I am not exactly a math person. I cannot really do math too well in my head. But I like visualizing and interpreting data.

I am 22, and I just graduated from UCLA with a degree in biology while on the pre-med track. I have been laser-focused on being a doctor for years, but the horrible training years, unbearable amount of exams/schooling, the not so great pay-out for all of those years in training, and the amount of years that I will be making zero money is making me rethink my choices. 

  
I am lucky to come from a well-off family, so I will graduate with no debt, and graduate programs will be paid for.

I've grinded for years and years, but I want to take that grind into something that will make me money that correlates with the hours I put in.

  
I've looked into consulting, but that seems pretty slim given that all of my work experience involves lab, hospital, or research work. Also, I would be a non-traditional applicant in any entry-level consulting role. I won't have the recruiting resources from school anymore either.

I make $80k.  Our HR Director makes $130k and our Fiscal Director makes $140k. We are all maxed out at our current wage min-mid-max scale. Despite my positive performance reviews I am told ""you're already at your max, we can't give you a raise until the next wage comp study comes out"" which takes about two years to complete.

I love my job and the people I work with. I believe the value I bring to the company is valued at more than $80k. Having two additional assistants does not mean I won't have any work and that they will be doing all the work. I have more territory to manage, more staff to supervise - more stuff to hit the fan and fires to put out.

Sometime in the next two weeks I will have a meeting with my supervisor, the CEO, to discuss department plans (i.e. budget, tech needs, equipment purchases, etc). Nothing has been mentioned about me receiving a raise.

With the added territory comes a new grant that would have an IT Director salary already built into it. In other words, there is already a salary for an OT Director built into the budget for this new territory. Suppose the CEO told me my job duties would remain the same and they would just hire a second IT Director. That is a possible solution. I know I could handle the extra work with the proper salary incentive.

Considering this, what would be a reasonable response or opening to further discuss my salary expectations?

Assuming I’m dressed well, find a quiet spot, and prop up my camera at a flattering angle, would it be unprofessional to do it from my car?

1dr00mx,"20M Need help deciding on pursuing Law, should I switch to cybersecurity and ethical hacking?","I am a turning third year political science student and used to have ambitions of becoming a lawyer (corporate or environmental) however, the concept of free/leisure time is almost inexistent when you become a lawyer; free time is a huge necessity for me. I need free time to attend to my other hobbies, such as combat sports, working out, reading a lot, watching movies, and hopefully gaming (soon). Lawyering and substance abuse are also notorious companions. Sleep-deprivation, high-stress, and long working hours are also far from my ideals. With all the aforementioned, I grew discouraged of pursuing law despite my desire to participate in intellectual careers.

Now I'm thinking, since I already have experience in the tech sector, having been coded tens of websites already using above-average level technologies such as Django, programming with Python and Javascript (React.js) for a while, I reckon that tech-related jobs are safer choices for me well-being wise. What do you guys think? Though it's quite distanced from my course and my general interests, e.g., social sciences and humanities, it's still worth the career shift. It's lucrative, computer-related affairs will never dwindle in popularity and in-demandness, it provides more free time, etc.

Now, I'm starting on my cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and AI-related journey while in the meantime, reading upon history and socscis as I am genuinely interested in those.

1dqzh4b,What would you think of an applicant like this ,"I’d just like to get some opinions on this situation. So say you see someone with a resume that shows 1 year in audit, 6 months in compliance, and then 1 year working as an English teacher abroad. Are you going to question the 6 month role? Does it look bad for an entry level? 

I’m planning on leaving but I still go back and forth in my mind. I’ll only have 6 months at this compliance job and I could possibly defer the teaching job to next year. I just don’t know what to do. In my department (I’m not going to go into specifics for privacy) it’s me and my manager and I feel so bad for leaving. I want to try to give them a month heads up so they can start interviewing while I’m still there. 

I’m just worried about having a plan for when I come back and I’m worried about my resume. I’m still early career. My conscience would feel better if I stayed a year. I’m worried about burning bridges at this role but at the same time I can’t care what others think and I need to put myself first.

I want to go abroad for personal development. I know there are other ways to do this but I already applied for this opportunity and I think it could be a good thing for me if I play my cards right. I think now is a good time for me to go and it will help me in the long run.

But then I go back and forth like I could stay the year but I’m not sure if I want to defer any longer. I’m not getting any younger haha. By now I think I’ve learned what the role entails. I don’t know if there is much else to learn even if I stay the full year. It’s suppose to get busy with auditors coming in, maybe some regulation changes that need to be updated, risk management but is it worth staying to learn that?

I don’t know if I’ll even be of much use. My manager says it’s going to start getting busy. It’s been pretty slow now and I don’t have much to do. Even if there’s audit requests my manager will probably take care of most of it anyway. I don’t always get asked to do things.

What’s holding me back is caring about what people think and how my resume looks and my job prospects. If the 6 months isn’t a huge red flag then I’d feel better about leaving.

 I know I’d still be entry level when coming back and it’s missing out on career development. I’m not going for money I want to go to gain more confidence in myself, experience new things and the culture and just challenge myself. But I still need to have a job for when I come back but I don’t know how difficult it will be given my lack of experience.

I feel lost and don't know if I should search for higher paying jobs based on my work experience and just work my way up, or go back to school for my Bachelor's.

Here are my current stats:
- 19F

- Majoring in Poli Sci with a conc in Human Security

- Minor in economics

- Service Experience: I’ve volunteered diligently through the YMCA, racking up over 1000 hours at this point, simply because I enjoy it. I enjoy helping people and leveling up my skills. I currently volunteer several hours a week dedicated to being an advisor for a teen leadership program, acting as a mentor and overseeing all operations alongside two other advisors while planning and facilitating meetings, overnight retreats, service projects, etc

- Work Experience: I currently work two jobs at two different YMCAs, coupled with the volunteering mentioned above. I work as a wellness coach, which I enjoy because I am a fitness fanatic and I love building relationships with my clients. I also, for the summer, currently work as a Teen Leadership Counselor for a summer camp that acts as an internship for teens, allowing them a safe space to have fun whilst getting experience and credit in all departments of the Y, including shadowing our professionals. 

- Career related interests: aiding in the housing crisis, poverty alleviation, human rights protection and preservation, environmental security, food security, pretty much just leveling out the playing field between the rich and the rest of us, and setting at-risk individuals up for success regarding their finances, quality of life, and future

However, now I find myself at 60 and I feel mostly tired and not interested in climbing the corporate ladder any further. When I am in annual performance reviews or discussions about the future/next steps I am honest that I am content doing what I do at the moment and my goal is to retire from full time work within 3 years. 

Most of the time when I speak to senior management about this I get shock and surprise. They can't believe I don't want to push towards a job as a VP or something.  And I wonder sometimes if its because people who are driven towards ""the next step"" will do more, put in more hours, push to increase their profile, volunteer for extra tasks, etc. These are those things that many of us end up doing to be seen as that person who will go above and beyond. However, at this point in my career I just want to work my regular hours, meet all my job expectations, take my vacations, get paid and just... ride it out. 

As I do so it will be interesting to see whether my employer will be ok with that. After all I'm not donating a bunch of extra work and time for no extra pay lol.

1dqwem3,"Stuck Between Two Job Offers After Failed to break into data analysis, what should I take?","hello Im m28 I’ve been working in call centers for over 6 years. During this time, I earned a bachelor’s in IT management and a master’s in data science, hoping to transition into a data-related role. However, due to working and studying simultaneously to pay my bills, I couldn’t take up any internships, and now I have no relevant experience.

I quit my job 6 months ago to focus on my job search, but I haven’t had a single interview for a data-related role. I’m starting to lose hope of breaking into the field.

Now, I have two job offers

1. **B2B Sales Development at a att** it is Cold calling, Compensation is $75k OTE with possibility of triple digits on 2nd or 3rd year, it is In-person, requires moving to Texas for 4 months of training, followed by another move to a different city for the actual job (they offer relocation bonuses) and they require 2-year minimum, or else I have to repay the training costs which are 14k I think.
2. **Customer Service at a Bank just a customer service position dealing with angry customers back to back** pay is $51k per year and its Work from home.

Given these options, I’m torn about what to do. Should I take the higher-paying sales role with the commitment, or opt for the more flexible customer service position? I would really appreciate any advice or insights on what you would do in my situation.

I’m a woman in my mid-20s with a female manager, have been working for the same company and team for 5 years but last year I was promoted to a new position that was vastly different from my previous one. I work from home, but have to travel now and instead of managing my own mini projects I’m having to work under a project manager to meet deadlines and keep track of documents. At first it wasn’t bad, but slowly I started to forget to file documents or didn’t think to check databases, and was slowly just losing track of my work. It got to a point where I was being late on major tasks and my manager had a conversation with me back in May about my time management. We talked and I started using a schedule/task organizer in excel and that was working for two weeks. After those two weeks I went on vacation (I was graduating from my master’s) and was out office for a few weeks due to time off and then being sick.

I’ve been trying to get myself back in this scheduling thing so I can get back to fixing and updating things from this last year, but a project manager just emailed me a list of tasks I’m behind on and CC’d my manager. It was a list of tasks I was in the middle of doing so I completed them and let the manager know, plus informed them of the tasks I planned to do Monday. But now I’m scared my manager will have another sit down with me and threaten me with being fired.

The cherry on top of all this? I’ve been dealing heavily with my depression that re-surfaced middle of last year. It’s gotten to the point I started seeing a therapist, and while talking about how I might have ADHD and how that’s the root of my issue, they recommended I see a psychiatrist for depression to get medicated so now I also get to deal with finding someone for that on top of other health concerns and personal issues I’ve been trying to work through.

Anyone else deal with something like this in their career, or is currently working through it?

The feedback was always “nothing, keep doing what you’re doing.” I work in a role that has access to salary ranges and other employee’s compensation so I had a pretty decent understanding of what an appropriate promotion would look like…..and what I was actually offered was $15k below that. All in all, my promotion was only a 7% increase on my current base salary and is at the bottom of the salary band. When it was announced I told my manager that I’m aware that this offer is quite low compared to others in the range and she kinda said she knows but that’s the best they could do….I nodded my head and we wrapped up the call but I’m feeling really upset about what’s supposed to be really exciting news. Would it be ok to reach out to my manager over email and reiterate this offer is low and ask for a larger increase?

All I’ve ever known is completing specific tasks thats clearly written out at a specific time frame, with minimal communication. It’s turned me into a yes-woman and checklist person who just shuts off my brain and ploughs through work.

I’m amazing at what I do, but despise the brain rot aspect and is trying to pivot into a more mentally challenging career. It’s an office role that involves managing projects, timelines, independent research, meetings and collaborating with others. 

1) How do I improve my soft skills like communicating “in corporate”? As an introvert who works independently it’s always been an uphill battle. I can speak naturally and get along well with colleagues but struggle with bigwigs like managers/directors - I get overwhelmed, intimidated, completely mess up my words and lose all my train of thought. It’s extremely embarrassing.

2) How does one excel at managing projects and timelines without prior experience? Is there some sort of must dos and don’t’s for these white collar roles? I am excited for the freedom but I’m so lost as I’m used to following strict directions.

1dqtk6n,Is my job at stake? ,"So far I have mixed emotions about my new job. Sometimes I feel like I don't fit in and sometimes it feels like I'm barely making the cut. I feel like I haven't been making the best impression so far either, part of it is my fault. I am starting off in the IT department.

In the first week I met everyone and they were all super nice. My manager is super chill but also very serious so it's kinda intimidating. Most of the people I work with are Indian so it's almost like they all have a connection and understand each other and I'm left out. So far, it feels like I’m not being included in many projects and I’m just put to do small tasks like entering data or meaningless testing. I get that I’m still new but I feel like there should be more interactive involvement even if I’m not really doing the work hands-on.

I’m a part of a two year professional development program where I basically rotate to a different team every few months just so I can get experience in everything. Hence, I’m assigned a mentor where she checks in with me now and then just to give me some feedback from the team and I can also say some concerns if I have any. She sat down with me and basically told me what the team thinks of me so far. In summary, she said that the team feels like that I am not fully listening to some of the stuff that they show and that apparently I tell them that I understand at the moment, but later on I come back with questions not knowing how to do it. She said that they would like me to tell them at the moment if I don’t get anything so that I don’t come back and ask the same questions I should have had at that very moment. I got really disappointed from this comment because I feel like they have my full undivided attention when they show me anything. I am literally taking notes in front of them as well as recording all of our sessions when they show me a new process so I don’t have to go back and ask questions. However, when my mentor said that I knew there was one incident that she was talking about that had to do with one person, I knew it wasn’t from the team as a whole.

Basically, one of my co workers, we’ll call her Jane, had messaged me over Teams asking if I can do something for her. Long story short she asked me to update a test document then upload it to the drive for the rest of the team to use it. However, Jane gave me very vague details. She told me that it's basically clearing up data and to just touch a few fields. The file is full of a bunch of test cases and a lot of info. It’s my first week and I’ve never seen a file like that before so I had no idea what to “update”. I needed some more clarification. I didn’t know whether to do the test cases myself, or what to add or delete and didn’t wanna screw up. She also told me to have it done by 4pm. The cherry on top was that another colleague, we’ll call her Mary, who needed to use the file, pinged me 5 minutes later saying she needed the file ASAP. At this point I’m lost and also panicking. I told Mary I had no idea what to do with the file as the instructions were vague and Jane stopped responding to me because she was super busy. Mary was nice enough to hop on a call and help me with the file. My mentor confirmed that that was one of the things that was brought up regarding my feedback and she understood my point of view. But in general, even if I do come back to ask questions on something they already showed me because of a special case or I got lost, what is so wrong with that?? Now I’m intimidated to even repeat myself or ask questions after this incident. The best part is that my manager was giving me comments throughout the week (before this meeting) about how important it is to “listen” and ask questions at the moment so that I don’t have to ask questions later. I now know why he was saying that. 

Aside from that, I feel like I’ve already made a bad impression on myself a couple of times after. Here’s what I’m talking about (this is all happened after the meeting with my mentor):  

Today there was a team outing where we all went to play golf. One of the team members, we’ll call him John, who I can tell from the first day is a gossip and know-it-all, approached me. I already don’t trust him. Anyway, he took me aside to talk to me in private. Mind you we are all at an offsite event having a good time and he completely ruined my day. John told me that one of the team members, we’ll call him Ron, was annoyed with me. He explained that we were in a meeting and that I went on my phone while we were in that meeting while Ron was talking to another colleague (this happened after my mentor gave me feedback so none of what she said applies to this scenario) . I am not excusing myself at all as I shouldn’t have been on my phone at all, and I’m the new guy so I should be listening. However, the meeting itself was very informal. I was actually the one who set up the meeting and the other guy (not Ron) came 15 minutes late. Like, no one really gave it much importance to begin with. I was paying attention for the first 10 minutes but then Ron and the other guy started talking about things that I really didn’t understand and I was not involved with. Anyway, John told me that he wasn’t supposed to tell me that Ron said that about me and that he was just “watching my back”. John also said that Ron was “very worried about me”. I didn’t ask too many questions after that but now I am 10x more insecure. Aside from that John started telling me I need to learn all this extra stuff if I want to impress everyone like Mern stack and other technical skills. I already felt like I wasn’t enough and this is now the icing on the cake. I explained to John that I am constantly trying to get involved in projects but I feel like I’m being neglected. I told John that I am always asking Ron and other team members if there is any way I can help out. John’s response to that was to basically not ask people more than twice a day for tasks to do, otherwise it can come off annoying. I didn’t realize that me reaching out to offer my help and showing I want to be involved can be annoying. 

What does he mean that Ron is “worried about me” as if I committed some corporate crime? Again, I know I went on my phone a few times during that one encounter, but other than that I always give my undivided attention. I just felt like the vibe at the moment was very informal but I understand if it came off careless and rude. The worst part is that John basically told me to keep my mouth shut but I really want to talk to Ron about it and make sure we’re cool, but I don’t want to cause any drama or attract more attention to it. 

At this point, I am super worried that the team thinks I’m careless, clueless and a nag. Why couldn’t Ron just have confronted me about the phone incident at the moment instead of talking behind my back to other team members? I just hope this doesn’t get back to my manager resulting in everyone keeping a watchful eye on me. I need your opinion on all this. Am I overthinking or do I have a right to be worried? I’m acknowledging my mistakes, but I also feel like the team sees me as a burden from the very beginning.",Nearby-Channel7382,0,0.5,0,1719606873,2024-06-28 20:34:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dqtk6n/is_my_job_at_stake/,6,2024

I have recently received an offer from a big Pharma company that is a trillion dollar company, where I will work as a Strategy lead for Enterprise Architecture.

  
The other offer is from a big bank, but where I will work with GenAI Business Partner.

both companies pay the same, however the Bank pays more in pension and has one more.

Which opportunity would you guys say, provide more opportunities for the future?

1dqtgut,Tips/Doubts [Entering the job market],"The best part about Reddit is that everyone is brutally honest, for better or worse. No unnecessary bullshit, but also no sugarcoating.

Help me out here, with no sweet talk: what are the chances of an insecure person, obsessed with work (and with ""intellectual capabilities"") to compensate for his lack of confidence, aesthetically fragile (male, thin, traces of rosacea) and with a constant fear of failure (more than anxiety or depression, it's a fuckin' simple and constant need to feel like I'm working a lot, etc., an obsession that, when it fails, leads to lasting guilt and that, in things like the master's thesis, it made/makes me not work a bit, not to lift a finger) being successful in a big law firm in any Western country (I'm in Europe)? I don't really care about becoming a partner, having great power, getting rich or driving a fuckin' Mercedes. Just being successful, whatever that means these days, and keep my mind busy and peaceful.

Thanks y'all.

P.S. In things not entirely defining, but that can be that thin line between being above or below water, I am the first in my family to go to college, I come from the rural areas of the country and I don't have last names or acquaintances in the world of law or any other area. In terms of grades, I had a very good average in college, an excellent average in my master's program (the best possible), and I might be able to salvage my thesis in two or three weeks.

1dqsmjj,I am tired of the constant fear.,"Since the first week of February I have been working at this Sand processing plant for this shitty company. When I say shitty I mean shitty. I work nights from 7pm to 7am for 4 days a week and then off for 4 days as a Heavy equipment loader operator.

The schedule is the only thing that is desirable about this place.

When I started we had a good little crew, 4 other guys + me. Within two weeks it was just me and 2 other guys(Derrick-foreman and Jerry-laborer). One guy got fired for making threats against the safety lady for cutting the lock to his locker. 

I don’t know why the other guy got fired, one night HR came down from another part of Texas to do health insurance enrollment, he clocked in for the night and waited for his turn for health insurance and when they had trouble logging into his account they discovered that he’d been terminated.

Fast forward 3 weeks the 2 other guys plus me are busting our asses trying to keep the plant running. I’m having to load the hoppers outside  with sand in the 950 loader and then whenever we get trucks to load I have to hop out and get on the 938 loader I nside the warehouse and load them with the dried and finished sand, on top of all of that I have to shovel and help out the other guys. 

And then they decided to bring this guy(John) from day shift to our crew because he got promoted from a laborer to loader, I have no idea how this dude supposedly made it a year without getting fired. But he was a cancer to our crew and pretty much influenced us to slack off not to the extent that he was slacking off but our motivation definitely dropped. 

So while all of that is going on, there’s this “foreman” on the day shift let’s call her Abigail. She has been working there for 4-5 years. Her brother who used to be the plant manager got her a job as a laborer and she worked up to being a “foreman”. I remember her brother because in 2022 I interviewed with him but ultimately didn’t take it because the job seemed sketchy. Before I started, her brother I guess either got fired or quit. 

Anyways; we see this foreman every single morning/night we work. She has no position of authority but she is definitely in the ear of the current plant manager, I mean I can see why; she’s seen as valuable and experienced to “management”.

Every night we come in, she tells us we’re getting fired and the plant manager is mad at us, and that management is watching cameras and our days are numbered.

Meanwhile we’re busting our asses trying not drown because our “foreman” Derrick is only 19 and has no previous experience. He was only foreman because he stepped up and the previous Foreman clocked out mid shift and never came back.

Another guy gets added to our crew and he’s a good worker but he already hates the company, he was originally hired to be a loader on our crew but Abigail didn’t see him fit as one even though he was a more than capable operator and instead promoted John because it wasn’t fair that the company wasn’t promoting within.

Anyways I’m going off track/getting into rant territory, I could write for days about the inner workings of this shitty company.

Derrick quits because he has personal issues, John get fired. Abigail gets promoted to a position of authority and is now superintendent of all four shifts. We get a new foreman and two new laborers, Jerry gets promoted to loader. 

The new foreman is shitty and useless and has something to prove and starts making Jerry and me do shit that isn’t even our job. We try to get him fired. The foreman and the two new laborers get caught sleeping on camera and get instantly fired. 

Jerry stepped up and is now foreman, Derrick comes back and now it’s just us three yet again.

I got accused of sleeping on camera yesterday by Abigail. I definitely wasn’t sleeping.

Inside the office there’s a monitor with every single camera on the property. I know every blind spot, I’m not dumb, I’m very aware of every blind spot in case I want to take a break or check my phone.

She didn’t say she knew for sure, she just said “if you are sleeping then STOP and If you’re not sleeping then don’t worry about it” 
 
I wasn’t sleeping but it just erks me. I’ve never missed a day, I’ve never been late. I’ve always done my work but they still want to accuse me.

Ever since I’ve started this job, every day and every week I have feared for my job. I am tired and want out but the job market right now is looking grim. The only thing that is keeping me here is the schedule.

I have dreams and goals, I want to start a food/coffee truck. I’m tired of working for other people and having to keep one eye open because people get off on drama.

I’ve been trying to save for a trailer but at this job I’m struggling to save anything. The pay is bi weekly, I’m at $20/hr and work 44 hours a week. 

In the past 2 years since I’ve been in Texas the only time I’ve ever had more than $3k in the bank was at this job I had last year when I was getting paid weekly making $23/hr.

I’m feeling hopeless and lost. I don’t even know the reason behind this post or if this post is even coherent.",UpbeatManufacturer23,1,1.0,2,1719604476,2024-06-28 19:54:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dqsmjj/i_am_tired_of_the_constant_fear/,6,2024
1dqsjcd,Career change and soul-searching. Advice,"Hi all,

I am an educator in Washington State. I have a teaching certificate and master's degree. I received my teaching cert back in 2021, but have been working in the school system in WA state since 2016 as a substitute teacher up and down the I-5 corridor wherever my wife and I happen to be living at the time.

This is the third summer since receiving my teacher cert that I am struggling to find a position. For the last two years I was in the same school district, but in different capacities, first as a full-time substitute and in 23-24, as a college and career specialist, sadly both these positions were only for a single year. Since the end of the school year I have applied to a dozen positions and had 3 interviews, one of which was at the school I have worked at most recently. Thus far, I have been passed on for all three jobs. Over the last 3 years, I've applied to dozens of teaching positions in my vicinity, I have had numerous interviews every summer, and have still never been hired as a classroom teacher.

Soon, I will need to renew my teaching certificate, but that seems ridiculous since, A) it costs a good amount of money, and B) why would I renew my cert when it's a career I can't actually break into?

So, this has brought me to this subreddit. 

I'm thinking I need a career change. I have worked as a freelance writer in the past, have great organizational skills, writing, editing skills, etc, I am self-driven and creative. I enjoy working with others, but also in solitude. Nevertheless, when looking at job boards, it feels as though I'm not qualified for anything outside of education. What industries and professions might I be able to get into with these skills?

1dqsdsz,Should I stay or should I go?,"I have been at a job for several months. From day one, I knew it wasn't a good fit. I was hired for one position, but am doing another position that comes at a higher salary. I was told they had to do it this way because of HR rules. I was told eventually they would post the higher-paid position, I would apply and get the job. But they couldn't give me a timeline. I continued to do the job, but it never sat well with me that it was so much work for so little pay. I forgot to mention the position was originally posted on LinkedIn showing a salary that turned out to be lower on the offer letter. When I asked about it they basically said our bad.

About 3 months in, I expressed my concerns about not only the pay, but also I didn't feel like the role was a good fit. One of the higher-ups said they would look into the salary and that there were other tasks I could do. Eventually, I was told I would receive a $15,000 raise. I was given a timeline. When the time came, I got a barely $4,000 raise. The HR person said she misspoke about the increase. She ""misspoke"" in front of other HR staff and upper level management.  Fast forward to now, they have hired someone in the position I have been doing, but at a higher rate. They want me to train him, and then I will transition into doing something else. And as for the other tasks I have been given, none have come to fruition. I'll do the task and then receive no feedback. 

I don't like this job and I don't have confidence in management. I have been looking for jobs, but no luck. I don't want to train this person and feel a bit resentful that they are paying him more for the position I've been doing. Quitting feels bad because I won't have income or health insurance.

1dqrz4y,Should I keep fighting this issue at work or let it go?,"I've been in my career for about 3 years, still considered a junior. I started a new account last September, but my manager quit after a month, leaving me doing managerial work for 9 months. I work in advertising, aiming to transition from a technical to a creative role. However, the lack of established processes with the new client has caused misalignment with the creative team, who don't keep me informed yet expect me to deliver results.

The breaking point was when they blamed me for a missed launch despite previously saying they had nothing to launch. I wrote up a process to clarify roles and responsibilities and presented it to leadership, who thanked me but did nothing. I sent a passive-aggressive email with receipts of my requests, but a meeting followed where they yelled at me, claiming leadership said my process was ""not needed."" However, I haven't heard anything directly from leadership. When I try to talk to leadership, they vaguely validate my feelings and just say, ""Oh, we'll talk to the team about this,"" but nothing happens.

Now, a colleague with less experience has been assigned to take over my project without informing me, and I'm being excluded from meetings and communications. Despite this, my colleague relies on me for guidance, and the team accepts his requests as valid while ignoring mine.

There's other jobs with similar responsibilities that pay a lot more, but why is it always the same story. The reviews on the job are always terrible.

She is in the same position as me, but has been here a year longer. I am the only person she has seniority over, but even after a year, I still feel like she tries to manage me. My manager always seems happy with my work and I get positive feedback from others. 

I finally brought this up to another colleague, who completely validated all my concerns, and said she’s noticed this particular worker is unfairly bossy towards me, when she should be treating me like an equal. 

Some examples:
-When working on a project together, she refuses to let me complete basic, one-person tasks on my own. This has caused delays because she insists that I wait for her to become available before I start a task, so that she can assist or supervise. 

-When working on a project that doesn’t involve her, she often goes into my reports and makes stylistic changes to font and layout without my consultation. I addressed this to her, and she said it was just her personal preference, but acted like she was doing me a favor by improving my reports. 

-She doesn’t listen to my suggestions, ideas, or input. Even when I have been sent to help her with a subject that I have more knowledge in. 

-When she is missing information, she will scold me for exchanging emails without CC’ing her. When I prove to her this is untrue, she just brushes it off without apologizing. The irony is that she frequently has conversations with management or clients without involving or updating me. I can’t help but feel like this is an attempt to keep me from being too involved in our shared projects. 

This all feels very strange and confusing, because she is otherwise very friendly and wants to spend time with me outside of work. 

I could bring this up in my assessment, and mention that she could improve how she cooperates with her teammates. I am also open to addressing this issue with her directly, but I really struggle with confrontation and honestly don’t know how to bring it up or what to say. 

Please help - how would you go about this situation ?

1dqnxuo,Did I make the right choice?,"I have been at my office job for 11 years. Started at the bottom and worked my way up to near the top and into the executive team. But, my pay is shit ($32/ hour - $66k/year). I do get an annual bonus of $3,000 and did earn close to $3500 in OT last year. So, in all, my annual pay is in the $73k ballpark. 

  
It feels like my growth here has stalled. But, it is easy, comfortable and flexible. My job is super safe here. I am liked by the owner and upper management. But, I know I can be earning more somewhere else, but at what cost?

I had a job offer elsewhere to be a small company's cost accountant. They told me the salary range from 70K-85K. They offered by 75K, which I know I could have negotiated up to at least 80k. However, they offer only 5 PTO days a year and 5 sick days a year and with a 6 month probationary period. I get 20 days of PTO a year at my current job and carries over. My current job is hourly and this other job is salary. Sure I can also probably negotiate up the PTO a bit, but I doubt close to what I have now. And my PTO is never turned down here at my current job and I never call in sick. In the last 11 years I think I called in 2 times. 

This new job would be an accounting position and working a lot through quickbooks. I do have a degree in accounting and my current job isn't exactly accounting. It has its small pieces. I work with numbers and excel and handle our company's bank accounts but I am more in operations and client support/consulting rather than accounting. So, this new job would be new territory for me. What if I am not good at it? It would have been a challenge, but could also pay off for career growth. So, I am not quite against a lateral move pay wise for an opportunity to grow. But, I would be throwing away a safe, stress free and comfortable job that pays okayish.

i'm incoming 1st year bsn sa NU and applying in Alorica (hopefully matanggap).

reason is i'm not sure kasi if i will pass sa scholarship sa ched and nu scholarship mismo and i believe even though may kakayahan parents ko magbayad sa tf ko is mababaon kami masyado sa utang since sa loan sila + maliit na sari sari + jeepney driver father ang source of income ko. note that hindi pa rin po siya sapat for us especially for me.

my only way to lessen the burden is mag trabaho ako ng at least stable job kahit papano. and one week straight na ako sinasabihan personally ng mga tao including my parents is hindi kakayanin unfortunately ng katawan ko. i alr think na this is true since sakitin in nature not sensitive but knowing my medical records there is possibilities.

my sched is 7am(Tues&Fri)-7pm(uwian ko MTThFSat) and idk pa sa alorica or other bpo company na pag applyan ko since i'm waiting pa sa alorica and if ever matanggap daw ako july 30 ang start ng training plus august 5 ang pasukan sa NU.

hindi ba talaga kaya pagsabayin realistically? even though sabihin ko kakayahin ko naman since mas nalulula ako sa tf ko :( ayaw ko kasing tumigil and if i can't find any other suitable job kasi na kayang maraos course ko.

1dqmrlm,Accepted Job Concerns ,"I have been with my current company for a year and recently started interviewing externally because I don’t like the way they do business. I was offered a new role last week and provided written acceptance. Soon after, my current employer announced a new CEO. The new company confirmed I passed background checks and said I would hear from the hiring manager soon with first day information. It had been a few days so I reached out and was informed that the start date we agreed upon was still correct but the hiring manager had accepted an external role and wouldn’t be there to onboard. This is a remote opportunity so onboarding is already more stressful than in person onboarding. With leadership style being an important reason for my leaving the current company, I asked if I could speak to the new manager who would be replacing the hiring manager at the new job. They informed me they don’t have anyone identified at this time. If I want to give two weeks notice, I have to inform my current company about the new role on Monday. I’m worried about the hiring manager leaving as I really focused my interviews on figuring out if this is the right company for me. My current company’s new CEO just held a meeting with the company and on paper at least, sounds promising as a leader. I’m taking the weekend to gather my thoughts and make a final decision but if I do withdrawal my acceptance, will it prevent me from future opportunities with the new company?",CitronWide9899,1,1.0,0,1719589532,2024-06-28 15:45:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dqmrlm/accepted_job_concerns/,6,2024

1dqlsm4,Feeling so lost on my career journey. Marketing Manager...that wishes she worked with children again.,"Hello all, 

  
Just looking to vent, and maybe even some guidance. I have been doing a LOT of self reflection lately. I went to school and got a BS in Business Administration with a concentration in marketing. During this time, I took a year off to teach English in a school in Spain. I LOVED this experience. 

  
When I graduated college in 2021, I had a hard time finding a job right away so I got a job working at a military base as a child and youth program assistant. 

  
It was the best job I ever had. It was only 6 months but I went from a part time employee to the HEAD teacher in the classroom. I worked with infants and toddlers. The management all told me this was my calling, I did an amazing job, I absolutely loved it. It only paid $20 an hour, though. 

  
I got a job as a marketing manager and left, and I haven't felt the same since. This job drains me, there's such little reward, but the pay is just so much better. I can afford to live on my own and feel well off. 



Does anyone know if there's any way to somehow work with children and make good money at this point in my life? I am already in a decent amount of college debt... so I am reluctant to  take out more debt, but I am partially considering somehow dropping everything and getting a teaching certificate. 

  
Any ideas, insight, etc. are super helpful...thank you.

But I wanted to engage with anyone with experience in the field to get their thoughts. Is it feasible for someone to switch fields into public history?

1dqk5s3,I need serious advice. I have 2 masters degrees and a bachelor in different subjects. Add to that some pretty scattered experience. What do you think my options are?,"Good morning,

I am in need of some serious advice here,

I will start by briefly explaining my situation, I am 33 years old I graduated with a bachelor in finance then worked 2 years in a bank as a personal banker. Then I decided to go for a masters degree in marketing managment , I finished the masters degree did a couple of internships then worked a year in economic and financial research.

At this point in time i had some serious family issues and an economic crisis hit my country which led to my dismissal from my job as I was not a full timer yet.

I got several jobs in the following 3 years, I worked in sales , account management and communication. The jobs were unrelated but I had to make some money as i mentioned things were really bad and covid hit as well so I was lucky to even being able to get a job then.

Last year I decided I needed to change something, i found a digital marketing and international commerce masters program in France in a very good school and I just finished my thesis and submitted it today.

I have no idea what do next, honestly the digital marketing aspect of the program is weak, I do not have a portfolio in digital marketing or prior experience to be competitive on the job market. I will be able to start applying to jobs hopefully in a couple of months, I need any advice about what career path can I pursue with my previous experience and academic background. I know degrees are not what used to be and that experience is 100 times more valuable than a piece of paper but the degrees were a way for me to get out of the vicious cycle I was in

I am also very passionate about research and academia I had my own business in university writing term papers and projects of all subjects so It came easy for me.

I have no idea where to go from here, Digital marketing seems unlikely, i was thinking business development or some other type of profession in business where a diverse professional and educational background can come in useful. Or maybe something in research ? or maybe try and do a doctorate yet I do not know the right path to do so.

I tried looking up career counselors and It hink this was my main problem , that I never had a clear objective but they are expensive and I heard so many negative reviews.

I would appreciate any help that you could give I swear you have no Idea how much I would take your opinion in consideration. What career part is the best from here?

1dqjlrz,Need to make a decision on a job offer ,"
Hi everyone,

I'm graduating at the end of August with a degree in economics, a year late due to gaining relevant work experience. I live in Ontario, where the job market for entry-level positions is quite challenging. Currently, I'm on a one-year contract as a business analyst intern, earning $45k annually. This role allows me to work remotely two days a week.

I've recently received a job offer for a procurement position with a salary of around $70k, which is a significant increase from my current pay. However, there are several factors to consider:

1. **Commute and Living Arrangements**: The commute for the new job would be 1.5-2.5 hours each way, depending on traffic. The only feasible way to manage this commute would be to move back in with my family. Alternatively, if I wanted to live in the city where the new job is located, either the company or I would need to pay around $16k a year for toll roads to reduce the commute to approximately one hour. My girlfriend and I are planning to sign a lease for an apartment in a different city next month, where my current job would be just a 50-minute drive away.

2. **Remote Work**: My current role allows for two days of remote work per week, while the new procurement position offers only one remote day per week.

3. **Job Security and Future Potential**: My current contract ends in four months, and I do not know if they will convert me to a full-time position. On the other hand, the procurement position offers a higher salary but comes with the challenges mentioned above. The salary potential for both roles is also a consideration, with the business analyst role potentially growing slower compared to the procurement position.

I'm facing a tough decision and would appreciate any advice on the following:

1. **Commute vs. Salary**: Is the higher salary worth the long commute and the need to move back in with my family? How do I balance the financial benefits against the personal and logistical challenges?
2. **Job Security**: Given the uncertainty about being converted to full-time in my current role, should I take the secure higher-paying job even if it means a tough commute?
3. **Living Arrangements and Remote Work**: How should I approach the decision about moving in with my girlfriend versus staying with my family to manage the commute? Also, how significant is the difference in remote work flexibility between the two roles?

1dqft4k,How to deal with a passive aggressive supervisor ,I just started a new job at a hospital. This is entirely new to me and I even told my interviewer who is now my supervisor the things that I would not know how to do but was told I would be trained. I work in the veterinary field for reference. I unfortunately got sick for a week and that kinda messed me up from going into work to continue my training. Once I came back a lot of things I forgot how to do.. So my supervisor has a meeting with me and tells me “im just gonna be completely transparent with you. you got sick and that held up your training process. All of my other Assistants that were im training got this stuff within 3 days.” and i just really felt like that was a little harsh to say because everyone learns differently. It’s been times where she has tried to show me her way to doing things and its honestly not the best and sometimes it leaves patients upset and no aggressive because of how she handled them. I decided to have a second meeting telling how how i felt and how i didn’t like that she called me out one day in front of the nurses asking me a question that i did not know. Her only response was that “well i didnt see it as calling you out.” ,Honest-Sea4096,1,1.0,3,1719567912,2024-06-28 09:45:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dqft4k/how_to_deal_with_a_passive_aggressive_supervisor/,6,2024

1dqddxf,"Considering grad school for bioengineering, need help","Hi guys, I'm a rising senior. I'll be applying for grad school and industry positions, hopefully accepted for Fall 2025. 

I want to go into medical device design, specifically in prosthetics.

I'm really debating even applying to graduate school. I don't know if I can handle the immense academic pressure I've heard about. I did a lot of stuff in college but have taken a long break from the grind after a rough second year so I fear I'm not good enough to even apply. A lot of stuff feels like it's one-off and led nowhere.

possibly important, trigger warning: I feel like I was doing great in school (3.8+) until >!I was raped!< in second year and had a knee surgery in third and then I basically spent a year not prioritizing classes. I'm happier now but at what cost 🙃

**stats**
- Current GPA 3.61, afraid it might fall

- Double major in math

- Minor in technological studies

- Will mentor two students next year for the whole year

- Resident assistant (RA) for two years

- TA three times: physics, chemistry, bio

- E-board of five clubs, most unrelated except engineering honor society 

- Did research in three labs, two for a year each (physics and synthetic biology) and one for two years (mechanical engineering). Have two scientific posters from this research that I presented at school symposiums. I was accepted to present at the BMES 2023 conference but I couldn't make the travel fee.

- No internships, which, I know, terrible. Literally had a recruiter at a school job fair tell me I had an OK resume but no internship, so they wouldn't consider me if I applied. There's a chance I'll get into an internship through my school in the fall.

- Worked as a medical assistant for 9 months, until the company got into some legal trouble and fired 15 people, me included :(

- Founded a club to raise awareness and funds for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Raised about $2k


**Possible letters of rec**
- Guaranteed great one for professor I TAed physics forin in freshman year.

- Guaranteed great one from the chair of my department who knows me very well through involvement in her club. I haven't done research with her, although her club was previously a research team. It became a club like two years ago. She counts it as research but idk if anyone else will

- Guaranteed one, probably generic, albeit OK,  from very very distinguished biology department chair. Did research with him for a year that is turning into a publication. 

- Guaranteed one, albeit OK, from other BME department chair. She doesn't know me that well.

- Guaranteed one, probably neutral and generic, from PI of lab I have worked for for two years in. She doesn't speak English very well and we haven't had much contact over that time.

Any thoughts on if I should apply to graduate school, any good ones for medical device design (I liked Cornell's MBeng) and if I can get in with this?

1dqczhc,Job search making me suicidal,"You know you’re desperate when you’re seeking feedback from Reddit. But that’s where I am. 
I’m turning 50 this year, even if everyone says I look like I’m in my 30s. I’ve been working since I was 12 years old in 1987. And I’ve never felt so hopeless in my life. 
I think I did all the “right” things - worked my way up from being a messenger, then an office assistant, administrative assistant, executive assistant (all this before I was even 25). Even though I was a talented young singer, my family was shit and never provided me any supper or security, thus working jobs all through HS and my first attempt at college. I eventually graduated with a Master’s degree in my mid-30s and pursued a career in media production (documentaries), and that’s where all hell broke loose. Nothing but headwinds and resistance. Now I’m in a new geographic market where there is very little creative opportunity, so I took a job in a newsroom for a pay cut that I knew from the beginning wouldn’t financially sustain me, in hopes that I’d find something better within a short period of time. Nearly two years and damn near 200 applications later, I’m running out of hope and time. I’m afraid every day that the eviction notice is coming, and I’ve been taken through cycles of multiple interviews and even CHECKING MY REFERENCES (humiliating!)before being passed over for production jobs that, frankly, I could do in my sleep.
I keep coming back to this same thought: if something doesn’t happen by my 50th birthday, I want to end it all. Otherwise I’ll be an old, broke bum, and I won’t be able to face myself in the mirror. 
I’ve been in and out of therapy since I was a teenager; I doubt that anyone can say anything I haven’t already heard. I’ve never known a day of security in my life due to my messed up family structure. My career is the WHOLE BALLGAME. Without it, I have no foundation on which to build a life. And I’m running out of time.
Idk exactly what I expect people to say to me here… maybe just wondering if other GenXers are in the same place. And also if maybe somebody can get me some Nembutal to make the exit easier. Because this feels…over.

1dqcxg5,"Parents' plan for me failed, no education, want to work a non-dead end job","Hello everyone! I need your help, I'll give some context.

I was born in South America. My family is military, and from a young age I was trained to become one too. I liked it, and at 16 I joined the military. When I turned 18, I started having medical problems that led me to leave the military. If I resolved them I could come back, but was taking years at this point and I went to my parents for advice, they told me to go the academic route.

I was never good at studying. I got into an university, I was lucky my parents let me choose whatever I want. I chose physics since I always liked science (also little competition to get into).

I thoroughly enjoyed the degree, but I was lagging behind. I started looking for regular jobs (waiter, retail, etc) but this was right around COVID which in my country was specially relentless lasting for over two years, and companies where dropping like flies. I was pushing 24 at this point.

I was tired of being financially supported by my parents, who were always good to me. I wanted to free them from the financial responsibility to me.

I moved to Paris and started a new life on my own. I am lucky that I was not yet 26 years old, so they have a lot of programs to support youngsters. In doing a 2 year degree on system and network administration. But the way the degree works here, I have to find an internship to validate it and I don't see that happening. I'm also lagging behind on the coursework.

That's it for context, now to my idea:

I speak 3 languages and can understand 6. 4 of these languages are very common here in Paris amongst tourists. My friend suggested I go into hotel reception, he said I'd be hired immediately. He's working at Disney Paris and he says they're always looking for people that speak my combo of languages. I guess I could work not only at Disney but at other hotels too. I was wondering if it's possible to evolve in this career and earn higher salaries that go considerably beyond minimum wage. I want to start a mortgage on my 30's and I want to not worry about money all the time.

I don't might working night shifts, I find them chill (did in military sometimes).

Thank you all for your attention and I wish everyone a great day.",Aggressive-Bath6420,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1719555587,2024-06-28 06:19:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dqcxg5/parents_plan_for_me_failed_no_education_want_to/,6,2024

1dqbxjo,Should i give up my dream career?,"Last spring, I discovered the real estate profession and realized that it’s something I truly want to pursue. I genuinely believe that with hard work and dedication, I could become good at it. I enjoy working with clients and I want my earnings to reflect the effort I put in. If you work hard and sell well, you earn well – you get the idea. The job seemed versatile and exciting, and even though I knew from the moment I decided to pursue this career that it would be incredibly challenging, I’ve always had the mindset, “If others can do it, so can I.”

Everything sounded perfect to me, and I learned as much as I could about the profession, the good and the bad. I improved my grades and did everything necessary to get into the real estate program. But just as I was ready to apply, I found out the program was discontinued.

My options were limited. I could ask real estate firms to finance my education, take individual distance courses (with no guarantee of being accepted into all required courses and no support system), or sell my apartment and move to one of three cities where the program is offered. However, I didn’t want to leave my boyfriend for three years to study far away.

I went through seven interviews at different real estate firms, but none were willing to finance an expensive education for a 22-year-old with no prior sales experience. So that option was out. I’ve now applied for some individual courses, but it feels uncertain since there are no guarantees I’ll be accepted. If I am accepted, I don’t know whether to accept the offer or not. I don’t want to end up with student loans only to realize I can’t continue next semester.

Moving to study also seems difficult. Student housing is hard to get, and you only receive the acceptance letter a month before the semester starts, which isn’t enough time to sell my apartment, find new housing in a new city, and move. Plus, as I said, I don’t want to leave my boyfriend or have a long-distance relationship. He’s willing to move with me, but then he’d need to find a new job in the new city too. It feels like there’s not enough time for all this, and then we’d have to move back again after three years. It’s all very overwhelming.

So here I am, back at square one, not knowing what to do except that I want to become a real estate agent. The only thing I know for sure is that I’d rather die than stay in my current job. Sometimes I feel like I can make it, but then it feels hopeless, like I should just give up on my dream. It feels like I’m stuck and that I’ll never become anything. I’m not even sure what kind of response I’m expecting; I guess I just needed to rant a little.",Agitated-Mind-4174,1,0.9900000095367432,2,1719551785,2024-06-28 05:16:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dqbxjo/should_i_give_up_my_dream_career/,6,2024

1dq9uka,Job uncertainty in China as an expat,"Hello everyone,

I am Italian and currently working in China. My contract with the local branch of an Italian multinational company is set to expire in September. I have a comfortable job with a relatively good salary. I am 50 years old and find it difficult to get employed in Italy (I've tried, not very convincingly, but I have tried). I have a young daughter in elementary school and a working wife (a fulfilling job but not a significant contribution to our family budget).

I am ""seconded"" to a local JV. This JV is in crisis, and it’s unclear if it will be relaunched, shut down, or acquired. Relations between the Chinese and Italian ownerships are strained, and there is no sensible industrial plan. Local HR and HR in Italy know nothing, and I believe them, even the CEO is unsure. There are few to no opportunities to be integrated into the local branch. Returning to Italy or transferring to another overseas office does not interest me. I am confident that my contract will be renewed unless this JV closes, which could happen soon.

I have been offered a position at a small and dynamic company (with its pros and cons, I know) in another city (not as nice as my current one, but acceptable). It’s a similar position but definitely more demanding and results-oriented in the short term. The job is more or less within my capabilities, but there is no room for error. They have been courting me for a year, but now time is running out, and they need to hire someone in the coming months for business reasons.

A. Should I buy time hoping the situation becomes clearer --> risking they find someone else?

B. Aim high with the salary (+30-50%?), make the leap and move the family in the coming months?

C. ????

1dq94s1,I was a cheerful person until my boss changed that.,"TLDR: My manager at work is incredibly incompetent and ignorant, and I suffer as a result.

Hi all. Looking for some advice / words of encouragement here. I've been with my current company for close to 2 years now. And yes, I'm actively looking for a new job but that process will take some time (plus my notice period is 8 weeks--I know!).

Long story short, I'm working under a manager who is severely lacking industry knowledge and have close to zero contributions to the team. Unfortunately, my manager's boss (the director of the company) is based overseas and trusts my manager to oversee things at the office that I'm at. They were friends (and as much as I hate to bring this up--of the same nationality). They are also a lot closer in age and share many background similarities, and in fact my manager got to the position that she is in thanks to their friendship (because my manager has no actual credentials for the role, really).

At first, her lack of competence & complete ignorance to what's going on around here didn't bother me. In fact, I used to enjoy it just for the fact that I'd prefer a detached/hands-off manager over a micro-managing one. However, over time the resentment within me started to grow. Due to her lack of competence, I end up having to do her work and (quite frankly) run things in this office, when I'm not paid nearly as much as her. Also, in terms of compensation, it is plain to see that my manager could enjoy unlimited PTO, get off work as early as 3pm to attend yoga classes or meet a friend for drinks in town, receive gas & grocery allowances, just to name a few. All of these benefits are not available to the rest of the team, who are clearly working 10x harder than she ever did. 

She also does a poor job as being a point of communication between our director & the local team here. She is just a resounding echo chamber, parroting whatever the director says without any valuable input of her own. When we go to her for advice/solution, she offers none and barely advocates for her team. Yet when we do an excellent job on certain projects, she would claim all the glory! Sadly the director has little to no visibility of all of these due to being based overseas.

My director used to compliment me and said she appreciated how cheerful I am, and the positive energy I bring to the team. Yet I feel like I barely have any of those left in me. I'm constantly tired, unhappy & increasingly resentful while desperately looking for a way out.

If anyone has had a similar situation, how did you deal with such manager while waiting for a better opportunity to come along? :(

1dq7syv,What do you advise for me? ,"

The truth is that, in a general sense, I would like to make more money. I’ve considered babysitting over the weekend as a way of making extra money. I make $19/hr as an assistant and aide for a child who has different needs. Recently, someone (a few years older than me) was hired as a floater (well, they’re going to be a lead in fall but are a floater right now so they can get used to how things work here, told me they have experience with older kids) and I’ve been trying to help them while the lead teacher has been out. Since we’ve been understaffed this week, a summer camp counselor has helped care for the child who has a different set of needs at points, as I want to ensure that the new facilitator feels supported. I started as a sub nearly a year ago, became an assistant in January, and have worked with the child who has a different set of needs for a little while. We discussed me potentially making $20/hr if I do well with the child who has different needs this month, but I’m not sure that it’ll happen (a lot has changed and the child will have a new aide next week.) I am a few years younger than the person who will become a lead, but must admit that I feel unappreciated and am wondering what exactly I should do. I know that since we’re understaffed this week, probably not the best time to have a discussion with my bosses. My school doesn’t require a college degree to become a lead. I must admit that it is difficult to work on improving at my job as an assistant teacher since the child who has a different set of needs can sometimes require more attention. I’m feeling very undervalued. 

Typically, I take college courses throughout the school year. This is partly why I started out as a substitute, in what was p close actually to August 2023, the became an assistant in Jan.

1dq77ct,I don't know what direction to go in career wise. Help!,"Thank you for taking the time to read my post.

A little about me: I have a half-completed degree in Business Managment with focus in Finance. I have worked in RIA's (investment brokerage firms) doing client management for 7 years. I feel like I hit a ceiling. My next move would be to get my series 7 and 65. This will allow me to be eligible for higher level position that pay much more (I reached $70,000 and my role does not go any higher than this) . I have no desire to manage investments myself. The highest I could go is an organization is operations manager. This is where I would manage the firms following of FINRA and SEC regulations for firms. I feel that my unfinished degree hinders my opportunities (even though you don't need a degree to do this kind of work, just common sense, naturally above average intelligence, and industry knowledge. Which I have but the world we live in still needs a thumbs up from an institution to confirm ).

I feel I am at a crossroads. Either complete my degree and get licensed. Or spend the next couple years switching careers. My sister is in IT and does very well for herself (even without any certifications)

Thinking of the future of our job market; I see computer science and IT staying in demand. I feel like I need to pivot to become valuable in our ever-changing job market.

So my question; have you personally or know of anyone who has benefited from a Computer science accelerated program? I see them advertised all the time. Do you know of a good one? I see companies needing individuals proficient in Oracle, SAS, Python etc. I think if I could have this education, I could still stay in the finance sector, but be eligible for more technical roles.

Any advice is welcome. Thank you!",danielle_blah,2,1.0,0,1719536343,2024-06-28 00:59:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dq77ct/i_dont_know_what_direction_to_go_in_career_wise/,6,2024

1dq6nhi,Why would someone get passed on a promotion twice when others were promoted?,"This specific person has been passed on a promotion twice. The promotion would just put them in a more senior title, but same role. We have two review cycles a year, so two times a year they are potentially eligible for a promotion. The pattern is usually you are eligible after being in your role for 1 year, and this person has been here for 2 and a half.

Normally I'd think it's because they are incompetent or can't do their job, but I've worked with them and they seem great. Easy to work with, they really know their stuff, meets deadlines, team player, etc.

Three other people on our team were promoted during the time she became eligible.

I heard her say that her feedback was she wasn't ready, but as a team member, I feel she is on par with our more senior colleagues.

A little background: I got this job after coming out of a 2 year depression which ironically was caused by me being unemployed. While I'm grateful for the job, the 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minute commute has taken a toll on my mental health to the point were I'm completely burned out. Commuting by bus doesn't matter as it takes the same amount of time (before I didn't have a car) and I've resorted to just waiting 30 minutes before I leave because the thought of driving home especially fills me with so much dread.  In my opinion/experience, I drive through an area with the worst drivers and I've almost gotten into several  accidents. I've even almost ran over a >!dead body!< once which was very scary.  

Recently came home after almost getting into another accident and I'm just kinda done. It's getting to the point where I'm really contemplating about quiting this job. I don't want to because I don't hate it; I just hate the commute. Is there anyway I can ask without sounding needy or coming across as whiny and ungrateful?

I enjoyed a pretty good education at a renowned school in Europe. I had an amazing time, did lots of different things and gained a lot of experience about life. But now this all ends and I don‘t know how I should continue. Life treated me good so far, I had some jobs, did well in school, have a healthy social life, loads of hobbies, some on a pretty professional basis, but none to build a career on. I got lots of different interests like economics, physics, engineering and much more but I don’t have “the one“ career in mind which many people my age have. I don’t know if I should do a year abroad or just find a job, do work and travel or just go to university, at home or abroad, idk. Part of that problem is that if I try I can succeed any class or profession (my experience so far), so there isn’t something that I am not ”capable“ of doing if I put a little bit of effort in, what I (if I care about something) do. I am not from a wealthy background so I would have to start earning money by myself very soon or I‘d need a scholarship. I believe that the world is open to me but I ain’t got no clue what to with that freedom.

1dq4wjr,Having doubts that I'll ever land an entry-level job in what I went to school for and I'm not sure what else to do.,"I'm 27 years old and graduated about 7 months ago. My major was in computer science. I was a naive student who only focused on grades so that I could graduate with a 4.0 GPA. I neglected to work on personal projects and do internships while in school. As it stands now, I have zero relevant work experience or internships to put down on a resume. The only things I have on my resume are my education/GPA, a skills section (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, tools), and some course projects. When I compare my joke of a resume with the ones I see online, It's no wonder why I haven't landed a single job interview in the last 7 months. I'm unqualified compared to the competition and I don't think I'll ever get an entry-level job because of this.

At this point, I feel like I have to pursue a different career path. I'm not opposed to pursuing something else, but I'm not sure what my options are. My college curriculum and school projects had mostly to do with programming and software development, which is the job role I've been applying for. I don't have anything else to put down on a resume. The only jobs I've had were in retail and hospitality, but these were not tech-related so I can't use them. There is also the fact that I have a huge employment gap I have to contend with given that I haven't had a job in 4 years!

If my resume is effectively blank for jobs people typically get out of college, then what else am I supposed to do for a career? As I see it, I might as well forget the fact that I have a degree. The only jobs I seem to be qualified for are in fast food and retail. Essentially, it feels like I can only get a $11-12/hour job that doesn't require a resume. However, even if I get a job at McDonald's, it will not give me the experience I need to put down on a resume for anything outside of the food industry. It seems like a dead-end job to make some money and I'll just be stuck at square one flipping burgers for the rest of my life.

I wouldn't even care if the job paid well enough to support myself. But given the fact that I'm almost 30 years old and still living with my parents, I have to move out eventually. I need to work towards something else that can offer me some kind of future to support myself. I just don't know where to begin with what I have going for me, which is basically nothing. I know some people will suggest the military, but I'm unfortunately not qualified given my mental health issues.

Due to the current state of the economy there have been employees that have been let go. During this time management decided to promote a few people internally instead of hiring. I was one such employee they offered a promotion to.

Essentially they wanted me to work in shipping and production throughout the week as demand ebbs and flows. This means I need to learn a whole new department, plus make sure orders get out in a timely manner all for less than 7% increase. I took the position under the guise that management wants me to learn more within the company, but after training in the new department I really feel like I got screwed.

Especially since a coworker with less seniority was given a higher up position that requires less work and more money for knowledge they dont have to expand upon, yet have to ask me questions about. I've given this company my all these last three years, even going as far to learn every position in the warehouse when it wasn't expected of me.

I feel incredibly stupid for accepting the promotion and am angry with myself.

1dq456m,Current company or Competitor?,"I work for the #1 Top Dog company of a new sort of business in the US (sorry, I can't go into more detail). Our #2 competitor is strong in China and decided to set up camp in Los Angeles and wants to poach me. 

- First phone call - I told them I'm not jumping ship for anything less that $100k. Recruiter said ""that's not a problem at all""

- They set up a meeting between me and their dpt head. It was a nice little chat. I was clear that I wanted the promotion to content lead. 

- Second phone call w/ recruiter - They offer me the title promotion to Content Lead from my current title. But their base salary is $84k, which is barely comparable to what I make now. So I obviously declined.

- Next day, recruiter texts me $93.6k. --> I mulled this over. It is a pay bump, but it wasn't high enough for that particular role. And the risks of going over to a foreign company setting up camp here whereas my current company is already established. Didn't seem worth it. I also felt a bit insulted by Chinese haggling tactics. (I'm American born Chinese) I declined after thinking about it for a day.

- 4 hrs later, recruiter texts me back $100k. 

  
**That's a sizable pay bump of $20k. Extremely tempting. Plus a title promotion.** 

  
PROS & CONS:

- Going with Competitor means being a founding team member. And GUARANTEED promotion.

- BUT, I'd be burning bridges with #1 Top Dog company that I'm currently at, and they are innovated and expanding faster than everyone else. I'm learning and acquiring a lot of skillsets here. Opportunity costs are different. Competitor is immediate promotion and pay bump, but I'm going to bet that Current Company will remain #1 Top Dog, so might be more longterm growth?

- Competitor wants to poach me for my insider knowledge of #1 Top Dog company, but I also worry that I will become disposable once I share that knowledge

- Current company is also more American which I prefer. And I'm already comfortable with them, have all my benefits set up with them, etc...

**I am sorta ""leveraging"" this $100k offer with my current company to see if I can get anything better than my current salary.**

- I haven't gotten anything concrete yet, unfortunately. My manager says she will talk to higher management. Her attitude makes me believe that she wants to keep me. But I would prefer something more concrete than promises of raises, rev share, bonus that are all ""based on performance"". She did say that they are also opening an office in LA and will also need team leads. But that's not guaranteed promotion from the sounds of it. Everything sounds like stringing along so far.

I plan to work full time until next summer to save up enough money to return to school and pursue a second bachelor's degree in computer science.

- Offers promotions after 6 months and about $5k in tuition reimbursement after 12 months.

- Open to exploring different departments based on my interests.

- Commute is 40 minutes to 1 hour.

- Schedule: 8-hour shifts, Monday to Friday, leaving afternoons free for studying.

- Would need to go part-time in school while working full-time to get tuition benefits, which I'm okay with.

\*\*Company B:\*\*

- Has a great reputation and is a large aerospace company where I could see myself as a software engineer in the future.

- Does not offer tuition reimbursement, meaning I'd likely leave before next fall and need a part-time job while in school.

- Commute is 20 minutes.

- Office environment is welcoming with a nice culture.

- Schedule: 12-hour shifts, 4 days a week, which might be challenging to combine with studying.

What do you think would benefit my situation more? My initial leaning is towards Company A for the tuition reimbursement, but Company B offers a shorter commute and potential for future growth in the aerospace industry. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

1dq3bki,Did y'all ever have those bad feelings...?,"When I was in high school, i always used to overthink about if I wanted to major in accounting or finance. I eventually came to the conclusion that I wanted to choose accounting due to the many benefits of the degree such as the high risk-reward ratio (very hard major to a nearly recession proof job).

By my senior year I started to doubt myself. I began to think that accounting would be too hard for me, and that my average GPA would drop. In high school I had a 3.97 un-weighted GPA and a 4.7 weighted. I knew in the back of my head that once most people got into college, their grades would drop. I knew that to get an accounting internship you should aim for at least a 3.0 GPA average but I wanted to be in the honors college, so I knew you needed a 3.5 average for most colleges. I hated the thought of me potentially going from a 4.0 student to one that always gets mostly B's in college. The good news is I've gotten far past that once I got to college.

However,there is something I began to worry about once I passed the ""grade phase"". I began to worry that I won't retain any information to become an accountant. I was afraid I would go into an internship like a complete fool and forget everything I needed to know. Sometimes I feel that way thinking about once I graduate and become an actual accountant (I've finished my internships already).

Have any of you went through feelings like this, or similar? I mean this for any career btw, not just accounting. ",Irielay,1,1.0,0,1719525331,2024-06-27 21:55:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dq3bki/did_yall_ever_have_those_bad_feelings/,6,2024

They never responded. Then I followed up this morning again, saying I forgot to ask what the schedule is like.

They didn't respond to that either. In general they seem to be using a throwaway they don't check often.

1dq1mu9,Managing up a highly sensitive leader ,"I work at a nonprofit, in the education department at a homeless shelter to be exact. So you can imagine the type of people this kind of work attracts. All of my colleagues are highly empathetic and everyone spends a lot of time caring about how other people are feeling. Normally, I don't have an issue with this, I want to work with people who see everyone as real people, regardless of their situation. It's one of the reasons I left the general classroom to come here. I run a very small department, there are only 2 employees under me. I work closely with my manager (one level above me), and my director (two levels above me) is extremely present.

I am struggling with working with my director. She is very quick to completely derail a conversation to be about a problem she has had, or is having. It's usually one of 4 things, and it happens at every. single. meeting. 
Yesterday, we were discussing hiring someone for my team, and she went on a monologue about a conversation from her senior leadership retreat where someone asked about her goals for the program. She calls this the ""hot seat."" It is always the exact same story, told the same way, with the same questions being asked. Doesn't matter what answers she gets, it will happen again in a matter of days. & often it doesn't feel like the story has ~anything~ to do with the current issue at hand. 
It feels like she is constantly trying to emotionally process situations that have occured. If she doesn't like someone's response she'll be quick to accuse them of having ""unresolved biases against our families"" regardless of whether or not that is the case or an appropriate response. (it feels like projection as she comes from a very privileged background)

It has gotten to the point where it feels like nothing gets done. She wants to be involved in everything that happens in the department, but involving her means that we have to have multiple conversations about a decision when a decision could just be made. & now it feels like every decision is going through emotional scrutiny in order to be made. We will have meetings as leadership for our department and not even touch the agenda because she is talking about the same 4 things. & if someone tries to steer the conversation back to the topics trying to be discussed, she will just go right back to what she was doing. My manager (above me, directly below the director) feels the same as I do, and we are not sure how to get back on track when this happens. 

It's driving me insane, anyone have advice?",LoraleiRose,1,1.0,0,1719521015,2024-06-27 20:43:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dq1mu9/managing_up_a_highly_sensitive_leader/,6,2024
1dq165p,Work experience for medicine,"Hi, so I’m in year 10 (doing my GCSE’s next year), and i’m kinda worried about the extra curriculars that aren’t required but are normally expected. I don’t have any extra curriculars like sports of instruments. Because of some reasons, I don’t think that’s on the table for me (as of right now)

Yesterday I had a work shadowing day in school and I worked at a pharmacy for 5 hours (watching and helping out a dispensary, as well as talking to the pharmacist). I thought the pharmacy would be a good start as it is closely related to medicine, but I was told a few times by people working there that they are very different. Now I’m not even sure if that experience is relevant. I also went at my mum’s work and she taught me how to work the till-I did that for 2 hours, but once again that’s not really relevant to medicine.

I’m wondering what I can do to help boost my applications for college and uni as I can’t seem to find anything that will help. I’ve spoken to two charities to volunteer at as well as a café for a job, but they all require you to be 16+. 

Some things I’ve done are:
1. DofE bronze (i have chosen not to do silver which i kinda regret)
2. I’m a student librarian in my school and have been doing it for about 2 years now
3. I’m doing KPMG Future Leaders Technology programme, but I’m not sure how useful that will be to medicine
4. I’ve applied to be a well being ambassador for school (haven’t heard back yet)

I’’m considering asking the pharmacy I did my work experience at for a part time job or at least volunteering over the summer, but I feel like it’s too late now as my chance was yesterday and it seems awkward to go back in solely to ask for a job, plus my dad is friends with him so I don’t want him to do it out of obligation and jeopardise they’re friendship. I’m also most likely going to apply for school council/charity rep for Yr 11, but that will have to be done in September.

1dq0fwo,Wage Negotiation !! Help !!,"Coming to reddit for ask what you all would do if you were in my situation ... \*typing this quick as  i need opinions quickly.\*

  
I (25F) am currently an operations manager for a nearly 2 year old luxury fashion company. I have had warehouse and managerial experience for 5 years before I took on this role (+forklift cert/bachelors degree). When I started I had someone here as, essentially, my equal (she made 40k for reference). My current role entails managing all customer service, all of receiving and all of web fulfillment. I also handle product upload as well as logistics management (prep, set up and operating the events) for pop up events typically once a month which includes traveling anywhere in the country. I also manage e-commerce photoshoots that are typically once a month out of state in NY. I also now manage 1 intern and 1 full time employee who make $21/hr (60 cents less than me). Essentially I manage all of the essential  functioning parts of the company alone. 

I am currently salaried at 45k. Since working here I have received one bonus in January in a lump sum of $3500 (which is great at the moment, but am currently on the same as when I was hired, just doesn't do much in the long run). I currently just had my bi-annual review that went extremely well from a performance standpoint, however their offer feels low. They offered me 46.8K (technically a 4% raise) This doesn't even add up to 36 more dollars a week and is less and a dollar an hour. 

When they broke it down they put my entire healthcare included in my salary which is not true (they pay half and I pay half). I also am commuting 300 miles a week to manage the warehouse (now with a broken ankle as well for the next 6 weeks lol). Our past intern had half the commute and they bumped his hourly to include the mileage in his wage. 

I don't want to be the person constantly comparing/complaining, however I find it unfair when I put my whole heart and efforts into this job and I am not seeing the pay out anymore. I don't want to seem ungrateful or as if i'm complaining, but I can barely afford to live off what I make between all of my bills. To put it further into perspective one of their purchase orders a month is the same (if not 10K+ more) than my yearly salary. In my head you'd think the management of your company is worth just as much as one product buy. Idk i always gaslight myself into thinking im asking too much, but really all i'm asking for is a living wage. 

  
Any advice on how to go about asking for that/what you think is a fair ask would be greatly appreciated I have been sitting with this for months and don't know what to do. I genuinely love the owners and don't want to leave but i'm not sure the struggle is worth my mental health anymore if I could do a FT associate position elsewhere for the same amount.

I honestly don’t really like the company, but it has allowed me to grow professionally. I started out as an HR intern, then became the Marketing Assistant at my university. 

Within the past couple of months, I was given the opportunity to move to another state and join a leadership acceleration program to build my managing skills and learn business functions. However, when I interviewed for this position, the hiring manager didn’t give me time to talk at all and the interview went on for an hour. He also made it quite clear that because I’m a woman, he would hire me. The interview gave me a gut feeling that I shouldn’t accept the job if I got an offer.. I ended up accepting the offer because the job market sucks right now and it’s decent pay for straight out of university. On my first day, he told me that a previous person in my role was sexually assaulted by upper management and got pregnant. This being brought up made me extremely uncomfortable. 

Fast forward a month and I am so lost as to what my role is. When I applied to this job, I was under the impression that it was a marketing role, however, it’s not even close to what I applied for.

1dpycql,"Should I pursue an MPA, MBA or something else entirely?","I begin a Master’s program for Public Administration in August, but is that the best choice for me? 

I currently work for a nonprofit that works with county government as the communications specialist, basically the PR person. I enjoy my job but it does not pay well at all, we’re a small office (4 full time employees) despite overseeing 45+ counties and their elected officials. 

I’d like to further my career in politics or even the nonprofit realm but to do that I need to have a Master’s degree. My bachelor’s is in Journalism with a concentration in Strategic Communications. I have been out of school for 5 years. 

With an MPA it will supposedly help me land management positions for nonprofits, cities, government offices, HR departments, etc.
And that sounds like everything I would like to do but I don’t know if it’s realistic. 

I have been told to consider an MBA because it’s more versatile and would lead to higher salary opportunities, but the accounting courses are intimidating to me. I am terrible with math and even my friend who is an accountant that just earned her MBA said the class isn’t easy. 

The other option is Master’s of science in Human Resources, my best friend has a degree in that and she makes great money. I didn’t realize until recently how much money is in the HR career path, I know you shouldn’t pursue something just for the money but I’m tired of being paid $40k.

1dpxy6c,Changing to cybersecurity - need advice,"Hello all,
I (29 M) have been trying to get a job as a security analyst for quite a while now. I’m trying to do a career change to cybersecurity from software engineering. A bit about me, I have my degree in Computer Science, I’m working on obtaining 3 certifications currently: Network+, Security+, and CEH from CompTIA. I’m on course to get them done in the next 3 months, but time is running out for me. I have about 6 years of experience in Software Engineering and my past 3 years, I actively helped patch code security vulnerabilities. This is kind of minor but it did benefit the company. I have all of this on my resume.

I’m currently doing HTB and am on starting point Tier 2 and hopefully ill be able to start doing retired easy machines next week.

I’m having a very rough time finding a job that will give applicable experience. I’m not applying to senior level roles even, entry level and internship and just getting denial after denial coming in. I really dont care what im getting paid at this point just as long as i can get a job that will teach me the skills i need to advance in the field.

I hope to have a job soon, I quit my last job because i was being treated poorly and have been relying on savings.

I’m considering joining the army and doing anything cybersecurity related there. Thoughts?

What else should I be doing? Are there any companies that you recommend I apply to? Do I need to start on the phones to get into this field?

Thanks.

30 min commute one way. Driving in inclement weather is very scary to me.

1dpxi9t,Seeking Advice: Transitioning to International Remote Work Due to Low Salary and Burnout in Italy,"Hello everyone,

I'm reaching out to get some advice on moving my career to the international remote job market. I'm 32 years old and currently earning €1420 per month, which is becoming increasingly unsustainable for me, especially considering the cost of living here in Italy.

Over the past three years, my tech stack has included Python, XML, and JavaScript, primarily working with Odoo, an ERP system. I also have about four years of experience developing web applications in PHP and have worked with Next.js on several projects. I have extensive knowledge of WordPress CMS platform, to the point of creating plugins and custom core modifications multiple times. I'm well-versed in MySQL, Postgres and some NoSQL database systems. Additionally, I speak three languages fluently, English, Spanish and Italian.

The low salary is taking a toll on me, and I'm experiencing burnout, largely due to the financial stress. I believe my skills and experience would be valued more in the international market, and I'm eager to find a remote position that offers better compensation and work-life balance.

I would greatly appreciate any advice or resources on how to transition to remote work opportunities abroad, especially in companies that value and fairly compensate their developers.

My partner is long term sick with long COVID and has no income so we'd struggle with just student loan. I also really dislike uni as a mature student and I know degrees aren't that important in tech.

1dpx2t9,Torn on whether I should take a sub-par job or stay unemployed,"I graduated last year and was given a junior business analyst job at some company. The office was nice and the benefits were standard (good amount of PTO, insurance) but were only available after three months. I left that company after about 8 months due to the toxic culture and it was mentally damaging me. 

I've been struggling to find work for a little over two months now. I interviewed at a much smaller company and I was given an offer with a little bit of a pay bump from my previous job, but the offer as a whole doesn't seem too competitive. 

- No WFH at all 

- 1 hour UNPAID and MANDATORY lunch, so the work day is 9-6, lunch is NOT provided either 

- office is small and the headcount isn't that great either, the place doesn't seem to be too organized 

- I will be only getting 1 day of PTO for my first year   
- 401k is 4%, medical dental and vision insurance available after 3 months, 401k enrollment after 6 months

I definitely do not think of staying here long if I do, and I really want to look for a place that's more 'standard' but I don't have any offers lined up. I've only had recruiters ghost me, and I got a recruiter call for a company I would love to work for through a friend's referral but I feel like lowkey I might be getting ghosted from that as well. 

I have until tomorrow to respond, but I'm torn on whether or not I should just suck it up and go for the experience early in my career or just try and look for a better opportunity. 

Any advice appreciated, thank you so much. ",canofcoke_w0w,1,1.0,7,1719509635,2024-06-27 17:33:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dpx2t9/torn_on_whether_i_should_take_a_subpar_job_or/,6,2024

1dpw7ww,Seeking Career Advice: Consulting vs. AI/ML Paths?,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently in the process of figuring out my career path and would love some insights. Recently, I've come across consulting roles, particularly at firms like BCG, offering base pays around $100k. Can anyone confirm if this is accurate for fresh graduates, especially those pursuing an MS in Data Science? Speaking of which, while my degree leans towards IT, I'm not particularly keen on pursuing AI/ML due to my skill level in that area.

For those in consulting, what are the essential skills needed to secure a well-paying job? Are there specific projects I should highlight on my resume? Also, what does a consultant in business or tech actually do day-to-day? I'm still exploring my career path and would appreciate any advice or experiences you can share.

As for my skills, I'm proficient in Excel, SQL, and basic Python, with substantial leadership experience as a club president, student ambassador, and blockchain TA.

1dpvwg0,Career and Financial Protection in a Growing Startup,"I am at a director level at a startup private equity company.  The company has taken off and there are no signs of slowing down.  I am coming up on a review and I need to formulate a plan on how I can set myself up for future protection.  My worry is that the company will sell within the next 2-4 years and who knows what that will mean for me.  If it doesn’t sell, I would guess we would go public.  Since I am not an executive, I am not fully aware of internal discussions but I have heard that the two scenarios are real possibilities if our growth continues. I have done my part and can confidently show how I have helped the company grow.  I also have the support and backing of the executive team.

With that information, what is my best route here?  I already get paid a very decent salary so going for a dramatically higher salary, makes me only feel like more of a target if we were acquired or if “trimming the fat” needs to happen before being acquired.  I am thinking that I would need to discuss profit sharing or some type of contract to protect me if we were acquired.  I don’t know anything about this topic so I want to prepare myself as much as possible to ask for the correct things without asking too much and negatively impacting my relationship with the exec team.  I appreciate any advice. ",Life-Ask7617,1,1.0,0,1719506739,2024-06-27 16:45:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dpvwg0/career_and_financial_protection_in_a_growing/,6,2024
1dpvdyf,Are these bridges already burnt?,"I have always believed in leaving companies on good terms by providing a sufficient notice period. However, I feel that the company I currently work for does not merit that courtesy, and here's why.

I have been with this company for almost a year, and the environment has been overwhelmingly negative. My colleagues are pessimistic and frequently speak bad of others (my boss, same colleagues they are friends with, myself, etc.). Throughout my time here, I have been belittled by my peers, my boss, and even those who report to me. Despite this, I have consistently shown respect and kindness to everyone to keep my reputation as professional I can, even when they treated me poorly, because my focus has been on my work, not on making friends.

During my tenure, I have been systematically excluded from both professional and social activities. For instance, my colleagues often go out for drinks or get food for everyone but me. They inquire about everyone’s day and say goodbye to everyone except me. This exclusion has made it clear that I am not welcome, creating a toxic and very snakey work environment.

Given these circumstances, I have sought other employment and received a job offer (pending the signing of papers). While I have always believed in giving a two-week notice to avoid burning bridges, in this case, the bridges have already been burned. Therefore, I am considering giving the shortest possible notice so my mental and physical health are back to normal.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this approach. Do you think I am taking the right course of action?

1dpulm6,Advice with sales managers ,"I'm not sure in terms of the flair as to what to put simply because they all seem to fit in this area. This is my second month in car sales and I truly love it. The one thing that is rather big hurdle is through the week there is a couple days where we have one SM, and the one for Thursdays is rather difficult to work with. What I'm meaning is he doesn't give much to go off of and in some cases won't bother helping in terms of neg equity. Or if there's a nother option as opposed to the other sm that I've gotten every deal except two this month with and, gives me alot more resources and tools to work with.

The big thing that I'm needing help with is evaluating trade ins, because right now only the SMS or the GM can but ive had several people walk away because they take too long when they want a ball park number.

From this I'm just trying to find a tool or maybe a idea of how I could do a ballpark or atleast a idea of how to go about these. When my SM said to me ""I can't it'll be a while have them come back"" when my other usually says ""keep em entertained and I'll be out shortly"" and usually he's swamped due to the cdk downage. My main priority is to make customers happy and have a good experience. (Which I've had several good surveys come stating that.) And I don't want them to leave not because of a sale but because they had a bad experience and time was wasted when I feel like I could do something to fix that or atleast close that gap.

I understand it sounds odd and possibly over thinking this in a sense but I was just wanting some ideas from some seasoned sales people out there if possible.

I wanted to share my journey and seek some advice from those experienced in Supply Chain Management (SCM). I have an undergraduate degree in architecture and completed a year-long internship in the field. During this time, I found the work environment to be highly stressful and often depressing. The constant changes in designs, the subjective nature of the work, and the low salary made me reconsider my career choice.

After my internship, I worked at an e-commerce company in an auditing role. While my tasks weren’t directly related to SCM, my department was involved in the last mile of the supply chain. This experience sparked my interest in SCM and logistics.

I'm excited to share that I've been accepted into a Master's program in SCM at a university starting soon. As I prepare for this new chapter, I’m eager to hear from those already in the field.

1dps0u2,No raise with a promotion? ,"I’ve been in my current position for 2 years now at a small-ish company. I generally like it here, and I haven’t found any comparable jobs for me in my city (I always keep an eye out, why not). My supervisors have now both told me that I’ve been doing well, and that they think I can handle more and they’re trusting me to take on more responsibilities from their plates now. They asked how I felt about this, and let me know this would likely come with a new job title, as well. They said this will be the path for me to “grow in the company”, so I was excited about this and accepted. Their vote of confidence in me and prospect of a new (better) title made me see this as a promotion, so I assumed that would come with a raise. 

Now, I’ve never asked for a raise here (we all get small annual COL salary boosts), and I decided now was my chance to go ask the big boss since I’m getting transitioned to this new role (and it’s been 2 years!). He didn’t say yes or no, he just said “yeah it’s been long enough where we think you can handle more, so we’ll see how you do and go from there”.

Am I wrong to be a bit disappointed in this? Is this the usual corporate protocol LOL? If my supervisors think I’ll be good in this, why do we have to “see how I do”? How would you proceed in following-up later on this? Thanks in advance!

1dprtj1,Work Projects on LinkedIn?,"Im currently working on my LinkedIn presence and would appreciate thoughts here. 
Back in October our company podcast had a 50th Episode & Four Year Anniversary Campaign. I created all the Graphic Designs, Helped with the copy, and drafted the pitch to past guests. They created videos or sent audio saying a few words which was nice. 

In the past, I would re-tweet announcements to my personal X account and my boss was cool with it. He even engaged with these re-tweets. I’m not sure if showcasing and explaining the publicity posted campaign on LinkedIn would be appropriate? I would add it to my projects.

1dprmkc,Between two job offers,"Between two job offers 

Hello everyone,

I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in HR management (05/2024) and reside in NYC. I've been fortunate to receive offers for two summer internships post-graduation:

1. The first internship opportunity is with a prestigious law firm. They offered me a full-time internship for the summer with the possibility of part-time continuation into the year. They haven't guaranteed a full-time position post-internship.

2. The second internship is with the MTA for the summer only. During interviews, recruiters expressed a strong interest in hiring interns after the internship concludes, highlighting excellent benefits.

I accepted both internships out of caution. I started the first internship on June 3rd, and while it's been great, the uncertainty about future prospects bothers me.

The MTA internship is set to begin on July 8th, so I need to decide whether to withdraw from the MTA internship or the law firm internship.

I want to make the best decision without letting anyone down. Any advice? Both internships focus on talent acquisition.

Thank you!",fvo96,1,1.0,1,1719495828,2024-06-27 13:43:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dprmkc/between_two_job_offers/,6,2024
1dprmkm,"I hate my job, I’m 30 this year and I want to start over - advice?","Hi. So, I hate my job. I work in the U.K. in public health. I’m paid £31k before tax, straight out of uni (I only started my degree in my late 20s and graduated last year). I actually switched courses to do public health (the irony). But, all we do is have the same meetings over and over again like it’s Groundhog Day. Our work rarely translates into any significant change nor does it help anyone. We have no budget and no power. We write reports, they get filed away, nothing happens or changes. No one at a senior levels seems to know what they’re doing, having sidestepped into their roles with no public health experience or background. I’m sick of the misinformation or loose evidence bases being used for their own agendas. I’m bored most days and feel like a fraud the rest.

So, what I’d like advice on (though I’ll take any perspective at this point) is:
1. Is there anyone working in public health where this isn’t the case? Is it just my team/department that are this rubbish?
2. Does anyone have experience re-specialising at 30+? Would you recommend it? Any regrets?
3. If I did change careers/vocation, what would you recommend I look into? I’m open to any suggestions (I’ve recently been looking at trades).

I’m creative, I like academics but suck at stats, I’m not opposed to hard work or working outdoors. As long as I’m no longer a bureaucrat. I just want to enjoy my job, that or earn a wedge so it’s worth the rapid deterioration of my soul.

1dpr97n,My old employer versus new employer,"Hi everyone, looking for a bit of advice here..

In May I was laid off from my job, I was very surprised and so was my boss, and his boss as well - some state budget cuts, etc. My bosses have been very involved in trying to get me back into the company in a different role. 

A few weeks ago I accepted a similar role with a smaller boutique company. I work in beverage distribution. The smaller company has only about ~30 employees, is family owned, and I’ve known the sales reps in the company for some time and they all seemed very happy and satisfied with the company. One sales rep already left and that’s whose position I’m filling, they moved on to a larger company. The second rep is leaving in a few days and has been training me, they’re going to a remote job to have more time at home with kids.

A week ago my old company, large nation wide company, called me about a management position. It’d be similar to my old role, but on a different team and I’d be the sales manager.

I feel very confident I will get an offer, and I’m torn between going with them or sticking it out with the newer, smaller company.

Pros of staying with the smaller company:
-great territory, great product, lots of autonomy, tons of opportunity for growth in the coming years if all goes well.
-all commission, no cap

Cons:
-no dental, vision, 401k (I’ve been told this would change when company gets larger)
-not great communication from “HR”. Haven’t done any paper work ( I officially officially start next week)
-previous rep mentioned tax issues one year and had to pay back ~5k at tax return


If I were to decide to leave the small company, I’d be destroying a bridge because both of their senior sales reps just left, I was their replacement, so I’d feel awful. I’m very much the mind of person to not feel bad about personal/business decisions, I usually think the company would be okay without me. But this is a very small company and it’d definitely be a huge blow to them.

I’m also hesitant about going back to my old company. I’d have a different boss, and a LOT more responsibility managing a team, meeting expectations, etc. but it’d come with significant more pay, incentives, and all the benefits missing from the smaller company.

Bit of background.. income is not an issue, it’s more of a work/life balance thing. But I’ve also never been solely on commission. Wife earns good money, but is skeptical of the smaller company.

Guess I’m looking for any advice from someone who’s had to make similar decisions in situations.",khajiit_has_coin,1,1.0,0,1719494808,2024-06-27 13:26:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dpr97n/my_old_employer_versus_new_employer/,6,2024
1dpr4yx,Suddenly being required to commute hours per week after office relocation with no compensation -- how should I approach this situation?,"I work in outside sales at a local office not far from my house. Been there for many years and usually work remote, would travel into the office a couple times per week typically. When I took the job, those were the terms I agreed to. They're restructuring and shuttering my local office, and now I'm being re-assigned to an office that is close to 50 miles each way and with traffic well over an hour. Initially HR told me they would be flexible with my traveling to the new office, but of course after speaking to the manager there, that quickly became an expectation that I will commute in at least once per week and ""maybe"" be able to call in virtually once per month. They told me I'll now be able to sell into that area since I'm assigned there, so it makes business sense for me to be there...but the issue is we cannot claim mileage for traveling to other offices -- only if we have client meetings. We receive no company vehicles and no monthly gas stipends. So in a nutshell, I'm now going to be spending close to 3hrs round trip on a weekly basis with a good amount of wear and tear (and gas money) driving to an office when I could easily just call in for those meetings virtually. Not to mention I have pets at home that will now need to be let out by someone since I'll be getting home late, so that's extra $ too. When I expressed these concerns, I was basically told ""we'll figure it out later"" and not to worry about it, but I wasn't satisfied with that answer. I'm already expected to start coming in starting next month.

I don't know how to handle. Considering there were massive re-orgs I was initially just glad to still be employed, but the more I think about the principle of this it really bothers me. I don't know whether I should make a fuss about this and bring up my concerns again and potentially escalate, or just keep my head down for now and wait until I've made the commute a few times before raising objections, so it doesn't seem like I'm just being non-cooperative from the start.

I’m the main engineer, there are a couple others but none actually have a degree and are smart but generally couldn’t find their way out of a paper bag. 

So, two years in…. I am now the “catch all”. ANYTHING that is even remotely out of anyone’s day to day routine gets sent to me. I’m over it. Now even receiving is dropping boxes on my desk when they don’t know who to give them to. Accounting sends me other peoples invoices they receive when they don’t know what/who its from and expect me to figure it all out. I have to be the contact for ALL outside parties. I have to manage all projects. I have to solve everything no matter how small the issue. I could go on but you get it….

1dpqoma,Post-startup career advice - ok to leave parallel roles off resume?,"I ran a startup as a chief executive officer for about 6 years, in parallel with a full time job (which kept food on the table but was an individual contributor engineering role). We shut down the startup. When I was applying for new roles after we shut it down, the only responses I seem to get or recruiter cold calls/emails I get, are for technical engineering roles. 

Would it be ok for me to completely leave those full time engineering roles off my resume in order to showcase and not distract from my executive role in the startup and better placement for Director+ roles in the corporate world? The dates fully overlap FYI, so I would not be leaving gaps on my resume. The only difference is that the startup was a fractional role and the individual contributor engineer jobs were full time, else my family would have starved.

Since I’ve been hired I’ve also been assigned to edit a weekly podcast with a tight turn around time of less than 10 hours, I make lots of social media clips, and various other miscellaneous projects.

Now I’m worried they will cut back hours to under 30 to rid me of health benefits.
Feeling quite nervous now, everything I’ve read about companies switching to hourly is never in the interests of paying the employees more, I know they are removing salary positions to avoid paying whatever the legal salary minimum is, which I definitely don’t make.

1dpp5b3,Getting…touched at work?,"I (19F) had worked at this place a few months back after securing $18/hr with them. It was a small construction business of 5 ppl with a straight older married couple as the owners. I picked it because they seemed nice, and I needed whatever job I could find. 

Not long into me being there, the owner (56M) started being really “friendly” with me, trying to promote me rapidly to higher positions, offered a fantastic salary etc…meanwhile with little to no experience on my end. 

Although he never explicitly asked for anything in return, ifykwim, he started asking for long hugs more often and would inconveniently place his hand over my ass while doing so, would come from behind me and hug me or whisper in my ear while walking by “I should slap that ass!”. He even went as far to say in front of other (male) employees that he should use me for sex sales bc I’m attractive and “sex sells better”.  

I got fed up with it one day when i went into (the only available) bathroom, and he walked in on me even though I could have sworn I locked and double checked the lock on the door. He winked at me when I saw him next and made the remark “don’t worry darling I didn’t see nothin on you that I hadn’t seen before”. 

I know I can say something to him, but I’ve been SAd before by my ex and uncle, I already feel like my body doesn’t belong to me and that more ppl care more for my body than who I am. But I just become speechless and let it happen, like my body just freezes out of terror.

1dpn5qb,Career path for a Field Service Engineer?,"Hey all,

Sorry for the long post but I really need some guidance and vent a bit...

I am a 29M and living in Germany as an immigrant. I have been working in the Semiconductor Industry (Ultra High Vacuum Systems, mainly PVD and CVD) for the past 2 years as a field service engineer. As you can imagine, I am like a ""that IT guy"" where I respond to our customer's trouble related to our product and solve them onsite.

I have a master's degree in STEM from Germany and a bachelor's degree in engineering from South Asia. During my master's, I worked on testing the potential of some biodegradable polymers for sustainable packaging using Ultra High Vacuum systems. The system was pretty effed up because of the long gap during CORONA. So, I basically had to repair and maintain the whole system from the ground up and I ran tests to check how tough are those materials for practical applications.

So, when I got this job even before my graduation, I was happy. Mainly because I really needed the money as I was broke and it was kind of a match with what I did during my master's. The job itself does not require much knowledge; if you have intermediate knowledge about PC, sensors, valves etc. then you can do it. Nothing too hard, too challenging.

One thing is, it requires you to work in a lot of weird position while wearing a full bunny suit in the fab. I mean, you have to twist, squat, lie down, bend etc for a long time. That was OK for me up until last year when I got a leg injury.

I suffered a 2nd degree, partial tear of ATFL on my right ankle. Now, this job becomes too painful every day and I am measurable after 5 pm..

Also, the brainlessness in this job is killing me slowly. I mean, there is no real progress and all you do is to just follow some manuals and do what is written there. No way to really learn something and make something. I feel I am doing something without needing to know why I am doing this. I feel this is not what I did my master's for. I mean I have seen people working here who passed high school and are smart enough to know about hardware and software. So, I think my ability to think, create, solve and apply something, for which I worked so hard for the past 18 years during my studies, are going down the drain here.

So, I need some help to find out what is suitable for me in future. I do not want to stay in this type of job where I harm my health. I know my ankle is never gonna fully heal because right after the injury I had to work 10 hours in a mostly squatting position for 12day straight. Also, I really want to apply my knowledge and thinking to make something meaningful just as I learned during my academic life. Not just following some 25 years old Japanese manual translated using DeepL in a fab.

Today, I was offered a choice between a full-time or part-time contract at my current school. If I accept, I fear my dreams of a fashion career may fade. I'm torn between following my heart and being realistic, as I know pursuing a completely different field at this stage could be a waste of time.

1dpm9y6,Career Change for a person with a major of marine engineering,"Hello 👋🏻 I need some help/advice for my man. 

He graduated BS Marine Engineering as his major in college. He is now onboard on an international tanker ship and been telling me lately how hard things have been for him. He made a decision to just finish the contract and no longer pursue that kind of work as he feels like it is not for him and wants to change his whole career. 

Are there any chances that he can land other works that wouldn’t mind his college major? Normal/Average paying jobs that can support himself. If so, can y’all suggest some work/career that is buildable from scratch.

My time in this company has been miserable for only one reason, my salary.

It is too fucking low, I make just 15% more of a new hire and I'm unfortunatly too shy to ask for a raise. But I thought this might be the chance.

I've tried to ask for one on more than one occasion by speaking to my supervisor and hr, but it always ended up with nothing more than empty promises.

How can I take advantage of this situation and approach my CEO about the topic?

1dpkkpu,Should I be this stressed about my job 4 weeks in ,"@[xboxhobo](https://www.reddit.com/user/xboxhobo/)

Hey man, it's me again. Just wanted to check in again after a few weeks of starting my job. So far I have mixed emotions about everything. Sometimes I feel like I don't fit in and sometimes it feels like I'm barely making the cut. I feel like I haven't been making the best impression so far either, part of it is my fault.

In the first week I met everyone and they were all super nice. My manager is super chill but also very serious so it's kinda intimidating. Most of the people I work with are Indian so it's almost like they all have a connection and understand each other and I'm left out. So far, it feels like I’m not being included in many projects and I’m just put to do small tasks like entering data or meaningless testing. I get that I’m still new but I feel like there should be more interactive involvement even if I’m not really doing the work hands-on.

I’m a part of a two year professional development program where I basically rotate to a different team every few months just so I can get experience in everything. Hence, I’m assigned a mentor where she checks in with me now and then just to give me some feedback from the team and I can also say some concerns if I have any. She sat down with me and basically told me what the team thinks of me so far. In summary, she said that the team feels like that I am not fully listening to some of the stuff that they show and that apparently I tell them that I understand at the moment, but later on I come back with questions not knowing how to do it. She said that they would like me to tell them at the moment if I don’t get anything so that I don’t come back and ask the same questions I should have had at that very moment. I got really disappointed from this comment because I feel like they have my full undivided attention when they show me anything. I am literally taking notes in front of them as well as recording all of our sessions when they show me a new process so I don’t have to go back and ask questions. However, when my mentor said that I knew there was one incident that she was talking about that had to do with one person, I knew it wasn’t from the team as a whole.

Basically, one of my co workers, we’ll call her Jane, had messaged me over Teams asking if I can do something for her. Long story short she asked me to update a test document then upload it to the drive for the rest of the team to use it. However, Jane gave me very vague details. She told me that it's basically clearing up data and to just touch a few fields. The file is full of a bunch of test cases and a lot of info. It’s my first week and I’ve never seen a file like that before so I had no idea what to “update”. I needed some more clarification. I didn’t know whether to do the test cases myself, or what to add or delete and didn’t wanna screw up. She also told me to have it done by 4pm. The cherry on top was that another colleague, we’ll call her Mary, who needed to use the file, pinged me 5 minutes later saying she needed the file ASAP. At this point I’m lost and also panicking. I told Mary I had no idea what to do with the file as the instructions were vague and Jane stopped responding to me because she was super busy. Mary was nice enough to hop on a call and help me with the file. My mentor confirmed that that was one of the things that was brought up regarding my feedback and she understood my point of view. But in general, even if I do come back to ask questions on something they already showed me because of a special case or I got lost, what is so wrong with that?? Now I’m intimidated to even repeat myself or ask questions after this incident. The best part is that my manager was giving me comments throughout the week (before this meeting) about how important it is to “listen” and ask questions at the moment so that I don’t have to ask questions later. I now know why he was saying that. 

Aside from that, I feel like I’ve already made a bad impression on myself a couple of times after. Here’s what I’m talking about (this is all happened after the meeting with my mentor):  

Today there was a team outing where we all went to play golf. One of the team members, we’ll call him John, who I can tell from the first day is a gossip and know-it-all, approached me. I already don’t trust him. Anyway, he took me aside to talk to me in private. Mind you we are all at an offsite event having a good time and he completely ruined my day. John told me that one of the team members, we’ll call him Ron, was annoyed with me. He explained that we were in a meeting and that I went on my phone while we were in that meeting while Ron was talking to another colleague (this happened after my mentor gave me feedback so none of what she said applies to this scenario) . I am not excusing myself at all as I shouldn’t have been on my phone at all, and I’m the new guy so I should be listening. However, the meeting itself was very informal. I was actually the one who set up the meeting and the other guy (not Ron) came 15 minutes late. Like, no one really gave it much importance to begin with. I was paying attention for the first 10 minutes but then Ron and the other guy started talking about things that I really didn’t understand and I was not involved with. Anyway, John told me that he wasn’t supposed to tell me that Ron said that about me and that he was just “watching my back”. John also said that Ron was “very worried about me”. I didn’t ask too many questions after that but now I am 10x more insecure. Aside from that John started telling me I need to learn all this extra stuff if I want to impress everyone like Mern stack and other technical skills. I already felt like I wasn’t enough and this is now the icing on the cake. I explained to John that I am constantly trying to get involved in projects but I feel like I’m being neglected. I told John that I am always asking Ron and other team members if there is any way I can help out. John’s response to that was to basically not ask people more than twice a day for tasks to do, otherwise it can come off annoying. I didn’t realize that me reaching out to offer my help and showing I want to be involved can be annoying. 

What does he mean that Ron is “worried about me” as if I committed some corporate crime? Again, I know I went on my phone a few times during that one encounter, but other than that I always give my undivided attention. I just felt like the vibe at the moment was very informal but I understand if it came off careless and rude. The worst part is that John basically told me to keep my mouth shut but I really want to talk to Ron about it and make sure we’re cool, but I don’t want to cause any drama or attract more attention to it. 

At this point, I am super worried that the team thinks I’m careless, clueless and a nag. Why couldn’t Ron just have confronted me about the phone incident at the moment instead of talking behind my back to other team members? I just hope this doesn’t get back to my manager resulting in everyone keeping a watchful eye on me. I need your opinion on all this. Am I overthinking or do I have a right to be worried? I’m acknowledging my mistakes, but I also feel like the team sees me as a burden from the very beginning.

1dpjutx,How to Train My Replacement,"I have run a medical office for 6 years. Just myself as the secretary/office manager and the doctor I work for. In that time, I have had to work a ton of unpaid overtime in order to keep up with the demands of my job as I basicaly work the job of two people. I also do a lot of little things that are a bit time consuming but make my boss' life easier. 

This year I was forced on a medical leave due to mental health by my psychiatrist. I decided that, as it was ruining my mental health and have a lot going on in my personal life, I can't be at work an extra 4 hours a day and occasionally on holidays and weekends. Because of that, things got behind and I was ""let go"" on June 25. I have said for years, including before and after I came back, that I needed help and did offer suggestions but nothing was ever done about it. 

My boss wants me to stay until July 31 so he can hire my replacement and then I can train them. Since I am the only employee, there would be no one to train the new hire if I didn't stay on. 

What do say to the new employee when they ask why I'm leaving? Should be honest about this situation? How long should I stay if I get new job before the 31st?

1dpj17z,Should I leave? ,"
Hello everyone, 

I am currently working as a staff auditor in a state agency, where I am earning the hours to get my CPA. 

Here is the problem. I was a tax auditor for five years at my old job. I had one lead at a time, and I focused on a very technical area, but usually the same company (rotating every three years or so). 

After a year at my new job, I realized that I really enjoyed being able to work in a focused area. My current job has me rotating between financial audits, compliance audits, and performance audits, with different supervisors for each one. I am not a fast learner, I am a deep learner, meaning that it takes me time to get good at a topic, but once I am, I am solid for life, and understand it profoundly. 

Anyway, I just had my one year evaluation, and my supervisor said that I am not efficient enough at the audits. She implied that if my performance doesn’t improve within six months , they will let me go. 

Now, I would like to leave my current state in a year or two years. I don’t want to look like a job hopper, by taking a new job, and only keeping it for a year or two. At the same time, I know I am not a good fit at my current organization. 

Should I apply for new jobs, and if so, how long should I stay if I know I want to leave the area. ",AgileProposal8666,1,1.0,1,1719463748,2024-06-27 04:49:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dpj17z/should_i_leave/,6,2024

All the employees are very welcoming, and the guy training me is probably one of the best coworkers I’ve ever had over 6 jobs.
The general manager is very out of touch. My first day (monday) I learned that my person training me was left to fulfill dozens of orders entirely by himself after management fired someone for simply ‘not being cheerful enough’, then berated him for ‘not being organized enough’ when he couldn’t single-handedly complete the work of a crew on time. The general manager also got pissed off when he gave us incorrect order sheets that we had to correct ourselves.

1dpgc89,How to handle this situation? ,"So I've never really faced this before and dont know if its normal as I never experienced it at this scale before.

Whenever I make a ""mistake"" or there's an oversight in something, my ""colleague"" would flag it by emailing me and cc our manager. (For context, my colleague has been at the company for about 2 years now and it was my 1 year anniversary a couple months ago). This has happened maybe 4-5 times over the last year. I am not a perfectionist and everyone makes mistakes but i find it weird including our manager on the email. Let me give you an example - she was running a report which was \*(and still is) unfortunately a manual process (due to our new system migration, there are no resources to automate this yet). Every month I have to download the prior month report and then add new rows if there is any new data.  She handed this off to me with a quick walk through and I asked as many questions as I could. About 2 months later, she emailed me (and our manager) saying i should review the report for inconsistencies in the font and size. At this point i had maybe added less than 20 rows of data to the file that had over 400 rows. I am thinking to myself 98% of the data in this file was entered by you. Why are you now flagging this and cc-ing our manager like its my fault? I have seen a few errors and typos in her work and have not once thought of including our manager in copy  - i either tag her in a comment or let her know 

I thought this was just limited to my colleague but it may apparently be company culture (small n of 2)

I have been working with this person who reviews and approves some of our documents for more than 2 weeks on a set of documents. We are migrating to a new document management system so we have been working through the kinks together. She finally gets a chance to actually review the documents today. She sends me an email with the feedback and copies my colleague. Why? I have no clue. She did have valid, clarifying questions and I used the wrong template (company has 2 active templates in the system and i picked the wrong one). I feel like she could have used the existing communication chain in Slack we have been running for the past weeks even up till today to share the feedback but she decides to send an email and cc my colleague instead. This same person approved the wrong report a few days ago and i didnt cc their manager. I just let them know to rectify it.

I am so confused. I am not sure if this is me just being defensive but like i said i am open to correction and not above making mistakes especially in an organization where everyone is in a hurry and there was no proper onboarding. Maybe it's just me or something larger?

1dpfugg,Should I leave or Should I stay?,"Let me introduce myself first. I'm young but I have gained a lot of experience. I'm currently awaiting graduation (in my fourth year of my course). During my college years, I started working online (mostly in data entry and market research). In my third year, I had an internship subject, so I applied as a marketing specialist. I got accepted and had a good experience during the 6 months. After my internship, I decided to work part-time for another 6 months. Again, I had a positive experience because I got along well with my colleagues, enjoyed my workload, and it aligned with my career goals.

Now, I've been offered a full-time position by my boss. I'm excited because this could be it—I have one year of experience with them, and my records are good.

However, the offer seems too low to me. They mentioned it would only last for 3 months with a possible increase after 3-6 months depending on my performance. Is this normal? I'm hesitant to disclose the exact salary, but I believe it might be below the minimum wage in my area.

So, to ask for advice again, what should I do? Should I negotiate for a better offer first? Should I consider leaving or staying? I'm a bit offended because after a year of hard work, I feel like I'm being offered below minimum wage.",sleepnot2002,1,1.0,0,1719453438,2024-06-27 01:57:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dpfugg/should_i_leave_or_should_i_stay/,6,2024
1dpfesd,how to bring up that I won’t be accepting employment contract?,"I am a 4th year engineering student working at company A for my work experience. It was a paid job but wasn’t in a field that I was interested. The workplace was supportive and I gained a lot of experience. I felt that my manager and team really cared about my development and I am grateful for them. Recently I have been offered a full time employment contract after I graduate.

At the same time, I have also been offered another employment offer at company B with a much higher salary (+30k higher), at a sector that I am highly interested in and with good benefits (9 day fortnight, mental health care leave etc). The salary and benefits were too good compared to my current workplace that I couldn’t refuse and I have accepted the contract. However, the employment does not start until after I graduate and there is no chance of me starting sooner.

I currently live out of home and need a job to cover my living expenses. I feel that if I decline the full time offer from Company A, I would be let go because I know companies are unlikely to continue investing in students that are not going to work for them after graduation. I am also feeling increasingly guilty as I feel I am wasting company A’s resources, however, I just have bills to pay and need a job to sustain myself. 

How do I approach company A in regards to rejecting their offer? I know that if I reject it I likely have to quit / will be let go. I am considering taking up a retail job to earn money after quitting but I am having trouble bringing up the conversation and figuring out how much I should reveal to company A.

Long story short, I am 24 and found myself at a crossroads. I have a bachelor's degree already in Fine Arts and I have enjoyed working as a freelance graphic designer/illustrator since I was 16 years old. Freelancing is amazing, but I need a more stable job with a stable income to help my family.

1dpbhpe,Offered a New Job and Am Struggling With Making a Decision,"I have a Masters in Electrical Engineering and got a job at a telecom ultility out of school. I have been there for 1.5 years as of now. Good benefits, pension, coworkers, management but I'm on a 3 year contract, sometimes the work can be dull and leaves more to be desired, and my salary caps in 3 years unless promoted. Recently (February), I was passed up for a full time role in my own department for someone from another department that was nearing the end of his contract. I was basically told that the was the reason he got the job over me. Out of frustration I applied to a few other jobs and let it be. My manager came up with a plan to restructure my work load to take on some more technical and exciting projects that are also relevant across positions in the company (this would give me a good chance to get full time when the next posting comes around). Since this change, I've really enjoyed my job and working with 2 of my coworkers. However, I got a chance to interview for one of the jobs I applied for a few months later (May). The interview didn't go well so I just shifted my mindset back on my current role and again have stayed enjoying it. Last week, I get a call from the company I interviewed with and they suprisingly offered me the job. The job has even better benefits, pay (+5k over my current job now, +50k over a career time without promotion), growth opportunity, the chance to work directly with experienced professional engineers, 2 of my friends I went to school with work there as well, and its full time but its a complete change of industry.

1dpbgov,I got fired 3 months into new job,"Frustrating bc they headhunted me aggressively from my last company, which was sh** but I had job security and they were very happy with me there. 

I was not advertised the role correctly and I did not ask the right questions to gauge expectations. 

I was told I wouldn’t need to do any BD for the role and all the clients and mandates would already be in place. I joined and immediately saw I had no actual jobs or valid leads to work, and the market they had me focus on was very small anyway. 

My first proper monthly review went well. My second one didn’t, I was told that I’m ‘far behind’ what they expected (I have 1.5 year prior recruiting experience) and they’re willing to invest in people and keep them in place if they try hard. They said as long as I put the work in, it should be ok. 

I started going in early and being the last to leave, prepping extra, reaching out more for help (they encouraged this). I even created new forms to keep track of client and candidate data, etc. 

Not even a full month later they pull me into a meeting and say they need to part ways. It’s odd bc my performance has improved a lot this month and even have candidates in an interview pipeline. I asked them if the effort I put in wasn’t enough, but then they acknowledged I was putting in the effort they asked for. 

They insisted it wasn’t personal and they’ll give me an ‘excellent’ referral, and even offered we have a coffee later to chat more about what direction I could look at next. 

I then pointed out that they told me they’re willing to invest in people, and one of the directors was speechless, to which the other said something like ‘some people perform better on other platforms’ and ‘we are a lean firm and don’t have the resources to help you get to speed’.

I spoke to my friend who is a recruiter elsewhere, and she said the fact I didn’t have actual mandates except one search (that my manager is also working on) and still sent out over 50 CVs in the 3 months there, almost all for ‘exploratory conversations’, was insane. My market has maybe 300-500 people GLOBALLY and the firms they have worked with are top tier. Realistically, the strong candidates I spoke to were not interested in advertising themselves as wanting to speak to another firm for possible growth, especially as they all know each other. 

I’m really shocked, not angry, but shocked… what else did they want me to do? I had a candidate have a second interview today that would’ve given me a fat commission check. I even asked them for specific feedback and they just gave vague stuff about how I’m not the right fit. 

I’m now going to look at jobs outside of third party recruitment, as I think it wasn’t for me anyway. The work life balance was horrible and shady practices are inevitable. I mean, I had to advertise somewhat false promises to candidates or be sneaky with getting intel out of them, which I didn’t feel comfortable with. 

I hope I won’t be unemployed for more than 2-3 months. I might just tell employers I’ve been made redundant as I know I went above and beyond and my metrics were good. In fact, they were far better at my larger, old company, and at my old company I was regarded well. 

I feel so embarrassed as well. ",Ancestrypost,1,1.0,0,1719440809,2024-06-26 22:26:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dpbgov/i_got_fired_3_months_into_new_job/,6,2024

I went to the career center at my college and the advisor stated that I should e-mail future/potential employers and ask if I can shadow them while they are at work but to me that's somewhat awkward, having some random college student email about networking, job shadowing, etc. I don't know if that is good advice from her end.

I'd really like to either be a technical writer, a translator, or possibly write stories for the newspaper but not be on TV/a journalist - if that makes sense. Anyway, what advice could you guys give me on better networking myself?

I want to be able to gain/add experience to my resume before I near graduation, thanks so much!

1dpa7er,Left off org chart 3 months after hired — are they going to fire me? ,"
Hi all. I was recently hired into my dream job and have been struggling with personal things which is causing me to struggle a bit in my job. I’m socially awkward and work in tech so that contributes to my personality as well.

Anywho, the past 2-3 months, I have noticed they have been removing my name from the org chart. We just hired someone new and they’re included on the org chart but I’m not.

I thought it might be a coincidence but I realized this happened last month and this month.

I spoke to a friend in HR who said they have 6 months to come up with a case to “fire me without repercussions” and I’m having major anxiety about all this. I need my health benefits and don’t know what to do.

I feel like bringing it up with my boss is not the best solution as I don’t have a lot of trust in them. I don’t know how to bring it up to HR, but this feels shady all around and I don’t know what to do.",juxtaposedmillennial,1,0.5699999928474426,4,1719437565,2024-06-26 21:32:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dpa7er/left_off_org_chart_3_months_after_hired_are_they/,6,2024

My boss is the owner, and does all the quoting, customer correspondence, and helps me in the shop if we're struggling to meet deadlines. Our production has roughly doubled in the years since I've been foreman. I've implemented many changes to our machining process to remove unnecessary steps. I'm making roughly 85 - 90K CAD a year, and am having trouble figuring out what comparable salaries are, as the company is so small and my role compromises of many different tasks.

1dp8xde,not understanding an employment contract,"Hi everyone,

I’m seeking some advice on a discrepancy I’ve encountered regarding my commission rates. Here's the situation:

My employment contract specifies that I should receive a 20% commission on any new business I bring in.
My employer recently sent me a new commission contract outlining a 5% commission rate. This is a significant reduction from what my employment contract states. However, I am unsure if I am reading one of the contracts incorrectly??


Here’s a bit of a breakdown of the f etails from the New Commission Contract:

Commission Rate: 5% commission based on the final services agreement between the Agency and “new business”.

Payment Terms:

Commission payments will be calculated and divided equally over a period of 6 months.

Commission Breakdown
(services the new business is paying for):

$6,500.00  
$9,500.00 
$5,850.00 
$10,000.00 
$250.00
$5,000.00 

$37,100.00 Total Eligible
$1,855.00 (5% commission)

Monthly payout: $310.00 CDN


The Issue:
According to my employment contract, I should receive a 20% commission. If applied to the total eligible amount of $37,100.00, my commission should be $7,420.00, with a monthly payout of $1,236.67 (over 6 months).

I’m unsure how to proceed and would appreciate any advice on how to address this issue with my employer. Here are my main questions:

How should I approach my employer about this discrepancy to ensure the terms of my employment contract are honored?
Are there any specific legal steps I should consider taking to protect my rights and ensure fair compensation?
Has anyone experienced a similar situation, and how was it resolved?
Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",liluzigoob,1,1.0,3,1719434383,2024-06-26 20:39:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dp8xde/not_understanding_an_employment_contract/,6,2024

1dp7t12,Can i pivot to high finance with an MSc Finance from LSE and my background?,"
Hi,

TLDR: How much could an MSc in Finance at LSE change my career trajectory to obtain a graduate role in high finance, having 2.5 years experience in capital markets technology and STEM background.

25M, graduated with undergraduate in Mechanical engineering from a top 5 Russell group university in 2020. Have worked at a very large FinTech for the past 2.5 years in 2 roles - credit research analyst and then a product management role.

I have been offered to study at LSE MSc Finance this year. I want to break into high finance (DCM or global markets - I still need to determine which exactly I want to focus on) and am happy to go back to the graduate entry level as this is pretty much the only way to get into high finance. I am familiar with application cycles in finance and how difficult it is, I previously obtained a front office internship with a Tier 1 bank in 2020.

How likely do you think it is, assuming I am strong in interviews and my quant skills are good, that with the LSE MSc in Finance I could secure a position in a bulge bracket or boutique firm? Would you take the risk of paying for the masters? How strong is the reputation of LSE these days with employers? Would an MBA in 1-2 years be a better option?

Thanks so much for any help guys.

1dp7qsz,Fired for not “vibing” correctly?,"I don’t really know where to post this, but I need some advice.
I was recently fired from a job because I had “bad vibes”. For some background I’m 26, female, and the people on my team were all men in the early 40s to late 50s. I did my job well and two weeks before I was fired I was given a 10% raise and promotion (just a title change). In those two weeks I was held at gunpoint and assaulted, my boss knew about this and only let me take one day off to go to the hospital. Additionally, in those two weeks I made several minor mistakes (I completely own up to this)
When my boss took me into the meeting to fire me he told me he hated coming to work and seeing me and my “bad vibes” he also told me he hated how anxious I am (I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder which I told him about when I was hired, it was never an issue until the end apparently). He also told me I wasn’t doing enough to ingrain myself into the work culture. When I asked what he meant he said I didn’t talk to anyone about my interests (when I did they would make fun of me or call me stupid for liking the things I like) and that I didn’t go out of my way to learn about the things he and the other men liked.
I don’t know if this was my fault, I know I did mess up a few times after I got beat up and shot at (probably around 150 dollars worth of messups) but I don’t understand what he meant by my “bad vibes”? I’ve always been told I have a nice personality at work and now I’m unsure of how to conduct myself in the workplace. Please give me any advice you have, this was very sudden and very confusing.

The new company is prestigious, the manager is very nice, high salary, WFH, many gifts from the management, and many former employees from my previous job work there. 

But there are certain points that make me very worried:

- on the first day, my lead told me what kind of people he likes to fire;
- my onboarding lasted for a week (thanks to a colleague!), after which I was immediately involved in projects; the lead was also against me having any onboarding, because in this company everyone should figure it out on their own, as he said;
- i receive constant criticism for my work, once my work was shown as a bad example of a task in front of everyone;
- lead called me insecure, made me look stupid, and advised me to engage in open conflicts all the time if I want to work here (oh, and I'm still afraid to speak up in meetings, because he’s always watching me);
 - high workload in the first months of work, as well as working late at night (I started ignoring messages from colleagues after 7 o'clock);
- feeling isolated (mostly due to remote work, but also because my team is not friendly);
- a colleague who speaks in a high-pitched voice to me and thinks I'm incompetent;
- a very boring project;
- a feeling of abandonment, lack of socialisation;
- for the first two months, my manager did not communicate with me;
- stinky office (I’m not kidding…).

Even though my former-new colleagues are helping me and my manager is now supporting me, things are getting worse: I'm afraid to call my colleagues, I find it difficult to do simple tasks, I procrastinate (I've always loved working hard!), I don't want to learn anything new, I count the minutes until the end of the working week. Physical symptoms are added (poor sleep, rashes, loss of appetite, worsening gut health). 

I already have work experience (3 years in old company, which i loved!), but it still feels wrong to leave this job after a short period of time.

1dp5veb,Going all out to ask for a big (35-45%) raise with nothing lined up?,"Hey everyone.

I joined the company 1.5 years ago in my late 20s with a financial background. I got a job earning slightly more than my colleagues at this stage of their career (which still isn't much). My job at the start was quite simple administrative work and bookkeeping. 

However, I am also a very curious person with some programming knowledge and the company had just implemented an ERP which was dependent on consultants. I took it upon myself to learn it in my free time, which ended up saving the company a ton of money. The company allowed me access to everything I needed to develop on it and so I did and I learned a lot. Lots of work, lots of unpaid labor, but I was benefiting myself too so I didn't care.

I've only had a \~10% raise (and they made a big fuzz about how they fought with the board for it to round up, despite the difference being €4/month, which I found offensive, like they don't think I can do simple math)

Things recently got a hell of a lot worse. My supervisor got pregnant and was promoted moved up to a different department of her own. HR person who got into the company after me took her place despite having close to 0 knowledge on the team's day-to-day job. And now *I* have to teach *her*, my future boss, despite the fact that nobody taught me anything and forced me to learn on my own. So now I spend 1.5h every 2 days teaching her.

Not only that, the company started putting immense pressure on me to teach the IT team how to develop in our ERP as well to get some redundancy. I know that as soon as I do that I lose all the leverage I have. And since an ERP is a business management software, I would have to train the IT guy on the ERP as a whole as well.

I recently got officially certified as a consultant and started putting my resume out there. 13 companies so far, 1.5 weeks ago. 0 responses so far. I have absolutely 0 leverage there, but maybe I just didn't send it to enough companies or give it enough time because I thought I was in no rush, but the company now started going full-speed on me to provide training to these people.

I will have a meeting with the responsible for the IT team later this week (to talk about creating redundancy) and then I have a meeting with the managers of the financial and quality department to discuss my KPIs for the quarter regarding developments (which I finished successfully, never missed a deadline so far). Otherwise I do what I was hired to do, nothing more. 

Right now I feel like going to that second meeting and putting my cards on the table. No training and no further developments unless I get a 35-45% raise AND my own team and I will train nobody outside of that team. Is there any way to approach this situation in a democratic fashion?

1dp5aqo,can’t decide between law or digital marketing ,"hey yall, long story short im currently a college student who has been studying a digital marketing degree, however recently i’ve been looking into law school as well. yet, i can’t decide which path i should stick to that would fit me best and also pay well.

here are some pros and cons im considering for both:

-digital marketing pros-

• i’m a creative thinker. i love editing, social media, and art

• work environment seems more relaxed than law

• i can work anywhere without worrying about a license 

• less debt (30k)

-cons-

• the pay could be shit for a long while. i’m already a first generation student who has lived paycheck to paycheck all my life and i REALLY don’t wanna continue that

• job security isn’t great since marketing isn’t always seen as a 24/7 “necessity” 

-lawyer pros-

• better salary

• im good in the subjects surrounding reading, writing, and creating arguments 

• better job security 

-lawyer cons-

• a LOT of debt (150k+)

• not sure if i’d enjoy work the environment. for reference, i’m a girl who has a pretty extroverted personality once i get comfortable and i have a leg sleeve full of american trad tattoos…not sure if id fit the vibe of a law firm lol. also id rather not wear suites and dresses everyday lol

• if i end up wanting to move states, i’d have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get licensed in that new state

• lawyers always tell me the job is boring??


if ANYONE could give me literally any advice at all i’d greatly appreciate it. i’m at a loss here!


TL:DR- can’t decide between digital marketing or becoming a lawyer. i’m a creative and lively person, but don’t wanna live paycheck to paycheck. however i also don’t  wanna hate my job like lawyers seem to do lol

1dp4w6u,Science Communication roles? Feeling stuck. Medical writing? Technical writing?,"Hey folks, my job is currently on shaky ground (not due to my performance, but factors outside my control and unrelated to my work). If I get laid off too, I don't know where to begin. 

What I do now is a lot of writing and a tiny dabble in video editing, but mostly without the industry standard tools like PremierPro (I have dipped my toe into After Effects, but I cannot fully animate anything).

But when I go looking I fall short of the qualifications for most Medical Writer roles because I have an MS, not a PhD or MD. Plus the writing I am doing is short form. I haven't written anything for a scientific publication in 7 years. My writing in those old papers was horrific because I was so new.  I also haven't written a grant proposal, ever, and some of those roles want that.

  
So, I don't feel like a Medical Writer. I'm not an animator or video editor. I don't have much experience matching content writing roles. I'm not particularly interested in marketing or copywriting, but even if I were, I don't have the background for them either.

Plus it appears professional writing is being heavily disrupted by AI right now.  

What job titles would you suggest I search for? Are there related skills I should work on in the meantime? 

Honestly, I almost want to pivot and learn data analysis. I always liked that in graduate school and some of my older jobs, but I don't have much coding experience. But that's so completely unlike what I'm doing now I'm not sure it's a good move.

1dp2f56,Could you give us genuine feedback on our ai job search engine ?,"Hello there everyone! Could you please give us feedback on our idea? :)

Starting this week, together with a team of 8 people we will be working on our first project. an Ai search engine that helps to find the right opportunities and connections in tech and ai. this post is made for you to give feedback on our idea so that we can have a easier time working out your needs. 


Why did we decide to work on this?

Its hard to find exactly what you're looking for. It can be hard to land a new job, get a great internship or to find the right individual for your project. It takes a very long time hopping from search results to another job offer website. And when you finally get the idea that you found something you like, you get no reaction, no match or the job is already taken.

  
This is all really frustrating, next to the fact its an very important decision to make. Working on the right project, at the right job, or with the right people that match really make a huge difference.

  
Since its generally hard to find the right match, especially with so much information out there. We decided to make this process a lot easier for you!



So.. can you tell us more about it?

We're building an Ai search engine that uses Ai semantic searching methods to find more meaningful search results. Rather than search engines like google that looks only on keywords or phrases. Our ai search engine is designed to find the meaning behind your phrases. It will use Natural Language Processing to find the actual meaning behind your requests together with a build in ai assistant that guides you around and helps you find what you're really looking for.

Users can link their professional account like their LinkedIn, there will also be an option to make an account on our platform that can be used to enhance the user experience.

Based on the information on your profile we will use Natural Language Processing to find the right:

 - job offers, internships, traineeships, freelance work and open source projects. 

- companies, start-ups and projects.

- investors, students and professionals.



Based on this we can offer way more accurate results that match your request. Leading to a  better match making process. 

The results will be categorized, where the top results being the once's with the best match rate. We will try to make an match % rating to indicate how much a company, project or individual matches your profile and request.


Could you please give us feedback and sign up for the waiting list if interested?

[https://www.yournewway-ai.com/]

All the feedback we can get is useful for us, with your feedback we can make our product better and make sure it fulfills your needs. Next to that by signing up to the waiting list we can make sure we will reach out to you the minute our beta comes online!

This might be a little long but please bear with me.
I (20M) am in a dilemma rn regarding which stream I must choose. A little backstory about myself ÷
In my highschool years, I've always been the bright kid that never took studies seriously. The only time I started paying a little bit of attention in academics was prolly when I was in 8th standard. I was always among the top 6 students in the class( though I wasn't giving my 100% focus in studies cuz to me marks were just numbers). Our school founder, principal and teachers had very high expectations for me. 2020 was the year I was supposed to appear hslc ( yes, the year covid was causing havoc throughout the world)  but since our exams got cancelled, we were assigned random marks. Now, on to my higher secondary years when I was about to appear for my 12th exam my gf of 4 years broke up with me. This was a very hard time for me as we were very close and I also kinda grew attached to her. I couldn't sleep or eat let alone study. A year has passed since then but I still haven't fully healed yet. As a result my 12th marks were pretty bad I only got 68%. Looking back on my life I've always regretted the choices I've made in life. I wish I could've atleast work a little bit harder. Now, I'm more of a science guy, physics, cosmology, astronomy I'm also into philosophy. I wanted to do engineering but since my 12th pc was low I wasn't eligible for entrance exams like jee, bitsat and what not. I'm also of a middle class family background so private colleges would also be a huge investment (this is still in my option tho) another plausible option would be to study abroad (Mind you, I'm Indian). Or just do general studies. I'm open to shifting my career path as well. Idk I just wanna break away from the 'middle class family' curse and do something for my parents. 
What do you guys think? Please help me out.

1dozgfo,Upper management delaying promotion after being told it was going to happen,"So, essentially work in business development been there a couple years and been working towards a promotion and move across to sales. 
New joiner started 6 months ago, female and she’s moving to sales in a month as she fits the criteria for the role, they were looking for a native female of the region being advertised. Initially, I trained her and was scheduled to move across to sales as well at the same time but to a different team however it’s been postponed and I’m now having to train her replacement before I move over.

The embarrassing thing about it is that it was announced on a global call within my team that this was going to happen and I’d be starting in June, now it’s been delayed and I’ve had no communication as to when it will happen just been told by the director ‘it will eventually happen’ just feels like a slap in the face. He’s off with me and puts in effort with others so I don’t understand his game, I work directly under him and for his team by booking meetings too and feel I bring value. 

I was the top performer in the team last year too so I don’t know why but it seems they want me to continue in my current role for now and train new joiners. I just feel the man involved is playing me a bit. 

Anyway, the boss that I’d be moving teams to always comes over and speaks to her and doesn’t really acknowledge me apart from the odd comment. I’ve tried creating conversation but after a short period he’ll find an excuse to do something else so he’s clearly not interested in engaging. 

I’m becoming frustrated and considered looking elsewhere but part of me thinks he could be provoking me as a test to gauge how ready I am for sales. The other girl in question is joining another team too so perhaps that’s why, I’m not sure. 

Any advice on how to navigate the situation would be great!

1dozg1l,My CEO makes $5M and I get zero PTO,"As the title suggests, I'm a little vexed, lol.

Back in Feb, I took a temporary, full-time gig in marketing at a major non-profit. The work is decent despite me being WAY over-qualified. I was desperate at the time (during the worst of the tech/media layoff period) and well, here I am. Times are still tough and I'm still working this gig. It's easy as heck, I have great health insurance through it, my expenses are low at the moment — so up until lately, I couldn't really complain. I've just been riding it out while I look for other, better-aligned opportunities.

But then the other week I learned that I don't get PTO. None. Zero. Not even the federal holidays that the company observes. I looked back at my offer letter, and it says ""\[company\] provides a a  (PTO) program to help employees balance work and life. PTO can be used for vacation, illness or other personal reasons."" The letter also includes this caveat: ""The benefits and compensation contained or referenced herein do not constitute a contract and are subject to change or termination without advance notice, to conform to federal or state laws, terms of benefits plans, cost constraints or otherwise at the discretion of the \[company\]. Recognizing that plan changes are inevitable, where individual plan descriptions differ, the plan description will prevail."" The recruiter also sent me the benefits package, which includes zero mention of temporary employees NOT receiving PTO.

So I guess I'm wondering... what would y'all do? I've already rocked the boat a bit by saying I won't do work that's above this pay grade (they were asking me to manage projects even though I'm in an entry-level role) and they said they absolutely can't pay me more. So like I said, I've just been doing the minimum and riding it out. But should I inquire about/professionally fight for my PTO??

I would appreciate your advice. I’m feeling down and struggling a lot right now. I work as a data analyst at a well-known company, but I’m not officially on the company’s payroll. I’ve been working here for the last nine months.



I struggle to communicate, especially when my seniors ask me questions. I get nervous because my communication skills aren’t great. I completed my graduation in arts through distance education and later became interested in data analytics.



One of my biggest problems is that I don’t understand things quickly and often forget details. Even when I know something, I find it hard to explain it to others. I also have a colleague who always puts me down and comments about me. This makes me feel even more stressed and anxious.



Despite these challenges, I sometimes solve logic and coding problems that others in my team think will take days, and I do it in a day. But even after these achievements, I still feel like people think I’m not capable.



I’m very worried about my future career. I’m just 21 years old and feeling overwhelmed by these challenges. I’m not sure what steps to take next.

1doz0mj,Working for a charity want to quit already in the first 6 weeks ,"Was hired to help with two stores and two stores managers taking annual leave one for 10 weeks one for 2 weeks. 

Had a crash course on how to run a shift and basic requirements 

While both store managers were away a few issues came up that I had to handle. 

One of those issues was internal theft and I had an uproar from the vollys about. I had to do something to de-escalate the situation and make sure they felt heard. I assured them all I would do something about it. I went home and thought about what the most appropriate step would be. I than called a staff meeting the next day and stated on my shifts we would be placing all volunteers purchases in a tub and it’s to be cleared by management. I also stated that they are free to anonymously leave any feedback on my management style good bad or ugly and that I welcome constructive feedback. 

Second issue comes from the temp manager who’s in the little store. Two stores are all slightly different and different tasks jobs are set. Unfortunately lack of communication from this temp manager on what my particular duties are for the Saturday has become more than frustrating and has led to other volunteers almost bullying the Saturday volunteer I have with me ( something that 1 is not acceptable and two is not her fault at all) 

So I walked into the small store Saturday and saw a note on the back door about no smoking near the building and that they have had an astray knocked over and that they shouldn’t have to clean it up. I reacted badly to this because I’m the only smoker there and I always place my butts in the bin so it felt like it was something placed there to get under my skin. I have had my differences with this temp manager for a little bit including her refusing donations from the larger store even though the small store is half empty, her getting defensive when she was sick and I went out of my way to help her. Just general bad attitude towards me. So anyway I sent the area manager a message stating it’s starting to affect my mental health and could I possibly only work at the larger store. 

Is not possible for me to only work the larger store so she called a meeting with me and the temp manager on my shift on Monday. The area manager was so nice to the temp manager and acted like a fucking cunt towards me. She nitpicked the hand written sign on the door poking it on the table saying in a condescending way we don’t do this here. Like well ok but if I had been trained to know where the correct signs were I would have used them. 

Anyway she tells the temp manager she needs to write me notes and I need to tick them off stating iv read them and understand. 

Than she goes on saying we’re on probation and don’t change anything at all. No change whatsoever and particularly about the staff meeting I called to de escalate the internal theft situation.  

I’m left here going okay so I’m learning two different stores, two different ways of doing things, in less time than the temp manager and she wants to grill me about a fucking sign on the door. 

Also feels like I’m just a glorified cash register operator because if the vollys come to me with an issue I can’t put stuff in place to help manage the shift better or store because I’ll get spoken to like shit from the area manager. 

Iv actually sent a text to both the store manager and area manager and think I’ll just hand my keys back tomorrow. 

Anyone with good management skills knows that you train and support staff to get the most from them and mistakes will be made in the first few months.

1doyvrk,Conflict Resolution Assistance Needed ,"I am starting to feel like a liability to the company and I am worried for my job due to a conflict with a colleague and would like some advice please. 

I work in a rapidly growing company as a project manager. We are growing so fast that in the last 2 years since I've started we've almost quadrupled in team members. What we lack is proper processes and documentation due to the rapid growth and need to focus on clients. 

Most recently I've had conflict with one of our primary resource managers due to them breaking a number of established processes causing resources to not show up to my prescheduled meetings or changing information I placed on shared documentation affecting scheduling. It's against all of our established processes to do what they have done and it's been discussed multiple times but not yet documented. 

I have spoken to them both times about the issues, both devolving into conflict resulting in them directly threatening me with pulling resources from my projects and making my professional life difficult. Both times I have gone to management afterwards to handle the issue further. They are in a leadership position so have the ability to pull resources but it would be extremely unprofessional of them. That is the reason I went to management is to avoid client facing issues and make it known so they don't continue.

This 2nd incident happened just this week. After sleeping on it a bit I am concerned for how to further handle it. I was asked what type of resolution I want as an outcome and I gave the following but admitted to not knowing yet what I expect 1- Proper Documentation 2 - For them to act as a professional moving forward. 

A - Is there anything else I should expect as part of this resolution? They apologized last time but with many buts and excuses. Also should I ask for any type of actual corrective measures such as specific training classes like 'Conflict Resolution' or 'Treating your Coworkers with Respect' type of training videos? Or what? I'm trying to be the nice guy after the mess but at the same time I don't want this happening again. 

B - What can I do better or are there classes to take for myself? I do know I come across blunt. I am very type A and just focus on the work getting done instead of cordialities, etc so I come across as authoritative without authority which could rub people the wrong way. I try but clearly I need to try harder.

1dox3t4,Am I wrong for wanting to go backwards? ,"I (f23) am now very confused on what my next move will be. 
For some background, I worked for an amazing mom and pop owned childcare facility in my city. I began there as an assistant teacher and within 2 years of working there, I became the director of the place. Running the center was not easy but very rewarding. It was stressful for me but especially stressful on the owners- so much so that they sold the business to a large corporation. 
With this sale, I was able to keep my job and the owners even negotiated a $12,000 raise for me to continue working there, putting me now at about $67,000/year before taxes. This was so generous and so amazing. I was so excited to start with this new corporate company…Until I did! 
So far, this merger with the corporate company has been a mess. They went ahead and changed numerous policies without warning, leaving parents, staff, and myself in the dark. They completely and totally lack communication. They promised people from corporate would be here with us to aid in this transition and we have seen them twice…My entire center is imploding and all I can do is help where I can. It’s like everyday we look stupid to everyone because we have zero answers and the help that was promised is nowhere to be found. We also have received 50+ packages in the last week with instruction not to open anything or use it so on top of being a shit show, it also looks like a tornado hit the joint.
Now here is my dilemma. I have worked in childcare since I was 17 and have always had a passion for it. I began as a teacher and I am thinking of that again (love infants the most). The problem however, is that I would be taking a massive pay cut. I mean MASSIVE. Daycare teachers average at 15-19$ an hour- obviously that’s a big difference between 67k. It also may not be a good look going from the top of the food chain to just being a teacher. 
I know I would be much happier and less stressed out. I could focus on myself and my classroom without the constant nonsense and problems. The center I have interviewed at is also 5 minutes from my house vs. where I am now that’s a 20 minute drive. I am also questioning if I should just quit all together and be unemployed for a moment as I do have 2 streams of passive income that can definitely keep me afloat. 
Is it really worth trading money for my happiness and stress? ",Frickandfrack9152000,1,1.0,0,1719404020,2024-06-26 12:13:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dox3t4/am_i_wrong_for_wanting_to_go_backwards/,6,2024
1dows6p,Boss used Chat GPT and forgot to take out [HR Employee Name] in my review. Do I acknowledge?,"Hi all! I recently started work at an agency as their first HR employee. One of the main parts of my role is revamping our annual review process and protocols. My boss has been a huge champion of this and it was priority number one in my first 100 days. 

I had my probationary review yesterday and it was pretty positive. There were some typos throughout the review which did not bother me because it happens and we are human. However, when we got to the summary there was a sentence that said [HR Employee Name] instead of my first name. 

I am the person who goes in and edits/approves all reviews, and because it was mine we didn’t follow that process and she handled the review on her own. Before I arrived at the company this fell completely on her, so it wasn’t anything new that she was attempting for the first time. 

I know for a fact that she prioritizes employee experience and I think for that reason I am even more insulted and embarrassed. And if any other employee had done this she’d be enraged.

1dovfsv,Advice Needed: How to have conversation with My boss regarding leaving the job.,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 24-year-old male working at a reputed product-based MNC and have 16 months experience . After completing a six-month internship with the company, I transitioned to a full-time role. It has been 10 months since I started, and I am currently in a 12-month probation period.

During my onboarding as a full-time employee, my manager mentioned that I should stay with the company for at least three years and that he needed that commitment from me. However, I have long had a desire to pursue higher studies, specifically a PhD. I have recently cleared all the necessary tests and interviews and have secured a seat in a PhD program.

Additionally, the company has not been making much profit, leading to several layoffs and poor salary hikes. I received only a 3% hike this year.

I am seeking advice on how to approach my manager regarding my decision to leave the company and pursue higher studies. Any suggestions on how to handle this conversation would be greatly appreciated!

1dotyof,Should I leave because of my boss,"I have a boss who is sort of sexist in his ""jokes"" and comments . He has admitted that he has to be careful what he says to some business contacts because some people take it as him being sexist (but he genuinely believes he isnt). He will say about women being emotional and he often says ""you women are all ....""  and talks about all women loving shopping and other stereotypical things. He says he wouldn't date a woman in her early 30s because basically women at that age only care about having babies and settling down . We had a woman come round to offer massages as a corporate thing and when we informed him of this his first question was is she hot. If we discuss working with a new contact he'll joke is she hot. 

On the flip side, he is supportive of me getting ahead in the business and has been a very supportive teacher, and he never discounts a woman in the workplace. He has also never acted inappropriately or creepy towards a woman in the workplace including me, that I know of. But the comments are wearing me down. he's even said before saying a comment like that that he knows I don't like it when he says this but.... And then proceeds to say it. I have argued against his opinions in the past but he is so set on them he can't see why his biased comments on gender and such aren't okay.

We work as a team of 4, within wider team in a large business but we are in a different city and are the only employees in this city. The rest of our small team don't seem to mind his comments and will laugh along. He has the connection with our business contact, and without the contact I won't have a job. If I go to HR he will likely get spoken to and then my relationship with him would become very awkward due to the small team. if he was to be let go, which I think is unlikely, he would take the contact and my job would probably become redundant.

There are some other issues like he can often be a bit patronising. I enjoy my job and like the team and there's good opportunity for progression. If I worked in a bigger team I think I could overlook this but 2 years of it has worn me down.

Is this a big deal or am I overreacting? I wonder if I should just put up with it since nobody else seems to mind. Leaving for a new job (and there aren't many options in my city) would get rid of my employment protection and security,  and I am also trying to have a baby so I would lose my (minimal but it is there) maternity pay.

1.) to be a criminal psychologist do i need to go to police academy?

2.) if i were to become a criminal profiler, do i need the police academy? (kinda like a follow up to the first question.

3.) is it like specifically researching and analyzing their minds, or am i like a literal therapist for the criminals?

4.) follow up to 3, if it is like being a therapist, what career is more like analyzing their minds and assisting with investigations

5.) last question, is it worth it? bc ik it requires bachelors, masters, and doctorate so it can take 10-15 years just to start a career plus the debt from crazy expensive college

1doqey6,Do I give up a higher paying gig for a lower paying passion?,"Hi! 
This is my first or second post, so apologies if I'm doing it wrong. 

I'm a 30ish/f in the health care industry. 
Most would call me a desk jockey. 
I was in my previous position for nearly 7 years at an end stage dementia facility of around 100 patients. Let's refer to this position as a C5. My C5 rotation was absolute trash fire via a 5 on 5 off, through weekends, 10am-6pm. I have been advocating for years to make this a full time position, however, my rotation counterpart has significantly higher union seniority, though I have higher position seniority, and would trump me in the fight for a 1.0 FT. 
This being said, my direct manager (bless their heart) advocated to their director to give me an interview for their newly opened assistant position. Long story short, through over 100 applicants, I was the choice though I never officially applied. 
This new position is the all American dream; 8-4 Mon-Fri, with a small pay increase ($3ish dollars/hr.) 
My previous manager has given me 30 days to turn around and go back to my C5 position. 
It has been two weeks, and I'm having some regrets. 
My new position is tied to a desk whereas my old position has lots of moving around, and patient / family / staff interaction. I find significant fulfillment in the socialization my C5 position provided, as well as the familiarity and the endless opportunities to goof around. 

All in all, is it time to grow up and go with the big boy job in somewhat seclusion? Or do I go back to the lower paying, terrible rotation job that brought me so much joy?

1doqdrw,"Stay in job, take job offer or keep looking? - career change ","Hi everyone, I (26 F) am in desperate need of career advice. I am currently working as a commercial insurance broker. It’s something I very much fell into and I don’t love the role or see myself doing it forever/the work load is high but the company I work for has a lot of great benefits. I get 32 days holiday (which I know is very unusual) and the role is hybrid so I get to work from home 3 days a week which gives me a lot of flexibility and a good work/life balance. I’m currently on £26,150/year. 

I have recently been looking for a career change and a recruiter suggested I apply for a paraplanning assistant role (£27,000k.) I’d never heard of the role before but after doing research it does suit my previous experience I had in administration. I got a job offer from them but the downside is it is completely office based (about 30mins away from where I’m based) and only 20 days holiday. (So I’d be losing 12 paid days essentially from what I currently have.) I worked out that with the petrol I’d be using to commute I’d be about on the same wage - even with the salary increase. There is a potential I will enjoy the role more and the company seemed nice -family run and very small.

1dopiy7,Is it okay to take time off this early on?,"I just started a new job last week, mid-June, and I have a vacation planned for 7 work days in early august. I had discussed this upon receiving the offer for the job a couple months ago and I was given the semi-formal “okay” from the higher-ups. 

I just discussed it again with my manager/mentor in the company and she said that while it’s totally okay, especially since I had discussed it before, she recommends that I don’t take another vacation for a while after that. None of this was said with an attitude or passive aggression by the way.

Now, my dilemma is what I WANT to do. I’m scared that even though I’ve gotten approval and followed all the etiquette, I will fall into disapproval amongst my coworkers. I also really don’t want to fall behind in acclimating, but as of right now I don’t think this will be a major problem. All this, knowing I could cancel my plans free of charge. This is my first job and I really care about how I perform/am perceived. If it’s of any use to your advice, im in consulting. If you were in my shoes, what would you do? Should I cancel my plans?

1doootw,Want to leave my toxic job but don't want to take a paycut - should I stay or go?,"Hi all,

I joined a startup almost 3 years ago with the intention to act in a technical pre-sales role. My official title is ""Solutions Engineer"" but I quickly realized several issues and red flags at this place:

* I do all of pre-sales but I also get pulled into post-sales support, technical escalations, support for internal systems like salesforce and stripe, account management-like duties (such as checking in with customers and doing QBRs), etc. Basically, stuff that has nothing to do with selling or even remotely close to my job description.
* The CEO and upper management don't believe in job responsibilities for each person. They think everyone should do everything and the CEO has literally been quoted saying this multiple times to our teams. This leads to 6 people from different departments joining every client-facing call because no one knows who is responsible for what.
* Middle/Upper management is useless and they don't enforce or even try to create job responsibilities for people. There is a TAM and CSM on the same team as me and I feel like they are supposed to be doing half the work that I get pulled in to.
* The CEO personally responds to support emails from tiny customers and throws me under the bus by providing the wrong/incorrect technical information about the product to customers, blaming them for product issues. Even worse, he specifically mentions in his reply, ""talk to elev801. He'll make sure you're set up correctly"", when his suggestions are just flat out wrong.
* I feel like my career is stagnating. I'm not learning anything new, not doing much pre-sale or solutions engineering work, and am constantly putting out fires due to an unstable product and management's lack of ability/desire to properly staff this company and have dedicated technical post-sale support, etc. There's nowhere to move up in this company because I feel like I already do everything.

With all that said, sounds like a pretty cut and dry case to leave, right? Well, here's the problem. The one silver lining is that their compensation is quite high for my area. I am the only Solutions Engineer at the entire company and for better or worse, they rely on me heavily to run the day to day functions of their business.

I've been interviewing at other companies for similar roles and it seems like the upper end most are willing to go is around at least a $50k cut, and some of that would be a variable, non-guaranteed component (OTE).

This is a significant cut from what I'm making now, and there's no guarantee the new job won't have some or even most of the same problems as my current org.

I know the market has declined in general compared to 3 years ago and it's a tough time to be looking, but I am starting to feel at my wit's end here, and customers are starting to blame me for the product's issues. Management / C suite are not supportive and continue to have delusions that the customers are always wrong and I somehow need to educate them.

Would you take a $50k+ cut for a more typical, standard Solutions Engineer role? Would appreciate any advice. Thank you!",elev801,1,1.0,2,1719371799,2024-06-26 03:16:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1doootw/want_to_leave_my_toxic_job_but_dont_want_to_take/,6,2024
1doogju,Am I about to be fired?,"I started at my new job 5 months ago and my probation period is set to end in exactly 1 month.
I have had regular reviews with my 2 team leaders as normal (company policy to have 3 probation meetings which everyone gets) which have highlighted both areas of improvement and a lot of positive feedback. 
My last meeting they gave me some great feedback, saying that I’m on the right track and doing some amazing work. 
I also was told I need to work on my distractability in the office, time management and generally keeping my file notes up to date. I recently got diagnosed with ADHD so this makes sense why I struggle in these areas but I was put on medication a week ago and this has already significantly improved. My team leaders have also said to me they don’t want to get rid of me, they want to support me to be the best worker I can be and do see potential in me. I have made great progress in the last 5 months but naturally have areas to improve. I am also younger and have less experience than my colleagues but they knew that when they hired me. Whilst there’s been indication of areas I need to improve on, I have been actively working on this. I get along with my team great and haven’t had anyone tell me I’m doing a terrible job or anything. All the conversations I’ve had have been around how I’m on the right track I just need some additional support.
I have just been requested to attend a meeting with one of my team leaders, and the upper manager of our department at the head office this week for a discussion on my “progress”. I received a call and an email from my team leader which was incredibly vague and all I know is that the upper manager requested the meeting .
I am really scared I am about to be fired since my probation hasn’t ended…. Any opinions? I am going to prepare some notes because I do believe my training was rushed when I started and I was thrown in the deep end quite quickly. I’m also going to note all the good work I have done and recognise my areas of improvement and what im doing to work on these.
I need some advice, am I about to be fired? What should I say? Is there any hope of keeping my job if im willing to do whatever they need me to or will the decision be made before I walk in the room?

1donpeb,Feels like I am stuck,"Hi everyone

I am currently feeling like I am stuck in my career and don’t see a way to pivot myself.

Background:

Came to Chicago as an international student at 18, got a bachelors in Industrial Engineering. Wasted most of my time and didn’t do anything worthwhile. Graduated with 2.8 GPA due to many missed classes and horrible performance in the first few semesters, did improve myself with 3.75 GPA in Junior and Senior error.

After graduation, after 3 months finally got a job as a logistics analyst with a freight forwarder. Been here almost 2 years and feels like I am using almost no skills and learning nothing here. Only thing I am doing all day is making spreadsheets to help automate stuff and replying to emails. I am constantly being told I am high performer and that I am going be the team leader but have not had an update for over 3 months after the performance review. I am making like 60k a year (5% increase each year since I started).

I have no idea how I can go about pivoting to a more technical field such as ML which I am interested in but have minimal skills in except some Python classes I took in college.

I’m currently interning at ACN as a Tech Development Analyst. I like the kind of work I’m doing and could do, but don’t like the idea of WLB in consulting. As a gen z, it’s a biggg priority for me. 

With that being said, their % offers from intern to full time is very high and I’m under the assumption that I’m likely to receive one. I’m located in the Midwest and it would probably be good salary, benefits, etc. 

My undergrad is in data analytics (wrapping that up now) but I’m completing a STEM MBA program over the next year. I also have an additional summer of internship experience as a Technology Analyst at a different company. 

My question is: in the current market, would it be stupid to decline an offer from ACN if I’m unsure about consulting?

I graduated in 2020 with a degree in psychology and minor in counseling with the full intention of working in higher education. After hiring freezes and working predominantly administrative jobs, I found my way into higher education admissions. 

Unfortunately, I haven’t found it as fulfilling as I hoped. I’ve gone above and beyond my position expectations with little to show other than support from management and taking on more work than I’m paid for. 

While I love my team, it is really draining to feel like an assistant and not see true value in what I’m doing (even though I know my role is important to move things forward). It is also disheartening to see how focused we are on results and rankings, not the students… while charging them $100,000+ for a degree. 

A little glimpse into some of my skillset - CRM management, process improvement, data analysis/creating robust reports and dashboards, email marketing. Outside of work, I love writing, reading, bullet journaling, and anything creative I can do to spark some joy. 

My dream is to live abroad some day (and distant long-term publish a book), but it is hard to see how I can accomplish this without forward progression in my career. I would obviously need to be able to land a job abroad and that feels impossible right now. 

I’d love any advice on how to pivot into a more meaningful career that could move me forward.

1dojld8,Need some advice on my current career situation ,"Hello, I'm 20 years old and got into the work force at 18 with a diploma. My dad got me into a Small fabrication shop that he works in and I used this opportunity to Build responsibility, Build work ethic, and team work. 

Work info: Small shop with 20 people. Lot's of ""Shop Politics"" 

The shop/My Experience: I've learned a lot of great stuff at this shop. How to operate lathes and mills, I learned trig and how to apply it to machining. I've really improved in every way by working at this shop. The issue I'm facing is lack of progression that stems from ""Shop Politics"". August of last year I was told that when a CNC machine is rebuilt I will be the person that will run it (It's a huge deal since I would constantly have work and a dedicated machine) and after 10 months the machine still isn't up yet and the boss quickly changes the subject when I bring it up. My boss seems to like me, even letting me work by his side and help him on certain projects. After a drill operator retired I was told that I would take over and learn how to operate drills. The guy who was supposed to teach me hates my family. So instead of teaching me he insist that he can operate the drills (He's already running 2 machines at once, now he's running 3) which will make his job way harder. But he doesn't care it seems since at least I'm not the one that is operating them. He has constantly went to the boss about any micro movement I do. Spoke down on me, Speaks to me like I'm less then him and overall prevents me from advancing in my career (While he turns a blind eye to other peoples mistakes and lack of work ethic). The boss listens to him and I stay doing the same jobs over and over again. After seeing him operating 3 machines at once I haven't been the same since. He has also demanded that the boss hires an ""Experienced"" machinist to help him out even though I can be trained easily. Now I am watching people get tours of the shop and interviews even though I could be the one that is advancing to become experienced. With this field knowledge is what makes you money and I haven't been getting the pay advancements I want currently getting $18 an hour after 2 years (I started at $16). I'm not getting the knowledge since the employee that is closest to the boss is stopping me from getting taught.  
This is my first job so I don't know what is going on here but it just doesn't seem right. The boss treats me good, 19 of the 20 people like me, But I don't advance and get stuck doing the labor intense jobs. 

  
My options: 

I can join a labor squad digging holes and operating earth moving machinery (Mainly digging holes for the first 2 years). I will be working outside and drinking over a gallon of water throughout the day. But the starting pay is $35 and I can advance after 2/3 years of work to $40 but will stay capped around that. The money is amazing, The job is very tough though. I heard I will get used to it after a few weeks/months. This job will have health insurance as well as paid time off. 

Carpenter, I start off at $20 an hour and will get raises every year until I'm 6 years in. After 6 years I will be making $60 an hour + benefits.  The starting money is really hard to live off of since I will be travelling every day. Sometimes 1hr+ drives and paying for city parking. It's seems easy to get caught living check to check like this and I have been living check to check for awhile already. The money will get better after 3 years. I will be making about $35 an hour. 

Stay with my current company to be able to work with my father, and maybe have a chance at getting a dedicated machine. I would stay struggling with money this way though and nothing is a guarantee at this company I feel like. 

I'm struggling to make this decision because I feel really guilty about leaving the job I'm currently at. I like working with my father and having somebody at my shop that I'm close to (He tells me I should follow my heart and get a new job if I feel this way. But I don't want to ""Leave him"") My employer is a good man and treats me well. I feel manipulated because I can't have a bad view on him. I feel like he isn't the best with people and doesn't want to anger the other employee by advancing me. Do I stay or do I go? How do I get used to a whole new job? Was I manipulated into staying at my current company? 

I'm sorry if this is all over the place. It is one of my few reddit post and if you need more details to answer please ask for them. There is a lot more but it is hard to put it into words.

1doi3ml,I had 4 interviews with a company but haven’t heard back in over a week. Should I assume I didn’t get the job?,"Hello everyone. I recently had a final interview with the CEO of a company that I felt went really well. The only problem is that I haven’t heard back in a little over a week.

For full context, I had completed 3 interviews prior to this along with an assignment, and a background/reference check which I was able to pass before reaching the final interview itself. Given the lack of communication since, should I start to assume that I didn’t get the job?

For full context, the company I have been interviewing with is a contractor and the role itself is dependent on a contract being awarded to them before I would receive an offer. Given what is common in the contracting world, would it be hasty of me to reach out to ask about the status of both the contract and my candidacy at this stage in the game or should I just sit tight?

Any insights into what I should do/expect in this situation based on past similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.

I have been working full time a few years already and haven’t gone to college properly due to me not knowing what career to go for or whatever resonates with me and I suck at school as well. However i have been thinking seriously to get an education so i can at least find a better paying job in the future. For some time, I’ve been eyeing X ray tech job (radiology program). I didn’t wake up wanting to go for this but i heard the pay is really good, really chill job for the most part and demand for this position will keep rising by 10% by 2030. The sucky bitchy part is obviously the schooling which i heard there is a-lot of studying either going with community college path or private school way. But in my city, the program is extremely difficult to get into by coming from community college and you will fly out if your grades cannot keep up, and I’m not A or B+ student… rather compared to private school which I will have to take a 36k loan for 2 year degree/program that should take me if i pass registry exam, their still will be alot of studying and work to do but less chances of failing and wasting time since I’m paying for it, and in 2 years I will have a job making $70-90k a yr.  I don’t have many choices but finding a decent career will help me. If i go with the private school, how do know beforehand that this career will be okay for me before I plant my head into this pot of debt?

1dog8w8,Debating taking new job with substantial long term pay cut ,"Hi everyone all advice is welcome. I just received a job offer that would cause a significant cut to my total compensation over the next couple years. The offer is for a jr HRBP consulting role for $70k with no bonus and 401(k) entry** in January 2026 after 1.5 years. My current role as a benefits coordinator pays $74k, $2.5k bonus, and 6% match on 401(k) fully vested. I hate my current job. I started this January after my massive layoffs at my last company taking the job out of desperation. I go into the office 4 days/week and with excruciating traffic it often takes 50+ min each way. The job is numbingly easy compared to working at a startup prior. The new offer would be 2 days/week on site and the commute is about half. It is at a very small hr consulting compared to a very large company. Based on a scenario I ran, I would make about $20k less (total comp) over the next couple years in taking this new role. I’m really conflicted if it’s worth getting out of my current role or not. My job search has been abysmal.

1docp9s,Do I just give my 2 weeks at this point? ,"Used to love my job, but now I can’t stand it because of management and superiors. I don’t want to leave because I love the doctors I work with, but I don’t know if I can take it anymore.

I’ve worked at this vet clinic for 2 years now. Even with the low pay, emotional hardships, and workplace drama, I loved my job until a few months ago. Just when the perfect opportunity for me to ask for full time came, I was told they were hiring back the surgery tech that had left 6 months before, now to be “Lead Tech,” so there wouldn’t be enough hours for me to go full time. Okay, I thought, one of the other part-time assistants is planning to leave when she finds another clinic, I’ll ask then. That time comes, and again my full-time request is rejected. Apparently the hospital had to jump hoops just to hire the tech back and somehow had too many labor hours now. 

Since the Lead Tech has had her position, she has been in charge of the tech/assistant scheduling. Also since her starting back, I have been miserable every day at work. She has been distant with me and has been on her high horse of authority (we were friendly before she left), and has been extra buddy-buddy with an assistant that has the worst work ethic and constantly neglects her job. My hours have been cut significantly and the buddy assistant is getting the exact schedule she wants and extra hours. I have been scheduled to work kennel many times, whereas this other assistant hasn’t had to once. Management doesn’t seem to care. The Lead constantly makes me feel like my skills are lacking (no, I just don’t like you breathing down my neck) and like I am completely dispensable.

We have a digital checklist of different things to stock and routinely deep clean around the hospital and exam rooms. While it is the responsibility of 4 people, I am literally the one that ever gets them done. My initials are the only ones at all (no exaggeration). Unlike the buddy assistant, I never get approached about something being done wrong or not getting done. 

I am getting married in a few days, and I asked my manager specifically not to schedule me kennel shifts the month before getting married. (Note: I have nothing against the actual job, it’s more the fact that I never come out of a shift unscathed. I am extremely pale, bruise easily, sensitive skin, etc. I have had my fingers smashed, nails broken, and countless bruises that take weeks to fade. In the past, I was recovering from a nose surgery and was put on kennel before my restrictions were up - that shift I got a nosebleed that ruined the surgery and I ended up having to get another one to correct it.) So, I asked to not do this specific job because I don’t want any injuries before my wedding. I’m an assistant, not kennel tech, I should not be the only one working these shifts when the kennel manager is sitting on her ass all day and management refuses to hire a new kennel tech (we have been down one for months). I have more schooling than the other assistant (she has done one year of tech school, I have a Bachelor’s and 2 Associates). Lo and behold, I am told to do kennel this morning, and scheduled kennel on Thursday, 4 and 2 days before I get married. Unsurprisingly, my arms and legs are already a bruised mess.

Like I said, I love the doctors I work with, and I (for the most part) like what I do. I feel like I’ve been putting up with countless things for so long. The hospital fought head over heels for this tech to come back and since then I have been screwed over constantly. I have been looking/applying for other jobs the past 2 months but the job market is scarce. 

My fiance is a night shift nurse and could take care of us no problem (we didn’t even take my pay into account when planning and budgeting because I make so little it hardly matters), but he’s worried about what if something were to happen to him. My dad insists I just give my two weeks and be stress free for the wedding/honeymoon, but I don’t want to push full dependency onto my soon-to-be husband.

Do I give my two weeks or just stick it out until I can find something else?

1docnzf,Took a wrong career turn,"I'm all over the place, but in a constructive path.  Entrepreneurial guy, started as an engineer in manufacturing environment, was really good with data/trends (8yrs), got an MBA, moved to Supply Chain (10 yrs), excelled there, promotion, promotion, promotion, moved to Product Management about a year ago because I had demonstrated leadership and financial savviness.  I'm over the PM team globally for 2 portfolios/P&L's.  

I just hate this PM role.  Maybe it's the org I'm in, maybe the business winds blowing the wrong way, maybe the wave of new leadership that I'm working with.  I just hate it.  

I want to go back to S/C, my company has a policy about 18 months before moving after a job change. I'm 12 months in and won't make it to 18 one way or another.  I'll have to look outside.  

How do I address being in PM on my resume?  I'm thinking about all the hiring I've done, I look for job titles that are pretty much what I'm looking for or a clear lead in.  Supply chain for supply chain, engineering/tech for engineering, etc.  With recruiting, pools of resumes fill up quickly and I delete anything that the current role isn't directionally appropriate.  In this case, I'd delete myself if I was the reviewer.

1docfha,College Student (20M) who is lost and seeking advice. What should I do?,"I am currently a second year college student who still hasn’t decided on a major. Before I explain the rest of my situation, it is important to explain that I took this past spring semester off to tackle this issue with little success (I have 3 semesters of college so far). I did shadow a bit, but it just made the decision harder. Some background information….

I graduated HS with a 4.3 GPA and was always in the accelerated classes (Honors, AP, some duel enrollment senior year). I had many interests in school including Law, Medicine, Business (Management or Finance) and Engineering (lol I know, too many options). Going into college I felt pretty good on my decision of doing a 3 + 3 program my college had with a local law school (decent law school but no were near top) where you could get a business undergrad in Business Admin (concentration in Finance) and then start taking law school classes early. You also could just do the business degree if you decided Law wasn’t your path. Anyways, after researching more and more, and talking with people in the field, I’m not sure if the life of a lawyer is for me. I like debating/ negotiating and I enjoy the business world so corporate law felt natural, however 70-80+ hour work weeks isn’t something I’m excited about. Because of this I thought about just sticking with a business undergrad in Finance allowing me to graduate in 3.5 years because of credit from HS. I wouldn’t be doing anything like Investment Banking and ideally would like to be in management (maybe with an MBA, or becoming a financial advisor). lol I know this is long, bear with me. 

However, with all of those degrees the work seems like you just sit at a desk all day and can be very boring. Because of this, I started looking at engineering as it seems to be pretty standard at 40 hours a week besides busy projects. In addition to that, the work can be so much different depending on the industry, leading to pivots if it gets stale. The other reason why I was thinking engineering is because it’s a more useful undergrad degree IMO compared to Finance (by this I mean you could get an engineering degree but still get a series 7 certification if you wanted to do financial advising). I still have the opportunity to do Law or a MBA with the benefits of problem solving skills of an engineering degree. The problem with this is that it would significantly delay my graduation as I was taking the business classes currently instead of Chem, Physics, etc. I know it’s not the end of the world and I’m still so young, but thinking about doing an undergrad in Engineering while not being too excited about engineering itself feels silly. I just look at the other fields I’m interested in and the job markets are very difficult while the engineering route seems pretty much straight forward because the program I would be transferring to for engineering has an embedded co-op opportunity if you want to go that way (so 1 YOE out of College). Engineering seems like the best option, but the course work is daunting as well. 

And as mentioned above Medicine was an option that I recently started to look at again because I do have a passion to help people and Engineering Undergrad would take all the required classes needed for Med School. If I did something like Bio if I decided Medicine was for me, it falls into the same boat as Engineering where it delays graduation.

In summary (I know this is a ton of different ideas) Should I stick with a business undergrad (as I’m interested in Business and could still do grad school with it) or do engineering which it’s self isn’t super appealing but the opportunities it could bring could be better suited (Med school, grad school + in demand undergrad). 

P.S. because I was dealing with this going into college, I decided on going to a local state university where I got 100% financial aid and haven’t had to pay too much the past 3 semesters. It’s know as a good school in the area/ state but for business, it’s better if you go to a T50 school at least. It’s worth noting that I did get accepted as a transfer student to OSU (I’m from Ohio) so doing a business undergrad there to finish up was on the table. 

P.P.S. Last thing I promise. During my gap semester, I was approached by my college’s recruiter for the Marines Offices Candidate School. This was the last thing I would ever consider but after talking with him, I’d be able to get my college degree, and then would work as a financial officer building up my resume and leadership skills. It would be on the leadership side of the marines organization so it might be good for gaining work experience out of College. Its bond to 4 years if you decide on it after graduating. Thoughts?

If you made it this far, thanks for reading! I know this is a TON of info and all the thoughts running through my head, but I wanted to just get it all out there lol.

1dobe5r,Help me with my next steps - restarting career at 37/38yo!,"Hi all

Long story short. Worked from age 16 to 29, when I had my first of three daughters. Husband earns comfortably for the family and has supported all of us (I had baby 1, baby 2 and baby 3 all within 3 years). We agreed as a family that I would start work again when baby 3 started school. Unfortunately in 2019 I was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer. This set off a domino effect; where my previously quite dormant eating disorder (anorexia) went full rampant destruction. In 2020 I was sectioned for the anorexia; I was extremely ill. I missed basically all those key, special “firsts” with baby 3 - starting to crawl; walk; talk; eat; everything. A huge chunk of the time I was inpatient, Covid was rampant and I wasn’t even allowed to see my baby, or my other two daughters. It was utterly devastating. 
Got better, out of hospital Aug 2020. Was totally traumatised by first breast cancer and treatment which was immediately (in fact got taken over by) being detained in a mental health hospital for the best part of a year. I found readjusting into home/mum life extremely hard. Anyway, trying to keep this short… mental illness plagued my life for the next three years. I became suicidal and was detained in a further 7 psych wards. All was hopeless. 

Last year I was in hospital once again, suicidal ideation, severe depression. Except this time it was different and the hospital was like none other. I got the best support - the right support. It cost my family £50k of our own money as our private insurance no longer covered my mental health. And this was, unlike previously, a private hospital. Apart from taking so much money away from my family and the guilt I had, I can say it worked. I still see the same psychiatrist and therapist, there, now, and I’ve been discharged for a year. Slowly I’ve been recovering. I am not fixed but so much better, mentally. 

Unfortunately in the meantime I have been diagnosed with severe chronic pain in my spine (osteoarthritis) and left leg (post surgical arthritis/CRPS). I also acquired a severe skin condition this year that causes abscesses, one of which had me in ICU on deaths door only in May (sepsis and heart failure). I am chronically unwell and registered disabled. I am “only” 37. It’s sad and frustrating because my baby 3 started school last September and I was originally meant to be back working now, but I’m not, I’m still not there. It’s been a really traumatising and painful 5 years. 

More recently I have resumed driving lessons (I know, I never bothered when I was younger, I was due to pass my test booked the day after I was diagnosed with cancer…obviously I didn’t attend the test). I bit the bullet despite severe anxiety and resumed lessons again this year. It’s going ok. I’ve also been volunteering at my children’s school whenever I can; classroom assistance and other support when needed and when I can. I really love it. Recently got my enhanced DBS, all good.

The plan is to start an OU degree in English Language (BA); then an MA in Forensic Linguistics. I want to work for the police ideally. Speech and language is also an idea; or something like that. 

As a household we are still financially comfortable on my husband’s salary. The emphasis is on me working for my own personal wellbeing and success. Having something that’s “mine” and I’m passionate about. Forensic linguistics/working for the police is a passion. However I also hold a lot of passion for my volunteer time at my daughter’s primary school especially Early Years (Reception). It does tie in with my interest of linguistics (teaching phonics and how to form sentences etc). 

Degree starts in October (home learning).

Prior to babies I worked in the stock exchange industry, in contract negotiation and relationship management (ie with other stock exchanges/vendors). Before that, it was purchasing. I’ve also done hospitality, office admin, management, all sorts. 

A job at my daughter’s school has gone up for a full time teacher assistant for Early Years. Basically what I do already as a volunteer but full time. It starts in September. 

Perks : I’m very familiar with the staff, school, expectations of role. I love the school. It is certainly a lovely place to work. I can still do my degree outside of those hours. Holidays being free also obv a huge perk. I spend time there already, why not get paid for it. I feel like having this teaching assistant experience while studying before I apply to police roles in the future (a good few years away) would be beneficial to my career. 

Cons : through my illnesses I still spend a significant amount of time at hospital appointments; unwell or in too much pain to work. I wouldn’t have the luxury of being able to opt out of a session like I currently do. I’m not sure I’m emotionally or physically strong enough yet to do a full time position. It would make studying for my degree quite a bit harder. Not impossible though. The pay is crap (pay isn’t a huge dealbreaker for me though).

I feel like maybe applying for the role and just “seeing”. My husband says I need to wait a year. Even this week alone has been exceptionally difficult in terms of my physical and mental health. I’m still not well. I don’t want to have to quit after a few weeks because I can’t hack the full time hours and become more ill. 

I’m desperate to get on with my life. I definitely feel a sense of urgency. But husband is probably right. I should concentrate on the degree for at least the first year and build up. I can still volunteer there - they are always welcoming of the help. 

Getting a salary of my own again after so long though would be really nice. I hate being so dependent. I feel like the more I achieve, the more inspired and focused and dedicated I am. I was at my lowest point when I wasn’t able to even parent let alone consider volunteering; driving lessons, study. I’ve taken huge steps. Is this momentum and a role being available at the perfect time for me to snap up now? Or should I be realistic? 

I’m done with illness controlling my entire life and I am claiming my whole life back. I’m so lucky to have the opportunity and support to pretty much do whatever I want. I feel like I need to grab this role because it’s literally so me. I love what I do when I’m there. I know that my ultimate goal is somewhat different but they are certainly linked and this teaching assistant role makes a lot of sense in terms of my career goals.

I only have one internship experience and have been nannying all four years of college. I’m truly loosing hope and even some of my friends are struggling as well.

Been thinking of making a jump to a higher paying dev job in this saturated market but with no luck.

To be honest, software development isn’t really my forte. I know enough algorithms and system design and all but I don’t consider myself as a whiz kid when it comes to it. I have always been more inclined to managerial positions(I don’t have an MBA, not that it matters in this day and age). More than technical skill set, I have felt more use for my interpersonal, communication and delegation skills. And then I happened to have a chat with a friend few days ago…

He is working in a company with a population of less than 100 but has been established for 15 years as a service based company. He says the company is flush with cash(so far) but the workforce is very weak and the productivity is down the drain. So he asked me directly if I’d like to join as project manager because they need someone to make the trains run on time.

Now here’s the dilemma: If I agree to do it, I have to produce results within the first month and if I'm successful, I'll get to decide my pay.
And if I fail, I can't go back to my current job which is how I keep myself afloat amidst some of the financial liabilities I have.

Not that I don’t have faith in my abilities, I just don’t know if I’m bold enough to take this leap. So I’d like some genuine advice.

During COVID I moved out away from the city, and now I am well away from any places with tech jobs.  My family depends on me bringing the money in.  I got 3 months worth of severance pay, and I already spend one month looking for a new job with nothing to show for my efforts.  My options do not look good:

1. Finding remote job would be the best outcome, for every remote opportunity there are hundreds of candidates, the competition is insane.

2. Finding job on site is a possibility, but that would mean moving out of brand new house with the lowest possible mortgage rate into smaller apartment at easily double the monthly cost.  I like the new house and suburban environment, and I really, really do not want to move back into a big city.

3. Possibly downgrade from leadership position into individual contributor role with very significant pay cut, challenge here is that I was not hands on coder for over a decade, so I would probably have to start at the bottom.  I don't know if this is something worth going after, especially with meme worthy amount of new professionals popping in every popular trendy new thing (generative AI etc).

4. Sideways career change that could at least use some of my previous education and experience in one way or another.  I enjoy working with people.  Perhaps role in HR, or another people management role?  I managed software projects from design to implementation for years.  Maybe project management?  Major challenge here is that going with that sort of sideways career change I will be competing with professionals that have been doing the matching job for years.

5.

1do7fa1,Becoming an Art Teacher ,"Hi all! I am in my last year of college and will be graduating with a bachelors degree in visual arts. I have decided to try and pursue a career as an art teacher and I am wondering what are the best steps to do so. I did not concentrate in education but from some research I have done it seems that it not required. I am in NYS so i am also assuming I will need to complete some tests in order to get certified. From what I can tell on the website (ALST, EAS, and CST exams) How hard would it be for me to pass the educational exams without this being apart of my studies? Will I need to change my major at school? Do I have to student teach in order to become a teacher? Can I take the required tests only after I have received my bachelors degree?

1do6en8,Help a early 30s extrovert find a pivot?,"Hello,

I've worked 7+ years as a copywriter in large corporate advertising agencies, and over the last couple, I've gradually come to realize my current career doesn't line up with my true skillset or my passions.

Basically, I don't like writing, I don't like working as a ""creative,"" and I don't like advertising as an industry.

What I've been speculating on are things that I know bring me joy:

* I'm a great public speaker and I love entertaining and informing people. 
* I build social circles fast and I frequently organize and host events, parties, etc.
* I am very good at navigation/trip planning and I love doing it, from simply getting to the other end of a new town, to organizing a three-week trip on the other side of the world.
* I love sharing my reviews and favorites with people when they're looking for things to do/see/etc. in places that I am familiar with. I've started writing up mini travel recommendation guides as I often make them for friends.
* I have always been a natural with computers. I pick up pretty much any program I touch very quickly from Excel to Adobe Premier. But I'm not sure I have the patience to learn programming languages. 
* I have a light background in manual labor thanks to growing up working small construction jobs around the property for my mother. I love working with my hands and fixing things around the house.
* I love nightlife. I spend a lot of time out. I always admire well-organized events like parties, raves, festivals etc. Sometimes I wonder if organizing events would be a good idea for me.
* I think I may be more of an analytical person than I realized in the past. I enjoy researching things, reading about people's experiences, and creating a sort of opinion hypothesis (totally subjective and of no use empirically...but often not wrong?).
* I am a gaming addict when I allow myself to be, although I am currently taking a long break as I feel I use it as a crutch to escape my real issues...like a career pivot. That industry seems really difficult to break into but a natural passion.
* I am a musician and I love music. Always enjoyed discovering new music and helping others find something new. Love concerts. I've always been curious about where I might fit into the music industry.

Some random thoughts:

* I made an acquaintance recently who loves her career in tech sales, she recommended I learn more about it so I am doing some research.
* My father thinks I should get an MBA. It seems like a great credential and maybe I'd make a good leader, but I'm not sure what I'd do with it yet, and I'm worried it might entrench me further in a corporate world that I'm finding soulless right now. Not to mention debt.
* I hate what I'm doing at agencies because I work on brands I don't believe in. I wonder if going client-side might make advertising more stomachable. But I genuinely don't think I'm a great advertising creative and kind of loathe writing scripts.
* I'm interested in UX writing/design as thinking about how people interact with things and finding ways to make those interactions more joyful excites me.
* I enjoyed accounting in college because working in Excel felt second nature. It's a total shift and I worry I'd be bored but maybe not?
* I'm from the US, have been living in LATAM countries for the last 3 years, and have enjoyed picking up a functional level of Spanish entirely through immersion.

And the final consideration is I've been working remotely for 3 years now. It would be very difficult to give that up, but I have a hunch that may be very hard to negotiate when pivoting into a new career.

If you've read any of this, thank you.   
If you have any advice, a hundred thank you's in advance.  
If you'd like to see my website to get a better view on who I am please let me know and I can PM.

  
So, what's a good pivot for an early-30s extrovert?

1do6b6m,Should I self fund?,"Hello guys wanting advice in which option would be the best. I’m working in a large construction company and can’t decide whether to let the employer fund half of the masters degree or not.

Here are the option overviews:

Option 1: Employer fund uni 50% of it so 4.5k funded and 4.5k student loan catch is: 

-stuck for two years while doing the course; if I want to leave then need to pay back all fees 
-stuck for another two years unless pay back 50% I.e 2250 pounds to leave and go to new employer, 1k if it’s 4th year

-Pros: idk job security? Makes them happy? 3 days a year study leave which is nothing tbh

-Long process to go through to get them to fund

-Maybe easier promotion but I could still pursue that if I decide to stay after masters or will it hinder me by taking option 2?


Or


Option 2: self fund through student finance of 9.5k using student loan

-not locked by company for 4 years no need to pay back anything to leave 
-can buy study leave/use some of holiday if needed
-Employer can’t randomly decide to suspend funding

Cons: maybe they will think I’m tryna leave them? And managers getting a bit upset maybe And overall 4.5k more student debt (if that matters)


Maybe I’m in delusion and I want to believe in option 1 so need some closure/validation as I’m confused

1do4jfg,"25 years old and feel so lost. What are the best next steps?
","I hate sounding like I'm complaining, and I know I have it better than so many people in this world, but I have just been feeling pretty confused lately.

I graduated with a bachelors in business 2022 from a great school in my area, but never really knew what I wanted to do. I've been working in public accounting since I've graduated, and I'm absolutely miserable. I've been at my current company(large PA firm) now for a year. The work is awful and my coworkers are terrible. It's a very small office(only about 30 people) and half of them haven't even acknowledged my presence since I started the job. Maybe it would be more tolerable if I enjoyed working with them, but at the end of the day I would still hate the work I'm doing.

I think I just feel as though I have zero purpose while working a job such as this one, or any other desk job that I can find. I was a pretty ambitious kid, and wanted to switch my plan of study a year into college to something healthcare related(nuring, PA, radiology tech are some things I was considering), but was actually talked out of it by my advisor.

I still think that something healthcare related or even education where I am interacting with and/or teaching kids would give me enjoyment. The only issue is I really can't decide what I would want to pursue, and whether or not it's worth it to go back to school. I know I am still relatively young, and I also have a good amount saved up since I am still living at home. I just can't help but think what if I go back and get a degree in something and I won't be able to find a job, or it won't work out for whatever reason.

The environment at my job is truly becoming unbearable, so I will be resigning soon and trying to find something else in the meantime while I contemplate my next steps. Any guidance or help from experience would be greatly appreciated, especially since I don't really have any mentors in my life.",MasterpieceNew6549,1,1.0,4,1719317716,2024-06-25 12:15:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1do4jfg/25_years_old_and_feel_so_lost_what_are_the_best/,6,2024
1do4j7k,EOS L10 is a blazing fire that won’t stop,"I work in a non-profit and recently they’ve started to enforce this L10 meeting on my team weekly - we’re the team that works with the families and volunteers on our caseload daily.

At these 90-minute meetings, we talk about our numbers - surveys completed, how many people we have talked to and so on. This has caused a lot of problems for us because they keep creating new measurables for us to reach before we even mastered the previous one. It is solely based on numbers and does not consider the nuances of the work we do. We were given the incentive of summer Fridays if we reached our numbers, but that idea was being held above us like dogs and was moved after we met one metric to a new one.

The people enforcing this are the CEO and a few directors with the influence of our board. They said that they can’t just give us summer fridays if we don’t do our work because “what will the board think” (we all literally go above and beyond…). One of my coworkers got really
upset about it because she was “killing herself” to meet her goals and not everyone else was - I will not kill myself for any job and I am doing my job maybe not at the new proposed idea of getting 25% of our overall contacts each week of the month because it barely got implemented this month! I’ve been working on improving and have steadily gotten better and communicating with my caseload. They never gave us solutions or tips or support to achieve this 25% either. Also, I started working there mid November 2023 - some people and not do quarterly check-ins so I’d be lucky if I had talked to them once or twice by this time of year. People are people.

In addition to contacting 60+ people monthly (sometimes 90+ depending on month), I attend events and schedule meetings between the families and volunteers and complete contacts that way as well. I like going to these events - it helps with relationship building, supporting my team and getting contacts in.

Our manager is in their first managerial role and they’re a good person, but you can witness how they were not trained properly. They’re not assertive, misunderstand what others are saying, not consulting others before doing other things (prevented my coworker from working with community engagement team without letting them know about it prior. They are one of the top performers.), and it feels like the directors and CEO just tell them what to do rather than actually listening to the team feedback and creating their own way. Of course, they probably can’t with power dynamics at play. 


I think the numbers aspect of L10 doesn’t work for nonprofits. It’s too humanless.

Needless to say this is creating a lot of tension amongst our team, we’re becoming known for our “drama” in the office and I feel like no one understands because literally no one else works with our families.

I spend these L10 meetings irritated most of the time. IDS another complaint every week on how this shit is working for us - it’s been months. This isn’t sticking. I’m vocal. IDGAF because it’s tiring to have to hear everything else your coworkers are going through at work.

Imagine your mom going through chemo therapy, your dad is a few months into recovering from a heart attack, your grandma dies and your parents use you as a couples therapist and you get a HR write up instead of being offered support. No resources for paid leave. No EAP. 

No, I can’t quit. I support myself fully and will be attending school soon.

1do3cnp,Quit my internship cause it affected my health. Was it the right decision? ,"



I recently quit my internship at a company where my college provided me the internship. The work culture was very toxic with no proper washroom breaks and lunch breaks. I was only allowed to go for restroom breaks after seeking permission from the supervisor and at times they would even forced us to hold the pee.

Whenever I took any sick leave the manager would constantly threaten to add negative remarks on the internship certificate. This took a toll on my mental health as I was always filled with anxiety as an intern. As a result, I even started taking lunch breaks only when they allowed me to eat. 

I was being overworked and whenever I stood for myself the manager never welcomed it in a good way. I began crying everyday and started feeling like depressed. 

It all went downhill when I started vomiting and had constant stomach pain. Initially the doctor thought it was food poisoning but later confirmed that it was because of not getting food at the proper time. I lost 10kg within two months of the internship. Doc then advised me to be on liquid diet. 

When I finally decided to quit the internship to recover my health, my college and manager weren't happy about it.Eventually the company released me on my request. However the college isn't happy about it and they are planning to take action for leaving the internship midway. 

Did I make the right decision on leaving such a company for recovering my health?",yeoreum34,0,0.36000001430511475,7,1719313613,2024-06-25 11:06:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1do3cnp/quit_my_internship_cause_it_affected_my_health/,6,2024

I decided to switch my career path and started applying to various positions on LinkedIn. I've lost count of the assignments and tests I've taken and the interviews I've attended.

Last Friday, I interviewed for a job (Instructional Designing) I was genuinely interested in. After several levels of screenings, assignments, and tests, I was hopeful. The interview board mentioned they would contact me for further rounds soon, but I've heard nothing since. I reached out to the hiring team for a follow-up but received no response. I know I should move on, but it's disheartening to put in so much effort only to be ghosted. I am seriously worried at this point.

I'm a specialist in firmware and embedded systems and based on my experience in university and the workplace, my skill level and speed are far in excess of anyone I've ever met or worked with. My under and post-graduate degrees are in EEE.

Based on my public contributions and reputation in some online spaces too, I don't think I have any issues what-so-ever in my ability to do this type of work. In fact I spend a large amount of time teaching others how to do this just so my knowledge doesn't fall out of spec.

What's tripping my up and making me very depressed is the virtually complete and utter lack of response to my applications. I've received three responses in total (this includes being declined). One was automated in nature saying 'fuck off' in corporate speak. Another was also automated but I asked for more info. (as it suggested you could), and I received a cynical and scathing response telling me that my work history in firmware was irrelevant to embedded systems and that if they had a hardware position it might be applicable (what?). The last response was very recent and resulted in an phone interview.

They praised my experience and everything and thought I was great and indeed I knew the processors they worked with and the radio specs for the types of physical and transport layers they are utilising. One could even say that the 2 million lines I've written for those processors alone would make me highly experienced. Great I thought.

I was turned down for not being passionate enough about the company and their interests.

And this is where I come unstuck. How can I be passionate about so many things? First and foremost, I am an engineer. And I am an engineer because I am passionate about software, about optimisation, about complexity, and about loading myself up cognitively.

I've been in this since I was six years old. That's when it started for me. That's when I began my youth membership at the national electronics shop chain to get cheaper components. I published my first software (albeit to scathing reviews) when I was eleven. I was employed to travel to the other side of the world and help work with a team of web-entrepreneurs when I was sixteen. I'm now hitting my thirties and I can't find work despite launching myself into this subject area when I was only a third of the way into my life as compared to when my peers decided to get into it.

In terms of salaries, when I am asked for salary expectation I was used to saying 90k. I used to be paid 60k six years ago when was last salaried and this fits with inflation alone. My peers are on 160k+. I have toyed with posting different salary expectations up to 160k as I know my ability exceeds that of my peers and that I could outpace them and outsmart them in their exact same roles. I have also toyed with the idea of asking to work for six months unpaid just to demonstrate my ability. Currently I am building more and more debt, the government gives me around 25k a year which only covers rent and the rest I borrow from my family. I am not on speaking terms with them right now and so I can't afford upcoming bills.

I'm growing tired, and soon I won't be able to afford to pay for internet any more and I don't know what happens then. I was seriously considering renouncing my citizenship for the free flight out. And the other thing which really bothers me is that in this industry you really have to stay up to date, it means paying for memberships with IEEE, national engineering organisations, doing what they term 'professional development', and specifically in embedded systems - you generally have to sink a bunch of money into buying development boards and having your own pcb's manufactured so you can keep your skillset relevant.

1do0b6k, How to navigate pursuing a career abroad? ,"Hi. I'm currently doing my bachelor's in psychology in Asia, but I want to practice as a counselor abroad one day. I'm thinking of countries such as US, UK, Canada, Australia etc but I'm unsure as to how exactly to go about the research / consideration process. I've looked into the educational requirements and have currently been comparing the cost of education (if I decide to do my masters there), cost of living, counselor income, and social atmosphere (this, alongside quality of life and career opporutinities are my main reasons to look abroad).

I feel overwhelmed because I feel like there is so much to know and there are another 15 countries in my list of potential considerations. It feels excessive, but at the same time I don't want to rush to write off a country while ""shortlisting"" (I'm not sure how to do that well); and I also think the ones I've researched well so far are kind of in the same category, so there isn't really a variety to fall back on if those don't seem to work out well for me.

Any guidance or advice regarding these topics - even just broadly the title question, ""how to navigate pursuing a career abroad?"", would be highly appreciated.",RockmanIcePegasus,2,1.0,0,1719300993,2024-06-25 07:36:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1do0b6k/how_to_navigate_pursuing_a_career_abroad/,6,2024

Should I just tough it out and go? My parents are making me feel like I'm going to be fired for sending this. 


Hi -----,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to update you on some health issues I've been experiencing and how they are impacting my ability to work. I truly love working here and have been excited about this opportunity, but I have encountered some challenges recently.

Over the past few weeks, a lump on the side of my neck has grown rapidly, significantly hindering my ability to perform daily tasks. I have been on intensive antibiotics and steroids, which have provided some relief. However, I had to visit the emergency room on Friday night due to pressure on my throat, making it difficult to breathe. I have undergone an ultrasound and a CT scan, and I am scheduled for a biopsy on Wednesday.

Despite a note advising me to rest until the 26th, I came in today, but by the end of the day, I felt incredibly sick, with significant throat and chest pain. The steroids make me nauseous and light-headed, affecting my ability to comprehend tasks effectively.

As much as I want to be present, I don't believe I will be able to make it in tomorrow or Wednesday (the day of my biopsy). I am very sorry for this inconvenience, and I know this must be frustrating for a new hire. However, I don't want a situation where I am unable to breathe at work. I plan to return on Saturday, and I am really excited to get back to training. I'm very upset that these medical issues have coincided with me beginning this new job. I also have a second job, and these medical issues have forced me to call out for the first time there as well, even though I've worked there for six months. I promise this is not a common occurrence for me.

Please let me know if there is anything specific you need from me, such as doctor's notes.

Thank you,

1dnzr8a,Advice please!,"Looking for career advice 

This is gonna be a long post, so thanks in advance for reading.

I’m 20 years old in Canada. After high school I took a gap year and worked full time as I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I had (still have it) one main hobby (health/fitness). I was considering going to university and studying something related to that, but I was young, and immature. I thought I didn’t have what it took and thought I’d fail. 

 During this gap year  time, my friend started training to be a pilot and enrolled at flight school. I would constantly speak with him and he would always rave how much he enjoyed it and that he recommended it for me. After doing some research and talking with some local flight schools, I decided this was the career for me. I’ve spent about 1 year so far flying. Recently, I got my PPL (private pilots license). I have enjoyed every second of it. I truly love flying. But, I still love my hobby of working out and health and fitness even more. During my whole time at flight school I had lingering thoughts of regret of not following my true passion, but I shoved them under the rug and ignored them. 

Now, being 20 years old and more mature than I was compared to 17/18yrs old, I am starting to regret my career choice even more. I learned that if I applied myself, I could succeed. I proved this as I got my PPL (not an easy task 😅).

I spent most of my savings from my gap year on flight school (roughly $20,000). Knowing this, makes my decision even harder. Pilot training is crazy expensive (about $100,000 in total). I don’t want to keep spending money if this isn’t the true path for me.

I know I’m still young and all, but time flies. Before I know it I’ll  be 30 years old, then 40, and then I’ll be retired! Life truly moves so fast!As morbid as it sounds, I could drop dead at any moment, and I’m fully aware of that. I don’t want to waste time and let myself down…

I guess my question is: Do I quit flight school and follow my passion? Or continue flying with the lingering thought of regret. I’m not inherently unhappy at flight school, but I feel deep down that I am not meant to be there if that makes any sense at all. 

Thanks again if you made it this far! Appreciate the help!!

1dnyu85,Changing jobs for high(er) risk startup?,"For those of you who have left a fairly stable job for a smaller company (or anyone who has even thought about it), what considerations did you have?

I'm 28 years old, MW \~1.5M. I work for a large US space launch provider you have probably heard of, and am considering going to a smaller startup (20-30 total headcount). If I do it this would be the first time I have ever switched jobs and I am a bit nervous, and I'd appreciate any feedback folks may have.  I'm not sure what info is relevant, so I'll share as much as I can think of on the off chance it might help folks who might be able to give me advice.  Thanks in advance!

**Net worth breakdown:**

* 1.2M in company stock (trying to diversify slowly, but capital gains taxes are brutal)
* 290k IRA/401k in total market index funds
* \~40k in cash and I bonds
* No house, but rent is cheap. All cars paid off. No student loans or other debt of any kind

**Current comp breakdown:**

* 140k/yr base
* \~160k/yr in RSUs at the current market cap.
* ESPP that allows me to purchase up to 25k/yr in company stock at a 15% discount from the lowest price in a 6 month lookback (realistically this has been \~30% discount due to annual growth). I annually sell older shares eligible for long term capital gains to recoup cash and fund the next year's ESPP
* $0 out of pocket for covered medical/dental/vision (\~equivalent to an ACA Gold plan)
* Decent 401k with good fund options (FXAIX), but with no employer match and no opportunity for mega-backdoor roth
* 4 weeks PTO + 10 fixed holidays
* The company is \~200B market cap and still private, but we have liquidity opportunities every 6-12 where employees can sell shares to outside investors. I've always been able to share as much as I want.
* Good cafeteria on site (lol). $5 for a steak, salmon fillet, or whatever you want with all sorts of sides. There's also good rotating food truck selection at the same $5 cost per meal. I eat lunch and dinner at work, don't have to cook/clean, and this probably saves at least $100/mo just in groceries vs buying comparable quality/quantity . Call this $1200/yr and at least 30 min a day in time savings
* 7 min commute
* Minimal travel (2-4 weeks per year)
* I have enjoyed 10x+ growth at my current company in the last 7 years and that is reflected in my NW and RSU comp, but I expect that growth to slow in coming years. I only need 2-3x growth to FIRE in 5 years based on currently awarded but unvested RSUs and I will continue to accrue more if I stay employed here.

**New Job**

* I interviewed last week, and was told by the recruiter they were impressed and want to know my comp target. I was hoping they would make an offer.
* New Company is pre-Series A, but had a successful seed funding round with several major institutional investors and has a handful of stable DoD contracts that are delivering revenue
* I just emailed asking for info on 401k, medical insurance, do they offer an ESPP, and how much vacation/PTO time is available.
* Unclear when there will be liquidity opportunities, if ever
* They dont have any cafeteria (obviously), so I'd be back to buying groceries and cooking/packing lunches every day. I enjoy cooking on weekends, but it adds cost and takes time on busy work nights.
* 20-25 min commute
* Significant travel, which I will not enjoy. 15+ weeks per year

**Thoughts/questions**

* What other questions do I need to ask or what do I need to consider when deciding what comp number I need to match or beat my current job?
* Does anyone have experience with early stage startups? How should i consider RSUs/equity when comparing to my current job?
* I understand its personal, but how much of a premium over current comp would you be targeting for a new role generally, and the added travel burden specifically (if any)?",Name_Groundbreaking,1,1.0,0,1719294909,2024-06-25 05:55:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dnyu85/changing_jobs_for_higher_risk_startup/,6,2024

I’m surprised she’s hasn’t done SNL

She’s needs to more performances in U.S right now its currently festival season. It’s perfect to for her to be perfoming Jump everywhere and get it as a summer song. I understand she’s has Injury but she recently performed at this Spotify event so I’m hopping she’ll be a festival this summer.

Jump isn’t getting the same promotion as water and that’s why it’s failing to Hit the Charts when it’s clearly a radio Song.

She’s need another Billboard hit or another mainstream song otherwise despite the album she’s looking like a one hit wonder. I hopping more promo is coming, her teams needs to take some pointers from Sabrina Carpenter.

I heavily believe her team is failing her when is comes to the American Market. She’s big everywhere but the U.S , she’s only known as the girl who Sings Water when she could be more. Even though the world dosent revolve around America, no one in this thread can deny weight the American market holds in the music industry.

1dnwrjg,“Yes” People…,"I have been in my industry for a long time, have always been considered a “strong” performer and I have consistently felt valuable to and valued by my employer. Last year, I had a bad boss. We didn’t see eye to eye on anything. It was a difficult time. I went on medical leave and they moved to another position. I returned from my leave to a new boss and some changes to the tasks under my role. 

Ever since my return, things have felt weird. It feels like my bad boss must have somehow slandered me or otherwise suggested that I was problematic or incapable. I have typically held important tasks, been involved in meetings, consulted for input/ideas/feedback on situations / proposals. Now, I’m in no meetings other than one on ones, none of my tasks are particularly important, they don’t even have KPIs. 

Maybe it went my bad boss at all, though. Lately,  it seems like all the “yes” people are being given the opportunities and those with enough knowledge or history to question stuff or push back are being siloed.

My new boss went on leave shortly after my own return from leave and will be back soon. Maybe it has just been the high rate of turnover and things will improve when stability is reestablished. 

I’m just scared and am not sure what to think or do. Should I bring anything up to my new boss?

I'm a 17 year old male, who just graduated high-school early and stuck on what to do from here. My main goal is to live a calm and peaceful life. I want to be financially safe 24/7 once I get into the real world. I took 2 years of shop class and learned many trades skills such as welding and carpentry. My mom says I should go to trade school to become a welder, but I'm not quite sure since the pay just doesn't sit exactly comfortable with me. I am relatively smart as I was moved up a grade my 7th grade year, the only subject I have trouble in is sometimes mathematics. An important fact to consider since I was adopted a few months after I was born, my tuition is completely covered by the fostering agency. Whether that's college, trade school, etc.. What would you do in my situation?",Fun_Presentation8187,1,1.0,2,1719286048,2024-06-25 03:27:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dnwdo5/graduated_early_and_confused/,6,2024
1dnw8p2,Looking to change career out of dream field and need some direction!,"Hey y’all, hope you’re doing well! I’m hoping that someone here can help give me some advice regarding possible avenues for a career change.

So, for background, I’m a 23 year old who double majored in History and English Lit and graduated two years ago. I’ve been working as a park ranger and volunteering with museums in interpretation for the past three years now. While this work is personally fulfilling, the realities regarding pay, the small and competitive job markets, and career outlook have made me decide that my efforts are better spent elsewhere, sad as it is. However, while I have some vague ideas about where to look going forward, I’m having a lot of trouble deciding on where to go next. 

I have the skills and personality you would probably expect; I’m a very outgoing and personable individual with strong foundations in writing, critical thinking, public speaking, and customer/visitor services. I’m also pretty good with statistics and very tech-savvy, owing to prior coursework and my job in electronics repair throughout college. While I love the outdoors, I really do not want to get into trades as I have seen most of my family’s bodies be broken by them. I have no issue with going back for grad school to start a new career in something else, and would probably even enjoy it. Currently, I’m looking at these fields, ranked in no particular order:

-Accounting
-Academic Advising
-Insurance 
-Real Estate
-Sales
-Social Work
-Publishing

I know I’m pretty general with these, but if you have any insight into these fields that you think are worth mentioning, it would be greatly appreciated!

1dnvdzw,Work wants me to move. What should I consider?,"Never thought I’d have to ask for advice on here, but here I am

So my job is kind of going away.  Basically I’m a field service technician and either somebody in my area needs to move, move up, or sales needs to get more customer sites (not due to the limited number of possible customers).  Also both sales people moved up, so we are trying to hire new ones currently. Nothing around here would pay me close to what I make.

So today my boss calls me and asks if I would consider moving.  He talked with the director and he basically said my job isn’t safe if those things don’t happen.  My family just built our house a within the last 2 years and got screwed on precovid prices.  I would lose my $50-100k on our house.  I said I’d probably lose my shorts and lose $50-60 and he said shouldn’t be a problem the director just needs to approve it (should have said more, but we weren’t having the 100% serious conversation).

One of the locations is of great interest to me and my wife being in Southportland, ME, but it is about 5 hours from any family.  We only live 2 miles from my in-laws.  The cost of housing is also over 40% more.  Basically I only owe $200k on our house and anything nice goes for $350-600k and up there.  If they gave us even $50k and paid the real estate fees on both houses I would have $100k to put down from selling our house.

How would you go about negotiating?  I plan to add up all the costs of my house to see what ai actually have into it.  What about pay?  The cost of living is much higher and I’m not sure how much to ask for.  I guess it doesn’t matter what I ask for they won’t fire me for asking for a large raise to move.  How would you go about researching how much to ask for?  I’m based out of Painted Post, NY and would be moving to South Portland, ME.  What typical moving packages like?  I don't know what kinds of questions I should ask or what is typically covered if they ask me to move.",Peltonimo,1,1.0,4,1719282861,2024-06-25 02:34:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dnvdzw/work_wants_me_to_move_what_should_i_consider/,6,2024

My professional work history is:

2016-2021 customer service assistant / customer service rep for auto industry manufacturer (was groomed for management for a while before they told me what they were doing, and I told them I wasn’t interested, then was fired for being late but paperwork says position eliminated)

2021-May 2023 client service specialist for ag company (left due to low pay 42k and no room for growth)

May 2023-present customer ops coordinator for chemical company 

The current company I feel is very toxic. Offices are not well taken care of. Management are bullies and punitive. Talk to employees like idiots when they met ask questions. Changing processes every week. Poor communication between departments. Unrealistic expectations. Extremely high turnover (50% since I’ve been there). I’ve almost had panic attacks at work and on the way to work.

I’ve been interviewing for months. Always get rejected. Just called in sick last Wednesday to go to an interview and got rejected today, Monday. I have an interview tomorrow that got scheduled last Friday. Work requires 2 weeks notice to take any time off. The company actually wanted me to come in on Wednesday, but I’m not allowed to take off the last 3 days of the month. So instead they said come in Tuesday and then do a virtual interview Thursday. I said okay, and they scheduled my virtual at 10:30 am for an hour which is when we have a weekly meeting. 

I asked my boss if I could work from home Thursday and she didn’t reply. I’m scared to call in sick for an interview tomorrow just to get rejected, especially when feeling low about not getting the job I took off for last week. 

The job I’m supposed to interview for is in a good location near where my boyfriend and I would like to move. Very solid global company.

1dnobkt,Help please! Not landing initial interviews after 250 applications. ,"I have been aggressively applying to jobs since February with little initial callbacks. Out of over 250 online applications (Indeed.com and LinkedIn.com), I've received 10 phone interviews with 3 leading to a 1st round and 2 leading to 2nd round interviews. No offers. 

Below are some strategies I've applied during my search:

- Hired a professional resume writer to revamp my resume/cover letter/LinkedIn page. 

- Cold applying to jobs on [Indeed.com](http://Indeed.com) and [LinkedIn.com](http://LinkedIn.com) (the two sites I feel are the most legit). I've heard of people 'networking' to your dream companies. However, my dream companies that are local are not hiring within the level of experience of Marketing roles I am applying for (Sr. Manager or above) or do not even respond to my LinkedIn messages, based on the connections I've reached out to. 

- I have tweaked my resume almost to every job application to ensure the right keywords are present and every accomplishment includes a statistical achievement. 

- After applying to top roles, I am finding the Talent Acquisition Manager or VP/Director within Marketing that potentially would be my manager on LinkedIn. I am sending them a post-application email reiterating my strong interest and why I would be a great fit (hunter.io helps you find actual corporate emails). 

- Reached out to marketing/creative staffing agencies to get my resume within their applicant system.

- Had 2 friends who work as recruiters/HR at external companies to review my resume to ensure no oddities. They all said my resume looked great and provided very minimal suggestions to update. 

Does anyone else have any additional insight or is everyone having similar struggles even landing initial interviews regardless of industry? Any other tips?

On an additional note, I also keep seeing LinkedIn career coach influencers that promise landing a job in under 4 months by using the 'Hidden Job Market' that only involves networking. Does this even work in 4 months like they promise? I feel like this is more 'long game' networking and not for those of us who need a job ASAP.

There are many things that I find interesting to possibly specialize in, but one of the reasons that I didn’t go straight into grad school was because I was not sure of what specialty I wanted to do. 

I just want to know if there are any other way for me to become successful without having to go another couple thousand dollars in debt. I managed to get out of college with a whole lot less debt because my parents had a program where they were compensated for their children’s tuition. I just really want to exercise every possible avenue before I decide to go back to school. I still feel like there’s other things that I could do but my mind is kind of just all over the place and there’s so many mixed messages. 

I can’t tell if it’s just my imagination playing tricks on me telling myself that I’ll be able to make it into a job that pays me more than $19 an hour with just my bachelor degree. Maybe I’m not so crazy and there is options for me out there, but I feel like I just don’t know how to access them. I have a job hopped a lot since college due to me, not being able to invest in a certain career. I feel like that has possibly harmed my chances… considering I’ve worked six jobs in four years. But in many instances, I feel like that gives me really advanced skills and shows that I am an adaptable person.

1dnmwdr,How to stay in a job you got disillusioned with?,"I’ve spent all my professional life (around 10 years) working for big corporations. 

I’ve always tended to receive excellent performance reviews, including sentences like, “You did more in your first 6 months than most people do in 2 years.” I’m quick at picking up new skills and have a lot of energy when I see results. I've been in different (although related...) tech roles but I normally find out quickly how to do them well.

However, what I constantly discover is that I’m being used. I’m given more and more tasks and typically excel at them. I have tangible effects. My bosses love me until I ask for something, e.g. inquire about a salary raise. I understand it’s a game and try not to take it personally, but that’s demotivating. I try to talk, once, twice, 3 times, then I get really frustrated. As a result, I switch jobs quite frequently. In the past I normally received +40%-70% to my salary, even more, when switching after a year/ 2 years. I have managed to build up a very good reputation for my skills.

As I'm getting older stability matters more and more to me.

Could you recommend something to help me deal with this pattern? I’m now in a situation again where I was promised a pay raise for taking on additional responsibilities again, and then my boss reneged on that and gaslighted me. I’ve lost all trust with them. I still do my job well, but I hate it so much that it’s almost physically painful to open my laptop every morning.

1dnm4fv,I’m looking to progress along my career path and could use some advice.,"I’ve been working for a large corporation in what’s considered a sales entry level role. I started as a Sales Development Representative in corporate sales about three years ago. At the beginning, the role was in the sales realm and I learned so much throughout my time. Over the last year, the role has shifted over to basically a mass marketing role through email blasts and I’ve become more of an assistant for my boss and it’s more of an administration job at this point. I understand the sales cycles and what it takes to become a successful salesmen in the corporate world and I just don’t think I’m cut out for it. It’s constant cold calling and the work-life balance is teetering toward more work and that’s just not in my long-term goals/plans. I make a pretty good salary with great bonuses and that’s tough to leave behind. It’s come to the point where it’s time for me to move forward in the promotion process and I’m worried I won’t be happy in sales and quite honestly, worried about failure and termination. 

I’m worried to reach out to my direct boss with these concerns. I have a feeling if I were to reach out, they would just get rid of me. Almost every month, we have a corporate wide call where they highlight my work and it’s greatly appreciated. My corporate job has been nothing but good to me. I’m also looking to create my own personal footprint by buying a house in the near future and settle down with my current girlfriend. It all feels like bad timing. On the side, I’ve been browsing different career paths and started looking at the Underwriting world, specifically in Banking.

To get to the point, is there something I should also be doing in the meantime to push me forward in my venture toward new career and life planning?

1dnkf0z,Potential new job interview process taking months - reason for concern?,"Hi everyone - 

I was approached by a recruiter at the end of April for a similar job in my field. While I wasn't necessarily looking to leave my current role, this new job sounded intriguing and would entail a title upgrade, along with a likely pay upgrade. 

I expressed interest and did a zoom call with a hiring manager at the new company in early May.  I felt our call went well and the recruiter said that same. However, I didn't hear anything for \~3 weeks after that and I kind of forgot about the role. However, at the end of May the recruiter reached back out and said that the Company wanted to move me to a second round. Even though it had been a couple weeks, I was excited, an talked to a higher up at the start of June. I also felt this call went well, and came out of the call fairly excited for this potential new role.  
  
The recruiter has since told me he got feedback that the second call went well and they wanted to move me to the next step and that they would keep me posted. However, it's been 3 weeks now and I have heard nothing. The recruiter keeps assuring me they are just busy with their current roles and getting caught up with some other potential candidates before they begin the next round. 

  
Goes without saying, but this is now turning into a multi month long process.  Is gap between interviews and lack of urgency from the new company a red flag? My current company does its hiring at a fairly fast pace so this is new for me.  Still excited about this potential new role, but just curious on opinions on an interview process taking multiple months.

I dabbled in project management at my previous job and I hated it, I can't stand the tedium of moving resources around, checking BOMs, chasing down vendors, and having all of the accountability with very little authority to get shit done.

1dnjy09,Victim of Gatekeeping?,"Victim of Gatekeeping?

I recently returned to my former employer after less than a year in another job. The company lobbied hard to get me back and I’m now making a lot more money to do (mostly) the same job I was in before I left.

After I left, there was a major reshuffle. The person I report to now, on coming back to the company, is a director- like me- with significantly less experience than I have.

The other day, a project was mentioned in an email with some of the upper management. I was not included on it until my supervisor looped me in, but the extent of the thread up to that point was colleagues from other departments saying: “I don’t have any experience with this but I’m happy to help.”

I responded directly to my supervisor saying, as a reminder: these projects are my specialty and are basically part of my job description. I reiterated my experience and told him that he could pass that along to our CEO.

Instead of acknowledging that, my supervisor responded to the group saying something generic like: “With our combined experience, this should be very easy.”

I noticed later that he responded again to the group saying that we should put together a committee.

I was a bit flabbergasted because there is a short timeline and this is literally my job. So I sent another very measured but direct email to my supervisor expressing the view that a committee is not necessary in this scenario and that, historically, we have not used them for projects like this.

He emailed back saying that he understands my points but we still need a committee.

While our relationship is overall very positive, this is not the first time that I have encountered a certain reticence to let me lead or function more independently on the high-profile projects I was working on before I left.

Am I overreacting? I feel somewhat hemmed in and somewhat like I’m not able to distinguish myself or my value. 

Likewise, I feel a bit like my job is being parceled out to people who don’t necessarily have the inclination or experience to handle it.

This company took a chance on me when I had NO experience and they’ve taught me a lot. I recognize they’re a business like everyone else, only care about bottom line, etc etc. But my gut feels bad pulling the rug out from under them after they’ve treated me really well.


I applied for a dream job at a big tech company and got a verbal offer (doubling my salary, going into a field im excited about.) My hopes are high but I’m doing nothing until I have signed the offer letter since I’ve heard big tech companies can be flakey at times.


When/if I sign the offer letter, I want to tell my current job immediately. Stop working for a few weeks while I physically move to a new state and get settled in my new role, then offer part time work while my old job finds someone new. Does this sound OK? If not, how should I navigate this? I’m stressed about physically moving too, I’ve never had to move while under a deadline of starting a new job and the thought of finding an apartment is stressing me out. If anyone has done this before and can offer a timeline or order of operations I’d be grateful.

1dniyh3,What career should I pursue?,"I am a 30-year-old Navy veteran. I am single with no kids. I have a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, both in Criminal Justice. My concentration in my master's degree is cybercrime investigation. I have CompTIA Network+ & Security+. My hobbies are exercising (lifting weights, playing basketball/baseball) and watching sports in general. I have no trade skills, although I am not opposed to learning them. I do have some education in IT of course, and although it is not something that I am dying to learn, I do find it very intriguing and fascinating. I have zero interest in things like cooking, art, and music. I do have some interest in finance and medicine, but virtually zero education on the subjects. 

The reason I got my degrees in criminal justice is because the subject was easy, and I lean slightly towards the IT side of things because basically that was my job field in the military. I have very little interest in law enforcement. I have been arrested before as a teenager and I have tickets, and I know those are not necessarily dealbreakers (or so I've heard), I do not believe I should pursue law enforcement because I will not be fully committed to it.

I do have the GI bill from the military, so going back to school or any kind of education is (thankfully) not a concern. I have 3 years' worth of free education with the GI bill. 

As of right now, I am currently collecting unemployment and living with family (again, very thankful) while I find out what to do. I left the military with an Honorable discharge, but due to certain disabilities that I've documented, I am about 99.99% sure I will not be able to go back in.

1dni2ud,to quit or not to quit?,"I (24F) have been working at my new job for the last few weeks. This job is my first post-grad job with my bachelors degree (yay). The job is in social services / housing stabilization (helping vulnerable adults attain housing that is appropriate). 
I had a not so great gut feeling before starting the job, but really pushed myself to give it a chance. I think I was just really excited to accept a post-grad job and be able to leave the job I had, and therefore “convinced” myself it was a good fit more than I usually would. Now that I am 2.5-3 weeks in, I wish I would have listened to my gut. The role is hybrid, with my time spent at home or out in the community. I can choose to stop by the office if I’d like a place to work, but I have no expectations to collaborate with any other staff or in-office requirements. I really wanted the job experience for myself and for my resume (I plan to apply for grad school in the future) but the concerns are outweighing the benefits and causing me mental distress. 

Here are some of my concerns and information about the role:
- low pay (which I *was* okay with since I am a new grad)
- But - I am not guaranteed 40 hours a week. This was not clear prior to onboarding. I am responsible for making my own hours, and if  a client meeting falls through, that time is gone. I don’t work a set schedule and don’t clock in (ex. 9-5). 
- High turnover (I have yet to meet anyone who has worked here for more than 6 months, and many new hires have left before finishing their trainings)
- Low support from supervisors - many new hires that started before me have expressed that they feel unsupported and are not able to help their clients. Everyone seems to be on the lookout for a second job or new job entirely (or at least have the idea of doing so in the back of their mind). 
- After weeks of training I do not feel prepared to guide people in the process of attaining housing or in solving obstacles that stand in their way of housing (examples include criminal records, rental history, income/funding). 
- As part of my training, I am supposed to have a few “shadows” to see current staff in the community with their clients. ALL of these shadows have fallen through, so I have had no exposure to real-life interactions with clients. 
- I am definitely someone who is energized by spending time around others, so the nature of the hybrid work has me feeling deflated and down. (I have diagnosed ADHD-inattentive type if that tells you much lol)

I have a few days before I get my first full caseload, and I worry about this. I do not feel like I can support these individuals and I feel worrysome about being intertwined in their lives. I will certainly do my best to support them and use any resources I can locate, but I worry about my ability to fulfill their needs. I feel like I owe the position more time to give it a fair chance, but I think I already know it won’t work out. I just hate feeling like a quitter. 

I know it will be harder to quit once I start working on this case load because there will be people dependent on me. However, if I give the job more time to see if I change my feelings, this will have to be a consequence. 

Please be mindful and considerate with your responses. I have been feeling very emotional regarding this issue and it’s been very heavy on my mind.

1dnhem6,Do you know if any of these assumptions I have about being fired aren't true?,"Here are some general assumptions I have about being fired:

1. If you're fired you can hide the fact that you were fired pretty easily. When you apply somewhere new it's basically a guarantee they won't ask you if you were fired and no one will know/care.

2. All of your PTO will be paid out when you're fired. Unless what you did to get fired was really bad.

3. Being fired is basically equivalent to being laid off. In other words, the consequences of being fired and being laid off are basically the same. The only difference really is that if you're laid off you can come back to the company.

4. When you're fired, the company makes it very obvious to you at least a month before getting fired. Like, it's basically a guarantee people get fired without knowing it at least a few weeks ahead of time.

5. Unless you work for a very competitive company, you generally have to be really bad at your job to be fired. Like, at most jobs you could probably not do good work half the time and you wouldn't be fired.


Are any of these assumptions very inaccurate?",Ben5544477,0,0.5,4,1719245752,2024-06-24 16:15:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dnhem6/do_you_know_if_any_of_these_assumptions_i_have/,6,2024

1dngesx,What is the best way to discuss salary if a pay cut is acceptable?,"
For context, I am currently looking to find a job in a new field due mostly to mental health reasons. I am willing to take a pay cut if the job is preferable to me. 

I am currently making 165k. I have been targeting 175-200 for my next position. From the interviews and job listings I’ve found so far, this is about average for my title and experience. Some go much higher, and a few are lower. 

I found a position I am interested in, but their salary range is 112-135k. I have worked this out budget wise, and this salary range is manageable to me. 

The company has asked if the salary range meets my expectations. What is the best way to handle this? Do I just say, “yes that is acceptable”? Should I mention it’s lower than I have been interviewing for, but acceptable? I don’t want to sound like I am sucking up, but I’d much rather have a better job even if it means lower pay. However, I would also obviously prefer an offer on the higher end of their range if possible.

1dnga8q,A position was created for me and two others - I didn't even get an interview. ,"**TL;DR - I wasn't granted an interview for a role I was doing in addition to my usual job that expanded into a full-time position. There was a broad tacit understanding I would be offered the full-time role, but I wasn't even given an interview. I don't know how I should feel or what my next steps should be.** 



I work in insurance for a fortune 100 property & casualty carrier. I've worked my whole 13 year career with this carrier, which is well regarded in the industry for how it treats employees and having a very defined culture internally. The industry has been going through a rough time the last 4 years and morale and treatment of employees has suffered some - but we're still generally above average. 

I've had 4 roles during that period in completely different departments - sales, claims, small market underwriting, middle market underwriting. Each move was a promotion and I have a very positive brand as someone who can pivot easily and has exceptional communication skills. I have multiple reviews from different bosses saying I am the standard for how to speak with others. I do not have a degree - but everyone assumes I do and I no longer get asked about it in interviews. 

For the past two years in my current role, I've been charged with assisting users on a new policy administration system that I have experience with in addition to my day job. The new system is full of bugs and defects and users are extremely frustrated and disengaging as a result. 

When they formalized a workstream for handling triage of these defects, I was the sole point of contact and over a period of months, but over time the duties grew and when our team size doubled, they asked two others to assist. 

They've recently decided that the work warrants full-time attention and are hiring 5 roles dedicated to the work and the three of us have been involved in decision-making for what that role looks like, and shaping the standard of work. We've been told to wait several months for HR to approve these positions and greatly expanded our involvement since January. A new external hire executive is in charge of finding a leader for this new team and hiring the four associates under them. 

I applied, pre-screen for the role -- and got a decline. My boss was shocked/upset and reached out to the new executive who advised that she let the recruiter do all the prescreening. I reached out to the recruiter and tactfully asked for feedback on my application. 

The feedback I got was that there are people in the department who have already been doing this work for years and have expertise, so it's hard to compete with them. I replied back that I was one of those three people and she never replied. My boss has since asked the recruiter to take accountability for not reading my resume and for providing an odd canned response, and I'm waiting on that now - but it certainly seems like I'm not going to get an interview, regardless. The other two people who joined halfway through the process and have less experience, but otherwise identical qualifications did get interviews. 

I am so... angry.. and confused. My boss has validated those feelings and clearly expresses them to some extent, as well. She's encouraging me to put on a brave face and stay engaged and ""kill them with kindness"" and it makes me feel powerless in the face of something that doesn't make sense. I know HR isn't my friend and I know I wasn't guaranteed anything - but the recruiter telling me that I didn't get an interview because I was competing with myself just.. makes me feel insane. That seems like an innocent mistake that gets corrected and you get back on track, but everyone except me and my boss is kind of shrugging and saying well, better luck next time I guess. 

I know the response is going to largely be ""Go find another job, they fucked you and now you know not to be loyal."" and I have already responded to some recruiters reaching out, but... really what I'm looking for is help making sense of what happened here and what my next steps should be.

I get the sense that there's this window of opportunity where I can influence the outcome that is closing - I am usually pretty meticulous about what I am/am not in control of and letting things go if I can't do anything. But in this case I feel like.. I can still talk to people, I can still nudge. It just feels like.... there's something off that if I can just say the right thing at the right time people will go ""Oooooh I see what happened, let's get that fixed.""

Either way.. I appreciate anyone who was willing to read this and offer their insight.

1dng11u,Paid holiday scam?,"I’m facing a predicament at my work… we are technically “salary” but since our salaries fall below the state minimum exempt threshold ($67 k in Washington State) our company made us non exempt salary employees so we can get over-time. But on weeks when there is a paid federal holiday, it is practically impossible to get overtime because the holiday paid time off does not count towards working hours. 

So theoretically, our boss can make us work 10 hour days for the rest of the week and we’d still be paid the same. What’s the point of paid time off then (at least for salaried folks), if we are still working 40 hrs? Some of us cannot commit to ten hour work days and maybe don’t want to for a variety of reasons.

Perhaps I can even major in something to see if I like it or not, so I would like suggestions if you have any.

I’m pretty creative, a pretty fervent writer with an overactive imagination. I have an urge to learn more about history and culture, meeting different people along the way. I like seeing new places (and having adhd, it makes my brain happy). I’m best in English (a 32 on reading for my act was my highest score). I’m not great at math, but do okay (no C’s).


I’m very tolerant and open minded, but need variety in my life. Doing a “normal” office job sounds like a depressing life for me personally. Even school has nearly broken me.


I love drawing as well, but I doubt I could make a career out of it so it is less relevant. I also love music and film, having diverse tastes in both and spending most of my time consuming them. 

I can’t really describe what I want to do but I’m always asked the question by adults, I saw anthropology but I haven’t settled on that.


 I’m also not sure if I’m really fit to travel the world (mental health issues) but it is the most interesting thing I can imagine doing with my life. (I want to know what it’s like to live a life besides my own).

Postpone grad school, continue job hunting until I find a salaried job, move out

Con: I don't know when I will get hired / could be a waste of time and missing the opportunity of school

**Path #2:**

Go to grad school, stay at home for another year, graduate with a job (hopefully)

Con: Staying at home, gamble what salary I can get (is grad school worth it? especially for real estate?), what if real estate is not something I want long-term?

**Path #3**

Switch mortgage companies to one that gives me structure, go to grad school

Con: as a mortgage loan officer I only get paid in commission, what if that's not stable enough? what if it is stable enough and then grad school was a waste of time?

1dnfuoo,Feel like I’m being gaslit by everyone around me. I’d really appreciate objective advice. ,"I’m 23 years old, graduated with a management degree in 2023. 

I’m in the Midwest USA.

I worked for a small manufacturing company in college and accepted a job offer from them after graduation to become the fulfillment manager. 

I manage a team of 8 and in small business fashion, my job duties are numerous. From inventory management, to customer relations, to creating and maintaining the fulfillment schedule, to interviewing, and to maintaining the facility itself since there isn’t a maintenance team.

That brings me to the compensation. Preface: I signed the dotted line. I resent nobody, I agreed to this. 

I signed on at $47,000 a year with 3% yearly increases. My one year just came around. However, the only benefit was an annual bonus. Last year that was a 2% of salary bonus. No insurance or anything else. 

I’m getting married in a month and it’s just gotten me thinking. I’ve loved the experience I’ve been getting, I’m learning a LOT with the experience of doing so much within a small business. 

But my salary isn’t great. I don’t have insurance and marriage will disqualify me from my parent’s coverage. 

But any time I talk to anyone except my fiance who supports me no matter what, they tell me the experience is worth it and I’m not in a bad gig. My mother especially tells me I’m being a product of my generation and expecting more than I’m worth.

1dnfrrd,Been at a new internal role for 4 months and not being given enough work. Should I start looking for another job?,"Hi all,

A bit of background about my career so far: 8 years of Finance experience and currently a Finance Manager. Been at my parent company (a global ad agency) for almost 3 years and recently moved internally to another agency 4 months ago.

I moved internally to another team about 4 months ago as a Finance Manager. Since then, I made two significant improvements to the team/agency: streamlining one of the automated reports and creating a database for our month close general ledger. Aside from that, I haven't really been learning much on the job or being given responsibilities. I am mainly tasked with creating new processes or working on random ad-hoc projects/tasks. I'm usually the most busy for about 5 days out of the month. It feels like I'm just the guy who's given work when no one else has the bandwidth.

My check-ins with my manager are usually cancelled or pushed because she's so busy but when we do meet, I do voice that I want to learn more and be more involved. She apologizes and says she will try to involve me more. I also ask if there's anything I can help with but to no avail. 

Although I understand 4 months is still early and it usually takes 6 months to a year to become acclimated, I feel that my progress hasn't been upwards in terms of learning the lingo, becoming familiar with processes, and having my recurring roles and responsibilities. I feel like these come slowly and begin to ramp up over time but it hasn't been the case for me. If anything, I feel less of a Finance Manager and more of a Sr. Analyst.

Today I was able to confirm my drug screening were completed. I already got confirmation last week that all 3 reference checks were sent back to the recruiter. Background check done with the state police will take weeks to come back. My start date is 7/10. 

My initial plan was to have all pre-screening activities done prior to giving my two week notice. However I did not realize it will take this long. 

This is my first time having such an extensive pre employment screening being done.

Should I give a last minute notice to my current employer? Any suggestions or feedback?

1dndlvy,Should I approach this person for a potential opportunity or is it not worth the risk? ,"My company is struggling at the moment and to be honest I am kind of annoywith them for how they have acted while I have been at this conference. There is a serious chance I will not have a job in around ~3 months. 

That being said, if I am made redundant, I should get my notice period pay, which is around 3 months worth. This would be crucial to me financially as I have not been able to muster much of a rainy day fund. 

With all this in mind, I have been working with a distributor for our company who is looking to take on more of our products. I think he treats his employees really well and I would like to work for him. Working for them would likely mean relocating to a new country. 

Hes seen me go above and beyond for my company over the last few days, and he has talked a lot about how well he treats his workers and took me and my colleague out for drinks. 

Would it be wrong for me to ask him to keep me in mind for future opportunities? I feel like because our companies are working together, if he took me on it might cause an issue, it would also be majorly bad if he chose to pass this on to my boss.

I've even started another master's degree hoping to gain some non-technical skills so I can work in an office with other people.

1dndb83,Shifting to Business Development after Consulting - does it make sense?,"Hey folks,

I'm looking for feedback on whether the career pivot I'm planning makes sense, and how to best present transferable skills in the resume / during interviews.

Background: master's in physics, 4 years experience in a small strategy consulting firm doing market research work: due diligences, market sizings, go to market strategy, competitive analysis etc.

I enjoy the strategic problem solving that I've been doing for our clients. Discovering new markets, identifying customer needs, planning next steps to grow the business. I want to keep doing this, but for 1 company, not in a consulting environment.

Is ""Business Development Manager"" a good role for this kind of work? I get the sense that it's a blend of sales and strategy - I'm more keen on creating the plans rather than executing them.

1dnc3i6,"Asking for a friend (late 30s M, US) where he could search for work given his very specific situation... ","I recently reconnected with a HS/College friend whom I'd like to try to help a little bit. Given the delicate nature of the situation, I am going to omit a lot of details, so just please take what I say at face value. 

The person in question graduated college in early 2010s with a BA in Economics and a 3.7gpa. Public school, but well known and respected. 

Due to personal issues, they have not really held any jobs since. Don't want to go into details there. 

Let's just say that at this point in their life, they are on a good path, they are living with a very caring relative, so food and shelter is provided. Not seeking full time work at all (5-10 hours a week would be more than enough given where they are at), and remote is 100% necessary. Simple Excel work would suffice. Does not have to pay well at all, the money would be going into a savings account for when they are in a better place in life. Just something to start having some semblance of work experience to put down on a resume in a few years. 

Where it gets a bit problematic is that they receive disability income, so preferably this would be some gig-type thing that won't immediately offset that income, in case it doesn't work out in a few months and ends up being a net negative for their finances.

I am currently working as a senior developer with around 14 years of experience and have been based in Australia for the past couple of years. I've been considering transitioning into a DevOps role and would love to hear from those who have made a similar move or have insights into the pros and cons of such a career shift.

Here are a few specific questions I have:

Skills and Learning Curve: How steep is the learning curve for someone coming from a senior developer background?

Career Growth: How does the career growth trajectory in DevOps compare to that of a senior developer? Are there more opportunities for advancement and higher earning potential?

Job Satisfaction: How does the day-to-day work and overall job satisfaction in DevOps compare to that of a senior developer?

Job Market: What is the current job market like for DevOps professionals in Australia? Is there a high demand for DevOps skills, and how competitive is the field?

Work-Life Balance: How does the work-life balance in DevOps roles compare to that of senior developers? Are there significant differences in workload and stress levels?

Appearing for TSCPGET Msc Microbiology or Msc Biotechnology.Not so good colleges in Hyderabad for Masters. Already a gap year since last year. 

Not interested : in Research or Academia. Publications or Journals. Extensive amount spent in laboratories. Wasting years appearing for other competitive exams like CSIR NET, IIT-JAM or can say not so intelligent to crack them. Not interested in PhD either as of now.
Tried getting into tech or learning but it's seems to be a bit too much for me as I am not into technical stuff and can't do self learning in this aspect.
Realising pay will be very low as well as the specialization will make it even harder to do things.

Last option left would be to get into teaching after MSc.
Even that's a bit unrealistic.

Interested in : Have always been interested in Healthcare and Medicine. Was a NEET student but couldn't afford a long-term and was a General Category student. Didn't try again for the next years either. Couldn't have cracked it on self-learning anyways. Covid years. Appeared for TS EAMCET but parents didn't agree for PharmD or Bpharm. Decided to just get done with Bsc degree and get into MSc. Realised halfway this isn't what I wanted to be in.
Is medical lab technician a good choice for me now? I have no idea how to get into this? Which institutes offer this? Is it PGDMLT? What's the outcome of this?

TS ICET is gone too. How's MBA in healthcare management? Let me know about the career outcomes of this?


Should I just take another gap year and figure out what I want to do? Change my stream?
Parents want me to get my master's, but I am worried I'll struggle with the job market even then. Or should I go for double masters to US after my master's in India?

Is there even any scope in Microbiology Biotechnology? I feel it's a dead end field which only requires highly intelligent people? Or even if it doesn't it's usually very limited.

Or there might be a problem with me and my decision making skills or in general capabilities.

Anybody knows how to climb ladders and get into a stable job in Hyderabad?

1dn96nl,Making Difficult Decisions,"I'm curious about how do you guys make difficult career/life decisions.

I'm a foreigner currently working in China. I work in a very easy job in Guangzhou as a high school teacher, where I get paid around 32k yuan and only have to work 14-16 hours per week, and I don't have to stay at the office the rest of the time. However for various reasons todo with the regulations, I have to find a new job. I have a girlfriend here and I've made some friends, but nothing too strong. I would prefer to stay in this city, but the job offers I got here are not that great. They are mostly around the same amount or lower pay and with office hours, although in schools with very good reputation/resume value (I suppose thats why they offer low). I was offered a much higher salary, as the head of the department in another city in the north, far away. It's on the outskirts of the city, with not much to do around there, maybe 1 hour away from the downtown, but a city of similar size. They offered me close to 50k, but it would come with more responsibilities, and higher workload. I haven't done any management jobs before. The school has a good reputation, but if I was to go there it would be a major change, and might cause the end of my relationship, and I am not sure I could take the responsibility. So far in my life, however, I've basically dove in the deep end in every career move and its ended up alright.

1dn8gvn,22M + career concerns are driving me crazy!?,"
Hey

So I (22M, London) feel incredibly uncomfortable with the idea of not knowing what my next steps should be. Any help would be amazing. 

For context, I have a job working for a big company as a building services apprentice. I’m about 1.5 years from finishing my apprenticeship, at the end I will be a fully qualified electrician and building services engineer. I earn about £40,000 p/year before tax currently due to working 6 days a week with double pay overtime and fees for the inconvenience of doing so. I started this apprenticeship with the goal of learning about construction, towards a career in property. I’m still interested in this, but it takes time and will likely be a side hustle for a long period. 

Do I enjoy my work? Not really. Do I hate it? No. The people are pretty fun to be around but I don’t particularly fit in and I find the work to be quite mundane. 

I am however, really interested in video editing and videography. I started a business with my friend fairly recently doing this, and it’s good fun but obviously a serious hustle to get to places (which is fine, I am very motivated). I also do feel like I have a talent for it, which is nice. 

My goal is to eventually travel the world with my girlfriend, which means that I’d really like to digitalise my work, and my current job does not allow me to do that at all.

My question is: Am I wasting my time working in an industry for a year and a half to then not work in that same industry after? Should I quit and focus on digital? 

Thank you so much for reading.

1dn85mh,Can’t move out bc Boss keeps messing up my pay stubs even after 2 months of trying. Is he being sketchy or does he just care that little? :/,"I’m so sorry if this is the wrong sub for this, it seemed like the most appropriate for my situation but I wasn’t 100% sure..

Also I didn’t read any of this back it’s past 3:30am hell nah

Background—

-I’m almost 19 but don’t understand how the majority of this kind of paperwork stuff works, so I’m sorry if I'm completely clueless on something that seems like common sense!
-Boss doesn’t speak English as his first language and I have bad auditory processing issues and not so great ears. We can have more communication issues than usual, but we are as clear and concise as possible over text, and I’ll utilize my manager or a coworker if I’m having any trouble with verbal communication.
-His restaurant might technically be a small business, but Boss is loaded as fuck. He’s the landlord of the majority of the kitchen staff.
-I try not to nag or annoy my boss as much as possible because he has a tendency to drastically cut someone’s hours if he’s mad at them, if not completely cut them for that week. I already missed out on almost a full month of work due to a fractured ankle (I could walk fairly soon on it since it wasn’t a weight bearing bone but I guess he didn’t want someone in a boot sitting tables). 

Short version—
  I’ve been trying to get my pay stubs to lease a student apartment since the end of April, and I still don’t have all the paperwork I need. I’m several deadline extensions past and there is barely a doubt in my mind that I’m not going to be able to move out this year. There is a little teeny tiny doubt though, because I’m still trying. Just in case. 

  The first few paystubs took him about a week each to get to me, and that’s only because a week is how long it took me to start asking about it. Once I said something he sent them to my phone the same day. But he was repeatedly fucking them up by giving me the wrong month, only giving me one month instead of the two I asked for, or I find out he’s in fucking Vegas so I had to wait even longer  for him to get the rest to me. But oh no! So much time has passed that my most recent pay stub is no longer what I have! So we play the game again.. 
  At one point, after a week of waiting I texted him asking if they’d be ready soon, to which he replied “How about this, it would be better if I give you a work certificate”. I said no because the whole point was they needed proof of income and the paystub was sent to be the same day. I know for sure our bartender has had the same issue, and we had a manager quit a little bit ago because “he was refusing to give her her pay stubs.” The manager quitting is by word or mouth from coworkers that aren’t friends with her outside of when she would work here so I’m not 100% on that one, but I plan on asking around during my shift tomorrow, and message her myself if need be. 
  Basically, my biggest concern is that this is because he’s doing something sketchy. Originally I thought he just couldn’t be bothered, but after talking to one of the friends I would have moved in with and hearing their thoughts, the more I look at the whole thing the more I worry.
I might have forgotten something, but it’s currently past 3:00am and I wrote this after the long version and I cannot be bothered to reread the long version to check. There’s a list of other funky things he does at the bottom of the post.
  

Long version—
  I’ve been trying to rent out a student apartment for a few months, but my boss takes so long to get me my pay stubs that I’ve needed to get the next months as well multiple times. After weeks of frustration and multiple deadline extensions, all I needed was a “letter from my employer on letter head” stating how many hours I worked. Unfortunately, I found out later that same day that my boss had gone on a family trip to Vegas for 2 days that he only told one employee he would be taking, and wouldn’t be able to write it for me till he got back.
  I just emailed the apartments that I’d get them the paperwork as soon as I could and asked if there was anything else they needed so I could get it all at once, since I’d already been a slow pain in the ass for them for several weeks and it seemed really unprofessional to blame it on the big man. Especially since I had told them “it takes my boss about 2 weeks to get them to me, this is the main reason I’ve been unable to finish my application sooner.” in an earlier email… 

  I guess they got impatient and ended up calling the store itself to confirm my employment with my manager, and let me know that all I had left to do was get a guarantor, which was a little aggravating since the apartment only asked me for the paystubs because the I was struggling so much with company I was hoping to use as a guarantor. I’m honestly not even sure what the purpose of giving them the paperwork was since I had (thought) I had given them everything they needed from me, except the guarantor. It was stupid of me too assume that I wouldn’t need the guarantor, but I guess I hoped that I had been making enough money that I qualify without or something since my savings alone could cover over half the year’s rent.
  Definitely an fuck up on my part, but I had completely given up on the guarantor and ignored their email (requesting another paystub as one of the two required was only half of the full month) for two weeks while I worked with the apartment. I thankfully already had the paystub they needed since the apartment needed it as well, so I sent that along with an apology for the delay.

  Which brings us to this week! The company I’m trying to use as a guarantor asked me for my mid-June paystub, so I sent him a screenshot of the email and apologized for needing more paperwork because he was getting fussy from all the shit I needed from him. He never responded to my text, but talked to me about it very briefly in the kitchen the next night during my shift. While I forget the exact phrasing, what I got from the conversation was that the company was annoying for needing so much paperwork from him/me. I apologized, agreed, and went back to work a little annoyed because the only reason they needed so much was because he was only giving me part of what I need and then by the time I get the rest too much time has passed and it’s no longer my latest paystub, so the cycle continues.

  Admittedly, my hearing isn’t the greatest and I have fairly bad auditory processing, so it’s always a possibility that I might mishear or miss things entirely when it comes to verbal conversations. I struggle with fully hearing and understanding a typical American accent sometimes and often don’t even fully process that I didn’t understand what was said to me till I completely walk away. 
   I usually just apologize and ask them to tell me again, but people can get annoyed with that really fast and my boss has a tendency to significantly cut the hours of employees he’s upset with, so I try my best not to do anything that might build up to that. 
  Of course, just because I don’t wanna annoy more than I have to doesn’t mean I’m not willing to make other people do it for me! In the case of paperwork I ask my manager to pester him for me half the time so it’s not always my face and voice he’s growing frustrated with. If you don’t check in on him getting the papers, he will just. Not. So I’m always sure to check in with important shit! 
  So today I had checked in about the mid-June, via text about an hour after my shift because it was too busy for me to talk with him the majority of the night and when it was finally slow enough a customer called in asking for a full refund on a over $100 take out because there was a piece of plastic in their rice. So he was pissy and fuck no I am not asking that man for paperwork while he’s in a mood. I also texted my manager asking to double check because this man likes to ignore my texts sometimes and it couldn’t wait for tomorrow because he’s going out of town for two more weeks even though he was just in Vegas earlier this week, and I know he’s not doing shit while he’s gone. 
  Come to find out (from my manager, not him), he “can’t do week by week paystubs”. Which would have been wonderful to know two days ago when I first asked him about it. So now I’m trying to find a way to professionally let both the apartment and the guarantor company know that I’m trying my best to get them the paperwork as soon as I can, but that’s just not a priority for my boss…

  In all honesty, I expected I would never get the apartment after the first month of trying to politely tell my boss he fucked up again after waiting a week and a half for another paystub. While the whole situation is really infuriating, and I’ve had to give up on moving out this year because of his incompetence, the thing that’s really making me paranoid is the thought that it’s not actually incompetence that’s taking him so long.
  The bartender has had the same issue when trying to move apartments, and a long time employee quit about a month ago. I thought she had left because she was promised a manager position at the new restaurant my boss was opening up, but everyone working at that location was paid shit, especially compared to what the same people were making at the original location, and had just gotten fucked over. Today though, one of my coworkers had told me it was because the boss was fully refusing to give her any pay stubs. This is just another chucklefuck(affectionate) and not someone who knows her outside of working together or would be involved in the situation itself, so I’m definitely not 100% believing it yet. I plan on asking my manager for the details tomorrow, and I might even just send her a message asking about it. That just seems a little awkward though..

  My friend I would have moved in with, and has been getting real time updates throughout this, is really suspicious that he’s underpaying us or something along those lines, and that’s why it’s so difficult to get them from him. The more shit that happens the more I worry something along those lines is the case. 


Notable stuff—
-I waited about a week before asking for an update on the first few pay stubs I asked for and, every time, once I asked I would have the pay stub the same day, if not the day right after.
-After asking for an update on one of them, he tried to.. like- negotiate? To just give me a “work certificate” instead because “it would be better”??… and when I said no because they needed proof of income he got the pay stub to me the very same day?
-He does all of the calculations by hand with a plastic calculator. How much we make from hourly, how many tips, and the tax deductions. -He’s not very good at it. He frequently forgets entire shifts and never gets our checks to us on time.
-Our hours aren’t tracked in a computer- it’s all written down on sticky notes. The servers each get their own for the day with each cash tip written out along with their hours. Is Hosts all share one, with the hours of each person listed and the sum of our card tips (which I believe he gets a cut of, I’m just not sure how much).
-Hourly is by the half hour only. You’re going home at 9:45? Either stay leave at ten or you’re not getting shit for that extra 15 minutes.
I’ve been told on two occasions that he expects servers (who are getting $2.50/hr) to come in half an hour early to get side work done off the clock. -There are definitely servers that don’t do this, so I’m not sure what the specifics or how serious actually this is.
-Servers have to have all of their cash tips put up at the host stand, where we put it all in a container and write down exactly how much it was. They aren’t allowed to write it themselves, the host must do it for them. He will sometimes look in a checkbook and put it back to catch if the server is pocketing any of it.

Anything helps! Verification that I’m not just paranoid, verification that I am just paranoid and this is just what a chuck of bosses are like, I just need some outside eyes :/

1dn7y1t,Was fired today. ,"
Got fired from my security guard job today  3 months in and it’s hit me pretty hard. I started this job right after getting my NSW 1A security license, which I jumped into 4 months after finishing high school. I chose security because I thought it would be stable and not too demanding like something I could handle.  I have low self-esteem and doubt my capabilities in any work environment. 

Instead of starting with simple foot patrols to learn the layout of the mall, they threw me into CCTV operations right away which you dont get trained for when you learn to be a security guard at all. It was overwhelming because it was a huge responsibility and I didn’t have much experience even just walking the floor. Managing the cameras, guiding other guards, and dealing with calls was a lot, and pretty soon my managers noticed I wasn’t keeping up a month in.

They tried to help me improve by moving me between the control room and the floor to “upskill.” I even had to sign an agreement that I’d have to work on being clearer and louder on the radio and phone. They gave me two weeks to show improvement. Turns out, I didn’t meet their standards, and just three months in, they let me go. The job exasperated my anxiety and depression and i had to get medicated to manage it. I was also starting to feel unfulfilled in my job.

When i was fired they did say i did some awesome things at my job and that it was a pleasure working with me and that i have plenty of time to figure things out which was nice.

Feeling really down about it because if I can’t make it in a job I thought would be simple, I’m worried about aiming for anything higher like cybersecurity or video editing, which I'm interested in but seem way more intense and require a lot more intelligence than being a floor guard which I feel incompetent enough at that. I’m 19, and seeing everyone else my age going to university and figuring things out already makes me  feel even worse, like I’m already so far behind.

1dn7efm,"Quitting my job to travel without much savings, need your advice","Hi people,
Not really sure if this is the right community to post this. I have a job that pays me well. I have friends who are fun to hangout with. My family is not a pain in the ass(joking, i love them)
 
But there is this huge anxiety,  restlessness and this feeling of bieng stuck in my country. I so strongly feel the urge to mixup with different cultures, meet tons of new people, view things with a lot of new perspectives, learn new skills and explore my life beyond the regular. I feel I am missing out on a huge chunk of my life working at my home. 

I am quitting my job as a software engineer next month after coming to the conclusion this is not what I want to do in my life and I can’t take up with this domain anymore just for the sake of a comfortable life. I am 25 right now. I want to work on myself to become an entrepreneur. If that doesn’t work out just in case, I would work towards switching my career to strategy consulting. 

Is there a way to travel and make enough for a decent survival while working on my ideas? Or live for a couple of months in one of my bucket list travel destinations to work on my ideas alongwith doing something that can fund my basic expenses of rent, food + some miscellaneous. Or some other options. 
(PS: I have enough savings to last 6-9 months in my home country but don’t want to spend that on travel)

1dn6t7c,I am Thinking in quitting my job. Need some perspective,"Hello Guys, I need some prespective.  
  
My apologies if I make some mistakes, English is not my first language.

I have been working for a madical company for over 2 years as technician (my company groups job roles in bands that determine the salary range of an employee, in my case my band is higher than an engineer level I, nonetheless, my job is still of a technician, although my job is more administrative than a typical operational technician role) and I have learned a lot related to my work. I have participated in key projects for my unit, led meetings with other branches and SQE to resolve quality issues, including meetings attended by the plant manager of my site. I have participated in CAPA investigations and resolved some CAPA actions, and I have received recognition for my work from the Quality Lead of my site.

The reason I am writing this is because I had 1:1 with my supervisor. She is thrilled with my performance and is currently working with our manager on my next step with our manager, however, she is offering me a POSIBILITY of a level I engineer (is not even an official offer, and apparently, I need to earn it first), my problem with this is ,as I stated above, Engineer I is in a band below my current job position. Even If i accepted the move, I will need to wait another 2 years to finally move to engineer II due to company policies, without mention that posibility that I may alrady at the top of that band, so my salary will not grow unlesa I get a promotion. Another issue is that she did not give me a clear development plan for my career, only vague promises of promotion in different departments. This makes me feel unsure because I do not see a clear career path that my managers have in mind for me.

I do not want to sound ungretful for the opportunity nor for my supervisor's efforts to promote me, but I have read job postings of Engineer I from my enterpirse, and others organisation, I noticed that the minimum requirements are 0 to 2 years and a bachelors degree. I have a bachelor's degree, more than 2 years of experince, I kwon the hole process back and froth, and currently I am in a process of obtain a master's degree, and I think I have proven my worth in this organization, sorry if sound a bit cocky, but I can not help feeling frustrated since it seems all my efforts and hard work are unappreciated or unnoticed, and the company prefers to hire new employees rather than develop the ones they have. I have talked to my supervisor and expressed my feelings, but she told me there is nothing she can do and that the decisions come from the manager.  


I need some advice, At this moment I am thinking in just quitting my job, and foucs solelyon my master's degree and than look for a better job. Perhaps you could give me another prespective that I have not taking in account? 

Anyways, thank you for reading this.

1dn6fwp,"End of the road degree-wise, what now?","**Context:** I was in my last quarter of my degree about 2 years ago. I had a moment and, long story short, I dropped out. I decided to try to finish the classes and so I've been going in and out of school for the past two years. The issue is that I have had the hardest two years of my degree (even thought it's almost no work at all), because having to confront my failure over and over has made me very erratic and unproductive and it gets worse every term (idk what that's about.. Im seeing someone for that).

Here's the actual issue. I just boofed my final class, for the second time. At my school you only get two tries and my path to grad is already super complicated because I dropped out. As much as I want this degree, I really don't want to wait a year to start working a non-service job (Im the worst waitress in the world #savethecusties). I need to move on, because it's been two years of this. With all the technicalities Im working around it's gonna be a whole long thing; Im ready for this to be a side project.

**Actual Q:** I want to know what the ethical expectation is for interviewing with a mostly completed degree that is not officiated by the college. Ive passed all the classes, but one. Should I say I have the degree or just write the years attended and my major. What do I say if asked?

1dn6e20,I have the opportunity to decide my own job title - can you help me?,"Hello. I'm travelling right now and I will for a few years. However I do have some free time and I decided to volunteer for a new mental health organisation (they mostly offer counselling).

I was hired as a content writer but things are not moving along because the marketing manager is not very active to be honest, also the CEO likes me so much she told me she wants me to do more, she told me to think about my job title (as in create a new job title for myself) and how I would like to move forward. She mentioned at some point ""director"" of something but it was vague. I think she'd be happy tho if I got bigger level of responsibilities.

Now, I know this is unpaid and being a new organisation, no profit, etc I won't be doing much for a while, but I'm taking this as an opportunity for a career in the future. So I'm thinking of this job title as something I can use for when I am ready to find an actual paid job.

I am just not sure what job title/description I should give them?

In my ideal job, here's the things I would like to be/experience. Keep in mind this is me fantasizing:

- I would like to manage people, groups or individuals 
- I want to be able to work mostly from home
- I want to be able to make decisions about the business/staff etc
- I want people to come to me for issues/I want to do problem solving 
- I want a typical 9-5pm salary, minimum £35k but I don't actually want to be at the desk from 9-5... What I mean is that I want a job where I can decide my schedule 
- have meetings with other organisations for collaborations etc 
- my career related interests: digital marketing, event management, business strategy, project management, branding 

I can't think of anything else but surely there's more. What job title fits this description I gave you? And how can I present it to the CEO?

Any more suggestions? Thanks!!!",btnreddit,1,1.0,0,1719208445,2024-06-24 05:54:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dn6e20/i_have_the_opportunity_to_decide_my_own_job_title/,6,2024

It is in the state I’m from giving me an extra motivation to fight for the kids I’m serving as I have a personal connection to the community. Recently however I’ve noticed myself become burnt out from putting in so many hours. Also, I love the outdoors and have fantasized about the possibility of living elsewhere. Also, my income 28M is only 40k a year. I panic when my friends talk about finances as I feel leagues behind them.

I got a job offer in a high cost of living area near the mountains where I already have a few friends doing a similar job to what I do now. The pay would be a 20k raise as well. It seemed like a great organization, but instead of being excited all I could feel was the pain of leaving my community that I’ve fought for here. It felt like betrayal to do community work in a community that isn’t my own. Yet I still have a desire for new experiences as the city I live in itself doesn’t offer the extent of entertainment options I would like. 

I felt I needed to be bold and accept the pay raise along with a more ideal social setting and accepting the job. I immediately felt regret and the pain of all the goodbyes, so much so that I turned down the offer. Now I regret that decision, feeling stuck in my current situation. It seems I can’t find a balance between my two values of community and new experiences. And it has resulted in a lot of turmoil.

Do I keep the job security and the lower salary that has okay healthcare, decent 401k matching, etc. or do I take double income and hope it doesn’t burn a bridge for doing it right after promoted.

PS — Also - recommend starting my own LLC to sub under someone else or just freelance without my own company.

-9-5 office or revenant job, low stress in terms of labor
-I’m a fast learner, not great with computers but I can always learn.

1dmzbki,Are my friends and family right when they say I am being delusional for wanting to go medical school instead of art school ? ,"
So basically I am a 21 year old woman who has never been to college before , mainly because I wanted to have a shop of my own and never thought myself capable enough, after so many odd jobs and a moving to new state I decided to be brave and go to college

My favorite actor Alan Rickman died of pancreatic cancer in 2016 and I’ve never been the same ever since , I have a natural talent for art and I would love art as a career but I don’t see how it can progress as well nowadays specially since I already draw all the time and I’ve been always in the art kid trope. I am inspired by him because he started his acting career later in life and it pushed me to apply for college since is never too late 

None of the college programs felt like something I would want to do but then I discovered my college offers a medicine area specially cancer related research and it was like finding gold in the sand. I’ve been always just inclined to art plus English is not my first language but for first time I felt some sort of purpose , it doesn’t mean I’ll discard my lifelong dream of having a shop which continues to be my main dream but I want to feel I can make some impact and in a symbolic way repay everything Alan Rickman has done in my life by saving others.
 My friends and family were shocked to learn about this and think it’s a terrible idea and that I am wasting my potential on art ,  they think being surrounded by the medical environment will be a recipe for disaster and this is not only my family but everyone , my mom is concerned that because I just came to the US I do a mistake and ruin everything she says a medical career is a huge responsibility and if I mess it up it will mess me up for life , she says I am too new in English to assume such a big thing specially because I’ll be asking for a loan , my friends think I will be miserable working in a lab since my whole life is been based on art and theater and I never had any previous interest in any sort of medical field.  but I want to feel for the first time that I am doing something for people , I feel everyone is just underestimated me already assuming it will be too much for me and I will drop , fail or be miserable. 

I am frustrated because everyone thinks I am being unreasonable because I am basing my career in Alan Rickman not understanding my motivations and making me feel stupid in the process and then telling me that nothing I do will bring him back without understanding that’s obviously not the main motivation  it sucks because absolutely everyone I know thinks the same thing and I am starting to be afraid about asking for a loan and whether I am truly too dumb to go medical school so much that everyone thinks I am straight up insane , I believed every parent would be so happy their kid wants to be on medical school but turns out it’s having the opposite effect. 
I love art and I will never stop doing art but I feel my life can have a bigger impact on others that might give me a stronger sense of purpose , art can be beautiful but family members not losing their loved one sounds even better. 

I must preface I am being made a joke basically and my family thinks it’s funny to send me snape memes  saying I am acting like snape they come with all sorts of puns about it and now is like the crazy person story in the family 

Am I delusional or I have a basis for my choice ?

1dmz8lc,I'm a uni student making 4k+ AUD/month from freelancing. What should I do for my future?,"I'm from the Philippines and I'm currently in Australia under a student visa. I took up freelancing to pay for my tuition (I pay over 80% of it, and my parents help out with the rest.)

I used to study a Mechatronics degree, and then pivoted to Computer Sci. I need to find a job related to Comp Sci in Australia within 2 years post-graduation to work my way to permanent residency in Australia.

Personally, I'm not too attached to Australia but I DO NOT want to go back to the Philippines. I know 4k aud isn't a lot, especially compared to a tech job I can get-- but I built up my skills throughout the course of 3 years and I don't want to throw that away.

I do copywriting, and I actually enjoy writing, even as a hobby; far more than coding or anything tech related. Plus, I've very confident that in a year or less, I'd be making 7k a month.

Basically, my problem comes down to:
What can I do/where should I go to continue freelancing WITHOUT heading back home?

Here are some things I've already considered:

1. Switch to a media/communications degree-
I have a client in Australia interested in making me work full time. This will be considered as ""a job in my degree"" so I'd be on my way to PR.
Cons: I already did a course switch, not sure if I can fit it within my current visa to do it again. Also I want a com sci degree since I can fall back on it in case my writing career goes up in flames.


2. Leave Aus after I graduate & do digital nomad lifestyle - I'd move to somewhere else and just do digital nomad stuff.
Cons: Stressful having to reapply visas every few years, but maybe I should just do more research. This seems to be the most viable?


3. Hiatus from freelancing- take a 2 year break from freelancing to work a tech job, and once I am granted my PR, start freelancing again.
Cons: I would be extremely depressed and I would have to throw away all my current clients.

Any help will be appreciated :)

1dmvxlo,Retiring After 40 Years With One Company and Not Looking Back,"My step father has worked for the same company for 40 years at the end of this month and is retiring.  He spent most of his career as a mechanical engineer worked his way up to a lead engineer and is retiring as a director of engineering.  He he had what everyone would call an ideal career. Traveled internationally had a few patents in his name and was very popular with his teams.  
About 10 years ago he started working remotely and would spend two weeks out of the month at the company headquarters. That would require him to fly and stay at a hotel. 

At my last visit I asked him a little about his retirement. After 40 years he is not going to have a retirement party or any kind of award ceremony. He is also not going to fly back for his last day. He has not been back to the main headquarters in the last 6 months and his last day he's going to package up his computer and send it back to them.  All of this very unceremonious behavior after a 40-year career was a major eye-opener for me.  

For decades I idolized his career and how well he did and how he was able to be stable with one company for 40 years. I always thought somehow I was defective because I'm going through a new company every three and a half years or so. Come to find out he doesn't like his company at all either and could care less. He's not going to look back he doesn't feel bad about retiring no video of him walking down the hallway for the last time and everybody clapping, he's just going to put his computer in a FedEx box and send it back to them. I was expecting a little more reflection on the work he did during his time there but nothing.  

I've spent the last couple days thinking about this and trying to extract some kind of lessons learned here. The only thing I can come up with is that even the people that stay with companies for 40 years are doing it for a paycheck. People that love their jobs and are sad about retiring are few and far between.  If you're struggling with work and job satisfaction you're not alone.

The skills that I have that I think could translate to the private sector are: recruiting (sales), logistics, financial planning/management, and staff management. Working in coaching also demonstrates leadership and I’m used to non-traditional hours. 

I am successful in my field and have been contacted multiple times for other positions in the industry annually. Current salary is $87k with bonus potential up to 20k (usually get 5k). 

Any advice for potential career moves?

1dmt4d9,Should I look for a new job next year?,"Hi Career Advice Community:

I have a small dilemma. The place where I'm working will be shutting down at the EOY for reasons, but the VP has means of creating a new place in a few years (2 - 3 years) for a better success story. They're keeping a very small subset of people to stay on board (and these are the only people who know; everybody else is being let go) while we wind down the old place and transition to building the new.

I'm the Data Reporting Analyst for a specific department within Ops. Initially, my Sr Director put in writing for me to stay until 3/31/2025, so I could get severance pay and a retention bonus and help with any reports that may come in after 12/31/2024. I was cool with this, and I was okay with having to find a new job. I love new learning opportunities. But then he thought about it and said ""I was going to reach out to your manager and you to come back for the new place in a few years. I know I can get your manager back, but I don't think I'd be able to get you back. By then you'll probably had moved on to something bigger and better, and it would be hard to get someone with your specific skillset (with your knowledge for this department with a data analytics background) to fill your position. So I talked to the VP to keep you, and she said yes she can see the need.""

I'm not sure how I feel about this. He was my Director at an old employer, and he brought me on over here. He's always making sure I'm learning (he's currently putting me in Tableau and Alteryx classes offered by the company), he sees me self-learning and applying PBI, and how far my reports have come along since he first hired me into this position a year ago. Very good person to be under and he's kind to his staff. But his statement was the very thing that made me not jump with excitement for not losing my job. Over the course of the years, he'll be pushing me off to help other people with things because there won't be the hugest need for me during that timeframe. I'll more than likely use that time to learn and master SQL as much as possible, but I'm not too fond of the idea of no growth for 2-3 years. Currently, I make around $65k, I work remotely, and I would love a better title, but I'm not sure how to navigate this because of how much he's helped me. He pointed out to my manager and me one day when discussing resolutions saying "" [u/SorcererMystix](https://www.reddit.com/user/SorcererMystix/), you have to think of the impact of any decisions for the entire Ops department, not just your department. When you become a Director one day, these are things you have to consider."" Which made me saw he respected and understood my work ethic enough to know I do want to be a Director one day without even saying anything to him.

TL;DR - My company is closing EOY but wants to keep me for their new company in a few years. I'm pretty sure I'm going to have the same title (and potentially pay), and I don't like that. My boss has helped me with so much growth though, I'm not sure if I should stay on board or leave.

1dms2el,(33M) Need help putting it together ,"Hi there,

33M with going through a rough 5 years career wise. Left my prior job running operations for a regional coworking firm during the start of COVID to pursue a technical masters (MIS). Had an internship that didn’t pan out and ended up back in hospitality management working insane hours (7 days/wk 9-12/hr days) with a newborn at home. 

Was able to pivot out to get an account management job on cybersecurity but got laid off with everyone else in August 23’. Struggled to even get a call back for several months till taking a sales/marketing/acct management role at a custom apparel company. 

Long story short, I had hoped to transition smoothly to tech sales/customer success but struggling to break-in. Pivoted to survive a few times to the point that my expensive masters degree isn’t relevant to my work at all.

What direction can I take this in? Any advice or guidance? ",AbjectResearch4,56,0.949999988079071,7,1719165542,2024-06-23 17:59:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dms2el/33m_need_help_putting_it_together/,6,2024

1dmmikk,Job not paying enough to cover expenses and I'm going further into debt/my overdraft each month - need advice,"Hi everyone, I'm (24F) in a difficult position financially and would really appreciate some advice.

I've spent the last 3 months as a Graduate Consultant for a large consulting and market research firm. My salary is relatively low at £28k per year. Other consulting agencies typically pay between £30k-£35k for the same position, but I settled for the company I currently work for because it was the only one hiring for the position I wanted and I really needed a job so took the first one I could find and receive an offer for.

My monthly expenses include my car (the car itself, insurance and service plan inclusive) and phone bill which comes to around £650 a month. On top of that, I have to pay for food and travel to London - I typically spend £200 a month on food and £700 a month on travel. The reason I pay so much for travel to London is because I applied for a corporate travelcard through my company, so the £700 gets deducted from my salary each month. I've cancelled the travelcard as I'm moving houses to live with a family friend next week, meaning my travel expenses will fall to around £300 each month as of July.

Because of this, I haven't been able to save and have very little money to spend on anything other than basic necessities. Even then, I've ended up going into my overdraft and adding to my credit card debts every month. My biggest worry is that I won't have enough money to eventually move out from my family friend's place - I'm staying with them until October so will need to get as much money together as I can before then which feels completely impossible right now. Even when my travel expenses go down, I probably won't be able to save more than £1k-2k by October as I still need to pay off my debts.

Realistically, what are my options? Look for a better paying job even/a job that's closer to where I live even though I've only been working at this company 3 months? Just stick it out until I get promoted next March (following which my salary will increase to £33k per year)? Renegotiate the terms of my car payments so I pay less interest? Look to do some sort of side hustle or second job?

If anyone has any pointed or general advice on what to do I would really appreciate it. Feeling very overwhelmed with everything right now and struggling to see a way out of this.",ScaredAd9406,0,0.5,1,1719150403,2024-06-23 13:46:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dmmikk/job_not_paying_enough_to_cover_expenses_and_im/,6,2024

1dmkxc5,Should I take the counter offer? Retire? Or find a new job?,"I am in a very specific situation and I would like to get thoughts on what others would do. To start, I very much under the privileged situation I am in.

For context, I am a 29M with a wife in a low cost of living state. Due to my situation my children will have their college paid for, and I will get a livable monthly stipend for the rest of my life.


Currently, I have been in my industry 2 years and in that time have been able to amass a 4+ million dollar territory at a margin considered low for the industry. Bringing my total income with $50k base to, 90-102k depending on the year end volume.

I have excelled quickly in my position, learning to close new business, build the customer’s given to me and have trained multiple reps to be successful. These last two years I have brought in more new business than my entire division going on two years in a row. Last year I was relied on heavily to keep high sales while others were lagging. This year I accepted a role in a new state to build a territory. I was able to get the territory from 200k sales in 2023 to 1.4 million YTD. This year the same reps on my team that were lagging last year and I am smoking this year were positioned to get promoted the same time as me with the same increase to base.

I pushed back against that idea, and when a new senior leader came in he scraped that whole idea anyways. I wrote up a report showcasing the top five sales reps of the region, their sales margin and total profit. Along with mentioning who I have trained and what plans I would bring if promoted to a role with direct reports. I was able to show in these 10 months I was able to transform a lagging account into one with the second most sales and the fifth most profit made.

Senior management replied to me that I have done everything to showcase my talents besides get my overall territory margin to the number they want it to be. This sent me over the edge because they just promoted a guy whose margin was points lower than mine with 6x less the sales.

Point being I submitted my resignation and was met by senior management telling me they would not accept. They would instead like to take a meeting to see if we can work things out. They say I am so close to $200k and they don’t want to see me throw away everything I have built.



I think I’m pretty high octane so staying home and not doing any job doesn’t seem like me. Part of me wants to run myself dry making all I can make in these next 12 years. The other part thinks he I can alter my budget life low and take a small income remote job to help have a little more money.



If you have a great territory, would you stay at a company that seems to be dangling a carrot in front of you and wasn’t willing to invest into you until you decide to leave? Let’s say I believe they won’t look for my replacement or hold it over me for promotion, what base bump should I accept? 

Or would you leave and continue trying new roles?

Or who would just live low with the blessed life I have and just try to be happy with family?

1dmjmk7,Back to secretarial duties?,"Hello, I've been working in this company for over 2 years. I'll be doing some generalization to remain anon but the work we do requires stamina and physical work. Not in a heavy machinery type but more of running a marathon or taking a long walk or hike every day. Now this is a male dominated field. It was pretty clear since college that it was but I passed, graduated and hired. As the only girl in the group, my first year, I was held back in the field though working in the field is my job description. Doing so, I learned so little. But then I was transferred and was able to do field work. It was tiring but I did learn so many things on hand. The issue is being a girl, we have an annoying visitor every month and though I normally would press on, a prior injury held me back. Double with Aunt flow and the pouring rain, I submitted a report detailing the physical and weather condition is too dangerous for me on field. This causes a chain reaction of unwanted pity and concerns over my supposed safety even though I was being responsible. So I'm being transferred away from active duty to a glorified secretary. While this may be kind of scammy to pay me for not doing what's in my contract, it would impact my future work and the impostor syndrome may come back. It would also set off my coworkers against me and I don't like being the metaphorical punching bag.

1dmhp5i,Tips about Dental Hygiene?,"Hey, so I'm currently trying to finish my general ed for Dental Hygiene rn, and I already know it's a lottery-based program (unless you pay to get in for-sure, which sucks) but I was wondering about the finer details of this career. I've heard a few things such as it's pretty brutal on the back and wrists, but the pay is good. Also that you can work it part-time, but it can be hard to find full-time at one single place so working at multiple practices can be common.

What does a normal day look like for you? How much math is actually used on the job, and what level is it? (I'm terrible at Algebra) Do you get anxiety about accidentally hurting a patient or anything similar? (I've got real bad anxiety issues) Any interesting stories or things to be cautious/aware of? How reliable is the salary?

I just want to live on my own in a modest apartment without the fear of bills, with good food, and maybe do something fun or buy something silly sometimes. So far, the most daunting things to me have been trying to do my labs since there's no teachers nearby for them or, plus Anatomy and Chemistry are beasts of classes to undertake (At least for me). But if that's what it takes to meet the aforementioned goal I have, I'll touch a cadaver & mix chemicals I guess lol. And idk if it matters, but I'm 25 & don't ever plan to have kids (not a fan), so is it a career you'd do until retirement or would you recommend having some kind of office job to fall back into after a certain age/period of time?

I'm sorry if these questions seem stupid: I literally have no experience with any of this except what I've read online on basic dental hygiene websites or the odd reddit post as of late. I've asked around at my colleges but the counselors are pretty clueless about dental hygiene. I've asked at the local clinics too but we only have dental assistants around these parts.

TLDR; If you're a dental hygienist, tell me about it! What basic things do you think somebody who wants to be one should know? And what advice or words of wisdom would you impart them with? Lastly, is the salary really all that it's cracked up to be?

1dmdfqv,Seeking Advice on Dealing with Difficult Boss ,"Hello everyone,

I need help dealing with my boss, who is the business owner. I manage his online business account, which includes running promotions, ensuring we have enough inventory, responding to customer messages, and addressing any account issues. Despite working with him for almost four years, I’m still struggling to work effectively with him.

My boss often forgets what he tells me to do, and when the outcomes of his decisions aren’t favorable, he blames me and tells me to use my common sense. When I explain that I followed his exact instructions, he insists I should know better since I handle the account. However, when I offer my opinions, he usually ignores them and insists I just do what he says.

There was an instance where he blamed me for a profit loss because I followed his instructions. I mostly do not know the outcomes of his decisions, and if I did, I would definitely advise against bad ideas. For three months, he kept blaming me for the situation and repeatedly mentioned it in our meetings. During that time, I was very depressed and told him that I followed his instructions.

I understand he has a lot of responsibilities, and I try my best to do my job. However, I often feel conflicted about whether to follow his instructions or use my own judgment. Despite working with him for four years, he rarely compliments my work and mostly focuses on my mistakes. I’m open to constructive criticism, but I dislike being humiliated. He will call my other workmate to his office just to show him the mistakes I make. 

The company is small, and we have no HR department. I can’t ask for help from my workmates as they mostly tell me to ask him directly. I’m considering asking him to email me his tasks so I have proof of his instructions if things go wrong. However, I worry he’ll dismiss this and tell me to use my logic and that I should know better.

I really like my job and appreciate the experience and skills I’m gaining. However, his treatment affects my self-confidence and mental health. I’m so tired of being blamed for things I have no control over and feeling stupid. How can I stand up for myself when he pulls the “use your common sense” card? Additionally, how can I stop being so emotional after our interactions, which often make me feel stupid?

Any advice on navigating this situation would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.",NoCategory5759,1,1.0,3,1719114834,2024-06-23 03:53:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dmdfqv/seeking_advice_on_dealing_with_difficult_boss/,6,2024
1dmd9vc,Contract to full-time employee ,"Hi everyone, I don't post much but I'm having a hard time finding advice on this subject. 

For context, i started as an intern at a rather large corporation just about two years ago. After six months, that internship turned into a year long contract position, which they re-uped for an additional year, which I'm currently in. I guess there is a ""cooling off"" period after two consecutive contracts. Throughout this time I've made it known that I would like to get hired as a full-time employee, which my supervisor, the director, and senior director would like to do as well. 

Last week my supervisor updated me on the situation and has hinted at the approval of the conversation to full-time. As a contractor, I'm currently making $75,000 a year. I would be hired on as a principal curriculum developer, which the average salary is around $100,000. 

Would anyone have advice on what I should do if they offer me the same amount I'm currently making? ls it common for them to offer my current salary? 

Any advice on this situation would be greatly appreciated. I'm based in the US.

1dmd1o6,What should I do?,"Hi. I have been working the past 5 months for a large US manufacturer. After 2 months of doing production I was asked to be a line leader by the section supervisor. I show up, work hard and believe in quality. I asked about a pay increase and was then told that the company does not have the position on paper and that they are not going to create one. So for the past three months I have been doing the job as a line leader (same as the other three line leaders in section). It bothers me I have to correct other employees that have been there for years (they are also getting paid more).

Also, about two weeks ago upper management asked me to apply for an internal position along with 4 others. Management took us to a conference room, presented the position and talked about the difficulty of having people apply. So I applied and the manager interviewed me in the section with no HR or direct supervisor present. He showed me the part I was going to be making, which is the same part I replace in machines daily and mentioned on second bullet of resume. So I could tell he didn’t read my resume. The interview lasted about 5 minutes and found out Friday I didn’t get the job. I guess they have to interview so many people before they can fill it. I really am not mad about not getting the job but wish I had my time back for updating resume and writing cover letter.

I really don’t mind the job but do not think I am being treated fairly. This week I am on vacation and plan on giving management an ultimatum of higher pay or no line lead for me when I get back.

1dmcpkt,Is this the norm for case management? Where to go next? ,"Hi all,

I have a bachelor’s degree in Sociology that I earned in 2020. I live in the PNW for context. To lament for a moment, it was not fun entering a COVID-wrecked job market straight out of school. The internship I had lined up was cancelled and there were none to take its place. I worked BOH at a restaurant to make ends meet- I really enjoyed this job, but also wanted to utilize my degree and work daylight hours.

I worked at a non-profit doing program coordination for a little over a year before I resigned and returned to the kitchen. I enjoyed the work itself, but I found myself doing the jobs of 4 people under an emotional rollercoaster of a supervisor for less than I made working in restaurants.

Shortly after my return to the restaurant world, I landed a job that I really enjoyed. I did case management in a Community Mental Health setting, but also did tasks such as job coaching, teaching people skills (using a computer, following a recipe, operating a cash register, etc.). I did this for a little over a year, but ended up resigning due to relentless sexual harassment from clients. I was very firm in my boundaries and thorough in my documentation (which allowed me to file a restraining order when it escalated), but I’m incredibly disappointed with how management handled the situation.  With one particular person, the harassment occurred over months until it escalated- Management was aware of this the whole time, but I didn’t have the option to stop working with him. I eventually had to go on short term disability before I decided to resign. 

I’m back to working in a restaurant- but I’m devastated about the whole situation. I loved this job and genuinely enjoyed the clients I worked with (apart from the obvious). I’m trying to decide where to go from here- I’m hesitant to look into other case management positions because I don’t want to be in this situation again, but I also don’t know what my skillsets can translate to. I considered going for my MSW, but don’t want to go into debt if I can avoid it. 

In addition to the experience I highlighted above (restaurants, program coordinator, case management), I also have experience in retail and 3 years of research experience in social sciences from my undergrad. Does anyone have advice on fields that I could apply my experience to?

I realize that much of this post is venting- I guess I needed to get it out of my system. I’m ready to settle into a long term career and am sad that something I enjoyed so much turned out to be unsafe.

1dmc5xq,LinkedIn Easy Apply screening questions?,"I recently applied for a job with a requirement of min. 5 yrs of experience only having 4.

The next morning, Saturday AM, I got a notification that said I was rejected. There was a section in the Easy Apply application where it asked me my min number of years of experience. The JD really matches up with my experiences and truth be told, does not seem too technical. 

Do applications get automatically rejected based on those questions? Should I reach out to the recruiter again?

1dmbhmk,Payroll discrepancies and late paychecks,"I do not know if I am in the right place, but here goes... I recently moved from a larger city to a small town. I was able to find a job at a hotel in the area (been in hospitality for 15 years now). It is a lower paying job with zero responsibility (I used to be a GM) and that is ok with me... However...

My first paycheck was supposed to be deposited on 6/4. Nothing there. After going back and forth with management and ownership, we were finally paid on 6/11. The paystub, however, is still dated 6/4 even though I did not receive the direct deposit for another week. Thought it was odd, but maybe nothing to worry about?

So ownership and management apologized for the delay but it was supposedly fixed. Shit happens, right? I am new here so I do not know how things usually operate. Obviously though, a huge red flag if a company cannot cover payroll. That is the first bill you pay! 

Now comes payday again, of course, last check was a week late so the problem is snowballing now and owner only has a week to make payroll again. I was supposed to be paid on 6/18, ownership says they are, instead, changing payday to Thursdays so 6/20. But Thursday, still no check. 

I again went to management and they said ownership claims it is late due to the holiday on Wednesday. Okay. I can buy that, I suppose. But come Friday, nothing... I reached out to management and forewarned them I am not about playing games. I show up every day on time and I expect my paycheck to be on time as well. 

So, I came into work on Friday and noticed the spreadsheet for payroll up on the computer. I couldn't NOT look so I took a glance. I noticed a couple staff members with a total of 80 hours on their payroll but I knew they did not work that much, because I sit right next to the timeclock and rarely do I see these people. I looked at the previous payroll and it is nearly identical. 

I start looking at timecards (they are right out in the open) and I see one of the ladies has punches for maybe 2-3 days a week, 730am-1230pm. 5 hours-ish a day, 2-3 days a week. Yet the payroll spreadsheet states she worked 80 hours for two weeks. Another woman works 4 hours a day, 6 days a week and is also being paid for 80 hours. This is the case for all of the employees who also, coincidently, live on-site, along with a handful of others. The manager lives here. Her brother lives here. The assistant manager lives here with his girlfriend, the full time laundry worker. 

As the owner is struggling to make payroll, the on-site staff are greatly taking advantage of his generosity, to the point that they are stealing money via payroll even though they are also living here for free. It is causing issues for those of us who want to be paid for hours worked, and of course, is detrimental to the business itself. Mind you, still no paycheck at this point in time. 

Should I approach the owner to let him know about the payroll vs hours-worked discrepancies? Should I report them to my state labor department for not paying on time? Should I just bug out and quit? Should I approach management instead? Any input is greatly appreciated!

I'm not saying all people of this ethnicity are but their culture and country is a messed up third world country and has backwards culture so a lot of people of this ethnicity are like this. the people of this ethnicity that i met in college were pretty cool so i didn't think much of it before deciding to work here. boy was i in for a major shock.

 i work in a small lab and my direct supervisor is of this ethnicity (hired through nepotism because they hire people of this ethnicity into management roles even if they aren't the best for it). I have to work with her daily since the lab is small and its not like a job where you don't really see your manager that much. anyways, i've been working here for two years now and she is completely deranged psychopath that likes to treat us like slaves. many of my previous co-workers and co-workers in other departments quit without giving notice due to this.  

there are many illegal labor violations that go on at this company and I won't list them all out but will name a few that stick out to me. asking to take off for necessary things like doctor's appointments is like pulling teeth and my supervisor questions when i have to take doctor's appointments and even asked me to reschedule it one time. also, my other manager that is my supervisor's manager asked me why i have so many doctor's appointments one time. (also illegal)  i saw a supervisor of their same ethnicity in another department yelling at my co-worker in that department because he couldn't lift something heavy and she yelled at him to leave if he didn't want to work.  when i went to the bathroom one time she came looking for me and asked why i was taking long in the bathroom (it wasn't even that long and this is also illegal). this was the final straw of many things she's done that caused my previous co-worker to quit on the spot without giving notice. she also blamed me for a mistake that i didn't do and that my newer co-worker did. I said i didn't do it and she insisted i did, like i would just admit it if i made a mistake and not blame someone else. she gets so upset over little things that don't matter but then doesn't help us to improve in any way or mentors us to get promoted or anything. but it's not like you can even get promoted at this company since they only seem to promote people of their ethnicity. i feel like i have to walk on eggshells working with her. these are just a few of the many labor violations they do. 

I stuck it out because i'm making a career transition and studying for a different industry so was going to finish studying but I don't think continuing to work here is sustainable anymore. my mental health is greatly affected and i dread going to work everyday. she is able to get it away with her behavior because the company is owned by her same ethnicity and they show favoritism to people of this ethnicty. but the president has changed now due to the old president retiring and HR is not this ethnicity so i could potentially report to HR and the president. the only thing is, if i reported to HR while i'm still working there it would be awkward since i have to work with my supervisor directly everyday and have to see her everyday, and who knows how long the process could take. i was thinking that i could report when i'm about to quit or after i  quit. there's no point reporting to her manager or other upper management because they are all of the same ethnicity that shows favoritism to their own ethnicity. could is also report this to the department of labor or other government agency?

I was salaried but they put me on hourly and asked me to come to office every day. I managed a team of 5. I like my team and job but I was sort of pushed out somehow it feels. 

I did not have another job lined up. My spouse works and is the breadwinner and we have a sizable emergency fund. This wont really affect us financially but I still wonder if I was rash and should have stayed.

1dm9ci0,Should I Accept Company A's Offer or Wait for Company B?,"Hey everyone,

I need some advice on a dilemma I'm facing regarding job offers. I have 1 year of experience as a software developer, and I'm currently weighing two options:

Company A:

- Position: Software Engineer

- Tech Stack: Deluge and WordPress

- Salary: $60-65k (my previous job paid $80k)

- Role: I'll be the only developer on the team

- Work Environment: Hybrid

- Status: Job offer received



Company B:

- Position: Full Stack Developer

- Tech Stack: TypeScript, React, CSS, AWS (DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, SES, CloudWatch), NoSQL databases, API development, Python scripting, and Bash scripting.

- Commute: 5 days a week, over an hour each way

- Mentorship: There is a senior developer (potential mentor)

- Work Environment: Full-time, in-office

- Status: One more step in the interview process (no offer yet)

- Pay: Unknown



Concerns:

- Company A: The salary is significantly lower than my previous job. However, I have a confirmed offer and a hybrid work environment. On the downside, I'll be the only developer, which might limit my growth and mentorship opportunities.

- Company B: The tech stack aligns better with my interests and career goals. There's also the opportunity for mentorship from a senior developer. The commute is long, and I haven't received an offer yet. I'm worried about the uncertainty and if waiting might result in losing both opportunities.



Given these factors, I'm torn between taking the safe route with Company A or risking it for the potentially better opportunity at Company B. The current job market is making me anxious, and I don't want to make the wrong decision.

What would you do in my situation? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

1dm986p,Is my boss reaction to my resignation notice normal?,"Leaving my job for a new and rather exciting work opportunity. Well I gave my boss my notice via a call since I wasn't at work that day.

Well when I called her all she said was hello, not even state her name. I asked how she is and she basically just said busy. 

I got straight to the point and just told her I am putting in my notice, gave 3 weeks notice. She just said okay to send her and HR an email. End of convo.

She didn't even ask why, or say we'll miss you, best of luck, thanks for letting me know. Nothing. It was strange. I've had last employers say nice things to me when I put in notice or ask a reason at the minimum. Her and I have no qualms with each other either and I know I'm a good employee. She's even told me in the past.

She has never been the friendliest, or cheerful, nor very personable. I'm not offended by her reaction just thought it was stale and strange. Haven't experienced a boss react like that before 

I'm 95% sure she didn't see this coming. I know companies find people are easily replaceable but it's not like it's just a minimum wage retail job. I was with the company for over a year and perhaps she just doesn't find the news that shocking. I'm not sure.

Anyone else have a boss react like this? ",throwawaybasket3,22,0.6100000143051147,106,1719100883,2024-06-23 00:01:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dm986p/is_my_boss_reaction_to_my_resignation_notice/,6,2024

So im M(21) have been a foodrunner for the last 4 years i make around 30k a year a pay about 800 a month for  a living room(i know right no privacy). I've been thinking of my next move. I want to move and get my own apartment but its diffcult with the money im currently making. not to mention most apartments to be more specific studio apartments are 1200 a month if your lucky. I only make about 2,000 a month if its a good month maybe 2,700.
I recently tried taking the apprentice entry test and failed. Now i have to wait until next year to retake it. I also had this other interest of mine IT. I found a school that has a free program for entry level IT certs. I see that where i live Tier 1 helpdesk make about 50k a year which is already good the thing is That would mean i would have to work as a foodrunner another year while doing a 6 month program. My goal in I.T would be to become a software Developer or cybersecurity.
My goal in the Trades was to become a PMP
Or a Plumber Designer or master plumber or master electrician but so far it seems i havent been able to progress much in those areas my math is also pretty rusty since i rarely used it or practiced. The plumbing union in which i was interested in has a pre-apprentice program/helper program the problem is it pays 17 an hour which good for the state there in there minimum wage is 14 an hour. Also its right across the border from where i live but 17 is minimum wage where i live so i find the pay horrible. I already make alittle more than 17 an hour. But im not sure if the helper program would help me progress into becoming a apprentice. So im not sure what to get into.

I've been doing chemical engineering now for \~5 years at both large companies and startups.

I've been grinding for my most of my life, its time for a change of pace.

ChemE positions are almost always in places I don't like, the suburbs or middle of nowhere. I'm not happy now and I don't think I'll get any happier staying on this path.

1dm8jdx,Navigating Career Transition Post Layoff: Seeking Advice on Project Management Diversification,"I have over a decade of experience in project and program management, primarily in the telecom sector in Canada, specifically focusing on fiber optics network (infrastructure projects) at a big telco in Canada.

I experienced a layoff last year due to a mass restructuring, which prompted me to reevaluate my career path. I am also certified as a Project Management Professional (PMP) and Professional Scrum Master I (PSM1).

While I've gained extensive expertise in the telecom space's fibre optic network project management, I'm now looking to transition into more diverse project/program management roles outside of telecom, especially in IT, technology or software project management.

However, I'm concerned that my specialized experience might be limiting my opportunities and that potential employers might typecast me based on this niche background.

I would appreciate any advice or tips on how to approach this career transition effectively.

Here are some specific questions I have:

1. How can I leverage my telecom project management experience, certifications and layoff experience to make it relevant and attractive to employers?
2. What steps can I take to showcase my transferable skills, adaptability, and resilience during job interviews or in my resume?
3. Are there anything in particular I can do to enhance my marketability?
4. Any success stories or experiences from others who have successfully transitioned from niche industries to broader roles in project management?
5. How reasonable/valid are my concerns or am I overthinking it?

1dm82r6,Should I quit my job?,"I currently work a very toxic, high pressure corporate job that I have been trying to leave for months. I’ve applied to hundreds, if not thousands, of positions and have literally only gotten a single response - a rejection. 

Currently I end up working 10/11h days very regularly, am frequently allocated 80h of work in a typical week with no compassion for missed deadlines, and have a very strained relationship with my boss who I’m sure is legitimately a narcissist, and the company at large is failing financially.

I could go into a lot more context about my burnout/mental health history but I’ll save you from that - but in summary: last time I worked a job this bad I had panic attacks almost every day that were so bad they made me think I was having a heart attack and this job is worse. 

That being said - 
I’ve been producing content on Instagram for about 6mo and recently launched a YouTube channel. My current audience size is around 70k and is growing fairly rapidly.

My content niche has great monetization and earning potential, especially with my audience size and engagement rate. That being said, I’m so fried from my day job I am physically incapable of dedicating the physical and mental energy I need to make it a significant source of income. When I have had the energy in the past opportunities rolled in (sponsorships, guest appearances at events, future corp sponsorships, etc), my audience grew rapidly, and my content quality skyrocketed. However, I’m so burnt out I can hardly find the energy to do laundry, much less be creative and engaging on camera.

My husband and I recently discussed the financials of me leaving my job and we /could/ afford to live off of just his income, but it would be difficult. Our expenses are fairly low relative to our income and my husband earns probably 2x what I do, but my contributions halting would definitely be felt.

I will also note: my current line of work has a big freelance market, so if I were to transition to content, I’d do freelance work under an LLC so if I fail/decide to re-enter the traditional workforce I don’t have a gap in my resume.


BASIC QUESTION
Should I prioritize my short term financial health at the cost of my mental health or take a risk and feel a bit of discomfort for a bit at the possibility of drastically increasing my income?

1dm697n,Rehiring process/Career advice,"Last summer, I left company B to join company C, hoping to pursue a career path more aligned with my educational background. Although I didn't get a raise, I was okay with it. Unfortunately, after just four months, I started looking for new opportunities because the growth pace was really slow. Out of the blue, company A, where I had previously interned, reached out to me. They offered me a raise compared to company C and a promising career path. However, I soon discovered that the work environment was toxic. I lacked adequate equipment to do my job properly, and they were pressuring me to stay longer hours than I had signed up for.

During my internship at company A, I had learned a lot and met some great people. But now, as a full-time employee, I realized I wasn't growing as much as I had hoped. I didn't receive what I was promised, except for the payment, and it led me to some serious self-reflection. I realized that the job at company B, even though it wasn't perfectly aligned with my background, was more suitable for me. I didn't mind going above and beyond because I had been working on projects I loved, I liked my team, had someone to learn from, and could see myself growing and climbing the ladder.

I got a hint from HR at company B that they would vouch for me, which made me consider approaching them. After several self-reflection sessions, I decided to talk to my former colleague at company B, who had praised me since I left and even recommended me for rehire to higher-ups. I explained my self-reflection and how I realized the career paths at companies A and C were not as suitable as company B. My former colleague understood and relayed this to my former manager.

All my former colleagues, including HR, were still at company B, so my former manager set up an interview with some new decision-makers who joined after I left. I explained during the interview why I wanted to return and expressed my desire to work in a more specialized field I had experience in while I was there. It wouldn’t be a promotion, just a role where I could grow in that specific field. As far as I know, I was the only one with experience in that niche at company B, so my request seemed legitimate.

However, I didn't hear back from them for a while. When I reached out to my former manager for feedback, they responded a week or two later, saying that the feedback was positive but there were no open positions at the moment. HR reiterated the same thing when they contacted me.

And now, here I am, with no further communication from them. I’m left wondering what to think. Should I move on?

Am I just afraid to step out of my comfort zone and try it with company A? I am not running away from going above and beyond if I am appreciated or I can see myself progressing. Am I running away from the 'harder' career path?

1dm4o3k,Accounting or Engineering?,"Accounting or Engineering?

I’m 18 years old going into college. Specifically i’m aiming for CPA (accounting) or software engineering. I know both careers can pay well, but I feel like software engineering might be the future given the rapid boost of AI and technology. However I have always been drawn towards the financial side of things, and i’d love to see how businesses operate by looking in depth through their records.

My problem is I dont want to be in accounting knowing that I couldve picked software development, which seems like it pays way more. But I also dont want to be in software feeling like i’m missing out on the business/financial aspects of life.

I’m motivated by money, but I still want to find a balance where i’m happy in my career. ",Cedricay,2,1.0,5,1719087902,2024-06-22 20:25:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dm4o3k/accounting_or_engineering/,6,2024
1dm3ibo,To Leetcode or not to Leetcode?,"tldr: 2025 student. did leetcode for 3 years even though didn't want to do it at all. very little dev experience. what do I do? I just want to build things. but I want a job as well. is freelancing + open source enough for a well-paying job?

So I started programming some 8 years ago. I loved it. For the first time in my life I was doing something that was related to studies but seemed like something to care about. It's hard for me to describe it, but it was just so different from anything I had ever done - for the first time I felt like I was doing something that had real-world value. So I made a lot of C++ projects. I mostly made pseudo-graphical games - games like Hangman, Minesweeper etc. I had a lot of fun. I was very happy. 
After some months I got to know about time complexity, data structures and all these things and I liked the idea of it, so did some of these things. Participated in a computing olympiad. I used to think that these people who did great at these computing olympiad just made a lot of projects and hence learnt these fancy algorithms that they know, and that they only solve these Olympiad problems when bored, you know - just for fun. Boy was I wrong! Turns out, these guys just give 5-10 hours a day practicing those contrived problems. I thought that was stupid, so I quit that world and vowed to never go back (something that I regrettably didn't follow through).
I then thought about building things seriously. I had to choose between web development (I had only done HTML and CSS till then and wanted to delve deeper) and ML (I just liked the idea of it). I got too confused, couldn't pick one and just decided to start prepping for college instead. Did that for the next 4 years. Got nowhere.
Continued programming again in 2021. This time I asked some seniors for advice about what I should be doing because I had lost a lot of confidence after college prepping and getting nowhere. I no longer trusted my decisions. I just wanted to build things so that I could get employed at one of those non-whiteboarding companies or preferably do something of my own. They basically told me to do DSA as you can't get a job anywhere without it. Me being the scared dude that I was, I trusted them. I did DSA and LC. I did it for the first 2 semester whole heartedly. Then I got burned out. Thought about stopping it all for good. Did some ML in the third semester, bit quickly started freaking out about how I won't get a job if I don't do Leetcode. Started doing it again. This time I didn't do it with much intensity. 

The whole sophomore year I just did nothing too productive - just some very basic ML and some Leetcode. Junior year came, I did some web with Leetcode. 

Now, about the present moment. My junior year has ended, and I don't know much about actually building things because I never did put my 100% to those things - my mind always kept pulling me towards Leetcode. I am not that great at Leetcode either even though I have done more than 1600 problems accross platforms. And I don't even want to do DSA. Sometimes I think this desire to not do DSA will leave me with no job. But then I'm tired of doing things that just take a ratrace-y form.

What do I do? Where do I go? If I learn backend and machine learning well, freelance doing them, work on some open source projects, would I be good enough for companies to consider me without leetcode? I have friends making god money while in college and working as interns in multiple companies. Some are making good money through freelancing. But I just don't know if I'll be able to do it because I'm just so late. 

I don't know what to do. I'm very stressed.

I'm a 21 year old boy from Pakistan, currently in my 2nd year of Media Sciences.
Initially I took admission in this field, previous year but overtime, I have developed an interest for Cyber Security.
Now since, I'm from Pakistan, some people are suggesting that instead of changing the degree, I should rather learn it from somewhere else as ""Companies usually don't look upon your degree while hiring, rather they look upon the skillset you have""
My question is, should I change the degree & take the risk of starting again in this domain or should I continue with my degree & learn the Cyber Security from OtHer sources like ""UDEMY"" or ""COURSERA"" ?

1dm2imr,Advice on next steps...,"My husband is 44 years old and has just finished higher education. This is because he grew up poor and uneducated in the UK, and had no guidance toward higher education at the time. He moved to the US 12 years ago, and was running his own businesses for a while, but had to stop (general contracting) due to physical limitations. He decided to go to college, and started at our local community college, with the intention of doing nursing. During his first semester he changed his mind, after some work experience at our local hospital, and realizing it would take him nearly 4 years just to get an associate degree in nursing (because he had to do all gen ed, then nursing courses and clinicals). In the same time frame, he has completed a bachelor's and master's in business administration. He worked hard and took courses every semester to finish an associate, bachelor's and master's in the time it takes most to finish just their bachelor's degree.

However, he is struggling with entering the workforce at his age, and with what he feels is not much experience. We decided it made sense for him to go directly to the MBA because the college he attended for his bachelor's offered him 15 credits off the master's degree to go into their program, and he had a scholarship (not much, but paid for an entire semester). His most recent self-employment is as a general contractor, and he also has 20 years experience as a personal trainer. He is certified with NASM, but it is not current, and he does not have a degree in anything personal training related. He currently has a steady flow of clients, but would like more income. He also has experience in the UK Home Office processing controlled drug import licenses, and as a police officer in London. He has a wide range of experiences, and now an MBA, but we are unsure what he should do. He is unsure what he wants to do, because he never had the chance to think about it, having a job was just a necessity. He already feels discouraged because it seems like you have to have experience even for an entry level job.

We would appreciate any advice on what type of jobs to look for! Thank you for reading this far!",RozCDA1,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1719081926,2024-06-22 18:45:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dm2imr/advice_on_next_steps/,6,2024

1dm15f1,Should I leave my job? HELP!,"PLEASE HELP ME MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION

I am thinking about leaving my current in-person job at a small non-profit.
I love that at my current job I get to identify problems and solutions, but I hate that I never get to complete solutions. This lack of completion and satisfaction is due to being over capacity by having too many tasks, and my boss being a blocker and seems to lack respect for me. My pay and title are less than my responsibilities. I lack work/life balance, there are so many urgent special projects and so many urgent day to day tasks that cannot all get done.
-Details about issues I face are below.

I have an offer on the table that I must respond to on Monday for a remote job that seems to very well align with my skills and interests, but the compensation package and title is not very different from my current job.
However, I haven't been in my current job for very long. I am worried about what changing jobs will do to my ""age of credit"". I'm also worried that if I am not good at this other job and I lose it, that will really dent my ""age of credit"".
Bonus: I also have an upcoming interview for something that if offered would be a no-brainer and I would accept it in a heartbeat.
-Details about professional background are below.

Leaving now would leave my company very high and dry, and burn all bridges. Not only is there so much that I do and know, and so much in the pipeline that needs to be completed, but my boss also takes things personally. 
-Details about departure characteristics are below.

I could also attempt to get a pay/title increase and try to work with my boss to make my job exclusively special projects. However, the reaction from my boss is unpredictable. 
-Details about if I tried to make it work are below.


Professional Background:
Some college, but really just generally gifted at common sense and technology.
-Administrative Operations Manager 2019-2021
Left to move to a new city.
-Office Manager 2021-2023
Left for more challenging work.
-Administrative Manager 2023-2023
Fired after non-conformity to toxic culture, avoids saying ""fired."" Instead presents as ""this position was just an overall non-match."" Sucessfully dodges further discussion.
-Director of Operations and Finance 2023-Present


Here are some details about the issues I face at my current job.....

Pay/Title Issue:
I am the Operations Manager, but am structurally the COO/CFO, I even made the whole budget for all departments for the coming year and the board said it was the best they had ever seen and it was the only they had ever approved from the first draft. The person in the role before me had VP of Operations and Finance title and was making more than double what I make. Experience does not equal skills. My predecessor left a lot of messes to clean up. My boss and peers are in agreement, I do the job 100000% better.

Blocker Boss Issue:
My boss says I am brilliant and wants me on his team, and says that he has my back and trusts me, but that is not reflected in our work together. My qualifications to make a decision for tasks I was hired to perform is often questioned.
Examples....
-Managing IT functions is in my job description, but when I identified some major IT issues and solutions, I was told that I am not qualified to determine whether or not an issue is present.
-We have a bad bookkeeper who needs to be fired. This role should be my right hand man, but the current employee is not resourceful or skilled enough to be that. He is doing more damage than help. I do not have the capacity to run our books and do other things. Our bookkeeping needs are not particularly advanced. I suggested to my boss that an eager student intern could support interim needs if we were to go ahead and fire the bookkeeper and have a gap while we seek a new one. My boss responded ""if we use an intern and it goes poorly, you are on your own.""
-Before we hired the bookkeeper, I identified the need to end our relationship with a part-time accounting consultant. We had been paying the consultant a full-time amount of money. Without any notice or collaboration with me, my boss hired the new bookkeeper and told me ""he starts tomorrow."" This gave me no time to prepare a training curriculum. Although, a curriculum probably wouldn't have helped this guy, it would have allowed me to identify his lack of skills before he destroyed our books. Additionally, my boss did not understand the full scope of needs for the position and his lack of collaboration prevented that scope from being part of the hiring process.
- My boss doesnt listen or read what I send. I worked countless hours crafting the budget, and my boss makes little effort to adhere to it. He asked me to make revisions in the process that make our projected revenue look far better than my forecasts believe it could be. When I tried to draw his attention to the influencing factors, instead of listening or reading what was on the page, he made up his own preferred conclusion. He allowed the board to approve a budget with certain specified cuts, but refuses to make the cuts. 
One of these cuts is quite simple, for 5k in savings we can cancel the lease for the big printer that is used by 4 people which is far less than it is designed for, and switch to small desk printers I sourced donations for. He won't even allow the big printer to be cut, even though it is on the board approved budget.
-We are a Jewish organization, and I am not religiously Jewish, but I am culturally Jewish. We get Jewish holidays off. My boss often assigns me tasks right before that have to be completed before the end of the holiday. I once texted him a question about a task on a holiday, and he replied ""I'm not working because it's a holiday, but you need to get this done before the holiday is over."" Which to me felt like ""you're not Jewish enough for me to respect your holidays."" The other day, he called me and assigned me a task ontbhe holiday itself.

Work/Life Balance Issue:
I lack work/life balance and often do not get to enjoy evenings, weekends, or holidays. I miss my evening dog walk shift, and so my husband has to pull more weight than is rightfully his. 
I have no one I can delegate to. The workload is too large, and I need support that I don't have. We are seeking a new bookkeeper, but I am unsure that assisting my capacity will be enough because I will still be up against the fact that my boss is a blocker.

Departure Characteristics:
There is a lot to be done that only I can do, and if I leave now, that's a problem.
- The bad bookkeeper trashed our books and that needs to be corrected.
-In July I am launching a new quickbooks profile and new Chart of Accounts and will need to transition the staff and various data accordingly.
-We have IT structural issues.
-I have 6+ upcoming onboardings and orientations.


Make it work:
I would like to be the VP of Operations or the COO. I would like an increase of $30k. I need enough money to rectify the discrepancy between my wages and performance, so i can address my work/life issue and pay for doggie day-care, and maybe some housekeeping. 

- I might alienate my boss if he even thought I was seeking other opportunities. Based on his reactions to other employees seeking other work, it would be determined that I don't care about the mission and can't be trusted. He takes things very personally.
-I might be good enough that he wants to try to revise the role to accommodate me. However, the budget is limited. There really is not money laying around for pay that rectifies the discrepancy between my performance and my wages. However, my boss does not respect the budget and could potentially provide the increase, but if he is spending wildly, am I not just on a sinking ship? 
-He may also determine that I am arrogant to ask for this. I may be skillful, resourceful, and sharp but I don't have decades of experience, and am a young person.

1dm0tx5,"I think I am ready to choose my career, but would like some advice.","Hello,

I am 20(M) and I have been stuck in analysis paralysis for a while. I currently work in construction and have been trying to figure out a career plan. Ideally I would like to start my own business, but I am not sure what it would be in. I have a year of community college done with all the general stuff you need.

Anyways, here are my ideas:

**Dermatologist**

This one interests me, but I am not passionate about healthcare so I am very worried about burning out/getting depressed. I am very interested in skin and what causes acne and how to heal it because I have had lots of acne. Bonus is that I could start my own practice. The salary is very nice too. I am very concerned about paying for med school as my family only makes about 70k. 

**Aircraft Mechanic**

I am very mechanically inclined and I am passionate about aircraft and engines. I feel like I would be very happy in this career, but I am concerned as I would still be an employee and I worry about working lots of nightshifts.

  
**Union Electrician**

The pay is pretty good and the work interests me. Plus I would be able to start my own shop after a while.

  
**Military**

This is what I am working on right now to help me pay for schooling and I would also be able to be exposed to some trades/jobs, but I don't know if it will work out so I need some sort of backup plan. 

P.S 

I feel like I would be miserable working a desk job.

1dlyy1f,Q about taking PTO and resigning,"So at my company, 2-5 years of service gets you front loaded 15 days PTO. Up until then, you accrue.

My anniversary is on July 12, which is also the last day I can physically work before moving (I’m fully remote but my company can’t legally operate in the state I’m moving to).

So if I resign on July 12, it will be 0 days since my anniversary, so I would get paid out nothing. The timing really sucks. 

I was thinking about requesting 7/15-8/2 off and putting my notice in for 8/2 this coming week.

How frowned upon would this be?

Would I be required to serve any notice period for the same? My offer letter didn't mention anything about it. I am yet to receive any official word from the company regarding my resignation.

1dlxgm3,"Need Advice: PIP Before Medical Leave, Possible FMLA Violation?","Hey everyone,

I’m in need of some advice regarding a situation at my job. On January 8th, after working with this organization for two years and six months, I was informed that I would be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) one week before I was scheduled to go on medical leave. The leave was approved two weeks before I was notified of the PIP and felt like the PIP came out of nowhere. I expressed my concern about the timing, as I was about to undergo surgery and would be in recovery when this news was delivered. I sent an email to my supervisor requesting a meeting with HR present, but I was informed that such a meeting could not be accommodated before my medical leave began.

Prior to this notification, there were no documented formal warnings provided to me. The PIP states that verbal and written warnings were given, but there were no documented conversations or formal warnings before the PIP notification. I mentioned a meeting I had with my supervisor and second-level supervisor almost 8 months ago in my email to them, but this meeting was intended to discuss and address some identified gaps, not as a warning. I understood this to be a regular part of course-correcting work, and no one informed me it was a warning. Since this meeting, I have been working hard to excel in my job.

Additionally, the PIP referenced my taking sick leave due to personal and children's illnesses and parental leave—both federally protected rights. It also states that ""following your return from paternity leave last year, your performance had slowed down significantly.""

Fast forward to April 8th, the initial meeting to discuss the PIP was scheduled for 30 minutes. During this meeting, HR was present for only 20 minutes, and my second-level supervisor joined 10 minutes late. Consequently, the meeting started late and had to conclude without HR’s continued presence. I felt rushed and was given only a one-day turnaround to respond, which limited my ability to fully share my perspective and provide all relevant information. I was given two options: a grace period of 30 days to look for another position outside of the organization or undergo a PIP for 30 days, with the intent that I improve my performance significantly within that time, after which they will evaluate. If my performance doesn’t meet their expectations, I will be terminated. I chose the latter option to go through the PIP, and I am in the middle of it.

Should I complain to the EEOC or the Department of Labor (FMLA), or consult an employment lawyer for potential medical discrimination and breach of FMLA? or Should I wait until I know the outcome of the PIP? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!",Low-Difference2958,1,0.6600000262260437,8,1719068071,2024-06-22 14:54:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dlxgm3/need_advice_pip_before_medical_leave_possible/,6,2024

1dlwgr3,"Snagged a short-term contract role, how best do I bounce forward after it comes to a close?","Hi everyone,

I am a 27-year-old guy with project management, higher ed admin, and real estate experience (all over the place, I know). I have an English degree from a liberal arts college which has not been of much use, and I am in the process of getting my Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) certificate through the Project Management Institute. I've been unemployed for some months now following a sudden lay-off from my last role, where I was an Assistant Project Manager at a company that managed ATM services for financial institutions (banks, credit unions, etc.) I loved being a project manager, albeit the bread and butter of what I did wasn't exactly exciting/interesting, I enjoyed what I did and I did it well.

Recently, I accepted an Implementation Specialist role that pays much less than what I made in my last role through a friend from my alumni network. Despite this, I am excited to be working again - it was getting really difficult to keep the unemployment dread at bay. For context, the company I will be working for designs and sells K-12 curricula across school districts in the U.S. (good connection with my higher ed experience). Huge pro: the role is fully remote.

This gig is going to be short term; lasting from July-October. I wanted to hop on here in search of advice for what you'd do during this time and how you'd focus your energy on a smooth transition into whatever else comes next. Some pointers:

* I would love to work in a growing sector; tech, fintech, B2B/SaaS and specifically as a project manager, implementation specialist, or customer success specialist.
* Not particularly obsessed in working within education, and as I've said, the actual product or service is not of much concern to me as long as I am setting roots in a sector where growth is predicted.
* Most ideally, I would love to continue working remotely/hybrid.

Questions: **How would you structure your job search?** I would accept a full-time position with this company because of their heavy focus on remote work - but I cannot bet on an offer being made. It's more of a situation where I would have to apply to a completely separate role within the company as my short-term gig comes to a close. **What are some tools you use to really job hunt? How do you broadcast on LinkedIn that you are seeking work for the near future while actually working? How can I position my all-over-the-place experience as a strength - especially following multiple lay-offs and prolonged unemployment stints? Also welcoming any general advice!**

Something smart I've already done is connected with literally as many people as I could from this company I will be joining on LinkedIn, and folks have been especially friendly and kind. I hope to work this network for whatever my next role will be. **Pointers with that?**

Thank you so much in advance!",glitchglory,1,1.0,1,1719065196,2024-06-22 14:06:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dlwgr3/snagged_a_shortterm_contract_role_how_best_do_i/,6,2024

1dlvz8w,"English ""language"" teacher after a degree in BBA(marketing)","
I have just completed my degree in BBA, majoring in marketing and I had applied for a job out of my hometown. The role is for an English language teacher, and I don't need a BEd degree to teach the language. So I'm thinking whether i should accept the offer or just pursue some certification courses to buil better skills for a career with my degree to make it not go to waste. Also the salary is very low for the teaching job but I have aspirations to teach English in Japan and am planning to get a TEFL certification along with an IELTS certificate. However, I have this guilt feeling that my degree would go to waste and also I fear my mother isn't very happy with the low salary and wants me to find a job that pays higher.

 So I don't really know, I am confused. If I pursue this opportunity and work for my ""own"" dream, i would be neglecting my duties of being able to provide for my family as I'm the eldest daughter and our financial situation isn't very good. I know I can get good jobs once I learn certain skills and certificates with the degree but as I have mentioned we are financially struggling and it is difficult. Also i am looking for other jobs and constantly applying for the ones i am interested in such as HR internship and low paying roles but there has been no response. My mother wants me to find an average paying job and fund my certifications myself which I have no problem in doing so. But she doesn't want this job to outside of the hometown. She doesn't want me to move out. So I'm wondering as to what I should do.

1dlv9z0,I just rejected the second job offer from a company I like but couldn't get past some red flags.,"I work in healthcare. A few weeks ago, I received a message from a recruiter for a job that sounded interesting. I'm fairly happy at my current job, although the opportunities for salary and career growth are very limited. It has great work/life balance and excellent benefits, but I feel I will never reach that next level, so to say. It's just stagnant and despite my efforts to take on more responsibilities and earning also graduate degree in a relevant field since my employment, I feel like I'm going to be in the same spot for the next 30 years.

After speaking with the recruiter, I learned the position was with a company I interact with on a regular basis. I have a great relationship with the former owner (I'll call him Jake), who recently sold the company to s private equity firm as part of merger with a larger company in the same line of business, but still acts as a high level executive.

I interviewed with him and the person who would be my direct supervisor. Everything went great and then sent an offer the following week. I wasn't very impressed with the offer, so I declined the position.

A few days later, Jake texts me saying that he would really like me to work for the company and wanted to see if we could come to an agreement. I said we could definitely discuss terms, so he consulted with the now CEO, and countered with so much better offer.

They gave me a week to think about it, and although I liked the offer, I was very gunshy about leaving a sure thing in my current job. This is where things started to get complicated.

I discovered through LinkedIn that a long term employee of the company, who had worked her way up from an entry level position to a high level member of management, recently left for a competitor.

I reached out to her to ask her opinion of her former employer. She said that she loved the company and high held Jake and my would be supervisor in high regard, but things just haven't been the same since the merger. Although Jake has worked very hard to preserve the old culture, there is much more pressure from above to protect the bottom line.

Now, in this particular industry, that's not always a terrible thing. Companies who aren't careful balancing the satisfaction of referral sources with the complicated and frustrating nature of insurance reimbursement tend to flame out and get acquired by cold hearted national providers.

However, what concerned my big time was when she informed me of the recent departure of multiple veteran employees who I loved working with and was unaware had left. This was a problem because they were people who I frequently relied on at my current job, and it was uncharacteristic of Jake not to inform me of these changes. I've also noticed recently in my interactions with their employees, many are new, and things aren't functioning as crisply as before.

She didn't explicitly discourage me from accepting, but she wanted me to know what I was getting into and be ready to deal with the growing pains of this merger.

With that info in hand, I made the difficult decision to contact Jake and decline their counter offer. He was noticably disappointed, but left the door open for the future should my situation change. That being said, I do not think I will receive a similar offer next time and especially not if I'm in a situation where I'm actively seeking a job.

I'm now conflicted by both feelings of relief and a sense of lost opportunity. This would have been a risk, for sure. However, had it panned out, might have been huge for my career. Jake is fairly accomplished, and I think I would've learned a lot working under him. However, I just didn't feel comfortable pulling the trigger with a family to support. Under different circumstances, I wouldn't have hesitated.

What do you think? Did I make the right decision? I feel like to take the next step in my career, I have to be able to take some risks, but were these concerns significant enough to close the door on this?",CajunJayLeno,9,0.9100000262260437,8,1719061616,2024-06-22 13:06:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dlv9z0/i_just_rejected_the_second_job_offer_from_a/,6,2024

If A meets B, then B will insist that B be credited with all customers that A sends to our company.  A is also a relatively small customer generator, so B probably wouldn't care too much about A.  

So if A meets B, B will come ahead, but A and I will both lose.

Essentially, the purpose of a Morty is that they're so dumb that they can disguise the nefarious shit that Rick is up to

That's all that's really important to know from the show to get this post.

There's *a lot* of fraud in America, especially in the b2b, healthcare, and education software spaces. Like *A LOT*.

The company I just got fired from was spending more than half its IT budget on a shitty healthcare software just because the software company flies the CTO and his family to Florida for conferences every year. Meanwhile, the CEO got remuneration from real estate deals.

After working there for a few years, everything felt like a fever dream. Chaos constantly, no one seemed to know what's going on, but all of the non-executive employees tried very hard to do their best.

Once I recognized the fraud, it all made sense. The executives weren't trying to run a business. They were trying to commit fraud, and doing the bare minimum to keep their cover live.

As such, I realized that the 400 other people I worked with essentially just live on a hamster wheel. They think they're contributors to society, but they're really just Morty's. Ignorant as all hell thinking they actually contribute, when the entire point of them being there is so cops don't bust the door down.

I was an overworked Morty for 3 years. I learned a lot and got a lot of leverage from the situation, so I'm not super worried about myself, but I'm sit here slightly heartbroken at how many people across America must be in this same position.

1dlqr1z,Looking for feedback on an email. Can you help?,"Subject: Follow-Up on Our Discussion

Dear [Manager] and [Manager's Manager],

Thank you both for taking the time to meet with me to discuss our communication and working relationship. I appreciate the opportunity to address and clarify concerns, and I am committed to moving forward productively.

Meeting Summary:
1. Urgent Message Definition:
- Action: [Manager] will define what constitutes an ""urgent"" message requiring after-hours communication. Here is a proposed definition for clarity:
- Definition: Urgent messages are those that require immediate attention and action outside of regular working hours due to their critical impact on business operations or safety.
- Examples: Critical operational issues, safety concerns, and time-sensitive approvals.
- Notification Method: Urgent messages should be conveyed through a phone call. If the call is not answered, a voicemail should be left, followed up immediately by a text message.
- Content: Clearly state the issue, required actions, timeframe, and desired outcome.
- Response Expectation: Acknowledge receipt and indicate availability to address the issue as soon as possible.

2. Communication Style and Tone:
- Request: I suggested adopting a more curious, question-based approach in communication to understand root causes, rather than assuming the context.
- Context: This aims to foster clearer and more constructive interactions.

3. Clear Communication Framework:
- Suggestion: When contacting others, communications should include:
     1. Issue/Problem Statement requiring urgent attention.
     2. Required Actions.
     3. Time to Complete.
     4. Desired Outcome.

4. Acknowledgement of Messages:
- Commitment: I agreed to improve my acknowledgment of messages to ensure more effective communication.

Next Steps:
Training:
- Individual Action: I have registered for the ""Communicating Effectively"" training to enhance my communication skills.
Monitoring and Feedback:
- Team Action: Track and evaluate the effectiveness of the new communication framework. Provide ongoing feedback during regular team meetings.
- Follow-Up Meetings:
- Frequency: I suggest we schedule follow-up meetings every 4-6 weeks to assess our progress on these points and make any necessary adjustments.

Team-Wide Implementation:
While our discussion was specific to our situation, I believe similar improvements in communication can benefit the entire team. Addressing communication styles and clarity across the team could enhance our collective productivity and work environment.

Final Thoughts:
While our discussion became emotional at times, I believe it was a crucial step towards resolving our issues. I acknowledge my part in escalating the conversation and am committed to a more constructive dialogue moving forward. I am eager to rebuild our trust and working relationship for the benefit of our team and the organization.

Thank you once again for your time and understanding.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

---

Actionable Steps Moving Forward:
1. Monitor Communication Improvements:
   - Responsible: Team as a whole
   - Frequency: Regular team meetings, bi-weekly
   - Details: Track and evaluate the effectiveness of the new communication framework. Provide feedback on adjustments to communication styles.

2. Enhance Personal Communication Skills:
   - Responsible: [Your Name]
   - Frequency: Continuous, with specific training scheduled
   - Details: Attend the ""Communicating Effectively"" training and apply learned techniques to daily interactions.

3. Document Interactions:

1dlq0jn,Freelance Graphic designer looking for a partner to grow business with [m18],"i grew up with a very average family, we skip balance diet, skip 3 daily meal per day in other to survive and i always want to change the whole situation. I turned eighteen two months ago and i have all my papers ready, however i have made over $15k with graphic design online which most of it have been dedicated to the dying farm land we own, animal feed which is super expensive and preservatives to the crops. also to some other kids living around nearby.

**Graphic design**

The most underrated component of a business is graphic design, which can turn a $1,000 investment into a $10,000 profit. I would want to see many of my ideas come to reality. I have vast experience working with various companies. I aim to use my skills and ideas to find someone who shares my vision for us to become outstanding individuals.

**why i need a partner**

I'm searching for someone who can fund my ideas after doing some research and who needs a side investment. Alternatively, I may be of assistance to someone who needs a designer to finish most of their project.  


**things i can build**

banners/ thumbnails if they're a streamer

card games like ""pokemon""

draft/chess board game

web designs

product designs

wallpapers for home and phones

user interface designs

food/ clothing designs in 3D

and many more.  


Here's one of my ideas: I could create a map for a building, either at home or at work, that would help people find their way about exactly like a google map does for a road. Some buildings are quite difficult, so this kind of map would be helpful to them so they wouldn't always need to ask strangers for assistance.",D1v3ine,0,0.5,0,1719040648,2024-06-22 07:17:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dlq0jn/freelance_graphic_designer_looking_for_a_partner/,6,2024
1dlpflz,A career where you get to experience all kinds of situations?,"I'm a 25F Peruvian architect living in an European country. I currently work as the head of a hospital international department, handling medical billing, managing foreign patients, and coordinating with insurance companies.

Regarding my career path, I find myself enjoying all kinds of experiences. Even if they are extremely stressful, scary, sad, or challenging, I get excited and satisfied every time. I like the feeling of developing a thicker skin and becoming more adaptive.

I'm not planning on having kids or getting married, so I want to take advantage of positions where balancing family life and work is usually too hard. For additional information, I'm very healthy, in great shape, eager to learn, and financially stable. I'm also on my way to obtaining European nationality.

My current plan is to study for a biomedical engineering degree next year, followed by a master's degree. After that, I aim to apply to the European Space Agency as an astronaut candidate by the age of 34-35. If that doesn't work out, I'll pursue a career in biomedical research.

Knowing that my main goal is to have a position where I experience a wide variety of situations, I realize I might be missing some choices. I'm looking for something that takes me to different countries often, allows me to interact with all kinds of people, and puts me in challenging situations. It doesn't need to be ""important for society"" or a super special exclusive job. If it involves joining the army, police force, or applying to a gov organization, I'm open to that.

Does anyone have a position in mind with these characteristics?

1dlojy5,Should I stay or should I go?,"I recently got very ill. It was sudden, and I had to call out and use FMLA. Getting everything handled and working with HR while dealing with being sick was a nightmare. Eventually I was able to go back to work. They had packed up my desk and deactivated all my accounts and had nothing turned back on for my return.

I've been here over 2 years now and I was just floored at their reaction and they pretty much verified they would have fired me if they could.

I've decided to look for other work. In the meantime, I've used all my PTO. I had approved time off due a family vacation next month that I'll no longer be able to take.

I'm debating with my husband. Do I keep working here until I find something else? Or do I put in my notice so we can go on the vacation we have already planned and paid for? We can get most of the money back for flights and hotel.

Will a gap in my job history be huge? Is it not worth the risk I won't find something in a couple months? We have reviewed our finances and I have enough saved up that I could afford to not work at all until January. But I could always do some gig work to cover expenses as I continue looking for work.

I work in administrative. I've been doing customer service/admin work for over 10 years and have 5 years experience as an executive admin. My minimum monthly expenses to cover food, housing bills is 1600.

1dlnzkc,Should I leave?,"I (38, M) met my supervisor (51, M) 15 years ago. Back then I was a junior associate and he was middle management. We rapidly became good friends, and worked together about 5 years. Our company shut down, and we went our separate ways, but always remained in touch.

Two years ago, I was stuck at my previous employer. Almost 10 years working with them and I had barely managed one promotion, and I was severely underpaid for my role. My friend contacted me and told me that he finally did it, managed to get his dream position as senior director at a medium company in our field, and he wanted me to join him as a senior manager. He then offered me twice what I was earning, so it was a no-brainer.

Fast-forward to today, I truly appreciate his help, but I am miserable doing my job (and he is too). Disagreements with owners/c-suite, poor working conditions, complete lack of oversight or direction on how to move the company forward, are just some of the problems we are facing. Like, this place is crumbling to the ground and we seem to be the only ones who even care. We are both frustrated, but taking different approaches. I want to leave and be done, and have been offered a similar position with slightly better pay. He wants to stay to finish climbing the ladder until we have more control of the business, but I see this as a very long-term option, and I do not believe the owners will allow that for now.

1dlnxc5,Should I bid on a job that I would enjoy more but with less opportunity for growth?,"I work in state government as a project coordinator and have been in my role for a year now. I have a pretty wide variety of duties, some of which I like and some I don’t. A big part of my job is stuff like meeting facilitation and basic project management, which I can do well enough but it isn’t my favorite. The task I enjoy most is maintaining trainings and tools and developing new resources, which isn’t technically in my job description but it needs doing and it’s something I’m good at. 

My team got funding for an additional position and my supervisor decided that we need a full time position for trainings, resources, and communications. That means that my favorite parts of my current job would be given to this new position, and I would be left with the tasks that I’m less enthusiastic about. 

I am really strongly considering putting a bid in on this new position once it gets posted. My supervisor says I have her full support and she thinks I’d be great in that position, but she did warn me that this training and comms position would likely have less opportunity for growth. My current job and the new position would be at the same level, which is one level below the maximum level you can get to without becoming a supervisor (which I have no interest in). I would in theory like to at some point move up to a higher level position, but most of the higher level positions are policy lead positions, and my current job would prepare me for something like that more than a training and comms position probably would. 

That being said, I am making a pretty comfortable amount of money right now ($70k USD at my job plus another $10k in self employment income on the side, in a medium cost of living city). We have a pretty good union so on top of annual step increases we also get cost of living increases pretty much every year. I know that I would really enjoy the training and comms position, but I’m having such a hard time deciding whether it’s a good move to take it.

1dlne43,What would you choose ?,"I’m more so looking for individuals in the job field I will list, but if after reading this there is a career you think would suit me pleaseeee!! help a girl out :)))

Im freshly 22 years old. I took a few college classes when I first graduated high school but with no certain major in sight. All I knew was that im very interested in the medical field, psychology, teaching, forensics or criminal justice. I was super depressed and didn’t do to well so I dropped my classes until I was ready and had a degree or certificate I wanted to pursue. When I first graduated I was interested in being a dental hygienist, After some thought I decided against. 

Things about me and what I enjoy

I love helping people whether it be physical or mental. it could be as simple as holding the door open for someone to cleaning up their vomit, I will do it with a smile on my face. I love making people feel better, when they are having a tough time in life to let them just forget it for a second and laugh. I love doing crafts always looking for something to do with my hands. Crocheting, making jewelry, doing pottery. I want to learn a new language. I would love to travel. I have a hard time with serious situation. I get bored easily. Once I learn a job it becomes mundane and I would rather do anything else. I currently work in the er, non clinical. I love the entertainment. The only thing I don’t enjoy too much is the regular patients ( ones that are not sick but you can put a bandaid on it or go to the clinic to get tested or buy a pregnancy test that take rooms from patients in excruciating pain) and the drama that you hear. 

Careers I have thought about 

Radiology tech- currently what I’m most interested in. I’m enrolled to continue my prerequisites to enter this program. I like that there are different modalities so I wont get bored as quickly. Really love the er, so idk how I would feel not being in the er. I like you don’t have to spend sooo much time with the patients, and if there is something seriously wrong you don’t have to let them know. I’m interested in ct and ultra sound. Don’t know about nuc med :/

Social worker- I love the idea of helping kids have not done toooo much research in this would love to hear from a social worker !!!

Phlebotomist- this is something I would like to do as a transitional period if I were to do it. I feel like the time for this position is over tho and I should move to a career position. It’s schooling is short. I don’t mind blood at all. Just worried for patients that are afraid of needles.  

Surgical tech- I love the idea of surgery, but I read the doctors yell at you and such and I’m not sure if there is any room for movement…

Nurse- nursing is a tough one for me. The er nurses I work with go through so much and I would be worried to mess something up and being sued. I like that you can do so many different things though. 

sonographer- haven’t done too much research on this. I assume it’s like rad tech, or being an ultra sound tech.

things I listed earlier or just things I really don’t see myself doing because I have not seen it irl, idk.

1dlmx6s,Am I in the wrong? ,"Recently entered a senior position to where the managing partner leans on me as their #2 person. I've worked hard and made tons of sacrifices. I'm a no nonsense person where my philosophy is shut up and get shit done.

We recently hired an Ivy League grad and despite saying they aren't a snob or entitled... well they are. Or at least I think they are.

The individual always wants to know what the managing partner and I talk about, constantly tells me what the managing partner and I should be doing or how we are wrong. They always talk about ""when I get an office/promoted"" yet they constantly bitch about the work they're given – either it's not enough or it's too much. 3 months into being hired they are asking for a raise. According to them their boss is trying to ""change how they work."" what does that mean? IDK. They call all the old employees who have moved on to other firms ""stupid,"" one of them taught me everything I know that allowed the managing partner to instantly trust me. I once gave them a minor project and not only did they fuck it up but they said they shouldn't be doing it because it's ""intern"" work. When we finally got said intern, they proceeded to boss the intern around and more than once gave the intern the all the work they were suppose to do as a result the work was incorrect and contained various blatant errors if we didn't catch it on time I can say with 100% certainty we would lose the client for the shit storm we would have caused them. When I am on the road for client meetings they get mad that they aren't coming or are not involved. According to them our clients speak highly of them, ask for their advice on strategy yet we haven't heard anything of that sort from them. Is this possible? Sure but all strategic decisions either go through their boss or the managing partner.

I am known to help people grow because a lot of people have helped me be where I am. But I am not about to do the work for them of which they have wanted me to do multiple times. Examples of this include: 1) call a vendor to check everything was set up for the client. 2) Write a confirmation email to the client on the completion of a project. 3) Draft an entire report for a client.

1dlla17,Am I Wrong Or Is My Employer?,"Hello all,

For context, I have been at my job for 1-year; but, I have been with the corporation for 2-years. I completely altered the way our office tackles new clients by making sure they receive services same day (prior to this the office was reluctant to help clients same day). Not only this, but I was given a goal to produce $1,200-a-day and I have exceeded that by producing $2,100 daily. My coworker who has the same title as me has been with the office for 3-years and for the past year was only producing $1,000-a-day.. noticing the boss was wanting more from my coworker, I trained them and for the past two-months their production has jumped to $1,900-daily. The office was also down an assistant, so I told them my girlfriend (who was a lead for this same role prior to having our baby) could help out until they found a replacement (preventing them from closing down on Saturdays). In addition to this, my branch of the office was recently awarded ""highest grossing"" and was given a trophy (the office has never received this award).

Fast forward to now, my office wanted to add a part-time employee for my branch and I knew someone perfect for the position from back in college and got them in touch. I agreed to shift my schedule around to accommodate the new-hire's desired hours and I am now losing 2-3 hours a week since my job has not been able to schedule clients yet (hurts the bank at the end of the month). I expressed if I could come in while I have no clients to perform other tasks and my boss asked ""Why would I pay you do to that? I could pay someone else half your wages to do that.""

I understand my boss' logic, but the hours missed comes out to $300-a-month. I was under the impression that since they budgeted me to produce only $1,200 and I exceeded that by $900 daily that they would be understanding; especially after I got them their part-timer to begin with. Keep in mind my loss in hours has not prevented me from keeping my production high, but I feel like I care so much about my job and that I was just spit on. I am not trying to take it personal, but all I want is to find another place to work. I told my boss all these factors and they pretty much said I have done them no favors and I don't work harder than anyone else at the job.

Am I wrong? I know any other office would not help me out, but I figured they would be more willing since I care deeply and try my best to go above and beyond. I just want to start somewhere else and perform my job well, while not trying as hard as I do now to be helpful.

1dll0w9,Requesting advice about my career path,"Hi. I am 29 years old and employed in a provincial government job. I have been in my current job for 4 years and 2 months, and have seen many team members leave the team due to various reasons through my tenure. These reasons include retirements, indefinite leave of absence due to health issues, and seeking other opportunities within, and outside of the organization. I now find myself in the position where i'm the only one left from 4 years ago.

  
I am at a point where I am a knowledgeable member of this team and the one who has been here for the longest, however the work has started to become a bit boring to me. Over the past 2 years, I have been doing essentially the same, repetitive task every day. It is the type of situation where I am a specialist in a specific area, however I do not see any opportunity for growth in terms of salary, or promotion to a senior level position on this team for me. The reason behind that is, the team is structured in such a way that there are many lower-level staff, and only 1 mid-level staff member and 1 senior level-staff member. I applied for the mid-level position in the past, but did not get chosen, and someone who was on the team for a shorter amount of time got the position over me.



I was raised in a household where there was a lack of money, so I feel lucky to be in the position I am in, since my salary is extremely high for the work I do. Additionally, my company has a best-in-class pension plan which would allow me to retire without worrying about money. Despite these benefits, I feel like I have stagnated and my repetitive work has caused me to feel mentally uneasy/irritated.

  
Am I in the wrong for feeling this way, and should I try to get an opportunity in a different organization, and leave my pension, security, and stability here? I am also scared to ask my manager if I can apply to different internal positions, as in the past I have but have not gotten them, and the team is at a delicate point since our supervisor just left. Or, should I just stay put, and see if any more opportunities pop up in the next few years on our team, while cultivating hobbies outside of work?

  
I would appreciate any advice on my situation. Thanks.",n1h1,1,1.0,2,1719022512,2024-06-22 02:15:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dll0w9/requesting_advice_about_my_career_path/,6,2024

I know cooperations usually pay out those 2 weeks if they let you go ahead of time to prevent information leakage but I’ve heard bad things about Stare Farm not doing things by the books. 

Would they be able to fire me ahead of time without paying out those 2 weeks? If so would it be better to leave abruptly to prevent losing pay. (I have no intentions on coming back to this company).

1dlkkl6,Transition from sys admin/developer to computer engineer / electrical engineer,"My (25m) company offers tuition reimbursement but I will owe 100% of borrowed money back if I leave before 1 year post grad. 50% if after 1 but less than 2. 20% if more than 2, less than 3. 0% after 3 years of staying there post graduation.

My goal is a master's in ECE but is it worth it to stay in my current role for 2-3 years to get the masters and then 2-3 years post masters (3 if I don't want to pay back anything)? 

For context, my current job is fine but I'm concerned about if I'll be losing out on potentially higher paying roles if I were to hop. On the other hand, I want to pivot careers into ECE as I'd like more of a part in electrical and hardware design + software. To do that, my current company will offer a good route to make that happen. 

So, stay with current company for 5 more years earning roughly 3-5% raises yearly which isn't great. But have a master's degree in the field I want to move into with work experience lined up. Or, hop into a higher paying tech role elsewhere and explore if they have a tuition reimbursement plan and further my education there.

1dlkdla,I'm in a kerfuffle ,"Hello,
I need advice because right now I'm so confused and don't know what to do. 
So I worked for Company A for 4 years. There was a massive layoff and redirection that was happening and somehow I got ""caught up"" in it. It was a Retail vendor job. 
So  I did what any other person would do and apply for Company B, which was the big box I worked in as a vendor. 
Landed the Company B job, I have been employed for 3 weeks or so. 
 
Well Company A called me today, offering me my job back with a higher salary ( Roughly 10k more a year) and automatic 2 Weeks off PTO ( Company A you usually have to accrue PTO) and all my benefits.

What could happen if I tell Company B , here's my 2 week notice and then come back the week later for Company A vending? 

Technically this is a conflict of interest due to me being employed to company B and leave to go back to Company A I believe. Am I wrong? ",NoConclusion3935,1,1.0,10,1719020439,2024-06-22 01:40:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dlkdla/im_in_a_kerfuffle/,6,2024

1dlj07f,Boss says I need to be more assertive and man up,"I've been with this company for 5 years. I am in operations and have been a manager for the last 4 years. Things have been going well, and I have been successful at my job even when it looks very bleak. (3 layoffs, seasonal struggles, turnover, awful company communication etc) Overall, I'm a nice guy; I get along with most people I meet, look out for those around me when making decisions, and everyone seems to enjoy my company. Though that is my personality and my leadership style, I have no problem with holding those accountable when needed, standing up for the ""right thing"" when I have confidence in what it is- but it just doesn't seem to be enough lately. I've been told by my boss that I need to be meaner and think outside of the box of our regular duties. Basically, be a manager- Great. I want to. However, my day is usually spent doing what my direct reports do because we are very behind and struggling as a company. I answer questions constantly- I'm running meetings with the team, and I'm helping them build and grow (there is no trainer). I create SOPs and hold more meetings, but then I need to be there for more questions. When the team is behind, i'm there in the trenches with them. This has been working well until recently.

I start my day each day at 6-630am even though I'm not supposed to start till 8 (salary) and work until 56, then do more reports to turn in which can be anywhere from 10 pm-2am. I sit at my desk and don't take lunch because I'm answering questions from the team, my boss, and their boss, and I just have no time. When I mention this- it's ""normal,"" and my boss is the same way. I feel i get no credit for the hard work i put in each day. I have not stepped foot outside of my office today. I stuck my neck out for someone on the team (our best person) and I was told Im getting too close to them- and honest to god, im not. I was doing the right thing for them and us as a team. 3 people have pulled me aside or called me after work and wanted me to know that they heard my boss, and someone else talking behind my back as well. I have been minimized, overlooked, and overall disrespected over and over, and now I have withdrawn. They want me to be meaner, so ill be stoic. And apparently, that's a problem now, too. 

I am not responding to friendly banter in messages

I have not gone out of my way to talk to others not within my team

i have kept everything very professional

The sparkle in my eye and smile is pretty much gone

but I'm still doing my job- probably even harder now. 

 The list goes on, but basicall,y I feel unappreciated and feel I have no value. 'Im looking for other options. Am I being too sensetive? is the company out of line? I rather not leave, but I feel like I need to. Thee's so much more to this, but I'Ive already written a very poor grammar essay. :) 

  
TL;DR: Im an empathetic person that wants people to win and im nice maybe too nice, boss says i need to be meaner and man up, i become more firm, now that causes friction. I feel unappreciated, disrespected and overlooked. What am I doing wrong? What would be a better fit for me?

I am coming to a bit of a cross roads. No longer wanting to work in the industry but also not knowing what to do if I do leave. Im 24 and have worked in this industry my whole adult life.

It's just starting to feel like I'm expected to sell my life to this company (its a job after all, you should not be required to live for your job in my opinion). there hasn't been much support for me on their side, there's the mentality here where they just throw you into situations a say, ""you'll be alright, you can figure it out"" which I have done, however tiring it gets.

1dlgq5n,What would you choose?,"Hello, I recently received my bachelor's in criminal justice and have been looking to get started on a career. While working towards my bachelor's degree, I was and still working in retail at the moment making around $15.75 per hour. Besides retail the only other work experience I have is being a caretaker for a year and a half during the pandemic. I've been applying to a number of different places and currently deciding between two different places. 

The first place being a job as an enrollment counselor. I'll basically be recruiting potential students entering the college, making follow up calls, etc.  The pay is 22/hr, with insurance after 30 days, PTO (4.3 hrs per pay period), 12 paid holidays, etc. The second option being loss prevention, the starting pay would be around $19-20/hr along with benefits. Loss prevention dealing with investigating internal/external theft, interacting with customers, apprehending shoplifters as they're hands on, etc. 

  
I'm sort of leaning more towards loss prevention at the moment as I believe that it can benefit me more in the future, should I decide to pursue a career in law enforcement or other loss prevention opportunities (like loss prevention manager) for other companies. With the degree in criminal justice I also believe that'll likely benefit me more as an loss prevention compared to enrollment counselor. 

  
Any advice?

* **Interest Level**: 7/10
* **Pros**:
   * I can have my own private practice in Morocco.
   * Tuition is free since I got into a public faculty.
   * Better salary prospects compared to engineering.
   * Backup plan: If I fail abroad, I can open my practice in Morocco and have a respected job.
* **Cons**:
   * Uncertainty about the nature of employment abroad. I might have to work for someone else or in a clinic.
   * Limited mobility and higher chances of staying in Morocco.
   * Physical concerns: I’ve started experiencing back pain.

**Option 2: Engineering Abroad (Canada/UK)**

* **Fields**: Electrical or Chemical Engineering
* **Interest Level**: 5/10
* **Pros**:
   * Early exposure to living abroad.
   * Supported financially by my dad.
   * Opportunity to gain Canadian or UK citizenship.
* **Cons**:
   * High cost of education.
   * Uncertainty about job prospects and the future political/economic situation in these countries.
   * Lower interest in engineering compared to dentistry.

**Additional Context**:

* My ultimate goal is to live abroad, preferably in Canada, the UK, Scandinavian countries, or Australia.
* I'm not comfortable with Moroccan and Muslim culture and am an atheist.
* Concerns about being accepted abroad due to my North African background.

* Suggestions on next steps and decisions.
* Logical reasoning for choosing one option over the other.
* Advice on what to do if I truly can't decide.

1dldi2s,Is taking a $2 pay-cut worth it?,"I currently make $17/hr with a 25 minute commute. I recently took a job offer $15/hr with a 35 minute commute. I currently work around 20 hours per week and will be doing the same at my new job.

I work part-time as a college student and want to leave my current position because my boss is not being flexible with my class schedule, she hired me in over a year ago saying that she would work with but decided to change her mind. She is also a micromanager who breathes down my neck every second of the workday, controls every aspect of my work, doesn’t let me work independently, and majority of the time I feel dread and anxiety when coming into work. 

I messaged her today asking if she’s willing to work with my upcoming fall semester, if she’s not then I’m out at my new job.

I’m nervous and feel a pit in my stomach that I accepted a job with low pay snd a longer commute because I know that gas will add up quick. I also have bills to pay too. I can make it work but I’ll barely be living. The new job is a lot less stressful than my current position and they can work with my schedule. It’s really laid back.

TLDR: Should I take a $2 pay-cut for a less stressful job? Downside is a longer commute and I have bills to pay.",mysticyooperlites,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1719000931,2024-06-21 20:15:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dldi2s/is_taking_a_2_paycut_worth_it/,6,2024
1dldgby,Would you leave? ,"Hello! Firstly, I hope this post is allowed in this Reddit forum. I’m seeking advice on if I may be overthinking this. 

My question is related to would you leave your current job for a new position? 

I’m a paramedic working full time at a hospital. I’ll list my benefits, shift differentials and hourly below. 

Total hours required to work weekly full time = 36 hours 
Base hourly rate = $24.7 
Spec Diff ER = $5.00 for 36 hour shifts 
Night shift Diff = $3.00 for 24 hours out of 36
W/E shift Diff = $1.50 for 8 hours of of 36
Evening Shift Diff = $2.50 for 12 hours of 36

When you consider all this, my biweekly paychecks gross are $2,374 which after taxes will be around $1,785. 

My current company offers good benefits and offers a 6% match to the 401k. I contribute 15% to the company 401k and that leaves me with around $1,441 normally every two weeks or $2,882 a month. 

I was just recently offered a position for $73,000 a year. Hours required to work is 42 a week. My hourly base rate is $32.00. The company offers a 401k but no match and has benefits. 

Driving distance to both jobs are the same in regards to mileage and traffic. 

When I do the calculations (if done correctly) It seems that I would be making $61,526 annually at my current pre tax and 73,000 annually pre tax at the new job if I decide to take it. 

This is the dilemma. I start nursing school up in August and my new job is a California rotation that MAY make it difficult for me to go to class while my current job only requires me to work 3 days a week and they are giving me weekend shifts so I can go to school. 

What would you do? Am I overthinking this? Am I even calculating any of this correctly because at my current job it says my annual salary is $46,200 but after shift diffs I calculate it to be $61,526. So if I took this new job, it would only be an 11k pay increase.

Are there any entry level jobs that I can get with an engineering degree? I’m a recent single mother in need of some career advice. I have a petroleum engineering degree. I worked in the industry for a year after graduating but I had to quit since my husband had to move a lot for his job and he wanted me to take the ""traditional wife"" role. Now 7 years later, he’s left me and our 4 months old baby and has moved to a different state. I know I have very little to no experience to go back to oil and gas and if I’m being honest, I didn’t necessarily enjoy it so, I wouldn’t mind staying away from that industry.

1dld9sx,"What is a good ""future-proof"" trade to learn that offers semi-reliable income?","I currently work admin in a law office; prior to this, I worked in college counseling and copyediting. With the truly obnoxious explosion of AI content, I'm starting to feel a little insecure in my skill set holding up as AI technology (and exploitation of sub-min-wage workers in underdeveloped countries masking as AI) continues to become ubiquitous.

To complicate this, my long term partner recently developed long covid and it's become tricky for them to find work they can perform without fainting. I'm committed to helping support them no matter what, and the ~$50k a year I make in my admin job is just not sustainable for the two of us where we currently live. I'm currently doing what I can in my current role to learn new bookkeeping/AP/AR/accounting skills from the rest of the admin team, but I would feel much more comfortable having some firm, hands-on skills based on manuals and tradition in my back pocket. 

I'm looking to learn a trade of some sort that is somewhat sustainable and less likely to be made redundant by technological advances. I have had semi-labor-intensive jobs before and enjoyed them (most recently I worked shipping/receiving and display assembly at a retail store for two years) but it does seem worth it to note that I'm a 5'3"" woman with a shoddy left arm from a childhood fracture that didn't heal right, so I don't think something like pipe fitting would be too feasible for me. I've always enjoyed handyman type work, and am a fast learner who loves to play by the book. I did also take carpentry classes a lifetime ago, but it's been probably 20 years since I picked up a saw. 

Open to any advice or suggestions whatsoever here - at the end of the day, I just want to pull my weight and fully leverage my able-bodied status so that my partner doesn't have to overextend just so we can keep a roof over our heads.

1dl8u44,"I have been blessed to have two ""full time"" high paying salary jobs of 145k and 200k a year, however I feel my physical and mental health decline was thinking of quitting the 202k","Never posted might be all over the place or how this works but just really been thinking about what to do for 2 weeks and almost feel stuck due to the money.

Some context

I am a 32 M, I work as health care professional. I worked as a travel professional in my 20s for 7 years of making well over 6 figures and instead of investing, paying off loans, I decided to travel spend money on partying, having fun all over the US and parts of the world (Not regretting but wish I put a little more away.)  I am now trying to recover in my 30s by working two jobs to get to my goals and I was worried that me pissing all the money in my 20s. I needed to catch up.

 My main goal is to feel financially secure, buy a home and save enough for travel for about 6 months before I really settle down.  I currently saved 36k and have 7k investing in roth. I grew up poor, trailer poor, I think it is why I'm really worried about quitting the other job as I always of worried of going back there and basically no financial literacy or how to invest or save, (found Ramsey being doing it, out of credit card debit and have more money saved than I ever have. but I know there is some other ways to get financially better) 

Student loans are at 898 dollars a month, and I owe 78k on them. I rent currently. 

I believed that working two full time jobs at that amount of money I could get to my goals in a year, I am 2 months of working both full times. In that time I have been able to save about 20k more. However, I am now feeling high level of burnout, I don't do anything but work and I have gained a large amount of weight, (stopped working out as well due to time, which I really enjoy) feeling pressure from both to produce. No enjoyment really in life. I felt because my 20s was one good ole time, I needed to grind.

They are full time jobs, but I typically don't get to 40 hours for either of them, as long as the job is done its done regardless of time. I would say I work 60-70 hours a week, typically but some weeks which has been the issues the last two weeks. I defiantly get 80 maybe even more. More so the 200k job is requiring a lot of time and would say now that takes up over 40 hours most weeks.

The 145k is much more manageable I enjoy my coworkers/pts and is much more established company and is only 20min from my place, I have worked with them for over a year.

The 200k I worked part time they liked my work so they asked to be full time but I didn't want to leave the other job as I liked it but they offered so much more, I felt like I had to take it. And a colleague suggested I do both and now I'm here. 

The 200k is a lot of driving. they have me driving all over the state most days its usually up 2-3 hours daily and on somedays its 5 hours, very unorganized as they just open this department up However my direct supervisor is cool and been as helpful as possible, (I feel like I let them down if I leave, they invested a lot in me)  they hired me as a manger to oversee others however in addition to being in charge of other employees and sometimes their cases that they are requiring me to see full case load of patients as well, I have let them know multiple times that how they are operating is not working (even gave suggestions on how to improve) and its fallen on deaf ears

 However, to turn down roughly 50k is causing me pause

Side notes to see if it was just the fact that it was 2 jobs, I took vacation time from the145k and only worked the 200k recently and I was finding it just as taxing and frustrating. 



I am aware and how lucky and blessed I am to be given these opportunities I wanted to share as much detail so I can get good feedback.

I already leaning heavily on side of quitting the higher paying job.  I just don't want to regret my decision.  I am just curious from the internet what others would do in his situation or thoughts rationales or decisions they would make, or other things I should consider. I would really appreciate some thoughts or feedback

1dl8nxt,How to know if you’re rubbing a co-worker the wrong way?,"Hi guys! Curious to get your unbiased opinion here. I’m in my second month at a new company as a Digital Marketing Manager. They had digital initiatives before but the programs weren’t baked out, and to be frank, the person handling it was not doing a good job at all. This person isn’t a digital marketer (they are comms) and had too much on their plate to even learn or improve the digital vehicles, which is why they created a new role and what brings me here.

I hit the ground running when I started and have since made a lot of little low hanging fruit changes (the bar was low) to improve things in the short term. Long term, I have started to have a lot of conversations with the team on new ideas and ways we can optimize. They all seem excited to change things as they realize that these vehicles aren’t performing as well as they should. They also haven’t had the time to dedicate to digital, so I think they seem excited that someone is taking the bull by the horns.

However, the person who was overseeing all my areas before (social, web, email, paid ads, etc) seems hot and cold with me. Some days, we get along fabulously and they are offering to help but other days they seems short with me. I had a 1:1 with my boss to go over more things and they suggested I collaborate more with the team and put on brainstorming sessions. They cited one example where I put in a job to our PM system and it was something we already had done awhile ago I guess? and suggested leaning on team to talk through my new ideas. It was just a social post, so nothing major, whoch was why I put the request in because it’s so small. But this comment made me think someone is saying I’m not collaborating well? My boss said we went to change things up and that’s why I’m here but maybe it was a “hey, take it slow” thing?

I try and lean on the team and invite the person who was doing everything before to the conversations to do a slow phase out, but truth be told is digital is a mess, and they even admit they don’t know what they are doing. I can’t even leverage this person much and inviting them is more so to make sure they feel included and to play nice in the sandbox. I know it probably doesn’t feel nice because I took a ton of responsibilities away from them but I was brought here for a reason. It’s no slight to them, they just had too much on their plate and didn’t have the expertise.

How can I do this balancing act when most of their tied to digital really need to be cut? Is there a way to better collaborate but still drive the bus?

I've been a restaurant manager since moving back.  The restaurant I work at opens for lunch and so there's an AM manager shift every day.  My main issue is that I have DSPD, which basically means that my sleep cycle is pushed back... I'm a night owl on a genetic level.  I dropped out of high school and never completed my degree because I can't function in the AM... I accepted at some point that I'd never work a 9-5 and am at peace with that.  The company that hired me told me I'd be on nights mostly, but they've been putting me on mornings (6-7am open) and it's taking a huge toll on me, psychologically and physically.  I'm on autopilot until early afternoon, in a total haze.  I lose track of what I'm doing and feel like I'm going to pass out.  By the time my body ""clicks on,"" I'm exhausted and need to go home and nap before I can do anything else.

I know it sounds silly, but, for me it's the same as it would be for most people if their job started putting them on graveyard shifts all the time.  I'd rather be on graveyards, honestly.

I have never gotten past a first-round interview for any job that pays well in my life. I end up working basic jobs and move up when management sees that I'm actually really qualified and a generally good employee. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, and now I'm stuck in a position that is sucking the life out of me.

I am currently Quality Control for a small tool manufacturer. I'm not going to say more, as I don't want to identify myself. I am in charge of the quality of everything that comes through the door: from nuts, bolts, and cardboard boxes to parts at every step of the manufacturing process. I love what I do, but I'm not growing professionally, and the culture is extremely toxic from the top down.

I have skills. I am extremely quick at learning new skills. I love computers. I taught myself SQL and built a database to track incoming parts and their approved or rejected status. I built a database to track non-conforming parts. Both of these were shelved and are not ever going to be used. I am driven, detail-oriented, but can also see how the details affect the big picture of the company. I can do great things if I could only get the chance to prove myself.

When interviewing, it all goes well. Then they ask about experience, and it all goes south. Because of the company I'm at, I can't grow and gain relevant skills to move anywhere because they won't pay for anything new or improved. We are stuck in the 90s. To try and gain skills, I have done some Coursera courses, but that doesn't do much in this market. I've gone to a Career Force, and they helped me rewrite my resume, which is how I've been getting interviews, but because of the lack of relevant skills, I never get a call back.

How can I change this? I'm looking for entry-level work even though I'm not entry-level. I need advice and help, and I don't know where to look or what to do, so I'm turning to Reddit because I'm just lost and hopeless at this point.

1dl7uxq,Grant writing?,"I’m currently a freelance writer at what was once a respectable publication but now is turning into an AI content mill. It’s soul-crushing and I’m thinking about my next steps. 

I’m not against using AI as a writing tool, but I am against publishing AI content without human review. It’s reckless and destructive. I want a career where I can use my brain and writing abilities to help people or further a cause I care about. So I’ve been thinking about grant writing. I don’t see that disappearing any time soon, no matter how much AI progresses, because people don’t play about their money. (But feel free to tell me if you think otherwise.)

I’ve been considering going back to school for a masters degree in macro social work, which would cover grant writing and other aspects of organizational leadership. But that’s a lot of money and I don’t really _want_ to go back to school. The university here offers a grant writing certificate that’s much more affordable. But if I’m going to spend some money on this I’d like to make the best choice possible.

I guess I’m asking whether you think grant writing is a good field to get into, whether I need a degree or just a certificate and portfolio, and any other advice you may have.

1dl7swp,[Need Help] Line Manager went against words,"I need help plx.  
  
**Background:**

I work in a big media buying house (Agency) and the HQ is in UK & USA. I was hired back in 2022 for a fintech client and was given an FMCG client too to handle. I work hard for an 1.5 years and got both my clients country level awards for best Instagram Campaign and Best Digital Startup. I even retained the fintech client for 2 years and my efforts were acknowledged all over the floor (Clients too acknowledged). In Aug 2023, My fintech client POC got removed and a new person stepped in \[not through merit but through favoritism\]. The new POC wanted me to work after office hours and teach how marketing and media works for the brand. At first, i didnot said a word but later i started giving push back after office hours and an email was sent to my GM that i should be removed from the account with false accusation. GM wanted to save the account so removed me from client facing and asked me to work from back. Still, i published my work as case study for fintech client in region which ranked second \[Sept 2023\] and recieved Employee of the month award in Nov \[2023\] from UK region for making powerful dashboard for Fintech client. Also new POC for Fintech client also got fired in Nov 2023 due to extremely poor performance. 

**Timeline of Events**

**1. February 2024: Transfer and Verbal Agreement**

* I was informed of a transfer to another department, which I initially refused as I had not applied for it.
* After discussions with my new line manager, who verbally assured me of a 100% salary increase, I accepted the transfer.
* To document this agreement, I sent an email to HR stating, ""I accept the transfer and as discussed with the HR manager, I have aligned my line manager as to how I can add value in the team so that there isn’t any issue when it comes to my appraisal/elevation in year cycle May 2024.""

**2. May 2024: Unfulfilled Assurance**

* Despite the assurance, I did not receive the promised salary increase or promotion during the appraisal cycle in May 2024.
* I reached out to my line manager, who asked me to wait for a month while he discussed the matter with HR and the managing director.

**3. June 2024: HR Meeting and Denial**

* After a month with no resolution, I raised the issue again and was called into a meeting with HR and my line manager.
* During this meeting, my line manager stated that I was about to be let go from the company and that transferring me to their department \[agency was going through crunching period as we lost big client and my GM wanted to promote my junior who joined an year back so GM wanted me to get transferred as there was no big client in the agency\] (does it sound taking advantage of the situation??? - Harrasment) was a favor. He denied any verbal agreement regarding the salary increase.
* HR dismissed my email as vague and stated there was no written commitment.

**4. Managing Director’s False Accusation**

* The case was escalated to the managing director, who falsely accused me of giving interviews during working hours. When I requested evidence, the managing director responded dismissively, refusing to provide any proof and stating, ""don't catch my words.""

How should i deal with the situation as i believe this is totally injustice and with inflation rising all i received after 2.5 years of hardwork was pennies increment.

1dl6ft9,"Indecisive about my career/research, and mid-PhD crisis","Sorry about the long rant and wall of text. I'd appreciate any advice - apologies for my English as I'm not a native speaker.



To begin with: I am a very risk-averse and indecisive person - it's becoming more and more obvious that it's going to be horrible for my career.



I have an undergrad degree in Electrical Engineering, which I chose because I couldn’t decide between math, physics, and computer science. So I did a dumbed-down version of a mixture of these three. Back then as a high school student, I was vaguely interested in those ""well-structured"" stuff but I'm not particularly passionate about or talented in anything specific.

During my undergrad, I (unsurprisingly) became a jack of all trades and master of none: I did a bit of electronics, a bit of control theory / dynamical systems, a bit of microprocessors, a bit of computer vision, even a bit of computer graphics, topped up with a completely random internship in embedded IoT development.

**Indecisiveness + risk aversion = I cannot get myself to commit to any one single thing because ""what if this fails I need a backup plan""**

I got some generic SWE job offers in non-tech industries upon graduation but I thought I was getting nowhere with this combination of background so I got into grad school,l hoping for life to orient itself.

So obviously, that's wishful thinking and that did not happen. 

**Not consciously forcing myself to focus on something = still no direction.**

I started my PhD but still with a very unstructured approach. And unfortunately, I joined a lab with a completely hands-free supervisor who was a genuinely nice person who emphasised too much individualism, with minimal supervision and career guidance. My research direction is a total mess right now. I had a paper on system robustness which was very fun to work on but turned out to have zero novelty whatsoever. I am now 1.5 years into my programme, and did two ""applied scientist"" internships (this probably tells you how little actual research I've done, how clueless I am and how nonchalant my supervisor is about me). Both were interesting (one in computer vision and one in time series analysis) but did not result in any publication.

Lo and behold - I'm still a jack of all trades and master of none. I still have no idea what I'm doing with my life. Watching my peers, my colleagues and even my roommates being so passionate and focused about their research is very painful and makes me extremely anxious. I am supposed to become an expert in one specific area, not doing something like a general studies or liberal arts degree.

I constantly doubt why I'm even in grad school in the first place. I lack passion. I'm untalented and inconsistent. Again, I cannot get myself to commit to any one single thing because ""what if this fails I need a backup plan""... Maybe I'm better off taking the SWE job offer. But the tech industry is no longer what it used to be like back in 2022, I may not even be able to get the same offers right now. It's bleak.

After all these wandering around, I have just recently begun to realize where my passion might lie: I kind of like dynamical systems, PDEs, information geometry and harmonic analysis. I might want to do more things about optimal control. I remember enjoying complex/harmonic analysis during undergrad and I just rediscovered the beauty of this subject. However, I fear that this is just a ""phase"". I don't trust myself to be consistent enough to go deep enough into the topic. Also, I realised that other people who work in the field, including some of the postdocs in my lab, all have much more rigorous mathematics backgrounds than I do and I'm nowhere near ready to do any serious theoretical work. All I can do is something very trivial, applied and empirical. I do not have enough time to redo much coursework and lay a solid enough foundation for this since I have already passed my preliminary exam (it honestly feels undeserving). I honestly want to redo an undergrad in real math but I think right now my best bet is to finish this degree first...",Normal-Alarm-4857,1,1.0,0,1718982934,2024-06-21 15:15:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dl6ft9/indecisive_about_my_careerresearch_and_midphd/,6,2024

They said currently there isnt anything but they will let me know if something comes up. I waited 2 more months and I saw company A was hiring for the same position I left a few years ago and I reached out to them and got hired within 3 weeks. It’s a hybrid role in a major city. Very relaxed and I finish all of my tasks in 20-30 hours a week as I am certainly overqualified for the role due to my experience. 

Two months into this job and company B reached out to me with an offer that is 55% higher than my current salary, it’s a manager role with 5 days in office and about 9 hours a day. It’s a bit stressful job but nothing that I couldn’t handle. It’s in a small town 2 hours away from the major city. 

I am really tempted to go for more money offered by company B but I am scared of burning bridges with company A, since I reached out to them for a job when I was unemployed and now leaving so soon. I work in a field where people know each other across companies and there are only 4 companies in total.

1dl3g6e,"Seeking Career Advice: Torn Between Software Development, Law, and a Newfound Interest in Dentistry","I am located in Poland and always wanted to study computer science because everyone said it pays well. However, just before starting computer science, I decided to study law instead, thinking it would be more interesting and still pay decently. Plus, money isn't everything. I graduated in law, hoping it would be something I'd enjoy. Unfortunately, I found it extremely boring—mostly reading and working alone in front of a computer with little interaction with others. Moreover, it didn't pay well at all.

In Poland, legal studies last 5 years. During my first year, I got into computer science and have since worked as a mobile software developer. The money is great, and I'm now a senior developer (two years post-law graduation). However, I can't progress further in my career, and I never liked it. It's just like law—working alone in front of a PC.

During my studies, I was diagnosed with severe endogenous depression (a genetic issue in my family). This led me to develop a strong interest in psychiatry. I borrowed books from my local medical university to understand my illness better, and I really enjoyed studying them. I've become quite knowledgeable—my girlfriend, who is a doctor, even asks for my advice in this field!

I've tried starting my own software company multiple times—a startup, a software house, etc. I conducted lectures at tech trade fairs and tried to sell my services to attendees. I loved the traveling and interaction with people, which were both lacking in law and computer science. Unfortunately, none of these ventures took off.

A year ago, I met a girl who is a dentist. Dentistry had never crossed my mind as a career, but it seems incredibly interesting. I study her books and really enjoy it. Every time I try to revisit law as a potential career, I end up hating it.

So, Reddit, I'm asking for your advice. I don't know what to do. I never wanted to be a software developer, but I'm hesitant to jump into dental studies without careful consideration.

I write this because I want to get a new job before I go to college, just to get things set up before i leave and also get out of the situation im in quicker without being jobless. Are there any places besides fastfood looking to hire college kids right now? I had my eye on my local grocery store, but even the last one i tried didn't want to hire me for the fact that im going to college.

1dl2vjj,trying to decide path forward?,"I’m 28 m and feel a bit stuck in things. I never graduated college, mostly struggled through it really got stuck on math and statistics which were required for what I was majoring in. Ended up getting a job in my mom’s accounting office as an AP clerk mostly also doing side stuff. Get paid probly above what someone in my role should be making since my mom wants me to have a living wage, $23 an hour in a fairly low cost of living area. But I coming to the realization it really isn’t enough money and I don’t really have any long term plans. My mom is already in her late 60s and doesn’t need to work anymore and the office is mostly ran by her Vice President but I’m guessing eventually she’s going to fully retire and the office will close maybe in another 5-10 years or whatever, don’t really know where to go in future. I don’t know if I’m cut out for college or trying to attempt it again. I’d love to start my own business, I could get funding to start one but I don’t really know or have experience in anything so I don’t want to just waste money trying to start a random business that seems pretty stupid.

I was somewhat considering maybe trying to take on a trade but I don’t know if it worth trying to totally switch jobs now. I was thinking maybe something like electrical/solar panel installation or plumbing or something but I don’t really know how accessible they are to just join if your totally inexperienced, or how hard switching to a trade is from a lazier office job. The pay decrease also semi worries me, I would be going from $23 an hour to between $17-20 for an apprentice in my area is what I generally seeing, even if it would probly quickly surpass my current salary if I started gaining experience. I’d doing something like this worth considering and trying? I don’t know if I’d want to pay a lot of money or take a job randomly without knowing how the day to day would go like.

1dl0ixz,"tired 20-something needs help/advice after losing wage job, feeling aimless","(Apologies if this is poorly written but I've never made a reddit post before, always been sort of a silent reader.)

So, for context, I was recently let go from my job of one and a half years at a warehouse (who's name I choose to forsake for privacy.) some time back in late April, and since then I have been relying on unemployment to pay my bills, dues, etc,.

In the last month I have been working with Worksource in order to find new employment, and they suggested accounting. I've done a fair bit of research since then in hopes I'd enjoy this career choice, but I feel a great disconnect with it and it just doesn't feel right for me.

This is where I wonder— For others who have been in the same predicament as I, what did you do to decide on a career choice that didn't crush your spirit? How did you know when a career felt right to pursue? 

I don't want to be bound to working wage jobs for the rest of my life, and at my big age I'm determined to find a career that is right for me, so any help I can get is greatly appreciated.

1dl07gf,[Electrical Engineer/Computer Engineer]: Go niche or not?,"Hello,

I'm in a situation where I have to choose between two offers. Both of them are quite technical.

The first one is at a telecom operator, a typical IP engineer. Main competencies needed are CCNA, Python knowledge, and a bit of network security.

The second one is a niche one at an electricity transmission company, where I get to become an expert in optical fibers standards (IEC) and more towards the passive components of an optical telecom network between the electrical substations.

To me, it seems like the niche one will really make me an expert with a lot of technical knowledge of optical fibers specs, and can help me get towards management roles. The common IP role will be just another role with again the basic requirements.

Any advice?

this might be a really petty matter but i could really use options on this 🥲

Im currently working at what we will call Store A. Store A is a **full bus ride away** from me with a **bus every hour**, Its in a **shopping centre** and is a **large store**. The other **staff there are close to my age and im able to have a pretty good conversation with them** which helps my usual 6-9 hour shifts. I get paid minimum wage for my age (18) which is **£8.60 an hour*. However, I have an *extremely rude manager** and they **constantly make my shifts hell** if we are on one together. 

However, I recently got offered a job at another store, which we will call Store B. Store B is **much closer**, in my **local down** and has **multiple buses that i could get** and is literally about 20 seconds from the bus stop. From what ive seen, its **smaller than Store A** and the **staff are quite older than me** and i **dont think i would have much in common** with them. This store Also **closes earlier than Store A** which is nice because it means i can go home earlier/whilst its still light out. It is the **same pay (£8.60)** and the manager of store B is my best friends close family friend so hopefully they would be kinder to me.

Im in a lucky position were i dont need to pay rent but i have been saving £100+ each month i get paid and i give myself a weekly allowance to monitor my spending. With finding another job, im a bit reluctant to because this job i have now is awfully easy and not too stressful (unless its a popular holiday, the weekend or an very entitled customers)

What Store should i pick? or should i just find another job?

I asked a successful patent lawyer one day what he thinks about going to a law school. He probably smelled my stupidity and told me not to, quoting <50% bar pass rate in texas. I was bit shocked to learn about that number as the schools that I was looking at had pass rate of about 90%. Regardless, I would say even 90% is a low number considering failing bar means no job as an attorney. So is it a risky decision?

1dky3v4,Need Help!! ,"I started this internship at a company against my wish as per the college. I thought that i could handle it and just accepted to do it as my credits depended on it. As expected the role informed and the actual role provided was entirely different. The company considered us interns as employees and was made to work like a lot. 
We were asked to handle customer calls. Initially breaks were provided and lunch breaks were also given at the proper time. Gradually everything started to change as they always delayed our breaks saying currently another employee is on break and we had to wait for our turn. This internship was nowhere aligning with our business course and felt like it was ruining our chances to learn something worthwhile. 
My health started deteriorating and even my mental health. I developed stomach related health issues and took sick leave as per the advice of the doctor. Everyday was a stressful day and the manager even said that if I were to take any further sick leave, they would write negative remarks on my internship certificate. 
Fearing that even without properly recovering, I came to the office only to get worsened. I had to directly go to the doctor once again from the office. I never properly understood why I had stomach issues. 
One month almost passed, and out of nowhere my health worsened again. I started vomiting and had intense pain. The office still insisted on coming back to work even after reporting the medical documents. It became unbearable to the point that I decided to quit my internship from this toxic place to recover my health. I informed this to the manager and they were really unhappy with it. 
They reported me to the HR for taking unapproved leave and that I was fabricating everything. I stood up for myself and said that I have to leave the internship for getting proper treatment. I informed the college and I finally left. 
While I was seeing doctors to doctors for my treatment, I got diagnosed with inflammation in my stomach which caused my constant vomiting and pain. It all caused due to lack of proper food at the right time. I also developed issues on the nerve on my neck as I constantly wore headphones without cushion at the office. The manager then informed more negative feedbacks about me to the college and I never understood the reason for this grudge. 
I have constant anxiety and I am depressed. I lost my health and even before I could properly recover, the manager is informing rumours about me to the college. The college is forcing me to go back and complete it. I really am traumatized and going back there is bringing me nightmares.I feel like no one's understanding me and I am slowly getting into this self doubt.I really don't know what action the college is gonna take as they informed that they only believe the company.

I’m looking for some career advice. I graduated college about a year ago and started working full-time at a large tech company. Initially, I was unhappy because the job wasn't what I expected. However, after learning on my own, I’ve found my place and feel comfortable now. Despite this, the position often feels mentally unstimulating, involving a lot of repetitive tasks. Working mostly alone sometimes makes me feel like I'm losing my edge.

I’m torn between staying at my current company or joining the startup. The startup seems like it would be more challenging and allow me to work on projects I'm passionate about. However, I’m concerned it might be difficult to return to big tech in the future if I choose the startup route.

It is important to note this is not a job I would ever intend to keep long term, if I accepted it would only be until I found another job. 

This job is in a city about 45 minutes from where i currently live. I have applied to jobs around the area and if I get one I plan to stay, but I have also been applying to several in a city about an hour from where I currently live and an hour and 15 from where the job is. 

Now onto the issues with this job, the starting pay is $45k a year salaried. I have consulted with others and based off of other job listings this is a pretty low amount for a marketing job in my area. The pay wouldn’t be such a big deal to me of if the benefits weren’t the problem. At this job you get five vacation/sick days per year. In addition to this, you cannot use a certain amount of hours of the time (such as taking two hours off or a half day you must take the whole day. I also wouldn’t receive five days this year, only two, and I can only use them after working there for sixty days. If I accept this job and I fear I will have trouble being able to schedule interviews, especially for a city so far from the job location. I have talked about this with several family members and friends and have gotten mixed advice, therefore I thought I’d come to this subreddit. If you were in my situation, would you accept or reject the job and if you would accept, how would you go about scheduling interviews?

This shouldn’t be the busy season—holiday season is for any ecomm company—so I can only anticipate things getting worse. Currently, I'm struggling with extreme anxiety, lack of sleep, and weight loss due to stress. I’m noticing burnout symptoms just being very angry and constant high alert.



Our company team is already small, and 5 employees, including 2 directors, have left since I joined.



2 days ago, during an HR onboarding check-in, I was asked to rate my job satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest. I rated it a 4, though my true feeling is a 1.



Suddenly, my team’s executive leader, who often belittles me and my direct manager, is expressing gratitude and trying to balance my workload (by passing it off to another overworked colleague).



Today, I discovered a colleague who joined 2 weeks AFTER me is resigning after just 10 weeks (now a grand total of 6 employees leaving within my 2.5 months here!!).



I'm skeptical of this sudden kindness and wonder if it’s because of this employee leaving or if it’s just to keep me around for the busy season. Idk what to make of it. With this sudden shift, should I give them another chance or just leave?

  
I'm also realizing how much I value work-life balance.

1dksq6t,What should I do to get a sales job with little experience.,"Hi,

I've been scrolling on indeed for the past month applying to hundreds of jobs with very few responses, which is to be expected, I have no real work experience with my only ""work"" experience being a volunteer assistant volleyball coach and running a keyboard reselling business for a few years during covid, also the fact that im still in highschool doesn't help. 

  
I've always wanted to start a business of my own, I don't know what so until I figure it out I though a sales job would be the best path to go down. 

  
Issue is, I don't know what would suit me or what jobs I can even get, I've applied to B2B roles, BDR roles, Marketing, Consulting etc, but I feel like no one is taking me due to my inexperience.

So my question is, what can I do to get a job in sales with my current experience, I feel that if I got an interview I can make a good impression but I can't even get an interview.

1dkrp0n,Should I give more than 2 weeks notice?,"Hi all, 

So, I'm going to be leaving the job I'm in on July 8 because I'm moving to another state on the 14th in preparation for starting graduate school on Aug. 1. It's a free ride + stipend deal in exchange for teaching. I decided on July 8 so that I have the rest of that week to finish preparing for the move. 

I currently work a night shift job at a residential treatment facility for troubled youth. I've been there for about 16 months. It wasn't a job that I was passionate about, but at the time I just needed a job and it happened to be open, full-time with benefits, and it was fairly easy (other than adjusting to working nights). I'm a hard worker at whatever job I do, though, and I have a good relationship with my supervisor and coworkers. I usually work alone at night, with my supervisor usually working in an adjacent unit, so we see each other a lot one-on-one. 

I'm considering telling her tonight that I'll be leaving soon, with the 8th my last day. That's not quite 2 weeks yet, but I feel kind of bad about the timing, since our company's third shift has been in an uproar lately due to one other person suddenly leaving, another having to take FMLA time off due to his wife being really sick, and another who is suspended until further notice pending the results of an investigation due to alleged misconduct (which I think is bogus but due to the nature of the company, he can't work again till cleared). And new hires flaking out and my supervisor generally stressed about filling the schedule for the next month.

I know none of that's my fault, and I do have a strict timeline to follow, since the lease at the place I'm moving into in my new town starts on July 15 and I have to be there in person to start my program Aug. 1. I'm just wondering what y'all's take on this is, whether I should tell her now or just wait till the 2 week mark.

1dkroe6,Should I quit my brand new job even though my boss's dad is dying?,"TLDR: After being unemployed for six months, I impulsively accepted my first job offer. My boss has been incredibly disorganized, and I learned that his dad is in the hospital and likely going to pass soon. Since he hasn't been around to train me, my boss has basically passed me off to another department that has me working a completely different job to keep me busy. Do I quit?  
  
For some background, I (24) was employed full-time up until January 2024, when I had to leave my position due to a change in management that was suddenly no longer willing to honor my scheduling accommodations that allowed me to take classes while holding the position. I was ready to prioritize getting my bachelor's so I decided to become a full-time student, hoping to get a part-time position to get experience. Unfortunately, the demanding coursework and scattered class schedule made it impossible to get a job during the semester. If I did make it to the interview stage, my schedule and availability were often cited as why I could not be offered the position at that time. 

Once the semester ended, I shifted my focus back to applying for jobs. One of the jobs I applied to was as a data analyst role at the school I attend. Although I wasn't too excited for the role (1.5 hour commute, state minimum wage, only 10 hr work week), it's relevant experience to my career goals (I'm studying Information Science/Tech and Data Science), and it being a student position with my university assured that they would accommodate my class schedule in the future. The interview went incredibly well, and I was offered the position the next day. I was hesitant to accept at first, but I had been unemployed for months, and I was cutting into my small savings that was reserved for tuition to be able to pay my share of rent and groceries. I accepted the job that day, as I was not interviewing for any other roles at the time.

I began the data analyst role earlier this week, and am allowed to set my own schedule, so I have it that I only come in twice a week so I don't have to make the long, expensive commute so much. On the first day, my supervisor informed me that he did not have any trainings prepared as he had been very busy. I sort of brushed it off, as my last position was also at a university overlooking students in my position, so I assumed he would just leave me alone to do homework or acclimate myself to the campus. Instead, he walked me over to another department and informed me that whenever I was not busy with my data analysis that I would be expected to help another department with giving campus tours and helping students register for classes, as that department was understaffed. They similarly didn't have any training materials for me and simply gave me a lanyard, directing students and parents my way. Of my 6 hour day, 4-5 hours were spent in this other office.

My second day was going to be for training, but my supervisor kept pushing it back hour by hour, until eventually he informed me he would not be coming in or holding the training. Instead, I was expected to spend my entire day with that other department, helping them guide new students and such. I was going to protest, but the head of that department let me know that my supervisor is dealing with some serious personal issues that kept him from coming in. When I sent him a message wishing him well, he informed me that it was about his dad, whose health outlook was looking really bad, before telling me they were rushing his dad to the hospital.

I feel incredibly bad for my boss, as I know he must be going through a lot. However, for all the things regarding my position, I feel like these are all bad signs. I don't think I should be expected to work an entirely different job just because my actual job wasn't ready for me. I took this position for the relevant experience, and all of my jobs before this were receptionist-type jobs, and I was really looking forward to not working a customer-facing role again. I would have rather been sent home or told not to come in so I could save the \~$25 it takes for me to commute to a job that pays so little. I feel really stuck right now. I've kept applying to jobs, but I still haven't gotten any other interviews. At the very least, I want to raise concerns and set some boundaries, but I cant even seem to get my boss to read an email from me if I include more than 1 question.

Am I being heartless by wanting to give up on this job so soon even when my boss is going through it?

Additional note: During the interview, it was mentioned that I might have to help this other department occasionally, which I assumed meant when they got really busy, or to assist them in data-viz things. I'd be understanding if it was either of these, but it definitely isn't.",Hot-Work-1890,3,0.800000011920929,8,1718931928,2024-06-21 01:05:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dkroe6/should_i_quit_my_brand_new_job_even_though_my/,6,2024

But I’m craving something more directly impacted or outcomes based. I guess a start to finish type job. I am a problem solution oriented person and very analytical.

Been in the government/non profit space my entire career (6 years…I’m 27 years old) 
I have BA in political science and communications 
I have a masters in Public Policy specializing in housing policy and community development

Almost a year later, I'm miserable at my new job. It's a lot of work and stress and I miss the community of people I had at my old job. I want to quit and take a break from working altogether while I figure out my next career move (and I have a windfall from my dad's estate to fall back on if it takes awhile to find a job). I don't know how much of my misery at my new job is due to the actual job, missing my friends from my old job, or the grief, but it's hard to imagine staying here for long. What should I do? Should I stick it out and see if things change or should I just quit and take the time off to figure out what's next for me? I don't even know if I want to stay in this industry at this point.

1dkmn2h,Applying for a job that my employer might find out. Need advice,"Hi everyone. I have an opportunity to apply for a job at a company that is much better than the place I currently work at. It is a bigger company, a lot more stable, better benefits and salary.

The problem is that my company is one of their significant clients. I'm aware that I'm protected by GDPR (I'm in EU member state) and in theory no one should know about my application. But, people talk and I'm fairly certain that my boss will find out. Add to that the fact that I don't have the best relationship with him but I'm playing dumb and pretend we're OK and he does too.

For context, my wife and I had a baby a few months ago so I can't take too much risks. My current job is fine but it is a dead end and most of the time it is pretty boring and I've been feeling miserable there for some time.

So, is it worth it, should I risk it or skip it.?

1dkm30b,I need a job,"Essentially just copy/pasting something I posted in r/Advice and the only comment I received was to look here and other subs for more advice. 

So as the title suggests, I need a job. I have been unemployed for a little over a month now but have been searching for a job for ongoing 8 months. Before you ask, I did not quit, I had just completed a 20-month contract with Google participating in their apprenticeship program. Amazing opportunity filled with incredible memories made with people who are just radiate golden energy, and what started off as a mythical journey, I was left with this bitter taste in my mouth at the end of it.

At the start, I felt like Bilbo Baggins. Venturing off into the tech industry with one of the largest tech giants inspired me with an ungodly amount of self-confidence, happiness, curiosity, and overall hope that my life was going to catapult into something I couldn't fathom at the time. This offer came at the right moment too, I was simultaneously embracing fatherhood while mourning the loss of my own father. It seemed like this opportunity was heaven sent (and in its own way I still think so).

About midway through the program, I started to think about post-program opportunities. As much as I would have loved to stay with Google, amidst the layoffs and them repeatedly telling us there is no pathway for conversion, I wasn't going to put too much stock into landing a career with Google. Doesn't mean that I didn't try, and I've tried about 14 different times. This just meant I needed to look externally for opportunities, and there was an abundance of o. At this point, I had no worries and was assured by everyone involved in this apprenticeship program that there will be amazing opportunities waiting for us at the end. Some even went on to say that by just having Google on our resumes, jobs will be fighting over us.

The first hundred or so rejections didn't hurt as much, and then 2024 came. I still had about 5 months, so I was still optimistic. I had been involved in some really amazing projects and had been recognized by several managers and was given more bonuses than anyone else I know that was in the program with me. I was sure by revamping my resume and leveraging connections I've made at Google and on LinkedIn will make a difference.

It did not.

So maybe it's not time for me to move into the tech industry full-time. I have a ton of previous customer service experience and managerial experience; I should find a job in no time.

I have not.

Ladies and gentlemen, I am here to ask for some advice since I seem to have put myself in some sort of limbo between being overqualified and being underqualified. During this long job search, I have amassed a grand total of 4 companies interviewing me. One of which had me go through 3 interviews, waited a month and then received my rejection in an email that was 30 words or less. I have had recruiters tell me to my face they will not hire me because from a glance they can tell ""i am overqualified"", ""I would not be happy doing the jobs they have available"", and ""that I would find something better within a couple of months of them hiring me"".

Now to be fair, I heard someone talk about how much it cost to onboard a regular agent for a call center I worked at about 7 years ago (something around $35,000), so I can understand from an investment standpoint, but at the same time I still have a family I have to provide for.

I've only recently started receiving payments from unemployment, but that's only so much and to be honest, I cannot stand not working. However, no one is hiring me.

It's taking everything in me, daily, to keep myself from giving a tree a really intense hug at 120 mph. Figure of speech, of course, don't need to make this post about something else when that isn't even how I really feel.

I literally have no idea what more to do. Staffing agencies won't call me back. Any job fair I've attended, they've all told me I'm overqualified for the positions they're hiring for. Every referral I've received from an internal employee has been thrown in the trash. I've never felt this rejected since trying to find a date to the high school dance (lol).

My girlfriend has been incredibly supportive during this time, but parts of me feel like I'm disappointing her. Earlier today she had an interview and was offered the job a few hours later. This stirred up some inner dialogue that is starting to spiral. She says it's fine, and that we'll get through this, and I will find a job, but I just worry that eventually her stance on that will shift and turn into ""ugh, why doesn't he just get a f\*ing job already"". I've brought this up, and she assures me that won't happen. However, as a man, I feel like if I'm not able to find a job and provide for my family, I'm a piece of shit.

So, any advice?",throwawayp00pa,2,1.0,0,1718916470,2024-06-20 20:47:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dkm30b/i_need_a_job/,6,2024

The job  is good, tons of learning, and support to grow skills set.

However, my first boss (the one who hired me)  decided to go on a sabbatical time in the middle of my onboarding. That shaked things up since a lot of people didn't expected that. And well, my onboarding ended up being quite messy to say the least.

Tl;dr, the new person taking his projects and people "" temporarily "" is... different.  She makes it very evident that she doesn't like me. Every time I speak, she ignores me. She makes an effort to exclude me in  every project, she talks me down and belittles me every time we share a video call. 

I tried to bond with her, but she just rejects me. She doesn't say anything directly or too confronting, but you know when someone dislikes you, even if they are wearing a smile.

I like this job. I could see growth with my first boss. But now, I even fear she could fire.

On top of that, I was expected to move to another city, process that now I'm postponing out of fear of being left jobless in a place I don't know and that happens to be more expensive than my current location.

I don’t want to lose my job, but I'm clueless on what to do here. Never been in a situation where my boss actively dislikes me. Any advice on how to handle this situation?

My ex manager is a complete freak.

Now I have another job offer and am leaving the company and had decided to complain my HR against him, my HR wants me to raise it to a very high level, while I just wanted to let them know as a precautionary measure henceforth. Should I raise it up or not?

1dkkla8,How to say no to a manager who doesn't care about boundaries?,"tldr: Manager added something new to my plate that is outside my JD, outside my skillset, outside my career goals, outside normal work hours, and my plate is already full. Manager doesn't really respect boundaries (plus I'm a people pleaser) - how do I say no?

My manager recently asked me to take on a project manager role for a new project. I normally like to take on new things for the challenge and growth and I'm a people pleaser so my first instinct was to not object (this wasn't presented as an optional assignment), but now that I've had time to think about it I have some reservations (listed below) that make me want to try and push back more. I am an exempt employee and my manager is not particularly concerned with boundaries so I'm not sure how/if I can say no and would appreciate any advice you all have on how to proceed. 



My concerns:

- I am not currently and have 0 interest in becoming a PM. I have told my manager in the past what my longer term career goals are and they are not even PM adjacent. My manager thinks it would be good for me to PM this project to put myself out there and gain the spotlight a bit, but I don't see the benefit in getting in the spotlight for doing something I have no experience/knowledge of or interest in doing longer term.

- My plate is pretty much full. We use a project management/task tracker so I can say that with data backing me up. My manager's take on it is that I should be doing work more quickly and rather than aiming to meet deadlines, to get things done before deadlines so that I can take on more things (which feels a little toxic/burn-out-ty culture to me). My manager does not have technical knowledge of what my role entails and cannot offer any guidance on how I would be able to do things more quickly but insists it is possible.

- The project is based outside of our geographic area and would require me to get on calls outside of our normal business hours (along the lines of 9/10pm or 5/6am). I have two young kids and this would impact my life outside of work in a negative way. I was also told when I started this role (under a different manager, unfortunately) that I would not be expected to work outside of normal business hours for our region.",OkArt8054,1,0.6000000238418579,2,1718912683,2024-06-20 19:44:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dkkla8/how_to_say_no_to_a_manager_who_doesnt_care_about/,6,2024

1dkj8j6,Choosing Between Jobs with a Baby on the Way,"I apologize if this gets way too long. Currently, my husband and I are expecting our first baby. I'm only 6 weeks along, but I already feel the complexity of becoming a mother. My predicament is this:

There are four people doing in my position. Since March, I've been doing the jobs of two full time employees while recruitment efforts have taken place to fill the gap I'm covering as well as in another area. In exchange, I've received a 10% increase in pay until my stint is up. I was also offered, in March, to move divisions due to issues occurring in my current division that made for a toxic work environment. The environment came about from the company having financial difficulties and experiencing a large layoff that targeted a specific class of employees, but they continuously give increases and stipends to many people. This week, and for a multitude of reasons including resolving the toxic workplace issues, I have decided I no longer want to move divisions. My current division and I have a fantastic flexible environment and I've realized the few bad apples can be ignored and I was to blame a good deal for letting it affect me so much. I never signed anything and the entire transition would be informal. However, my new supervisor is forcing me to move divisions because it's for my ""professional good"" and she thinks I'll ""be happy"" and can handle the work because I ""answer emails quickly."" This will result in permanently doubling my work load but taking away the 10% increase in pay.

I have been applying to many places, mostly remote work. I applied to a similar company, but different field, that's 45 minutes from my house and does not currently have remote work options (which is why their previous employee left). They are willing to pay handsomely over what I make now but there's barely any flexibility. With the baby on the way, I'm now stressed out about future daycare costs, doctor's office locations, etc. Being 45 minutes one way, that's also an increase in wear and tear on my car. Even more so with the massive amounts of construction on the way there. I have the second and final interview tomorrow, so I am prematurely worrying because I may not receive an offer. I am the type to want to know as much as possible before I make a decision. 

My husband says we can make it work, which is very much his style. He travels for work and, as it stands, will continue to do so after the baby is born. I say this because the daycare pick ups and drop offs, appointments, sick baby, all of that would fall to me at least half of the year. Due to his lack of driving, we also consider trading in both cars to upgrade to one nice one. That then fuels my worry about sick baby - he could get a Lyft, but that's very expensive, and I can't leave work and do the work from home which I could with my current job. My current job's benefits are way better, more sick time and vacation, but the pay leaves me with only change after my bills. My husband and I split bills mostly 50/50 but I know he'd be willing to take over more so I can have more money available for emergencies and pet related expenses.

Do I bite the bullet on the child care concerns and take the higher paying job or do I keep the low paying job with the incredible flexibility? As a first time mother who is already anxious, the flexibility is a very big deal for me, but my current company is ridiculous. Either the money stresses me out or my baby's care stresses me out... Any advice that isn't my biased husband?",No_Rest_9648,1,1.0,0,1718909263,2024-06-20 18:47:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dkj8j6/choosing_between_jobs_with_a_baby_on_the_way/,6,2024

1dkikhp,I'm a new employee and my manager seems to be ghosting me,"Looking for some advice. I recently just started a new job as a server at a restaurant (hired about 3 weeks ago) and just completed some training shifts this past week. Not sure the status of my onboarding process but most of the employees are scheduled through the online employee portal. Originally, the manager reached out to me via text to schedule my first shift (which I thought was a little odd but it isn't really a big deal to me) and then I reached out to them the following week to ask when my next training shifts were going to be and we figured out a few dates that worked. I completed those shifts no problem and everything seemed normal, I even got paid for those shifts that I worked so I know I'm not being taken advantage of or anything.

Now we have reached this week. I checked the employee portal and there is still nothing on there. So I reached out to the manager via text to ask them to confirm whether or not I had any hours for that week because that is what we had done the previous time. Usually they had been really good about responding within an hour or two to my messages but I heard nothing from them that day. I reached out the next day via email in case maybe they were having some cell phone issues or had just missed my text, again no response. Called in today to ask if I could speak with the manager over the phone and was told that they were not in their office but they would tell the manager to call me back (this confirmed to me that the manager was not on vacation or anything). To be honest, I am not really expecting to get a call back at this point. 

I'm not even chasing after hours and would not be upset if I was not scheduled for this week, but I would just like some communication about what I should be expecting or even just a ""Hey, we're still working on the schedule"" but I have heard absolutely nothing from them.

In the case that they do not contact me back, what do you think reasonable next steps would be? What is a good amount of time to wait before attempting to contact again? I don't really have contact info for anyone else other than the HR manager and it seems a little extreme to contact the HR manager over scheduling communications and I do not want to start any conflict with the manager because we will be working together. Is this a sign that I am being fired or maybe that I should go ahead and leave the job?

1dkiefk,How can I feel motivated to work hard?,"This is semi venting lol. 23f in full time sales job. WFH. Wanting to make a change already. I don’t know why but I’ve been having weird feelings about work. Before this I was in a different type of sales and worked super hard while in school. I’ve been overwhelmed at times but I feel like a sales role of this caliber is just way out of my depth. I feel really unhappy, even tho I have a great pay and benefits. But I am legitimately crying a majority of the days of the week. I feel really distracted at home and feel like I’m going stir crazy. I think I really need an in person job, which makes me feel dumb bc everyone wants a WFH job..

I feel so out of place. I feel unmotivated, and I question how people actually want to work and care. These feelings are recent. My parents are both drug addicts in and out of jail, and have pretty much given up on any sort of job… I watched my dad lose the business he owned and it sent him through a spiral. He was such a hard worker. My mom never wanted a full time job and just liked working at the mall a few hours a week. They both have such strong aversions to ever working again and continuously choose to scam and other stuff for money instead of just working. I feel weird when I see people of their age working with me, and I wonder if it’s normal to want to work in a high stress job. I have never had these feelings before and I wonder if it’s contributing to me not liking my job.

I want to switch to teaching. I have a degree in an area of science and am considering trying to teach that class to a highschool. I know all jobs come with their own set of issues, and I would take a substantial paycut, but sales is so so so uncomfortable for me I just can’t do this long term. Also the threat of getting put on a plan despite me making revenue for the quarter just makes me feel horrible (I’m below on one of the other kpis besides revenue). I feel embarrassed everyday. I just paid off my student loan so I feel like why not do something else now that I have the freedom of debt right now. I worry about burning out like my dad, and I don’t see why I’m putting myself through a a high stress job that I hate when this is the only time in my life I have to try other things out (getting married and living with partners family in upcoming years, they are Indian so trying out dif jobs while I’m there is a no-no. Traveling alone is also a no-no and I want to do that too and fail to see when I will have the time in the job I’m at now. I currently help out with my grandparents and siblings, but only financially with groceries and some house upkeep and repairs, bills paid by other family members).

I talked to my grandmother and she agreed I should do something else. I just feel dumb. I feel like there’s something wrong with me for wanting to take it easy w the stress, but then I think about what I have gone through with my parents (physical, mental, and financial) and maybe I owe it to myself to take it easy for a bit before life really does get difficult.. I have been working consistently since I was 17 and have never had a break from school either, I took overload units. During semester and full time classes every summer to graduate on time (impacted major + major change lol) 

Is this feeling normal? Am I irrational for wanting to leave my current job for lower pay? Do adults really feel motivated to work and provide for their families ??? I’m scared that I’ll never feel that feeling.",E6rthAng3l,2,1.0,2,1718907172,2024-06-20 18:12:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dkiefk/how_can_i_feel_motivated_to_work_hard/,6,2024

1dke8dj,Seeking Advice: Quitting without a job lined up.,"This is a long post so apologies in advance. Feel free not to read it. 

TLDR: Honestly about to quit my job with nothing lined up after my annual performance review and a laughable raise offered, that still has me below market standards for my position. 

I know the advice is going to be 95% do not quit in this environment, but I honestly can't see myself staying here at this company even while trying to apply and interview for other jobs. I currently work as a marketing coordinator and had my annual performance review where I honestly felt utterly disrespected and undervalued for the work I have been doing for the last year. I am currently underpaid by $3 on the hour for my area's market and the raise I got was $1.50 not even putting me at the entry-level salary I should have been at anyway. 

During the annual review, the only thing they could criticize was I ""didn't think outside the box enough"" and that they were underwhelmed with the social media performance. I proceeded to then share the actual metrics from our social media accounts which they were not interested in at all (ironic from a marketing standpoint). Over the last year, I have increased our social media following by over 50% on multiple accounts, including 248% on Instagram alone. On Facebook, Impressions were up 645%, visits up 116%, reach increased by 765%, followers by 80%, and our Click Rate on links up by 534%. All of that and I got hit with a we are underwhelmed by our social media because it isn't ""creative enough"" and when asked how they would like to see it changed I got crickets for the most part. 

They also failed to acknowledge or listen to the fact that I took over our website internally after we fired the company running it, I took over all graphic design (my original background) cutting costs on outsourcing, SEO, and Blogs, and started running our automated marketing efforts and digital advertising. 

With all of this shit pilled up, they had the audacity to put me on a $1.50 raise with a 90-day probationary period The raise I was asking for was to at least put me at the deserved market rate and a slight increase above that based on my performance and added responsibility/duties. I should also mention I don't get healthcare (was lied to about a healthcare stipend I haven't seen once in the year I have been here), no 401k or retirement options, 1 bonus during the entire year for $248, and 5 days of vacation... Having a hard time justifying staying here and working harder to prove myself to keep a raise that is honestly insulting to begin with since it doesn't even put me at where I should have been when I started.

1dkdn33,My promotion is on hold for financial reasons but another employee got a salary bump,"I've been a manager at a small, mostly remote firm for three years with glowing performance reviews and increasing responsibilities. In December, I was promised a promotion to director. However, after losing a big client in January, my promotion was postponed. Since then, we've lost a third of our team, and I've shouldered more responsibilities.

Now, the outlook doesn't look much better, but I know we have enough clients and work that the business will survive. It's been over six months since my promised promotion, and I feel taken advantage of. I'm already job hunting, ideally for a director role despite not having that title yet.

Recently, I discovered another employee received a pay raise without a title change (so it was quiet), which has really confused and upset me.

1dkbzal,Seeking Advice: Balancing Care for Elderly Parents and Pursuing My Career,"

Hello, 

I find myself at a difficult crossroads and could use some advice. Here’s a bit of background to provide context:

My mother has been battling clinical depression since her twenties. Her condition requires continuous attention and care, and I’ve been a primary caregiver. Despite the challenges, we have managed financially thanks to a decent pension, which is sufficient for us to live comfortably. However, I’ve always aspired to be independent and carve out a career path for myself.

Recently, I’ve been presented with an opportunity that could significantly advance my career. It would provide not only professional growth but also a sense of independence and personal fulfillment that I deeply crave. The downside is that it would require me to be away from home for extended periods, making it difficult to provide the level of care my mother needs.

I’m torn between two choices:

Stay and Continue Caregiving: This would mean putting my career aspirations on hold indefinitely. While we’re financially stable, I worry about my own personal growth and sense of independence.

Pursue My Career: This would allow me to achieve personal and professional goals, but it comes with the guilt and concern of not being there for my mother as much as she needs me. I’d need to find alternative care solutions, which might not be as comforting or effective for her.

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s faced similar dilemmas or has insights into balancing these kinds of responsibilities. How did you make your decision? What steps did you take to ensure the well-being of your loved ones while pursuing your own goals? Any advice on how to navigate this situation would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your support and guidance.",Postywashere,1,1.0,1,1718891033,2024-06-20 13:43:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dkbzal/seeking_advice_balancing_care_for_elderly_parents/,6,2024
1dkbbaz,Should I delete the work client didn’t pay for or report them to the department of labor/ IRS?,"I previously worker as a social media intern for $150/mo 15 hrs a week at a 503c nonprofit. 

However, I was a 1099 contractor in reality and they were paying me through zelle. 

I stopped putting effort into the job after I found out how much I was actually getting paid. - They only gave me a vague number during my onboarding. 

Previously, I never hit the required 15hrs a week but my effort was evident and I got paid. (9 posts in a month)

Recently, I did 8 posts in the month with less effort but still got good engagement on the posts.

The client (my boss) refused to pay me and prorate my stipend. I told him to at least pay me $85 for the work I did, but he refuses to pay me for the work I did.

 Since I was a 1099 contractor, I’m not sure if I have any rights here. I’m debating between:

A. Sign into the account and delete the posts I worked on

B. Report the company to IRS for Misclassification or department of labor for not paying me 

C. Sign in to their account and advertise on their social media that they were using the term “intern” to find cheap labor. Ironically the organization exists to help young creative people of color lol. 

D. Creating a social media page where I create a post every day asking people to put pressure on them to pay me lol - “this is day x of asking ___ for my money”

What do you guys feel would be the best course of action? I’m not sure if I’ll get compensated.

I am 16M, studying in high school but hella stressed out for my career which changes every day. I love physics listening about it or talking about it gives me a dozens of dopamine but I also want to help my pay my father's home loan (btw he sacrificed his dreams for giving me privilege to study) and I researched that you cannot get paid good in the astrophysics careers. So I thought why not just do double majors of data science with astrophysics which are high paying jobs also I am going to learn some of computer science in high school. I love theories of relativity, solving math equations and also interested in AI. I see myself solving mysteries of space like dark matter or dark energy I really want to give humanity something. In my POV my financial situation also matter as my desires so my questions are:
1. Is it worth it to do both of them?
2. Is it hard to do both of them?

Never the top of the class but always close without the need to study much. I consider myself lucky in this aspect (less so in others, the world is fair and I've got a million areas I wish I had been more blessed in). This however, has caused a huge problem which I'm fully realising now, 10 years after graduating college. I'm lazy as hell, I've always been. And somehow I've found a decent paying job which has allowed me to be this way. 

I work from home 3 days a week, and basically do nothing for those 3 days. Sure, I'll try to sit at my desk and I'll join in on calls. But other than that, I do nothing. As a result, after 3 years in this job I haven't gained any skills. I'm basically unemployable for any positions of my seniority.

1dk9a67,Should I accept an offer from a big international after working a job for only 3 months post grad?,"I’ve been at my current company for 3 months and it has been exhausting. Everything takes forever to progress, there’s no set management in place, no central data for anything, I am extremely uninspired and unmotivated, it’s not what I want to do in life, and it seems like the boss wants to revamp management to encourage employees to be more capable and committed to a company using a stricter quantitive performance evaluations. Also barely any days off, barely any vacation days, you need a doctor’s note for even a single sick day, and no more than 4 consecutive days off. 

However I really like my senior colleague who’s been sorta like my supervisor. She guides me through the company culture, gave me advice about future jobs, and helped me with general adulting stuff (insurance, taxes, etc). 

Also despite the job being soul sucking it’s really, really chill because no one knows how to remotely do my job + everything at the company is painstakingly slow and me at bare minimum is extremely fast to them. My boss is VERY VERY happy with me too, so there’s no pressure. Also, he actually lets me offer ideas and implement them (even if it does take forever). 

However, I’ve been inspired by a friend and decided to try applying to a job or two, only ones that I’ll actually like. 

And I got one. 

It’s at a bigger international company with 20% higher salary, lunch provided, a hybrid work model, potential career growth, and it’s aligned with what I want to do. 

I was ecstatic but fearful. 

I’ve never worked at a big company before, at least not a company with more than 50 employees. I don’t know how big companies work and I’m scared it’ll be more restricting. I’m also fearful that age, seniority, and mind games would be a big thing here (haven’t gotten a sense of it from the interview, but who knows?) 

Also would this look bad on my resume? I’m also getting attached to the people at my job. 

I was also told that I shouldn’t switch jobs so early postgrad, that no one gets experience from just 3 months and experience should be my #1 priority as a new job seeker.

Hey Redditors, my qualifications: I am a recent B.E. Biotech graduate with zero work experience. I need some advice on choosing between an MBA in India and an MS in Biotechnology in countries like the UK, US, Germany, or Canada. My goal is to land a high-paying job, but getting into a good MBA program in India is really tough, especially since I have zero work experience, making an MBA abroad impractical as I'd only get into mediocre colleges. If I don't get accepted into an MBA program, my only option is to go for an MS in Biotech abroad, a field I'm not very enthusiastic about. Doing an MS in India isn't worthwhile either, as the biotech field isn't well-developed here. With the January intake for most countries nearing and my MBA entrance exam in November, I need to make a decision quickly. Given these circumstances, what would you choose in my situation and why?

1dk3idw,"I’m 31F and have never been a manager, feel behind. Any success stories of those becoming leaders later career?","

I have a BA in Communications, 2020. 

Started my professional career outside of food service in 2016 at company A as a customer service assistant. Three years later I was finally promoted to a customer service representative. Management had high interest in me, told me I was sharp, bright, very organized and accurate, and they were grooming me for management. They got me involved in cross functional projects and everything was going great, except I didn’t relish being a customer service manager. When they mentioned management, I was blindsided, and told them I wasn’t sure if I was interested and was more interested in marketing. My manager told me that I didn’t seem like I’d fit in since I was quiet and shy. But every time I walked by the marketing department, I was a bit jealous and fascinated by what they were doing. Creating graphics and presentations, writing technical documents, drafting communications, photography, editing. I also didn’t highly regard my manager, who was a micromanager. Anyways, during COVID, I was actually let go, due to being late. I had been searching for a marketing job to no avail for months, and started performing not great at my job by being a little late a couple of times. I was there 4.5 years.

A month later, I got a job as a sales support specialist at company B after applying to hundreds of jobs. Unfortunately, this turned into a distribution planning specialist, in supply chain. I ended up staying with this company for 2.5 years. It was an outsourced role with no room for growth.

A year ago, I started at company C as a Customer Ops Coordinator. I was enticed by their promise to get me promoted and their claim that I could transfer into any other department later after learning customer service. The training has been very lacking and management is the worst I’ve ever seen at this company. Extremely toxic, bullying managers. I’ve witnessed new coworkers crying due to how they talk to us. Unrealistic expectations. 50% (8/16) turnover in one year. 7 people fired since I’ve been there. Lots of threats from management. Lots more I could get into.

long story short, I feel like I have fudged up my career. I should have taken the customer service manager proposition from my first company, and I would have a much stronger resume than I do now. Right now, I probably look like a job hopper who doesn’t progress in their roles. I don’t even know what I want to do anymore. Marketing is so huge and oversaturated. I know customer service and maybe I should stay in it, but it doesn’t pay well. I only make 52k. Many of my peers and younger are managers by now. I have managed in my teen years at a fast food location, but that’s it.

TLDR: I’ve considered going into recruiting, supply chain, pricing, and more, but I don’t know what’s realistic. I want to start a family soonish, within 1-3 years, and I’m worried about my career. I need more income.

So I had no choice but to resign since I couldn’t sustain that. 

Now, I just was able to have someone watch my kids so I can work every day fulltime. This just happened during my 2 week notice. I would like to get my job back because I like it and the colleagues. Would it be wise to ask to retract my resignation or has that ship sailed? 

I am in a good spot financially so if I cant get the job back I can look for another in the meantime. 

Maybe perhaps another option is doing contract work for them since I know the clients and process. 

Does this make any sense or forget about it?",neuromancer-ai,1,1.0,2,1718858971,2024-06-20 04:49:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dk3eri/is_it_possible_to_retract_a_resignation_if_i_left/,6,2024
1dk3837,What kind of career would suit a Medical Graduate with Business Experience and an Interest in IT & Management?,"Hi everyone,

I recently migrated to the US and am seeking some career advice. I graduated as a medical doctor outside of the US, but my interests have shifted away from practicing medicine. Before moving, I was involved in business, and I enjoy working with computers and have a strong interest in management.

Although I'm interested in IT, I feel that I'm too old to start learning coding from scratch. Recently, I’ve been considering medical coding as a potential career path since it seems to align well with my background.

Can anyone suggest other career options that might be suitable for someone with my background and interests? Any advice on transitioning into these fields and the necessary qualifications would be greatly appreciated.

1dk2sc4,I want to make a career transition but feel directionless,"I have always been academically oriented; I got straight A’s in school and went to a top 10 college. However, I majored in English and film and moved out to LA upon graduation to pursue a creative career in screenwriting and filmmaking. Now, I’m 25 and I feel that my momentum and initial drive has ground to a halt. I am seeing success in a creative career as unlikely now and I crave something more stable, where I can earn money and make a good living. I have also been working as an agency assistant for the past 2 years (low pay and high stress), and I do not want to continue on that track and become an agent, either. I want to make a full career transition to something else, but I’m not sure what.

I’ve thought a lot about law school, but I don’t want to do it just because my brother did. He’s really passionate about the law; I, however, am not really that interested in it, and I don’t want to enter into that commitment lightly just because it seems ""safe."" 

I’ve also entertained the idea of finance or consulting, but I have no experience in it and don’t know if I could even break into those fields. Also I don’t know how to pick any career path since I’ve only ever studied and interned in the entertainment industry so I don’t feel innately connected to anything else. I have lots of intellectual curiosities and interests, and I’m sure I could be good at a lot of things, but I don’t know how to pick.

1dk2k1t,Is switching careers a good idea if I care mostly about money and not burning out?,"To summarize, I am a 24-year-old graduating with a Health Science degree this fall, who switched out of my college's nursing program. I have worked many entry-level and minimum-wage jobs in a myriad of fields ranging from retail, food service, and even IT.

My friend is offering to refer me to his workplace. It's not anything sketchy, but most of the pay (70-85%) comes from gratuity. He showed me his paystubs and it is competing with physician assistant level pay around where I live.

At this point in life, I just want to make money as soon as I can. I want to raise a family, buy a house, travel... and I am considering doing the work part-time because it might still allow me to have enough free time to pursue graduate school. But at the end of the day, if I am making just as much money as a PA (or maybe even more), why should I even bother?

I heard that there are benefits to transitioning full-time. I guess I'm just worried for my own self-esteem (working at a job that pays a lot, and requires little to no education) and how I've ""wasted"" years of my life pursuing a degree I will never use.

  
TLDR; friend offers high-paying job in different field. I am tempted to not pursue graduate school because the pay is just as good as my end-point. Feels like I wasted my time in college so I might just work part-time and go to graduate school anyways even if I will still be making as much money with near-equal or even less pay.",EDMenjoyer,3,0.8100000023841858,5,1718855930,2024-06-20 03:58:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dk2k1t/is_switching_careers_a_good_idea_if_i_care_mostly/,6,2024
1dk2g8i,Architecture or Civil Engineering?,"Hello, currently I’m a Canadian student that tries to figure out which University bachelor to chose. Struggling to make a decision between going to B. Sc. Arch and pursuit career as an architect or going into Civil engineering.

*If anyone can give me any advice, share their experience or provide any help with decision making, I’ll be really grateful, cause I’m struggling with this decision for a long time*

I’ll also shortly mention my pros and cons for each industry (I’m located in Quebec) 

So architects licensing proses is really long, basically 3 years bachelor, 2 masters and 3 years of internship before being able to obtain a good salary. Furthermore I heard many complaints about this career in Canada that are related to the quality of the industry.

Civil Engineering is has more perspectives. Government invest in your education, paid internships, higher salary and faster time period to obtain licence.

It is hard to choose for me because of dreamy expectations of Architect career that seems to align more with my career desire and also I think I’ll be able to bring something new to the industry, however engineering has more potential and market demand, and I’m kinda interested in this too.

1dk159j,Which job should I choose?,"Which job should I choose?

I’m indecisive about whether I should leave my current job for a new job offer I received and if it’s worth it or not. 

I’ve been in my current job for 4 years, and I’ve worked my way up from $26 an hour to $80,000 a year over these 4 years. I’ve had three title changes (none to manager, just things like supervisor and senior), and it’s my first job since I graduated from college. It’s a 15 minute job there and 15 minute drive home, so very short commute. One work from home day.

The issues are that they don’t appreciate the work that I do, and I feel constantly criticized, stressed, and on edge. I’ve been promoted primarily due to people leaving (incredibly high turnover company), and my boss doesn’t have time for me or do anything when people are rude to me. My department is treated like a punching bag. People always want and need things from us, but don’t value what we do and see us as beneath them. It’s a typical weekends off job with good health benefits and most holidays off, but only 2 weeks of vacation until you hit 5 years, and no sick time (so if you get sick it’s unpaid and you have to prove you’re sick to even take unpaid time off by seeing a doctor). It’s a small company.

I just got a job offer for $110,000 plus a potential bonus, and with a management title at a large, incredibly well known company. 16 days of PTO to start, 2 floating holidays, and 5 sick days. I’m not sure if the culture will be better there, but they’ve been around a lot longer and have typical workplace processes in place that my current job doesn’t/struggles with.

1djzvti,Toxic Boss,"Hey everyone,

I broke down at work today and cried my eyes out after my virtual 1:1 with my boss.

We have mid-year check ins coming up and he wanted to make sure I arranged them on his calendar for his team, and included myself.

I told him 'yes, everything is set up and ready to go.' And he told me that he wanted to talk to me about how I am meeting the needs and wants of the 'office.' For context, I work in a small office. There's 7 of us total. And last June, after promising me a promotion (that didn't happen), he ended up pulling what feels like a 'smear campaign' against me.

He scheduled a meeting with my colleagues to meet about ME. Without me. Asking them to send him a list of things they wanted me to do. They complied and I was shocked. Basically, people just want a private secretary to schedule meetings on their calendars, transcribe, etc.

I'm a 4.0 graduate school graduate. I'm not dumb, but I'm not the best when it comes to transcribing, and managing calendars. Nevertheless, I try. It's just not something I have become accustomed to.

Things settled down a bit after my boss collected all of their wants/needs... and even some feedback. He sent the list to me and CC'd the entire office on it (I was embarrassed and felt gaslit).

I am supposed to be managing portfolios and projects. And I did mention this to my boss. He admitted that this position demands admin-like duties and only posted the Program Manager position to attract talent. Clearly, this has caused a lot of confusion and lack of clarity.

Now, a year later, as we approach these mid year evaluations, he is planning to reach back out to my colleagues regarding the original list he compiled from the team.

This is really traumatic to me because it is making me feel like I am doing something wrong. I have really good annual performance reviews. It feels like I was unofficially placed on a PIP.

I have been searching for other jobs casually, and just finished a series of interviews. Unfortunately, ither candidates were selected. But I'm trying to remain optimistic. 

I know I am absolutely confident in my abilities. I trust myself in fulfilling the actual role. I have gone above and beyond it. I just can't figure out why I am the target of such an awful manager. It's eating away at my mind. It's making me feel gaslit and incompetent. And I am afraid my colleagues might say or do something, even unintentionally, that will set him off. I'm afraid of losing my job. Again, even though I have great annual performance reviews.

I am an emotional wreck. I'm trying to be kind to myself but it's really hard to right now.

Hoping for some insights on how to handle this type of situation. Please be kind. I'm at my breaking point.",HumbleBumble77,1,1.0,2,1718847404,2024-06-20 01:36:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1djzvti/toxic_boss/,6,2024

1djzffv,What do I do in this situation?  ,"I've been on the hunt for a new job for the past month. I've made some progress with a couple of jobs, but I have no idea what to do.

Let me preface by saying I do live at home with my mom and I'm in my early 20s. I'm a recent college grad with a science degree. I have a bartending job where it's event based, but I quit my regular job about a month ago.

Now onto what my issue is.

I tested and interviewed for a government position around a week ago. I passed the initial test, then moved on and did an interview. The interviewer, the manager of the team, had seemed extremely confident I would move to the next process and get a job offer. She told me I was looking at a 4-6 week wait period as far as starting goes. This job would make me anywhere from $55K to $64K, depending on their offer, and is by far more professional.

However, I do have a next step process for another job. This job would be an admin assistant position for a local nonprofit making close to minimum wage. I've interviewed over the phone and I have an in person interview next.

This is where my issue is. I want the government job. I've followed up asking when I should hear from HR and the response I got was ""HR will compile a list and reach out for the rest of the process! Hopefully soon!"". I know they have two more dates that they'll be testing people left, so I probably won't hear anything until next week at the absolute earliest.

However, the admin position may give me an offer sooner. How do I approach this situation? My mom tells me I need to accept the admin position and then quit if I get offered the job I actually want, but I feel like a complete jackass doing that to a small nonprofit. I do realize I'm not necessarily guaranteed an offer from the government job, but it seemed promising.

This is stressing me out because the admin position pays a ton less and is double the commute. The government job would be so much better in a million different ways, but my mom just keeps saying I may not even get it. She thinks it's better to be the bad guy to the nonprofit if I have to quit after potentially 2-4 weeks.

I need any input I can get in this situation please! I hope this all makes sense. ",mysteryparrots,3,1.0,6,1718846002,2024-06-20 01:13:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1djzffv/what_do_i_do_in_this_situation/,6,2024
1djz9b7,Reputational Impacts of Running a Sex Toy business on the side,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I will be crossposting this in legal communities as well. 

I am currently in law school, and intend to practice estate planning/administration in the future so in theory plenty of older folxs, financial advisor referral partners, and other attorneys are the primary source of business. 

During law school I also launched an online side business that focuses on LGBTQIA+ sex toys. None of them are particularly crass, and frankly, many of them you wouldn't be able to tell what they are unless you connected the business name with the product.

Notably, the firm I intend to practice at after getting licensed is located in Portland, OR. The city has a strong reputation for sex inclusivity, although this does sometimes seem to depend on the age of the person you are talking to. I might be more understanding if we were talking about somewhere that isn't as sex positive as Portland.

My future boss, and mentor, is very concerned that I posted I was a co-founder of this business on LinkedIn. I should say I have very few connections on LinkedIn, but this could change, and LinkedIn is by it's very nature semi-public. They cited concerns that future referral partners and clients might have negative connotations of the business and that it could impact future profitability. They stated it isn't about the business itself, or even the gay nature of the venture. The concern is reputational impact. There was no such reaction when I announced it on Facebook, or even to the office.

I am trying to get more perspective on the situation. **Is this career suicide to be so open about co-founding a sex toy business?** Is there something particularly important about LinkedIn that means it shouldn't be there? Part of my thought to include it now on my LinkedIn is to sneak this information in while I still have a very low-key profile. I don't intend to ever talk about it with potential or actual clients in the future, unless they bring it up.

I need advice on whether I’ve totally fucked this up and should just wait to be fired or what I should do to prove that I can be better (not bring it up/ wait for next task and do better, ask for advice from supervisor, something else?) 

Full post:
I’m an intern (from this May 2024 until March 2025) at a decent size company and it’s fully remote for me (but the other ~7 interns and all the permanent employees of the tax department are hybrid, so maybe like 1-2 days in office every other day remote.

I am realizing I made a mistake in being remote (but I really didn’t want to move across the country to a middle of nowhere town, not be able to take classes this summer, and also I would’ve had to cancel my surgery that I had in May) but I am definitely feeling the negatives of a remote internship: not feeling connected to the work AT ALL (like it doesn’t seem like it matters or does anything) and the people seem like just NPCs cause I only see them on a video meeting or have a max 20 min video call w them, where we only talk about the project at hand, no getting to know you stuff really.

All this to say, it’s been like 4 weeks and I’m no question the least productive intern there. I know maybe they didn’t hire interns with the goal of a huge surplus of productivity, but I’m literally wasting this opportunity and being so lazy and useless. They don’t really give timelines on tasks they assign, but just judging by either how fast the other interns complete the tasks or how much of it I can get done when I put in 100% effort, I can take 2-3x as long as it should be, like days later.

I know that I should be fired. There was one day last week where I think I didn’t do much work at all, like maybe made a singular pivot table (that didn’t even work and I had to fix today). I’m a serial mouse mover just to appear active in case someone is watching. I can rationalize it in the moment, but then 15 mins later I start feeling guilty about wasting time and then start avoiding the task more because I’m afraid of it being late which makes me more anxious, and the cycle continues. 

The worst part is I know I’m being a lazy fuck who’s wasting away an opportunity to learn about a future career while making the best money I’ve made so far in my life and I’m very aware that I should be fired, but I feel like knowing these things just keeps the anxious-avoid-guilt cycle moving more. I’m super aware of the fact that maybe I could get away with this when I’m 20 years into my career, have expertise, maybe took a chill job and can get all my shit done in little time, but I know that’s not how internships should be, I need to be working most of the time and learning as much as possible. I feel like I’m applying my school study strategy to corporate work (procrastinate until as late as possible, then do a shit load of work in as short of a time frame as possible) but I am fully aware that isn’t how it works and it should be consistent, regular productivity. 

It’s gotten to a point where I know I fucked up and I feel so guilty and I’m worried I can’t stop. I know it’s only a matter of days or weeks until they find out how little I’m doing even though I clock in from the start time to the end time every day (so I’m getting paid no matter how productive I am that hour). 

I think they’re going to find out soon. There was a training last Thursday for all the interns, we had done this basic report for every entity (each of us did a few (I did the least)), and now he was teaching us a more complicated report he needed for each entity. After the training, I put it on my To-Do list, but I had 3 things to do beforehand (although looking back I should’ve done this group project). One I finished in a few hours, one I’m still not done with because I’m getting taught how to do it step by step, so every time I finish a step, I have to set up another call with this busy guy so he can show me the next part. And the third was just something the guy who’s overseeing us just assigned to me. It had a list of steps to complete and when I’m focused, I can get a lot done, but I’ll slack off most of the time so it’s going slow, I’m guessing lowkey waaay too slow, I mean my supervisor hasn’t said anything but judging by how fast I can do it when I’m focused, if I was working hard the whole time it would be done in a day or two.

Regardless, since last Thursday, I’ve been lollygagging on those two tasks, and each day I write a to-do list to finish them (or at least get to a spot where I have to schedule a call for help) so I can do the task he showed us how to do Thursday. Well I’ve been so damn slow that today I went into the group excel sheet for the task, and every column had initials by it, which means they either finished it or started each part. So they’re basically or fully done with it and I didn’t help out at all. (That’s what I feel most guilty about, that I increased their workload).

I know this is cringe and probably wasn’t the right thing to do, but I sent the intern groupchat a short message apologizing/ saying I got caught up with the other task/ I’ll be more involved in the future/ if there’s any last minute part they need help with. I was going to try and sweep it under the rug and not mention it at all, but I’m not sure that was the better option, maybe I at least am admitting to my faults? I didn’t say anything to the associate that trained us on that task though, I don’t know that he cares plus I don’t want to draw more attention.

We have update meetings with the tax team of about ~20 plus the ~7 interns every Monday and Thursday. They don’t pay much attention/ ask follow up questions to each intern’s update really, but if they decided to, they would see how much of a lazy unproductive intern I am. Because tomorrow, my update will be pretty much the same as Mondays “finishing up abc task and working through xyz task with x associate.” Eventually at one of these update meetings (or the one on ones I have w a supervisor every Tuesday), they’re going to realize how much time I’m wasting. 

I know how much of a fuck up I’m being and how I’m wasting an opportunity and how bad it’d be if I got fired and had nothing on my resume before I graduate college. I’m perfectly aware. I’m just not sure if it’s too late and I’ve fucked this internship up, and should just basically wait for the hammer to fall. Or if it’s salvageable, what should I do? Quietly get though these next few days while these tasks finish themselves, bring it up with a full-time employee, ask for advice from supervisor?

1djypf5,WFH Blues,"Hi! 

This is my first time posting here. I would like to know your thoughts on a problem I’m currently facing. I’ve always loved working from home. Ever since the pandemic started, and we were forced to work from home, I knew I wouldn’t want to go back to the office. I was always a performer at work. I’d go above and beyond with my tasks, but now I noticed I wasn’t performing as I used to. I’d always get distracted with everything at home. I’d rather do laundry, or other chores than to work. Leaving me with little to no time in doing my tasks and I end up procrastinating. We are currently in a full WFH setup and our office is an hour away from where I live. When I computed my expenses if I’d go back to our office to work there, I have to spend $22 a day just for transportation alone and my salary is just enough for me to get by every month. 

I don’t know, I feel like I’m a failure. I’m all over the place, I don’t know how to prioritize things. I’d have a system, but life happens and then I’d lose track of my system, then I’d get bummed because nothing is going my way, and then I don’t know how I’ll prioritize things again. 

Do you have any advice? Or did anyone went through the same thing as I do? What did you do to overcome it? What are your systems and how do you keep being on track?",One-Comment-1313,1,1.0,1,1718843745,2024-06-20 00:35:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1djypf5/wfh_blues/,6,2024

1djy8e2,Should I leave my Job in Politics,"Hi folks,

I am 1.3 years into working in politics full-time. 

I am a newly  recovering addict and I have faced a lot of professional setbacks because of my addiction.

On paper, I have a lot of good experience. But, I struggle to think of a single job that I can reach out to for a positive reference because i was such a fuck-up until recently.

 I’m a highly educated, experienced  fuck-up, but a fuck-up all the same. I was even fired from the dining hall in college because of problems I stemming from my my addiction. I have been failing  up for my entire career.

I work for a progressive elected official. A high ranking member of our staff has a social work background. They have been extremely graceful toward me. I think if it weren’t for their social work background, I would have been fired a long time ago.

They are moving on from our office soon.

I was placed on a PIP in March, which I beat. Im still in the same office— there’s limited room for growth. I can’t go into a lot of detail without giving out info that would ID me.

I suspect that this person has been my main advocate in the office. Other leaders in our office have assigned me less responsibility, and have generally been colder toward me in past weeks.

How do I move forward here? I am not sure that I can get another job in politics. Should I start applying to jobs in the private sector should How do I move forward here? I am not sure that I can get another job in politics. Should I start applying to jobs in the private sector? Should I develop an exit plan?

1djy84o,Really struggling at my first job,"I’ve been really depressed for a while (personal and work related reasons) and I’m really struggling at my first full-time job because of this, and the workplace environment makes it worse. 

It’s really hard for me to have a good work ethic and stay motivated during work to actually get work done. I can’t stick to a 9-5 schedule and ai barely do stuff watch day which isn’t something I want.

I work at a small startup and the environment is very much so of a startup. Work is very ambiguous and vague, my work isn’t well-defined and there are no proper tasks for me. I’ve brought it up to my manager but It feels like my manager has no time for me to give me a proper project with some requirements. Most of the task that has been given to me are very short and one offs, and honestly seem like it’s just given to keep me occupied. Most of the times,I have to find myself tasks to do and I feel very very very useless at this company.

Essentially the startup doesn’t have the proper support or resources for new grads, which is expected I guess. This work has also killed any desire I had for a new field that I wanted to break into. Also I don’t have any will to go job hunting for another job and the market is shit right now. There are many other details but I won’t get into them to keep this post short

Please help!

TLDR My depression and being a new grad affects my work ethic. I need my work to be defined to keep me on track but this isn’t the case so I do fuck all

1djxpny,Almost 40 and feeling inadequate.,"I'm almost 40. I'm married, have a nice apartment (renting, because I'm a millennial), have good friends, and have had the same job for 7 years.

I'm not interested in pushing forward with my job. I don't want more responsibility. I don't want to manage people. I want to do what I do (half desk work, half operations) and get paid the average amount it's worth.

I want more money, but I know that comes with more effort, and I'm not willing to do that, so I've settled.

However there's been a recent shift in my job that's made me feel inadequate, stangnent, and resentful of someone else being possibly promoted above me.

Do they deserve it? They lack some skills but they try, so they are more worthy than me. However I can't feel happy for them.

Them being promoted doesn't mean my job is less than before, but I feel left out. And it's my own doing.

I hate it. I make small mistakes at work but nothing earth shattering. I have skills that are useful that no one else has, so I'm not being pushed out. 

How do I feel happy for someone else, without feeling like I have failed? Why am I lacking the motivation to try harder?

1djxmxc,Trust your gut?,"I was just extended an offer for an opportunity that most people would probably jump at. It involves hard work, but tons of learning and growth potential with tremendous upside financially. A path to riches, no doubt. This is a call I would dream about getting. However, having met with the partners/team that make up this small company twice now, I feel a bit like a wild card. I’m more of a bullshitter and extrovert, whereas they are not. Something in my gut is making me indecisive. My current job is great, but it’s not nearly as lucrative over the long term. If it was an average gig, I’d jump ship anyway. However, there is some risk to moving and losing what I’ve got. I’m not certain if I would be able to be myself around this crew, though I’d have to dive in and see for sure if that’s true. Maybe I’m wrong. Again, there’s risk to moving given my current sweet gig and this gut feeling that I can’t place. Have you all ever went against your gut and had things play out for the better anyway? Or is the consensus to trust the gut?

1djx7gn,Is it time to quit? Am I being gaslighted by my managers? Rational advice welcomed and appreciated ,"So for some context, I work in the food service industry, both as a server and in the kitchen. I’ve had this job for over a year now, and it’s been fun earning some money, but I’m over it and don’t necessarily  need to work at the moment. I don’t have bills to pay as I’m still a student living at home, and I’m not struggling financially. 

I was asked a few months ago by my managers if I would be willing to learn how to make product in the kitchen, which is somewhat of an honor for this job (ik it’s weird, but it’s a local small business and only two other employees are trusted to work in the kitchen.) So I said sure why not, not actually thinking they would follow through with training me because my managers are hardly ever true to their word. 

So like four months after they asked me if I was interested, they put me on the schedule as a kitchen trainee, and I had three training shifts with the manager. It was sort of interesting to see that side of the job in making the products we sell, but it’s not something I’m interested in doing for so little pay, especially since I don’t need a job and I’m trying to focus more time on my studies. 

It’s not only the measly paycheck that is making me turn away, it’s the environment. My manager is a cold hearted, hypocritical person who sucks the life of the room everyday. Working in the kitchen for hours next to them was when I asked myself… why am I working for this person I don’t like and supporting their small family business? My manager complains about my fellow coworkers right in front of me, and makes petty comments about people that I don’t agree with. It always makes me self conscious and wonder… what does she say about me when I’m not there? 

I’ve been working a lot of hours and losing sleep and skipping meals because of long shifts, so I decided last night that I desperately need at least a break for my mental and physical wellbeing. I have never once asked for a long period of time off since working there, and figured my manager would be understanding of my situation. 

So today, I messaged my manager and asked for some time off at the end of the summer to transition into my school semester for university, and they said no! I also expressed that I cannot be working as much during the school year since the work load for my career path is INTENSE, and school is my #1 priority, not my silly little job. 


This was the response I got, via text message… 


“Hey! I didn’t realize you weren’t working during the school year. We were training you (in the kitchen) because I thought you would be working all year long.” 

I never once said I was planning to work all year long, they just assumed I would because that’s what I did last year.

Then, I further explained myself, I was very polite and explained my situation with my full load of courses/honors program activities to balance. Then I got this response…

“I understand. Let me talk to (other manager) about everything. I know for sure if you want to continue working in any capacity we will need you to work until school starts back up. Being done mid summer isn’t working a full summer.” 

I also never once said I was planning to work a “full summer.” Them training me in the kitchen is starting to feel like they trapped me into working for them for longer. I’m angry and frustrated, because I know my priority right now is my well being and education. Maybe I don’t want to continue working for them “in any capacity.” 

That’s all I have from them for now. I have my two week’s notice draft simmering in my notes app just in case. I’m working in the kitchen tomorrow, so we will be talking in person for sure. I hope I can keep it together and advocate for myself, because I’m pretty bent out of shape about it. 

Anyways, what do you think? When is the appropriate time to send my two week’s in? ASAP, or wait a bit? I don’t want to leave on bad terms, but I need to get out as soon as I can for my health.

1djuy9z,"I'm about to hit 5 years of experience in IT soon, I have a decently cushy job. Do I really need a degree at this point or have I worked enough to just let my experience carry me?","Hey all,

I've been working in IT since before I dropped out of college 4 years or so ago. I have been moving up a decent bit and just landed a cushy job. I'm not entry level anymore, but certainly not at a engineer/senior/manager level. My intention is to stay in my current role for atleast 2 more years before finding a new role. At that point I'd have \~7 or so years of experience to use towards an advanced role and I'm wondering if at that point a degree would even benefit me at all.

1djusnd,How do I approach this situation between two jobs?,"I've been on the hunt for a new job for the past month. I've made some progress with a couple of jobs, but I have no idea what to do.

Let me preface by saying I do live at home with my mom and I'm in my early 20s. I'm a recent college grad with a science degree. I have a bartending job where it's event based, but I quit my regular job about a month ago.

Now onto what my issue is.

I tested and interviewed for a government position around a week ago. I passed the initial test, then moved on and did an interview. The interviewer, the manager of the team, had seemed extremely confident I would move to the next process and get a job offer. She told me I was looking at a 4-6 week wait period as far as starting goes. This job would make me anywhere from $55K to $64K, depending on their offer, and is by far more professional.

However, I do have a next step process for another job. This job would be an admin assistant position for a local nonprofit making close to minimum wage. I've interviewed over the phone and I have an in person interview next.

This is where my issue is. I want the government job. I've followed up asking when I should hear from HR and the response I got was ""HR will compile a list and reach out for the rest of the process! Hopefully soon!"". I know they have two more dates that they'll be testing people left, so I probably won't hear anything until next week at the absolute earliest.

However, the admin position may give me an offer sooner. How do I approach this situation? My mom tells me I need to accept the admin position and then quit if I get offered the job I actually want, but I feel like a complete jackass doing that to a small nonprofit. I do realize I'm not necessarily guaranteed an offer from the government job, but it seemed promising.

This is stressing me out because the admin position pays a ton less and is double the commute. The government job would be so much better in a million different ways, but my mom just keeps saying I may not even get it. She thinks it's better to be the bad guy to the nonprofit if I have to quit after potentially 2-4 weeks.

I need any input I can get in this situation please! I hope this all makes sense. ",mysteryparrots,1,1.0,2,1718833028,2024-06-19 21:37:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1djusnd/how_do_i_approach_this_situation_between_two_jobs/,6,2024

1dju4h1,Boss publicly reprimanded me in front of my coworkers  - should I complain to hr?,"I was let go from my current company, and rehired as a freelancer temporarily.  
It hasn't been a great experience.

  
I was put on a moderately challenging set of tasks I was taking over for a team lead who had to move on to other tasks.

It was difficult getting up to speed in 1 week - others have been on the project for months.

I basically delivered everything on time, but struggled with 1 task in particular.  I tried my best to finish it on my own and not burden my team lead with it - I guess that backfired to some extent.

The task was handed off in a very messy state frankly, and I didn't ask enough questions.

My team lead had not 1, but 3 follow up calls with me basically to reprimand me.  He also took the task back partially - I still ended up finishing it.  I was pretty caught off guard by this - things seemed to be going ok despite the issues. I solved several key problems myself, so I don't think it's fair to say I slacked.

Being let go and hired back for only 2 months as a last resort option is insulting enough, but I felt his response was over the top.

He took things a step further by giving a presentation on the task in our department meeting, citing it as an example of bad practices.

I privately expressed to my supervisor that this was very embarassing for me, and even cruel, and bad for my reputation.

Maybe I'm being too sensitive? My concern is this reflects very very badly on me and my reputation.  I guess they expected me to formally apologize - but we still delivered the task on time.  And even if we were further delayed, the task was dependent on delivery for another department.  So from my perspective, things didn't go that badly.  I guess I'm oblivious.  I felt their response was humiliating and unprofessional.

1dju2v6,How Should I Quit my Contract Job?,"Hi all,

As the title suggests, I am looking to quit my job. Currently, I am working as an AML Analyst at a large bank, and I am unhappy with my position. I have been in this role since April and find no satisfaction in it. I am required to be in the office five days a week, get paid hourly with no benefits, packed into an office with 40 other analysts, managers are the worst i’ve ever had, and they have made it clear that there is no room for growth and we can be replaced anytime. 

Although I officially graduated last week, I completed my studies in December. My goal is to transition into FP&A, as I previously did a position within FP&A at a large insurance company and enjoyed it. I only accepted this AML Analyst position out of desperation and the fear of unemployment with the current job market.

My contract is set to end in November, but they have indicated it will definitely be extended. I am now considering ending the contract four months early, but I want to do so in a way that still allows me to secure a reference. I have consistently produced high-quality work and have been recognized for my output. However, I am concerned that leaving early might result in a negative reference or refusal to provide one. I am unable to stay at this job while I work since it is fully in person and there is no space to do the interviews in the office.

Should I make a fake reason for leaving, or be honest and state that I am seeking a role more aligned with finance?


TLDR; I want to quit my job but still want to keep them for a reference. Do I make up a reason or tell the truth?

Thanks for your advice!",HiddenGem131,1,1.0,3,1718831219,2024-06-19 21:06:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dju2v6/how_should_i_quit_my_contract_job/,6,2024
1djsqhk,"Great pay/benefits/work life balance, but work is slowing down with no clear future. What to do?","I’m 40M married no kids. I have a higher level engineering job (like engineering project management) for a big company. Been there 15 years. Pay is very good, I work from home, hours are flexible, 4/10 schedule, awesome benefits. It’s like a dream come true.
Unfortunately, I’ve been extremely stressful lately because work has been kind of slowing down with no new projects coming up. Every time I work on something I get questioned about why I’m doing the work, is that work in the budget, etc. There have also been layoffs over the last year. There doesn’t seem to be many more opportunities for current job. I’ve been pretty depressed about my future outlook at this company’s location, even thinking of leaving the company altogether, but the pay, work life balance, benefits are just so good, and from my searching there aren’t many jobs like mine where I live with this pay/benefit, so I’d probably have to move if I want to stay with this company because none of the open roles at other locations can be remote.
I’m not sure if I should just ride this out until I inevitably (assuming) get tagged for a layoff and get forced to move, or get ahead of it and look to relocate now. I would prefer staying where I am now because of family and friends. But I’m open to living somewhere else as I’ve lived in my current area my whole life and maybe it’d be a nice change living somewhere else.

1djspqg,My manager is never consistent in what he says and I’m losing my mind,"I’ve been at this job almost 2 years. My managers a nice guy, but it’s almost like he’s bipolar and it seems to be getting more consistent. I don’t know if he’s overwhelmed, doesn’t know or want to stand up for his reports, or he just wants to get rid of me.

It started with him asking other people for work for his reports, but wouldnt tell his reports about the work. When they asked about it, because he didn’t tell them and they were in the middle of other work, he would lie and say “I didn’t know about these blah blah blah but it’s urgent and needs to be done today”. Then speaking with the other manager they say they don’t care about the data, and didn’t even ask for it.

One day he’ll be super nice to me, and just be laid back. When we talk about work, most of it is “it’s not super urgent so don’t worry about it today” “when you have the time next week do this”. 

So I’ll plan it out around my other work, and the next day or two he’ll start saying with a passive aggressive attitude like “why isn’t this done, this needed to be done two days ago. You could have started it at 4;30 yesterday, this is really urgent and keeps getting asked about.” When he knows I’m busting ass with other work.

I’ll bust ass and get the shit done, he won’t acknowledge the work in anyway, then will never bring up, almost like it was never needed.

A lot of it is stupid stuff, like train a co-worker on a protocol we don’t use and will never use, oh and it’s 4:30 on a Friday, everyone left at 12 but this has to be done today.

I’ve thought about it a lot the last couple months, and I feel like I need to quit. Although I’m not sure what’s more stressful.

I have a new manager and he is very hard to please, is nitpicky, which makes me feel demoralized and stressed further contributing to burn out. 

On top of that, my husband and I are trying for a baby without luck so far. We’re in the middle of some fertility treatments so it could happen (or not happen) at anytime… just up in the air as to when. I don’t feel comfortable taking on a new full time gig because as soon as I get pregnant, the plan is for me to stay home anyway.

My husband and I are in the situation to where we could live on just his income. Ideally I’d take up something part time with more flexibility at least until I get pregnant, but I haven’t found anything so far. 

I’m just at the point now where I really want to quit for the sake of my mental health. I dread going into work everyday and am miserable in general. 

I just know that when I submit my 2 weeks notice, that my manager will ask why and I don’t really know what to say. I understand that I don’t have to say why in my 2 weeks notice, but I don’t know what to say verbally that is vague and still acceptable.  Is there a generic response I could use and state in my letter? I would like to stay in good grace with the company if I ever did decide to come back.

","Hello everyone,

I hope you're well.

To cut a long story short, programming has been a hobby of mine for years. I began learning web development a while back but had to pause when I started working in the oil and gas industry four years ago.

Despite the good pay, I've come to dislike my current job. Therefore, I'm seriously considering returning to web development. I already have a grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics and now want to delve into React, backend development, as well as data structures and algorithms.

My aim is to secure an online, remote job that offers flexibility in terms of location and pays upwards of $50,000 USD annually. This move is also about safeguarding my career against potential layoffs, given my location outside of the US and EU.

I have set myself a one-year timeframe to acquire the necessary skills, committing eight hours daily after my regular 9-5 job.

So I’m a tattoo artist, relatively successful for the area, staying afloat.
I spend my off time training, I take lessons, I read, practice, etc. 
For a variety of reasons I don’t need to get into I’m falling out of love with this trade. 
I have a partial film degree and some experience directing. I’m also a musician (play a few instruments) and I like to write and I’m into photography.

I’ve always liked storyboard art/ character design / concept art, but I know these fields are saturated, and I hear sooo many bad things about the game industry. Layoffs, ai, and so on. 

I’ve been thinking about getting a portfolio together and trying to break into storyboarding because I think my skills are suited for it. 

I was wondering if anyone here had experience working in an art/media field or if I should really just try to find a day job and make what I want to make outside of it.  I’m not really sure if these other career paths would really be better than tattooing, but I’d like to get some opinions. 
If you’re working in it, did it kill the passion for you?

It probably sounds like I have trouble making a decision and it’s because I do, I could never pick what creative path to do so I just do it all and spend all my time doing it lol.

1djphrk,Career/Country Change - thoughts on UK MBA,"Hi everyone :) I'm having a bit of an early mid life crisis and wanted to vent/get some thoughts here.

I'm an American but studied in the UK in fashion design and went on to work in Sydney and New York which was a great experience. I'm now 28 and having been working in NYC for the past 5 years in fashion design/merchandising. I'm ready to get out of New York and have been applying for positions in fashion in London and California for the past year or so with not much to show for it. I also have a small vintage reselling business which I really enjoy doing but hasn't brought a huge amount of financials (yet!! :) )

I'm now leaning towards going a different route and getting an MBA in London so I can   
a) look into a career in project management in tech since I've always been a pretty quick learner when it comes to technology. I have implemented a similar skill set in my current role (won't post the boring details here) but think diversifying my education would help a bit. Would love to get a more remote job with a larger salary that would allow me some lifestyle flexibility.  
b) learn more about the business side of things to continue growing my small business in the meantime. i've had a few side hustle projects but would love to learn how to take these larger scale  
c) have a visa in the UK for a year to travel a bit while I'm single/no kids. also like that the UK MBA programs are 1 year and a bit less expensive than in the US.

So overall am just curious to get feedback from anyone who's either transitioned from fashion to tech, done an international MBA or relates to this post any way. I've been working from 14 until now (like most people) but feels like it's time to jump in and take a risk even if that means taking on a future loan and having a bit of a gap in my resume.

I joined 4-5 months after he got promoted to manager to fill the analyst role. When he was just a manager, I was being mentored by him but I was not reporting in him, but i guess my day to day was being managed by him. We talked about career growth and that the company has a general rule of being in a role for a certain period of time before being promoted, but he does care for them and you can move up a lot quicker if you prove yourself and suggested I should ask for a promotion after a year. Which I took as him being on my side. But fast forward to now he got promoted to senior manager and now I report into him officially and I asked if i should consider the now open manager position (his back fill) and he said no since he's looking for someone more senior (closer to senior manager) to fill his role and basically when his eventual backfill gets promoted to senior manager that's when i can be promoted to manager. I feel blind sided and hurt. I thought he would be encouraging about me being promoted, but it seems like he's looking out for himself, which is understandable (but I don't like I was led to believe otherwise).

Job #1- I was a manager at the snowboard shop worked there from age 16-21. I enjoyed my time there but had to leave due to the pay not being good enough for my liking. Last from 2016-2021

Job #2- my current job I am working at is a plumbing supply warehouse where my job is coordinating and procurement. My issue here is the lack of work sometimes and being constantly bored. I feel like I’m losing my mind when I don’t have any work to do along with the pay just not being there and false hope from management

So pretty much what I am asking what are some fields of work some of you are in, that didn’t attend college and are enjoying your day to day job. I’m stuck because I want my next job to be one that keeps me happy and hands on. I have times where I feel like I wouldn’t be good enough for a certain job but I need to get out of my current one, sitting at a desk all day isn’t doing it like I always thought it would.

I was and still am the Assistant Manager for the area but am now without a Manager and am trying to run and manage a team of about 14 staff in four different places around the county. 
My contracted hours haven’t gone up, neither has my pay. 
Higher management recently interviewed for the manager post which I applied for and didn’t get, but still have to perform the duties and responsibilities for. The interview was over a month ago and they still haven’t recruited anyone.

1djm5ym,Better opportunity after recently starting new job,"Looking for advice on an opportunity that has recently presented itself to me.

I started a new job 2.5 months ago and I am really enjoying it so far.  It is an individual contributor consulting-style role at a large financial services company.  My boss and the team I work with are great.  The company has a healthy culture where everyone genuinely likes to work together and seems to promote a strong work/life balance.  There is long tenure on the team.  I am hybrid (3 days per week in office) with travel required for approximately 1 week every 2 months.  The pay is solid ($120K base + some small bonus potential).  The business is very stable and I think there is potential that I could be promoted into a larger leadership role within the next few years based on my professional experience & expectations set when I accepted the position.  

A former boss and mentor reached out to gauge my interest in a new position that has been posted at a large company he started working at ~2 years ago.  It is a Senior Director level role, so it would be a promotion both in title and compensation.  It is likely the “next level” role for me based on my experience.  The base salary is significantly higher than I am earning now ($175K - $195K base + likely higher bonus potential).  The role is 100% remote, though I assume there will likely be occasional travel requirements.  The position would lead a team of 8-10 direct reports and aligns well with my prior professional experience, as I have led teams and similar work functions in the past at a Director level.  

I applied for the role to at least begin the process of determining if it’ll be a good fit.  I have an initial interview scheduled for later this week.    

I know the decision ultimately doesn’t matter until I have an offer in-hand, but am having a lot of conflicting thoughts about the best approach to take.

The higher salary, title, and remote setup seem like a no brainer, but I’m really enjoying my current role and a bit nervous I could end up walking into a worse overall work environment (e.g. worse work/life balance, poor culture, bad boss, higher risk of layoffs in retail industry, etc.) compared to what I have today.  I’d also feel bad leaving my current role, knowing how well I’ve been getting along with my new boss and the level of resources the team has put into onboarding me over the past 2.5 months.  

Has anyone gone through a similar experience?  

How did you approach the decision making process?

Do you have any recommendations on questions to ask during interviews to try to identify aspects of the role that may make it less appealing than my current position? 

Are there any other considerations I should be thinking about?",stadamj,1,1.0,1,1718811397,2024-06-19 15:36:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1djm5ym/better_opportunity_after_recently_starting_new_job/,6,2024
1djlxq2,Two job offers: risk or comfort? ,"Hi all. I have 2 job offers and I'm over here crying trying to choose. Preface, I am a biologist and work for the government as a technical specialist in human health risk assessment of chemical products. Currently I work remote away from headquarters. I went back to graduate school for environmental engineering to pivot to water resource management/climate change research stuff. I got a masters cuz I was just on a 2 yr (unpaid) sabbatical and couldn't get more time off. 

Job 1: In the city I grew up in, which I'm not a fan of because people there are a bit elitist. It's to be the sole hydrologist for the area in groundwater and other drinking water sites. So long as I do my core work, I can expand to research projects and other side projects freely. I'd be the regional rep at the national level for this area of expertise. It sounds really great except I'd have no one to train me (no one else does this job) and I'd take a step down (13 to 12). 

Job 2: Located in headquarters but I can request remote work after 3 months going in 1 day a week. This seems to be typical for this office. It's on human risk assessment but specifically water pollutants so slightly different than what I do now. I'd initially take a step down (12) but then can be promoted back into my current level (13). The downside is I don't really like risk assessment work and I don't know if I would like this more because it's a little different or if I'd still hate it. 

Long story short, was super ready to accept job 1, take the pay cut, move, take a risk, and use my new degree. But now that job 2 is a total wild card (last minute interview last week, etc) and wants me, I'm struggling because I don't have to take a pay cut or move permanently. I know I can make anything and anywhere work, but it would be ideal to be happier than I am at my current job. I didn't like living in headquarters area mostly cuz I didn't like my job and didn't like people in that city (elitist). I moved to the Midwest and like it here a lot because I'm more than just my credentials. But it would also maybe be good to be near my close friends and aging family. I'm so stumped.

So, I was fired from my former job a couple of months ago. I was placed on a bogus PIP or Performance Improvement Plan and let go after 90 days. I'm currently looking for a new job. I recently just checked my former company's website to see if my old job was reposted, and it kind of was and wasn't. The new job that was posted was completely revamped with new skill requirements, experience requirements, and a completely different title and set of responsibilities. It seems like they eliminated my position entirely.



So my question is, when I'm asked in a future interview why I left my old job, would it be appropriate to say I was laid off, or should I say I was fired?

1djk4k2,Remorse: I regret leaving my previous job,"I'm a bum. Such a loser.

I left a job I tolerated because of peer pressure. It's so lame.

Backstory: a person who was unhappy at work thought I was unhappy too and so offered to reach out to someone they knew who needed someone with my skills.

The ball got rolling and I was asked to submit my resume. I wasn't sure really but just sent it through thinking I would just see where it goes.

After the interview, I was sure it went badly but didn't care for it anyway so I put it out of my mind.

To my surprise, things escalated through to an assessment (I submitted 2 minutes after the deadline because I hadn't started it), to a second interview and then an offer.

For some reason, I felt obligated to resign now that the offer had arrived. I was still unsure and probably had the most miserable notice period of my career. I was depressed on my last day.

So now I'm in my new job, 4 months in and it's terrible.

My old job had said they would have me back before I left but I'm not sure if they were just saying that to be nice but I'm thinking of going back.

Do you think that would also be a bad move? It's probably worse than taking a counter. A former colleague had pulled the same move after leaving as well and they welcomed him back warmly.

1djk3g0,Job Opportunity Crossroads,"I was recently offered a pretty great job opportunity out of the blue that I wasn’t looking for. The pay and growth over the long term is exponential. However, I do love my current job, which pays well and has ultimate flexibility along with the challenges and responsibilities that I need to be content. Timing is never right, as I wish this opportunity would have popped up either 3yrs ago or 2yrs from now. There are several reasons for this, including tuition reimbursement that I know won’t be covered by this new company (different field), and loss of ESOP (not fully vested). However, the biggest reason I’m struggling with this decision is that I haven’t yet fulfilled my commitments to the company. I was sent to a new city to develop a market for my company a few years ago. We’ve made great progress but it takes time. There are a couple of specific parameters that I want to meet, at the very least, before feeling content on leaving. Otherwise, I know I’ll likely look back and wish I had left the situation better off - something to show for it. My current company has been great to me, almost like family, so there’s that too. I like to accomplish my goals but if I leave now, that won’t be the case. This new career opportunity is fantastic for learning, growth, pay, etc. other than work life balance.

1djjnl5,Career Change With NO College Degree? Asking For Friend,"Hello all,

I'm trying to help a friend gather some ideas for a career change. Money is not a motivator here. Of course, making above poverty wages would be nice, but if a job pays around $15-17 that wouldn't be a big problem.

So, this person does NOT have a college degree, but they are a licensed hairdresser / beautician (tbh, I'm not fully sure what the qualification is) with 10 years of experience working in hair and makeup as an educator. They have worked for a few schools throughout their career, and taken some time here and there away from the school to work in a salon short-term over the years, but the overwhelming majority of experience in the last decade is in education and beauty industry.

My friend really, really wants to do something they find more fulfilling. They have a big heart for people, especially youth, and want to find something that helps people. Last night, we talked a bit about crisis prevention hotlines when they were inspired by a TV show. Something along these lines I think would be perfect for them. After looking online, it looked like most posts on Indeed and Zip Recruiter asked for a degree, so I'm not sure this exact job title is a good fit.

Does anyone work in crisis prevention at a hotline chat / phone that could answer questions about the process of getting a job and the general educational or licensing requirements?

We've also discussed ""youth services"", but I'm not sure what they mean or what that could entail. Although money isn't an issue like I said, I don't think they could just not work and only do volunteer stuff. Any thoughts on this one?

As a final thought: my friend is not interested in any geriatric work or working with any disabled or mentally challenged people. They have a family member they help take care of and I think that they would be overburdened if they took on more work like this (not that their heart isn't there). They DO have a big heart for helping people. Especially the youth. They could work with those experiencing addiction or housing crisis, etc. Personally, one idea I had was to try and take the skills they have and pass them onto high school kids in disenfranchised communities. Any ideas about that? Any thoughts on getting a hair and makeup program into a high school or something like that?

Thank you very much for reading this far. I'm sorry if this doesn't seem like much to go off of. Any advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks!!!!

1djimrq,Can employer terminate me early if I give two week notice ? WWYD,"Hi all,

Im changing jobs and in my current contract it says I have a guaranteed salary of 70 000 $CAD after the first year of service which falls on the 1st of August (thursday / payday). The problem is that I really dont like the job anymore and the pay is not what I was expecting it to be (low paying job but travel expenses paid and random bonuses).

By next August I will not be able to pay my rent as I have not done any traveling for work in the past 3 months (where I do most overtime and have my food and gas paid for the week) and haven’t recieved a bonus in 6 months, The bills have slowly been draining my account and credit card and I wasn’t careful with my spending (which I shouldn’t have to with my experience and profession).

With what I estimated I should get 8000 to 10000 back if it continues this way for the total of 70 000.

In the meantime I found a new job I am sure I will like and pays 13$ more an hour with overtime available. I asked if I can start the second week of august where they weren’t sure, seemed limit, but accepted. (I dont think I could have asked for a further date but they are aware of the situation and as to why)

I want to play my cards right so I dont get screwed but also want to give a minimum 2 week notice.

If I give a two week notice can they terminate me immediately? Thus forfeiting my guaranteed salary.

Have you ever NOT given a two week notice ? I would feel uber cheap to do so but I really need that money and want the new job. I am thinking I should tell them how it is but I know them and they will take it very badly.

My best case scenario is I get the « random » bonus with my next pay on the 4th and tell them that Im starting the new job and let them decide. If they terminate me earlier I get early and longer vacay which I dont mind.

  
TLDR; Should I not give two weeks notice and get 10 000$ from employer or give two weeks notice and risk getting terminated early forfeiting 10 000$

1djgxme,Should I negotiate salary with no other options?,"Hi everyone!

I recently was offered a full-time position at a company that I have been freelancing for on and off for the past year or so. I'm very excited as I really enjoy working with this particular company.

While the official offer hasn't been sent to me, they told me the salary on the phone. It is pretty decent and I would happily accept it, but I was thinking about asking for 6% more for the position. My main reasoning being that I'm already implemented into their company and I won't require much training to get up to speed. I also am being paid by them about 25% more for my freelance work. But that pay doesn't have any other benefits (like health) and it isn't all the time. I know the position im filling was paid higher, but that person was far more experienced than I am. Apart from the year I worked for then freelance, I am pretty inexperienced. I believe I am getting a slightly different title as well. 

I'm a little weary of trying to negotiate, however, because full time positions are very rare and hard to come by in my field (most people are freelance). Truthfully, since I've graduated 3 years ago this is the first one I've been offered that has decent pay. I also know the team well, and I dont want them to think I'm greedy or something like that. I didn't even interview or anything for this job. They called me directly as soon as the position opened up because they knew I was interested in leaving the freelance world. 

I'm pretty much going to take this job regardless, but I don't want to kick myself down the road for not maximizing my potential salary. 

I would love your advice and opinions!

Thank you!",air-enthusiast,2,1.0,2,1718796838,2024-06-19 11:33:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1djgxme/should_i_negotiate_salary_with_no_other_options/,6,2024

I graduated Dec of last year with a degree in micro, had a series of internships through college, so I have a decent amount of experience.

That being said, I'm through my probationary period, and I've done essentially zero micro work or training for the role I applied for and was hired to do. I've only been training on the bottling lines, and I've found being the low one on the totem pole I can get forced in to work a bottle line anytime a shift isn't picked up by a senior employee. The job description said nothing about being a line technician, it was exclusively about being the microbiology tech. I've only had a few days RECENTLY in the micro lab, and getting pulled for a bottle line takes priority over the micro training.

1dje601,Company doesn't have a plan for my role,"I started at my company 2.5 years ago as part of a big project with its own office. To be honest, my role is pretty niche and I was the first person they'd ever hired for it. 

I only finished my degree 5 years ago and the pandemic happened straight after, so it took a while for me to get any corporate experience. I don't think I was fully qualified for my current role, but I nailed the interview and here we are. 

I was almost made redundant last year when the project had to make cuts across every team. Instead, the company moved me to the head office where I didn't know anyone and some managers were kind enough to find tasks for me. 

It took 6 months - plus me emailing HR with details of how I'd been asking for certainty and the stress and anxiety it caused - for me to officially be transferred into a team here. However, all the other people in my team do a different role and my work is often with other parts of the company simply because that was what I could find when I moved across.

The head office just announced its own round of redundancies and I'm struggling to find enough tasks for my full workweek. My manager was brutally honest with me the other day and said, ""No one really knows what to do with your role. But you should be safe since you've made it this far."" God knows how I survived this time. Maybe the company just hit the amount of savings it wanted and thought it would be best not to cut people where it wasn't absolutely needed. 

It's hard to tell with my lack of experience, but I think I'm actually overpaid for my role and at my age. Couple that with feeling like I haven't achieved very much due to all the uncertainty, and I'm really worried about how a job search will go. 

I think a good option could be for me to find a career path with a clearer place within the company (e.g., what the rest of my team does) and see if I can upskill, but the thought of that is a bit overwhelming. 

Does anyone have any advice? ",Fragrant_Lie_1428,1,1.0,0,1718785839,2024-06-19 08:30:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dje601/company_doesnt_have_a_plan_for_my_role/,6,2024
1djdo4n,Are you looking for an ongoing help in programming to boost up (or start from scratch) your tech/coding skills or get a job in software engineering?,"Hey there - I've been working in tech for over 10 years and last year have coached my cousin, for a year, and he went from being a delivery guy to now working as a software engineer.  
At the same time, I was contracting at Capgemini and coached 5 junior developers, and I liked the whole, guiding developers thing.  
I focused more on the liberty and beauty of programming, as in, what cool stuff you could build, so it gets you excited. This way, the motivation towards learning comes from curiosity and having fun, which is a much more effective way to learn coding.  
Especially now, as AI is advancing, the possibilities are endless, endless fun haha.  
Anyway, I want to work with a few people, 2-4 persons, one-on-one, for 2 sessions a week.  
And help them, guide for the first a few months so they get to the stage of doing everything by themselves. Was thinking of a fair price, £600 a month, 8 sessions in total, of about an hour each, but obvs sometimes might be a bit longer or shorter, depending on what we are going to do.  
If you find this offer enticing, please, get in touch with me, let's have a 30-min call and we can see together what I can help you with.  
In terms of skills, I'm highly proficient in Javascript, React, Python, HTML & CSS, AI, Bash scripts ... and all the other tools that usually job applications look for, such as Google Cloud, AWS, Deployments, Testing....  
My initial thought was that 3-6 months would be enough to get you on your feet, but again, depending on where you stand right now, and what you want to focus on later on.  
Our sessions will be different depending on how our first calls go.  
If you will be more inclined towards mobile development, together with AI, there will be shorter sessions, and more work on the side.  
If we somehow get into design, than we might be doing less coding, and more inspiration, tools, where to find what.  
But overall, I would say, if you are a complete novice and want to get to a peak where you yourself feel comfortable doing software engineering apps by yourself, and also feel confident applying for jobs then 1 year is a fair target.  
If only to advance in some areas, anytime between 3-6 months would be enough.  
Let me know what you think - I'm quite available for the next few days while finding the first 4 persons, you can ping me and by next day we could be having the introduction call. No need to commit right away, let's see if we connect in the call and then you later decide if you wanna get our collaboration started.

1djby9s,Boss is quite difficult and I want to improve,"Hi everyone, I’ve been working in my company for nearly a year now. 

For a bit of background, there’s only me and my boss in the office and there’s an offshore team. The offshore team used to be just one member but he got fired (he also has a full time job elsewhere and he is just a contractor with us) because she got a new offshore team. 

My issue is that my boss is very moody which she has admitted to me early on.

She’s very fast with her instructions, she jumps all over the place, she told me to try to understand her. While I obviously can’t understand her thought process 100%, I am trying to see it from a POV of a business owner but I still fall short most of the time as she has something to complain about. 

She finds something to nitpick abt or get mad at me for. I’m genuinely not sure if I suck or is it just her? 

I can say for certainty that I did not do well in the first couple of months as it is the first time I’m in this role. On top of this, she is very fast with speaking. She jumps to different jobs and sometimes when I come in, she just shoots all the work at me as soon as I sit down. I have told her this issue before and she has told me two things on multiple occasions. 
1. She understands and will slow down 
2. She expects me to just get it 

I am really trying my best to be up to her speed but I don’t know if I can. 

I also honestly think i am getting better as I can see myself achieving different jobs quicker with less to no mistakes/questions.

There is a big job today and I think I did well without her having to show me as I had it approved by her and she was okay with it. 

But she found something to nitpick on and I’m just unsure what to do at this point.

I can also say I admire her knowledge as I have learned A LOT since I started. I really want to improve the work situation as I am keen to learn more. 

Can anyone give me some pointers on what to do/improve as I don’t know what else to do.

1djauz3,Where did I go wrong in this SDR tech start-up interview?,"Hey, I am posting to get some input/insights on why I did not get pass the first round. Here's a breakdown of what happened:

Highlight of the interview:

* One of the first question was ""Who was your reporting officer?"" for the first job I had after graduation, which I left 2 years ago and have been freelancing since.
* Kept digging about how I would rate my previous leaders, and how would the RO rate me if they were to reach out now. (I said perhaps she would rate me a 7.5-8/10. I believe she would agree on my competency but I have spoken to her a few times to talk about the morale of the workplace and the rampant gossiping culture).
* Got me to rate my previous 'Reporting Officer' and give feedback on her. Rated her a 7. Said she was intelligent, brilliant, and a success, but could work on her active listening and people skills. Was that a trick question?
* Asked a random question of what ""open-source"" is even though its an entry level sales role, I could answer and answered it well. But wonder if this is normal bc its not even related?
* For the rest of the interview, I think I did pretty well in answering them.
* The company also requires a CCAT test subsequently.
* Overall, company has good ratings on Glassdoor. I think they are just trying to filter and have low tolerance for such potential negativity/red flags about someone.

I understand rejection happens, and for start-ups that are doing extremely well, they would be very selective with their hires. Just felt that it was unfair that the first few question was obviously a test and a way to check my credibility/honest. I feel unjust because judging you based on what your 'Reporting Officer' might think of you is multi-faceted. Some people have really bad bosses and that is not a testament to my character.

What do you guys think? Is there a way I could have answered it better? I do not think I could lie because they seem like they were looking for 'credible' references and to reach out to them. I have been freelancing and have regular clients, they do not seem to bother looking into that. Was I stupid enough to be honest and was it a trick question?",Plainhorsemen12,1,1.0,0,1718772454,2024-06-19 04:47:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1djauz3/where_did_i_go_wrong_in_this_sdr_tech_startup/,6,2024

I just graduated from Michigan State University in April with a degree in Economics. I've been job searching since then but haven't had any luck. My only experience is an automotive internship from my freshman year, and my grades aren't great, so I don't include them on my resume.

I'm very eager and desperate for a job as of now. I apllied to about a 100+ and was hoping to find something in the $45,000 - $55,000 range, but I haven't heard back from any applications except for 100% commission sales and a $16 teller position. I want to stay in Michigan for at least a year, which I know limits my options.

I've applied to accounting jobs, data analyst positions, and teller roles, but I'm not sure what else I should be applying for or what I'm qualified for. Are there any other types of jobs I should consider? Are there certifications or quick courses I can take to boost my chances? I'm willing to do anything and work any job to get started.

1dj93sw,Art Therapy programs,"I'm 37 y/o American, no kids, looking for opinions on the best route to take to become an Art Therapist. I live in California I earned my BA in Art Education K-12 in Pennsylvania, and my MFA in Studio Art in Pennsylvania. I've been teaching art education in private schools full-time for sixteen years. My plan is to retire from teaching art education when I'm older (65, 70), and continue working as an art therapist for income. Worried about needing to fly back and forth to Pennsylvania to take care of parents so worried about a reciprocal degree in this field, too.

My questions are: 

1. What route(s) do I take and what stepping stones do I make sure to step on if I want to be able to practice being an art therapist in both CA and PA? 

2. Do I need to be board certified or can I have my certification in something to have my own private art therapy practice?

4. In the next 20 years, I will be working work full-time teaching art education. Is there a program I can do this in while going to school either online or in person? 

5. I'm also interested in doing a research program and studying the side effects of stress and trauma on the body. I'm mainly interested in working with children and facilitating communication between families using art making as a modality. Are there any funded programs that would support me in this research? 

6. I believe art therapists should be in schools. Is there a program that would support my interest in studying the intersection between placing art therapists in schools and research on processing trauma, coping with stress, and facilitating communication between child and guardian?

The context is:

- I've been trying to job hunt for the last 2 months, getting close a few times but no successful offer yet

- My experience so far is 1 year at the previous company and 1.5 years at the big 4.

- One of the reasons i'm so desperate to leave is because we have an upcoming rotation where that department is notorious for being brutal (lots of overtime, very excel heavy work which i'm not good at, unpleasant managers). Otherwise i would have sticked it out until i found my next job, but i'm so burnt out already that i don't know if i can survive the rotation

- Options are currently (1) leave without another job lined up, which i'm afraid would be a red flag to recruiters considering i've only been here 1.5 years, also less bargaining power (2) use a 3 months career break that the company offers and use that time to find a job. This would however be horrible for my reputation and lowers my chance of getting a good reference as it looks like i'm trying to avoid the rotation.

1dj6im1,Storytime: New Job Presents a Difficult Challenge. Help?!,"If anyone has any thoughts or advice I would greatly appreciate it. 

At work, I am fairly new, I've been in the role for less than four months. For context, I've worked in digital/content marketing for almost 8 years. In my previous roles, I've worked in-house for well-known, global brands and have moved into people leadership in the last 2.5 - 3 years. In my new role, my boss hired me to transform and grow a discipline of their department. I report directly to an executive. The company I work for has an aggressive growth plan in place beginning in 2020 through 2026. For me, the company and role was attractive for career growth and building a team. 

Now the issue that I am dealing with at work. A large part of my role in recent years was outsourced to a contractor after the previous person left the company. The shift from internal staff to external resources didn't seem unusual given the job market in recent years. However, since I started earlier this year, I have been met with unprofessional behavior from my company's contractor. A bit of hazing doesn't seem too bad, right? Well, I've received multiple emails that are 5+ paragraphs in length that is abusive; I'm met with this person withholding information to perform my job, making me seem ill-equipped in front of peers, and going behind my back to speak poorly about my character and ability to perform. Most recently, I received a 9 paragraph email illustrating to C-suite, my boos (also an executive) with me in distribution of my inability to do my job and ""all they have done for XYZ company."" Yesterday, a colleague informed that my company's contractor was speaking to internal staff about me and complaining by saying, ""If (insert name) would ever do their job"" and ""they don't answer me when I email them. Can you ask?"" In recent months, I've attempted to address this situation without getting executive leadership involved. However, my boss and I have spoken about this in passing on two occasions. C-suite and my boss have acknowledge that the behavior displayed from our contractor isn't acceptable. That's just scratching the surface.  



I'm at a loss for what and how to make this better so it doesn't have to be a toxic, hostile, and manipulative for me in a role I've been in for not even six months. I feel deflated in this situation for a few reasons 1) I am relocating for this job and feel that I am now making a mistake. 2) I don't want this to go to HR but feel in my gut that's where this is headed.

Outside of this issue the rest of my team and company has been great.  Any advice or ways to handle this situation would be helpful.

Construction Management in Australia.
I'm currently working at a tier 1 property developer as a cadet qs and have worked at a fitout contractor as a cadet contract admin / estimator type role. I absolutely hate where I currently work. It's extremely confusing, l'm not getting the help I need, the type of work is fucking horrible, whilst the hours are fine at the moment to allow for my studies I hear of the grads and senior guys doing insane hours bringing their work home with them 80+ hour weeks which is what l'd be looking at post grad if I stay. I want to have kids one day and I can't see that as a feasible career option in the future.
My question is anyone who is a building surveyor, do you like it, can you leave your work at work, is it low stress and how are the job availabilities? Money isn't as important to me, aslong as it's decent enough to live comfortably with kids and save. From what I can see at face value there's lots of council roles in building surveying which would suit me with the 9 day fortnight and benefits.

1dj4ise,"Serious Career Advice - Oh Wise Guru's of Reddit, show me the way! ","Hello,

  
Seriously not a shitpost. 

I'm genuinely trying to find myself after waking up from a daze of life. I'm super interested in medicine and totally love it, I like management too, quite a bit. Medicine is def cooler though, albeit way harder. 

Here's my bg: 

1. US based 
2. Got 12-13 years work exp in tech 
3. Bachelors from a top 10 engineering in the US 

I understand going to medical school and even doing the fastpath is still going to take 6 years of life away. That's serious opportunity cost. However at the end of it, I will be working in medicine which may be really fulfilling. 

Why I want to do medicine: 

1. It sounds fulfilling and stable. Not subject to layoffs like in tech. Imagine being 52, and laid off and struggling to find new work. Sucks! 

2. You can work anywhere in the world and make solid income! Money is super important and doctors get paid crazy salaries for sure. 

3. It is a stable job, no layoffs and as long as you have a stethoscope you can open a clinic pretty much anywhere. Sounds fun. 

4. Your job is literally helping people. That's got to be some seriously good Karma. 



Reasons why I'm apprehensive of doing it:

1. HUGE DEBT and I have 0 background in medicine. 

2. My Age, I will be mid 40's by the time I'm truly working. 

3. An MBA may be an easier transition into higher pay (but longer hours, and not as much as medicine and pretty sure it will not be as fulfilling, unless you are working in ultra modern tech like AI - but those jobs are hard to find and pretty sure they maybe automated soon too). 

4.  Afraid that if I struggle and spend the 6 years and I'll be starting with a mountain of debt and then have to pay that off and hope by that time AI has not already made doctors (family medicine and PCP's) obsolete. I'm sure it's still a way to go before it comes for surgery. 

Question: 

1. Does it make any sense for a person with this background to start from scratch? Yes it may be fulfilling, but it needs to make sense financially too. Will the ROI justify it in the long term?   
  
2. What are the odds of AI wrecking family medicine and PCP doctors in 10 years when we get doctor in a box near you?   
  
3.  Reddit, what is your advice to me so that I don't wreck my life and can live a truly meaningful existence? 

4. Should I just do an MBA from a top school and then try to work my way up the corporate ladder and still unlock $250k+? 

Show me the way Reddit Sensei's

1dj41ns,Feeling Stuck in Remote Job,"I (25F) have worked remotely for an IT consulting firm since August 2023. I haven’t even been working for this company for a year yet and I feel stuck and miserable everyday. I have no motivation to complete my work, and since it is a consulting firm I have to bill my time to clients. I get stuck in this endless loop of not getting much done and having to bill empty hours to Overhead or Training, and have recently been talked to about my “Billable Ratio” being too low. But I can’t bill time to clients that I haven’t actually spent doing tasks for them. 

This job wasn’t really what I went to school for (chemical engineering) but is somewhat related in terms of problem-solving and data analysis. There’s just something about the tasks that leave me unable to start on anything and struggling to manage several clients at once. Before this role, I had 3 jobs in a little over 3 years, with one being a barely 3 month stint that leaves a stain on my resume. So safe to say I’m a little hesitant about leaving the company and looking like even more of a job hopper.

I’m unhappy with working remotely and look forward to the quarterly meeting at the company headquarters when all the remote employees come to visit. At the same time I have grown accustomed to a flexible schedule with a lot of perks, such as being able to work from anywhere with just my laptop. It’s gotten so bad that I have asked my manager to work reduced hours (30 hrs/week) just so I don’t have the stress and pressure of billing 40 hours out of thin air. I’m also in graduate school and getting married this year so the stress was just really getting to me when it came time to fill out my timesheet.

To address some common responses I may get:
- I have talked to a therapist about it, she suggested that the fact I get paid for this work should motivate me to complete it. (Yes, I probably need a new therapist)
- I have tried to talk to a coworker about my struggles, she told me to “get organized” and “just do it”. Was not helpful, shockingly.
- I have not discussed specifics with my manager, just cited mental health reasons for the request to work part-time.
- I live in a different state than the company headquarters, so heading into the office isn’t an option right now.
- I have tried co-working space memberships to get out of the house, but money is tight right now (i.e. grad school and wedding).

Please give me an outside perspective on my situation. What should I be looking into so that I can either enjoy my current job or leave without looking like a flake on my resume?

I’m seeking some advice on what to do, as I feel really lost and uninspired at work.

1dj25oa,Want to become a database admin,"Ive just finished university, and i really want to get into database admin. Im confused as to why there are no entry level positions? 

Everyone seems to say they started off programming first then got into dba through there work? Why does this seem to be the case? Im not a fan of programming (web/app dev etc) but i enjoy sql and python for data cleaning and exploration and analysing etc. i also have an interest in dbms, and topics like erd’s and db best practices, normalisation etc

I’d like to just go straight into dba, anyone done this haha? Or is programming literally a mandatory prerequisite? I can only see small relevances like how data is parsed through apis or like LINQ for example. I get all that and comprehend them when reading code, i just dont want to do development in that space if that makes sense? 

Thanks for reading and would really appreciate some feedback and hopefully optimistic experiences.

1dj1yd6,Failed Drug Test Suppose to Start Tomorrow ,"Hi Reddit,

I’m kind of in a situation and could really use some guidance. Here’s what’s happening:

I recently received a job offer from a hospital in California, which was contingent upon passing a physical exam and drug test. I did take edibles over a month ago because sometimes I get really bad cramps and back pain from endo. I’m not a frequent user by any means. I don’t have a med card or any prescription because it’s legal here in California. Despite my assurance that I wouldn’t test positive.. I unfortunately did. I didn’t disclose anything to HR because I genuinely thought I would be good. To top it all off, I even took an at home test and it was NEGATIVE!! The bamboozle. 

I received the positive results on Sunday and immediately emailed HR, explaining my situation and why I hadn’t disclosed it earlier. It’s now Tuesday, and my projected start date is tomorrow (Wednesday) and have not heard a single thing back. Should I be panicking and just count my loss here? 

I’m feeling anxious and unsure about what to do next. Should I grow some courage and call HR for an update? Any advice on how to navigate this situation would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you all in advance for your insights and support",Gullible_Mail_3082,0,0.33000001311302185,2,1718745853,2024-06-18 21:24:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dj1yd6/failed_drug_test_suppose_to_start_tomorrow/,6,2024

1dj0dpd,I was asked to state my conditions,"Hi all,

After a quite long process with multiple 1:1 discussions with various leaders in a business who have been headhunting me for a while they asked me today to “take a few days and let them know my conditions” to join.

It’s quite a specific set of knowledge and skills they are looking for, and I find their vision quite compelling and I know I’m quite a unique match. The downside: I told them what I’m on now, which is probably a good 10-20% below what I think I should be on let alone the additional amount above that I’d expect for the role they’re looking to fill.

My question is what’s a reasonable amount base salary as a % of current compensation to ask for without seeming rude? I know traditional advice is to seek 10-20% for a business move, but I’m moving from a highly secure and slightly unpaid role and I believe they recognise this…

Additionally bonus, compensation, flexibility are all up for grabs.

Is it bad form to go seriously high with the expectation of negotiation downwards or do I risk scuppering the offer? This is a fairly new scenario for me having always received an offer on the table to consider previously…

1dizg2z,I’m Completely Lost on What I want a Career in.,"As an incoming freshman (I know I probably shouldn’t be on this sub or this app at all) I’m completely lost on what career I want. Family members ask me all the time “do you know what you want to do in life?” or “what college are you thinking about?” and my best answer is “I don’t know.” because I truly don’t know. 

A little background on what I’m good/bad at, 

I’m very interested in History, particularly wars (WWI, WWII, Crusades, etc.) and this has led me to being put in AP Human. I’m also very good at writing, English, statistics and numbers. I also won an awards at my previous school for Leadership. I finished last year with all A’s B’s and a C in cooking sadly. 

Somewhat contrary to what I just said I am very very bad at math, my brain just goes numb during that class. My decision making is questionable at times, and I’m a very big procrastinator. 

Some people I’ve talked to have referred me to being an Accountant or Historian. I’m mainly trying to look for a Job that I would love but also pays somewhat decent.

1dizfyt,Was I out of line to challenge a discussion about paid time off? ,"Context: I lead a large team of people on a technology project. The project is ending in October. There are release dates in the summer. There are team members who are ending their contracts or leaving on their own as they see the project is ending with no guarantees of work afterwards. I personally have no work guaranteed although no one has told me I'm leaving (yet). 

I booked a week off that overlaps with another person's week off. We usually back each other up. That week we both booked off will be a slow week. We know this as we know the business cycle and we have no key tasks planned at that time. The other person who booked the week off DOES have a guaranteed role after this project; I do not as yet. 

Both of us have worked many additional hours, evenings, weekends etc. and we're both tired. We're not the only ones; many others have as well. My boss was upset that we're both off at the same time. I responded there are other people around; neither of us are irreplaceable. I reminded her that I barely had any time off at all this year and I have 30 days entitlement that I haven't taken. And that number is growing. She then proceeded to remind me that she was taking calls during her vacations in Europe and in Florida. I told her that was her choice; she didn't have to do that.  I refused to ask the other person to change their holiday and I'm not either. I have a family wedding that week and I have to travel. 

Well this just aggravated her more and that emboldened me more. When she kept complaining about all the hours she worked, I pointed out that she was compensated for that. Me and my team are not. Her salary is almost half a million a year; I make a third of that. Canadian summers are short as heck; we already have weeks embargoed due to releases... we're taking vacation as booked. 

She's been giving me the silent treatment all day. I don't care. In the big scheme of things if I'm so valuable I can't be off then... heck... pay me more.

1diymmh,How should I go about applying for an internal transfer?,"Hi [](https://www.reddit.com/r/work/)

I'm not too happy in my currently role, and I am looking to transfer to an internal position within the same company.

For some background:

1. I am a high performer in my role, but I'm not energized by my work. The org that my org supports apparently loves me and the quantity and quality of work that I produce.
2. The role and company that I am in pays well, but there isn't much growth in the long run.
3. On top of that, I get the sense there is a lot of hostility towards me in my org because my father use to work within the same division(not the same field but in a very important role) and he himself was a high performer, but its likely he was a dick to a lot of people(he sometimes comes off as an asshole). I feel like people don't like me(especially my upper management) because of my association to him.

How should I go about applying for an internal position in a different organization? I love the company that I support and would like to stay here if I can.

TLDR;  
How do I go about applying for an internal transfer when I may not have my manager's and upper management's support?",Whole_Damage_8945,1,1.0,0,1718737461,2024-06-18 19:04:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1diymmh/how_should_i_go_about_applying_for_an_internal/,6,2024
1diydfd,My Coworker is get paid more. Seeking advise for future negotiation. ,"My coworker is at the same level as me, is receiving a significantly higher salary. 

We are both female immigrants, my English, education, and overall professional experiences are better. 

We started at the same time. Her starting comp was higher than mine, which I understood because she had industrial experience.  

She got promoted the first year with a huge bump, which I understood, because her manager left, she took over the responsibilities. She got 15% of bonus, I got 10%

I asked for a promotion the second year, received a small bump after a hard negotiation, which I wasn't happy of course. 

I trained her to take over my job since my promotion shifted me from one team to another. The training outcome is okay; I would say she met expectations, I still lead most meetings when we collaborate, 

The following year, she received the extra bonus for taking over my job, I got nothing. She also got higher merit increase than I did.  

I have no negative feelings toward her; in fact, we are closer than other coworkers. I'm happy for her to get what she deserves. But I'm not happy that I'm not recognized by my employer, the worst part is I started to think, what I did wrong to not being recognized!!! 

Please advise!

1diy87l,"I’m interested in a new job at work, but not sure how to approach","Hey y’all, could use a little advice.  I’m 23, graduated college May 2023.  Started working at my company in June 2033, so I’ve been there a full year now.  We have 500 employees, so medium-ish company I suppose.

My job title is data analyst.  I do a lot of data viz, mostly using a proprietary analysis program, as well as sheets and tableau.  So far, I’d say my work has been received pretty well.  I even got a raise 8 months in.  

I check the company job listings once a week or so, and I just saw a job pop up.  The job title is data engineer.  This must be a new job, because there are currently no employees with that title.  It must also be in a different department too, because I never heard of it at work until I saw the listing.  It’s probably under IT, and I fall under sales.

Long story short, I was a compsci major and this is the sort of work I was more interested in to begin with.  Working with SQL, MATLAB, Alteryx, data automation, etc.  I’m very interested in this job, but it requires 3+ years of experience.

What should I do?  I don’t want to risk my current job or make things awkward.  Also, I feel like I sort of cemented myself as the awkward, nerdy, quiet type.  I don’t think it bothers anyone, but the industry I work in is very social, and I’ve been called out for being quiet and shy (in a joking way).  I feel like this reputation may hurt my chances of growing within the company, but I could totally be wrong.  Like I said, my work has been very well received, and a lot of upper management has come to me to build out trackers and projects for them.

Any advice?  I’m mostly just worried about the 3+ years of experience requirement, as well as risking my current job or making things awkward.  But in my eyes this would be a win win, because it’d be something I’m more interested in long term, as well as definitely a higher paying job.  I just don’t know if it’s too soon.

1dixyt9,At a crossroads should I choose passion or stability?,"
I am 22 years old, I’ve recently graduated with a degree in Communications. I’ve had the privilege of completing two internships in the live music industry, which has always been my passion. However, I’m currently facing significant challenges in finding a job in this field. The competition is fierce, and the available positions often offer salaries that are barely livable, especially in high-cost areas like NYC. This reality has made me start rethinking my career path.

I’m currently working for my family’s successful business, where I’ve been employed throughout my entire working life. It’s a stable and high paying, with my Dad and Uncle each earning around $500k a year. My Dad has suggested that I could take this on full-time, but it would require a serious commitment to learning the business.

Adding to this issue, I have a strong desire to move to a major city like NYC for a few years, which would be impossible if I chose to stay with the family business.I find myself at a crossroads, torn between pursuing a career in the live music industry, which fulfills my passion but offers limited financial stability, and committing to the family business, which promises a secure and well paying future but may prevent me from experiencing life in a major city.

Hello everyone I was abruptly let go from my last job after criticizing management(I digress). I am currently Ubering to make ends meet. However I had an interview with my brothers company and they were great. Unfortunately there was a hiring freeze which resulted in me being told they want to hire me but can’t. There was no timeline provided so I looked around and decided I’d go to trade school(hvac/r) first class is Monday. I have already committed to the financial side of schooling. 

Now the kicker

I get word today that the company has been making head way and can possibly start hiring again. No conversation have been had in terms of offers but my brother works there so I know they still have interest in me. 

My dilemma is do I take a relatively safe office job with little to no room for significant salary increases or do I finish school and go into the HVAC? 

Office job probably lands somewhere in the 40-60k range with decent benefits 

School says I should start around 50k in hvac but quick advancement after time in the field.

1diwl1b,Should I continue negotiating this promotion salary?,"I work in HR in the UK, some big changes happened in my wider team which saw one lady in the department leave so my line manager was  promoted / side stepped into another team, a week or so later another girl in the wider department left but was hired back a week later as my manager. 

During the chaos I took my opportunity to ask for more responsibility and pay. They offered a slightly better title with a 4% bump. The 4% is not going to affect my pocket and seems very unfair in comparison to the hefty extra work load. They’ve previously (separately) agreed to pay for my CIPD course (approx 3k) later in the year but I have nothing in writing. 

The business has money which they are still dishing out on operational staff, but they are making a lot of support staff redundant so this was possibly a risky move.

Looking at similar positions I should be looking at around 20% but there’s not a huge number of these roles available, I asked for 10-11 and was told there is no scope for further increase. 

Do I push one more time / how would you proceed? should I take the title, 4% and qualification? Times are tough out here I really could use extra money.

1diwh9x,First big mistake at first corporate job,"Hi, yesterday i made a very silly and rather big mistake at work - i accidentally sent out an unapproved document to a bunch of media contacts (I am in PR) that I was not supposed to, causing potential reputational damage to the company I work for. I basically attached the wrong attachment, one which was still not meant for the public to see. I reported it to my manager straight after I saw the error, owned the mistake and did all I could possibly do to follow company protocol. I could not sleep well the following night and kept checking for new emails from compliance/legal officers until I fell asleep. 

This morning I had a call with my manager, managing director as well as another superior to talk through it all (we all work in different time zones) and I was not fired, instead my managing director told me about how he also messed up in the past similarly to me and also basically told me to learn from this mistake and move on, be more careful. I also felt a huge relief when we all learned that the document I shared did not include any super duper highly confidential information that would have a significant effect on the company’s reputation/share value.

However, I still feel so awful about the whole thing, even after my manager telling me not to worry (several times) about it and that it was an honest mistake.

Given that it is my very first and rather serious mistake which will definitely not be forgotten by management anytime soon, I cannot stop feeling awful. It is literally all i think about. I feel like I will be even more anxious at work than before (it is a very stressful job) and I am afraid I will hate myself for being there even more than I do now. I have good and bad days at work, but since it is my first “real” job (and by no means a dream job), i have made a promise to myself to stay in it for 1.5 or 2 years max just to have something good for my CV snd future. 

My question to you all would be how can I turn this all into a positive experience and not let it make me feel incompetent, stupid, unreliable and untrustworthy. How can I prevent myself from overthinking this whole situation. How can I not beat myself up about all this. I feel like I cannot be trusted with anything serious anymore.

TLDR; messed up at first job, how to feel better

1diwel4,Taking a pay cut for a better quality of life?,"My current job is a total nightmare. We're currently in dire straights financially (each pay period we're not sure if we'll cover payroll), we're in serious legal disputes with a few companies, and the morale at the company is in the pits (we've had to layoff staff, etc.). At the same time, I'm working a ton of hours to pick up slack and am super stressed. 

Needless to say, I've been job searching and need to exit my current role asap. I've received a few offers but have declined them for a variety of reasons.

Recently, I received an offer for a position that would result in a 30% pay cut (after salary negotiations). It's a slight step down in terms of title (VP to Director) but I've worked with this organization for a long time and know that (1) they do incredible work that I'd love to be a part of and (2) have incredible flexibility and work life balance. I've also always wanted to work for the organization (I applied to past positions but never seemed to get my foot in the door).

I'm excited about the position and the scope of work but am conflicted on the paycut. We would be able to survive on this lower income (and even have a little left over for savings/retirement/emergencies). Further, this position has incredible career trajectory potential. I just cant seem to shake the feeling of uncertainty in lowering my gross salary by a third.

Has anyone else been in this position before? Any guidance or outside perspective is welcomed. ",Murky-Valuable3844,2,1.0,3,1718731937,2024-06-18 17:32:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1diwel4/taking_a_pay_cut_for_a_better_quality_of_life/,6,2024
1divi8c,Leave Amazon for MSFT? ,"Hello, It's been 2 weeks since I joined Amazon, Seattle as a Swe 2. I like my team and the job profile. Manager is friendly and seems like a nice dude. I received an offer from Microsoft recently. Overall the team in Microsoft comes pretty close to the current role, although I would say it is slightly better in terms of future aspects - there's a close ML component and business criticality. 

I'm torn whether I should leave Amazon now. I've asked the HM from Microsoft to beat my Amazon compensation, and it most likely will be done. The offered level is 63. Seattle. The slightly higher level, benefits and the wlb are alluring. 

I'm trying to understand what the repercussions will be and if there are other aspects to consider. Appreciate all your inputs.

1divfo6,What are my best options for a new career/education path at 28 years old?,"Hi there,

9 years ago I graduated from a music/audio program at a Canadian college. For those past 9 years it has been an absolute gruelling process trying to land a job in this industry and I'm afraid that at 28 years old it's time to call it quits. I have lived with my parents this whole time, and since graduating have never surpassed a $24,000 CAD a year income. For 5 years I have been getting sporadic work at a recording studio, but it only amounts to about $12,000 CAD tops per year with no room to grow, so I supplement it with 2 days a week at a wood shop, which has recently laid me off due to lack of work.

My girlfriend just graduated college again at 27 to become an educator and it has really inspired me to look into a new career path. I know it's never too late to start over but it certainly feels like I'm pushing it.

There's very little paths that I am opposed to following, I am just seeking some suggestions on paths that won't lead me to a dead end as my audio journey did. And to be honest, I'm not so much interested in making tons of money or ""building a career"", just something that I can support myself doing and not have to worry as much as I do now. I currently live just outside of Toronto, but am looking to relocate west towards Burlington or Hamilton, Ontario, which makes me think the opportunities are reduced. I just can't take Toronto as of these past few years.

Careers that I have thought of pursuing with my current experience are: - Home/commercial audio visual installation - City parks and recreation - Cabinetry - Various trades - Postal service

As for pursuing a new education, I know that trades are begging for workers but I'm interested in knowing what else is worth looking into.

So please if you will, throw your suggestions for career/education paths at me, as I'm eager for a new start!",Dear_World_8904,1,1.0,0,1718729506,2024-06-18 16:51:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1divfo6/what_are_my_best_options_for_a_new/,6,2024

1diuzi7,Confused and lost(computer science).,"I've always loved electronics and computer science, still do. I just graduated(CS) and I simply cant seem to focus on one area in CS. Everybody I know tells me to choose one path and stick to it, but I simply cannot, because I love it all, no kidding. I have hands on and theoretical knowledge in fields such as Deep learning, Web development( Frontend/Backend), App Development, Cybersecurity, Embedded programming, 3D modelling, robotics, ros, to name a few. Guaranteed, I am not a master in all of these topics(though i want to) but I certainly enjoy doing what I do, that is building cool shit, hacking stuff etc which also means I do not like to do projects that don't interest me, such as building a clone of a website or a popular app, which I agree does demonstrate your skills, but how does that set you apart if thousands of other ppl do the same? Given my broad interests, I do not have a shitload of projects in any one specific area, but I have projects that cover multiple topics (for example I had built an AI camera system using Rpi, hosted a server on DigitalOcean, developed apps for the same). Now this becomes a problem when I'm applying for positions. Since I do not have many projects in any one area, I cannot tailor my resume to suit the job requirements, which ultimately means I end up with no interviews. I do want to focus on one area, but I do not know how to chose what I want, like I said I love it all. I really need some help here, people around me are getting placed with great packages, while I'm here questioning my life choices.

This post may seem stupid and trivial to many, but I am genuinely confused as to what I must do. If there's anybody out there who has been in a similar situation, or anybody who can some good advice, I look forward to it. Thank you.

1ditm7m,Stay at the lower paying job related to my field or go to the higher paying job outside my field? ,"Hello,

I’m a bit conflicted about a decision that I have to make soon. Since January, I had been looking for a new job. My old job was too toxic and made me absolutely miserable. After five months into my search, I finally got a job offer. Despite the fact that I was taking a significant pay cut, I took the job on the notion that it could help my resume look good for grad school. My goal is to go grad school for public health soon. The new job is an admin position for a nonprofit organization that focuses on advocating for physicians across the state. So far, it’s been pretty chill and my coworkers are amicable. I do intend on still working full time while pursuing my masters. Not too long after starting this new job, I received an offer for a state government job that I had applied to awhile back ago. While the offer gives way to a higher salary, it’s an admin position with the department of corrections. That’s not really what I want to do. I’m only considering this offer because I’ve been told  it’s easy to change departments once you start working for the state government. If that’s the case, I could get myself established then switch to a department that’s closer to what I want to do. Additionally, a good amount of public health jobs are within government entities. 

Ultimately, should I stay at my current job that pay less or take the take offer that pays more? Any advice is appreciated. 

For context: I graduated college with my Bachelor’s in Psychology back in late 2021. I’m still very fresh when it comes to establishing a career.

1disvgq,could double majoring in 2 unrelated fields tank my career prospects?,"
im a prefrosh and i am kind of stuck between 2 subjects, history and geology for my major. if money weren’t an object i would simply be a history major but i feel more comfortable doing geology. i feel geology something i can enjoy while also being sort of lucrative. however, i feel really bad giving up history bc i feel like it’s my passion. so i was planning on double majoring and trying to get a career in history (i want to DO and USE history, not law or hr or management or anything), and using the geoscience as a backup. but ive seen how competitive the job market is (especially these two fields ☹️), and i feel like a double major would take up a lot of my time and prevent me from doing internships which would make me uncompetitive. and even if i did get some internships, i don’t think it’s realistic to expect to get them in *both* fields, which would mean i wouldn’t even be able to fall back on the other major most likely. since i absolutely don’t want to rule out the possibility of doing a history career and will be hopefully very active within the history sphere as a student, i don’t see how i could relate any history experience to geology jobs if i have to start looking for them.

**so is it better to double major in my non-lucrative passion and something more practical or just try to kick ass in the non-lucrative thing?** 

hopefully my passion would make me a great student and get me internships and high grades and good relationships with other students and teachers so i could network. btw, the careers i want are government historian (using my historical knowledge and skills to help create policy - this is my first choice for a job), managing archives or a museum collection/public history, or becoming a professor and doing professional research. i don’t know what i could possibly double major in that’s lucrative and would complement well with a history major and i would like.

As a natural salesperson, there are tons of opportunities for appointment based sales and I found one in home improvement. 
I actually am a customer of theirs from 2 years ago, and everything was excellent from my end as a customer. 

I would be a W2 employee with a base salary of 35K plus commissions. The benefits I must say, are excellent. They have paid parental leave which is non-existent in the US. 
In my current role, I have a salary of 60k, with an opportunity to earn a bonus based off my salary. I have crushed my sales goals by almost double, but have not seen a bonus. That is one reason I need to leave. 

My concerns about this opportunity are obviously leaving my salaried position for something that relies more heavily on performance for compensation. And although the reviews on Glassdoor are overwhelmingly positive, I also have seen some unsatisfied former employees with valid concerns. There is door knocking involved during training, and that role secures the leads and sets appointments for the sales people. Eventually after training you become a sales person. 
I do think there is success to be had in this field if you have the personality for it, and the right mindset. However, I worry the company is selling itself too much to me.

1diqvzq,Passive aggressive workmate,"I have a workmate who was more senior than me in my current role. We have the same position and this person basically trained me when I first joined the team. Even during the training, I felt something was off. Almost like this person (let’s call this person Sam) does not want to share information with me, and would only answer my questions but withhold information I dont directly ask. Being new, sometimes I didnt even know what questions to ask. This makes onboarding difficult for me. 

There was a time when Sam called me out in the meeting, I felt embarrassed. To be fair, I was wrong. But the way I was called out was almost hostile. I never would call out anyone the way I was called out then. 

I pushed thru and thankfully, someone else gave me a helping hand. It was a tough 6 months. Anyhow, even now that I’m more exposed to the role, I’m still finding my way around. We also have to work from time to time. 

Sometimes, Sam would ask me questions and when I answer and it’s different from Sam’s POV/opinion, i can see the disapproval from his/her’s face with matching frown/raising of eyebrow. I tried to answer based on facts but I know I’m not always right. Sam could always opt to do what he/she wants. IDK why he/she even ask for my opinion. Not to mention the passive aggressive emails Sam sends with higher level managers cc-d. Some ppl noticed. I tried to really work as harmoniously as I can with Sam. I don’t respond with p/a email and just tried in general to be nice but this person is hell bent on giving me a hard time. 

I don’t want to do anything that will backfire to me, but sometimes I just feel so frustrated. When I send Sam a chat or an email, my heart sinks to my stomach and just makes me sad the full day. It’s almost like I feel his/her annoyance. Now, I just try my best to avoid Sam but it can’t always be avoided. 

As a background, I believe I am a good employee. I frequently get exceeding expectations rating and people are happy to work with me because I collaborate well. I believe I am a kind person who makes it safe for people to reach out to me and ask questions. I’ve also established my credibility in my previous role, so this is not a matter of me always doing things wrong. When I was new to my role, I felt that people were happy with my ways of working so I don’t know where all this angst from my workmate is coming from.

Any advice? ",ZeGutsyNinja,3,1.0,2,1718717844,2024-06-18 13:37:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1diqvzq/passive_aggressive_workmate/,6,2024

Is anyone out there a 'super commuter' that isn't abhorrently miserable? I like audiobooks and podcasts and music.

1diqaln,Politely Declining Committee Membership,"My org requested nominees for a new DEI committee they are forming. I reached out to one person on my staff and asked if it would be okay if I nominated them - they are the only trans person (that I know of)  in our org, worked closely with me and other areas of the org in their coming out, and I thought it would benefit them professionally (esp. building confidence) to make connections and work with people outside their immediate department. I wanted our department to be represented but do not personally feel that I have the time.

Evidently someone nominated me, too, without letting me know. I think the work is important but I don't think we need two folks from our already understaffed department to join and I frankly just feel like I have too much shit to do. I have been on various leadership committees in the past and have been frustrated with how little progress is made - it often seems like something in name only for leadership to feel good about themselves or just to say ""we're doing this."" Plus, I feel like committee work is heavily gendered, unpaid, and unappreciated.

Any advice on how to politely decline without becoming a pariah? Will declining make me look bad with leadership? I know all other departments are also understaffed/under-resourced, but most of those people are also compensated more. I feel like I am put in positions where I can't say ""no,"" but by spreading myself so thinly, am not set up for success.

1diopz0,"Career in finance, operations or IT?","Hi everyone,

I'm in my mid twenties and looking advice for further career options. I would live to hear what would be the best option for me to follow and seek? What qualifications would be beneficial?

About me:

* Living in a small country in Europe
* Bachelors in Business Management (Abroad)
* Currently doing Master's in Finance and Investments (Home country)
* External 6 months courses covering Data Analysis (SQL, Looker, Tableau, etc.)
* Working in a small IT startup
* 2 Years in Sales Operations (CRM administration, processes implementation, automations)
* Half of year as a Data Analyst (Analysis, Business requirements documentation, visualizations)

I see two career options either focusing on IT or on Finance. As I am interested in building and scaling business, maybe there are more options where I could advance further? One of my thoughts were to seek career in early stage VC's but I think it might be too hard to get in and maybe there are more balanced life career options?

1diofzx,Advice for finding “non-toxic” job?,"In my decade of working post-grad I’ve worked in a lot of different industries and roles (Big corporations, small companies, etc.) There was a lot of micromanaging in my early career that I’ve used to make me a better worker. In each job I’ve found the most important factor is your relationship to your boss and coworkers. I’ve had bad luck in pretty much all of them where the boss is either too busy to literally ever meet with me from day one (and ignores me and I’m never trained),  doesn’t like me and stirs up gossip to turn people against each other. I’ve been immediately ostracized from three jobs where I was ignored and seen it happen to others too where the office culture was cliquey and gossipy. This has meant being first on the line for firings/layoffs/ taking blame for all failures (mine and others), etc. My friends are optimistic but confused. I have multiple degrees and love learning and problem-solving. They know I am friendly, smart and have a good work ethic but don’t understand it. 

Also notably, I am a black woman who is comfortable in all types of settings, having worked and lived with people from all backgrounds and cultures, and I blend in a lot of places but also stand out. I mention race because people at work have said weird things to me about random Black celebrities I remind them of (and I don’t look or sound like) or their surprise at how smart I am…complaining that black people get special privileges or are hired for skin color and filling up all the jobs(when we make up less than 5% of the office)…it’s been weird….I’m fairly smart and competent but confused about how to find a job that pays the bills, doesn’t destroy my mental health via gaslighting/verbal abuse/ people sabotaging each other. I was going to try teaching next since I love helping people but seen some horror stories.

My question is, what can I do to provide a stable living for myself?

I feel like the people also don't know what to do with me, since my role doesn't really have any significance and there's no clear guideline since I'm the only entry-level person here.

1dil626,How do I decide when/if to leave academia?,"I'm a research mathematician, currently employed as a postdoctoral research associate in academia. I finished my PhD in 2021. Academia obviously does not pay well, but for most of my 20s I didn't really mind because I didn't have any debt from my undergraduate degree, earned enough to support myself, and was essentially getting paid to obsess over things that I would have obsessed over anyway. As I get older, I'm starting to see that (a) it may take a long time to get a tenure-track position or I may never get one, (b) the low salaries for postdocs limit my future in some tangible ways, and (c) if I do end up ultimately jumping ship, putting that off as long as possible may really limit my choices for my next career and my earning potential.

My first postdoc just ended and I will start a second in August. I had tenure-track interviews in the last hiring cycle (American mathematics departments essentially all hire on the same annual cycle) but no offers. My next postdoc has a three year term, but of course I don't have to stay for the entire term.

Here are the things I'm thinking about and would like feedback on:

* It seems like I could stick it out for 1-2 more years to try my luck on the tenure-track job market again. It's pretty typical in math now to do two (or even three) postdocs prior to finding a tenure-track job. However, I worry that if I wait too long and still end up jumping ship, it will be even harder to find non-academic employment. Any thoughts on how to strike a balance here?
* To start building some non-academic skills, I completed a data science bootcamp and have one fully developed portfolio project. I will spend more time this summer on additional projects & technical skills. However, I'm honestly pretty unsure what I would want to do outside academia and am worried that data science is oversaturated and hard to break into.
* I'm considering taking the first two actuarial exams so that door is also open. However, I'm also not sure if I would enjoy this career path.
* If I had to choose a non-academic job, I think it would be cool to work for a transit authority, airline, the FAA or NTSB, etc. However, I'm not really sure that I currently have any transferrable skills. I have some experience with optimization, graph theory, etc, but those are not my actual research areas.

I realize this is a pretty scattered post, but I guess this is my early mid-life crisis. Grateful for any thoughts or suggestions.",Specialist_Apple5864,1,1.0,1,1718697136,2024-06-18 07:52:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dil626/how_do_i_decide_whenif_to_leave_academia/,6,2024
1dil0q9,Who is a technical consultant and how to become one?,"I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Applications and exploring different career paths in the tech industry. I recently came across the role of a technical consultant, and it piqued my interest.

I would like to know if the role will be suitable for me, I have good communication skills, have worked with different technologies, can research well, have good problem-solving skills, etc..

1dijq9k,Request to work remotely from abroad due to partners relocation,"I need help on how to approach this situation and how should I talk to my manager.

My partner got a promotion and it requires us to move to Switzerland. However, I'd like to ask my current employer if they're willing to let me work remotely from Switzerland.

How do I go about asking this? I don't want to immediately bring up that I will be moving because they'll know I'm also looking for a job there.

1dijl7d,I started a new job yesterday and hate it. What should I do now? ,"I made a decision to move the whole family to another city for this new job. And I started yesterday. This job is in a pharmaceutical production company so they told me that sanitary wide it is strict and we have sanitary uniforms even though I'm working in the office. I thought I would be fine. 

Turns out, every time I want to drink something other than a cup of water beside the water fountain, or everytime I want to have a coffee break, or even using the toilet, I will need to go all the way to the changing room (where all my belongings including my personal phone is left), change out of the uniform, do my business, wash my hands, change again and wash my hands again before I can go back to the office. 

3 storeys of stairs and another 200m of distance altogether.. So a trip to the toilet would take at least 6 minutes! 

Not to mention there's confusion regarding my job responsibilities among the team, my manager and her manager are new comers too, and there's lots of shuffling going on in the department. 

It was such a disappointment that I broke down in tears when I reached home. All I think of for the past hours is to terminate my contract which is possible due to a trial period given and start looking for a new job again. 

But I'm the sole breadwinner for the time being as my husband had to quit his job for me so I know this option is not a good idea. But thinking of going to work today which is just the second day is already stressing me out. 

What should I do? Am I exaggerating as its just another job? Any advice to overcome this so that I stay? Or should I just follow my heart and quit?

1diihmr,I absolutely hate my big tech internship! ,"i just started my internship at one of the best tech companies in the world but i hate it. My manager who I loved at first is an extreme micromanager who doesn’t care to listen to anything I say. Although, the manager thinks it comes out of a place of care — the old world beliefs and the lack of trust for anything I do or say makes me feel anxious, general sense of dread and just frankly annoyed. I feel so depressed working this role and after every conversation with I cry in the bathroom.

Despite working remote and in a different time zone she requires me to be in person every day. I have had to switch our meetings to 7:00 AM my time (this role is a traditional 9-5) in order to accommodate to the fact that they have an incessant need to talk to me every single day & will continuously go over our 30 mins into 40 or 50 (even when we have nothing to talk about that day. She will ask questions until she finds something to critique) fully knowing I have a stand up for my project every morning that I am required to be at. 

Additionally, they are not on the same project as I am tasked on (I have a different project lead) yet they will ask me specific questions about it and when I answer the confidently it is met by a “how do you know” or “you should ask someone.” 

There is also no account for my time (I work from 7:00 AM - 7:00PM) which I don’t mind but they will continuously ask me to do busy work when I am actually busy with REAL work that my lead has given me. They contact me till 8:00 PM to chat about what to me seems so random and will message till I reply. It feels as though every time I talk to them I have to be extremely careful of what I say because they are seeking a reason to critique (even when I made a joke to another intern that was accidentally over heard by her will be a reason for critique despite not being meant for their ears).

I love what I do but I hate this manager. I believe that she will still be my manager if I decide to join the team and the idea of that makes me want to cry. 

she also always suggests I work on weekends and I asked her since the whole team is remote and she is remote and I am alone in the office if I can work on Friday from home and they said no. Additionally, she said to be in the office by 6:00 AM (again she is remote in a diff time zone) and I said that’s unsafe because I take the public transportation in a sketchy area and she said “you have to do what you have to do.” Lastly, she called and asked why I look tired after I had just told her I completed a 12 hour sit in meeting. 

She has all these expectations and i’m not sure if I can meet them and it’s burning me out. Especially since I feel so lonely at the office and I don’t have time to hang out w any intern friends aside from weekend nights. 

Idk this job is beating me down. What should I even do because this is the opportunity of a life time if I get a full time offer? What should I do now?

1diforr,Hypersensitivity to noise but office is driving me insane,"Hi all - this is such a stupid question but seeing as it's affecting my mental health, I would really appreciate your input. (Please also let me know if there are more suitable subs out there where this should rather go).

I started a new job about six months ago. The role is a full time office job (no hybrid working for some reason).

To preface, I suffer from misophonia. Yes, I know it's not a recognised medical condition, but worth mentioning to try and explain why this is getting to me more than it should and the best explanation of what is ""wrong"" with me.

One of my colleagues (sitting next to me) has a habit of sighing. Loudly and deeply. Every couple of minutes. I'm talking ""the world is ending, oh woe is my life"" sighing. The. Whole. Day. Long. He also has a very lovely habit of rinsing his mouth at his desk (think drinking water and sloshing it around in your mouth). This is done quite loudly and a few times a day. 

Even just typing this out, I know how stupid and childish this sounds - I am literally having an issue with a human being....being a human being. But I honestly can't deal with it. On my very first day I had a WTF reaction (throughout the whole day) and was waiting for someone to speak abou about the mouth slosh rinsing, at least. But nothing has ever happened.

It's affecting me mentally as my brain can't make sense of his need for constantly sighing (it basically oozes negativity and makes me feel depressed after a while)
• When I hear the insessant sighing, I think there is something wrong and can't help but think it's not THAT bad and if it is, do something about it. He will literally sigh just for opening an email, replying to an email, having to answer a call or a message, having to read a document... So it ends up frustrating me and interrupting whatever I am busy with
• I don't like wearing headphones/earphones or earplugs at work. I think it's unprofessional to do it in an office setting as the whole point is being part of conversations, the culture, hearing what's going on around you. If you are going to be completely closed off to what is happening around you and joining in on conversations, you might as well WFH.
• I have however started using foam earplugs or listening to music via my headphones to drown out the noises, just to help me get through the day. I really don't like it though for above mentioned reason, plus it also starts getting physically uncomfortable after a while and it is especially embarrassing if my manager comes up to talk to me and I don't hear him.
• I have not spoken to the colleague as I am afraid of being accused of bullying. I know it's not his fault I am hyper sensitive to certain noises, but I also think as this is an open office setting, that people should be mindful of their behaviours that impact the environment of others around them
• I have not spoken to my manager because I think the whole thing is idiotic and I should be able to deal with this on my own. 
• I thought it was a case of getting used to it, but I can't. It's driving me crazy and there have been many times where I have been close to snapping (obviously that won't go down well)
• I feel like I am going crazy as no one else bats an eye - so I am constantly overthinking it and that I'm the one in the wrong, why can't I cope with this while everyone else can, what is wrong with me, etc etc (it's exhausting so this coupled with the constant irritation of having to listen to it, is what is affecting my mental health the most)

How can I cope with this without a confrontation that will affect the working relationship? Is this really something that I need to talk to my manager about? (I would like to avoid of I can). Are there different noise cancelling things I can do? 

I actually enjoy the job, the team and have an awesome manager, so would like to stay here long term. But it's been bad enough some days that I've looked for other jobs (yes, very dramatic over something so minor, I know).

Any advice or anyone that have been in similar situations?

I’ve been working at the company for four years, and have brought in the most value to my team’s results and can back it up. I’ve only had positive feedback with my colleagues. I applied for the director role, and came in #2, since my current manager was selected. After one month here is what she said:

1) coworkers don’t like working with me
2) I have a bad attitude
3) I am not committed to the team and company
4) I am missing deadlines
5) I have poor project management
6) I am not working full time (I did go to a doctor’s appt last week?)

1didrgs,I think I bombed my interview at my #1 firm.,"Background: 

I recently graduated undergrad from a top 5 B-school undergrad with a major in finance, minor in accounting, and hold dual certificates in risk management and wealth management.

I was on vacation for my friends bachelor party. The firm I have/had the best chance at getting an internship offer from emails me while I'm out of the states telling me to schedule a second-round interview. I took the best time possible for the situation. It was an 11 hour turn-around from when I landed in the states (1:00am) to the interview (12:00pm). 

Situation: 

During the interview, I was unprepared and didn't know what to expect, given the allotted time was 1:30 minutes. I had adequate time to review my notes from the previous interview, and had several (8 questions) preprepared. However, the interview was strictly for my interviewer to answer the questions I had. I engaged in civil and polite conversation, got to know him, but felt very unprepared given the quick turnaround I faced from being out of town. We concluded the interview cordially at the 45 minute mark. 

I feel as if I was unprepared and bombed it, but I do not know what to expect, given that I have rejected prior offers and am not going to regret that decision, because I will give everything I have and more as an intern for this company because they guarantee a full-time offer upon completion of the internship.

1diddco,Going back to school to be a Doctor? Not sure what to do in my career.,"I’m 27 and have a decent job making $52k as an Assistant Director in Wellness at a college. I’m not the happiest and really considering changing my career. I got my Masters in Exercise Science, and am considering going back to school for either a PhD or Physical Therapist. 

Physical therapy scares the shit out of me as I still need to take physics and the program I’m looking into is 100k. I currently have no school dept and I’m just not sure if 100k dept would be worth it.

My other thought is getting a PhD in Exercise Science etc and perhaps being a professor one day.

Are there any other programs you recommend? Anything close to physical therapy?

1dicq0n,How do I go about this situation?,"I have been working at my state's Department of Veterans Affairs agency as a constituent services coordinator for 7 months now as part of an Americorps program. We are not the Federal VA and only work with them to conduct wellness checks on veterans going through mental health crises and to assist veterans file claims through our VSO program.

I have noticed that the requests I am getting are becoming more and more complex and am struggling to manage them. A veteran will be calling about something menial such as where to file a claim, and eventually inform me on how they're months behind on mortgage payments, in need of financial assistance for their car, and are having issues with their property tax credit our state offers to vets. I try to help them as best I can but the questions they ask me at times are too niche for me to answer, leading them to doubt my services and referrals. I do not have any connections outside of what my host site provided me and with my state having 26 counties, creating partnerships with innumerable organizations for every issue is impossible. I do not think I do horribly but people reaching out to me in desperate need of help and I can do nothing but refer them to a number to call kind of sucks.

This position did not exist before me starting here and I have been unsure of how to create this role. I was told that I'd be the person doing the warm handoffs to other people/organizations who have the resources to help but as of right now, I see myself simply referring people to phone numbers to call for help. In addition to this, I do social media and outreach. I enjoy the social media aspect of my job the most because it does not require interacting with the general public and I can hone in on the posts. Outreach isn't too bad except when I attend events where the guests see me as a representative of the federal VA. My host site manager, director of outreach, is very busy. The bright spot of this is that they're offering me the position following the end of my program which would be amazing but I can only imagine it'll get more stressful from there.

Venting aside, what are some things I could do to make the intake of requests more manageable and what would be a good way to develop relationships with organizations to put my referrals in a position of receiving care quickly?",Heavybeingsalad301,2,1.0,0,1718668192,2024-06-17 23:49:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dicq0n/how_do_i_go_about_this_situation/,6,2024

1dibge4,Unappreciated at work by students and the rest of the college ,"I work as a financial aid advisor for a relatively small private college in the online department.  If you work in that industry you know that the changes the department of ed have made to the FAFSA have been a mixed bag (being generous with that).

Today feels like the straw that broke my back. Part of my responsibility is to get students cleared for the next semester. Each advisor has a portion of our student population to get ready each semester. At our weekly team check in it was communicated that we are very behind so I decided that I would come in early today to try and get things back on track. My students are mostly done so I figured I'd help my coworkers.

I know I don't jump into burning buildings or rescue kittens from trees but I work hard to try and make sure everyone is in good shape. All I got from students today was ""where my refund"" or ""send me my plan now"". Every other email I sent got a response that was full of attitude. 

Obviously the students couldn't and don't know that I'm taking on more than I should be and that would be fine...if my co workers didn't seem to have the same attitude. Fix this for me, review this report for my students, review my students today so I can focus on xyz thing. I don't need a pat on the back but I only got one ""thank you"" from any of them even as a courtesy.

I guess this is more of a rant but...what do I do with these feelings? Part of me wants to tell my manager that I'm feeling overworked and under valued, but then I feel like I'm whining. I don't even know how to broach my feelings about my students sometimes. It makes me feel guilty and weak to even be this frustrated at work.",Expensive_Manager211,1,1.0,0,1718664702,2024-06-17 22:51:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dibge4/unappreciated_at_work_by_students_and_the_rest_of/,6,2024
1diazzn,I’m nervous to leave my job because my coworkers depend on me tremendously,"I have been a rehab tech for a therapy department of 8 people at a skilled nursing facility for 3 years. My job is to scan and upload documents, obtain required signatures, verify and submit insurance, help with scheduling, order equipment, help the therapists when needed, and just about anything that my manager doesn’t feel like doing that I’m able to do. Overtime, a lot of responsibilities have been added to me. I market our services to independent living residents that live in a section that is part of the building. I call family members to get permission for therapy. I pretty much help the manager run the department

Here’s the kicker. I only make $13.50 when I am sometimes asked to make a decision that should fall on the manager. I did ask for a raise 4 months ago and even the regional manager wished me luck with that. I do have my Certified Nursing Assistant certification but that makes the therapists more inclined to come ask me to help with a patient. I run around and help the therapists, I run to get things people need, I take care of the regular duties I’m supposed to take care of. During the school semester when I have 15-17 credit hours, I still do the same things and have the same responsibilities so everything waits for me until I come in to work after my classes. Even the things the other workers can do without me, they still wait for me. When I’m off work and return, they all tell me how badly they needed me while I was gone. It feels nice sometimes, but I work way too hard and do too much for $13.50 in my opinion. They also tend to walk all over me in the heat of the moment 

Contradicting that last sentence, we are all pretty close with each other. We hang out outside of work sometimes as a group and we all have a great time. But they are all in their 50s except 2 of them (24 and 36), and I’m 27 and the relationships can be very mother-daughter ish which can be super uncomfortable. They WILL try to talk me out of leaving and try to tell me how bad of an idea it is. Especially my boss who is the worst of the unwanted advice. We share an office so the bad vibes are gonna be strong. They will 100% fall apart if I leave and it makes me feel terrible to do that to them. It makes me sick thinking of breaking the news that I am looking for another job because I truly care for them. But I know I need to be paid what I’m worth. 

TL;DR: Need more pay, this can only happen by finding a different job, and my coworkers who rely on me significantly will be devastated. Not sure how to go about this, I don’t want them to crumble without me and I’d love to keep these relationships",umaddybro,0,0.5,7,1718663455,2024-06-17 22:30:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1diazzn/im_nervous_to_leave_my_job_because_my_coworkers/,6,2024

Basically I will be a senior in high school this August and I don’t know what I’m going to do for my career. I personally really want to pursue music engineering/technology or music production. I have a passion for it and I know I would be spiritually satisfied with that. The only problem is that it doesn’t make money and most colleges that teach this are in California and are very expensive. I don’t come from a well off family, we are lower middle class. I don’t want to blow a list of money and student loans on something that won’t be able to pay it off in the future, it just doesn’t seem very smart to do that. But on the other hand I would pick something purely for money so I wouldn’t have to struggle in the future, but none of the jobs I’ve looked into seem like I would enjoy them. I have never been a very intelligent student. I have mediocre grades, they aren’t bad but they aren’t good enough to get scholarships. My dilemma is my future. I either pick something that will make me happy but ultimately I will struggle financially, or I pick a high paying career and have financial stability at the cost of my happiness.

1di9ryg,"How much do you value title and base salary, if total comp is relatively equal (long term impact)? ","All,

Im an early thirties male working in biopharma/biotech at a global conglomerate(100k plus employees). I recently interviewed and have an offer in hand from a much smaller biotech (1500 employees)  and am struggling with decision. While the salary is higher, there are nuances in the comp package that bring the overall value down (much worse 401k, unclear stock plan, risk with the move, etc). Details below. 


Current comp and company:

Salary: $160K
Bonus: %18 
LTI: Annual grant valued at ~$25k annually that vest over three years. 
401k: 11% match with immediate vesting (amazing I know) 

Competing offer 

Salary: $210k
Bonus: 12.5% ($26,250)
LTI: very unclear. Seems like it is available every year but is up to executive discretion and performance based. 
401k: 4% but takes 3 years to vest (huge difference) 

When I do all the math, I think I come out about $20k ish ahead at the new company. Nice money, sure, but not an amount I would make a decision on. What I’m trying to assess is the value of the title, which is two levels above where I’m at and scope of work would grow significantly. Im trying to focus on the long term and would appreciate any guidance! For reference, current role is manager and offer is senior director/lead.

1di8w0x,Career change: Architecture to IT,"Hi everyone!

I posted this in r/architecture but I also wanted to post here in case I get other advice:

I'm a young architect (just graduated with my M.Sc. in April) and I have found myself in a crossroads in terms of my career. 

I've been working full time at a very small family owned office for over a year where I've been able to gather experience in every possible area, from initial design plans to construction details, coordinating construction work to working with manufacturers and clients alike, interior design and competition projects, renovations and new construction, even legal documentation needed for building permits. I've even taken courses for rendering and BIM, that were provided by the office. 

The thing is that the workplace is a bit toxic and there isn't much room for growth in terms of promotions, the work I do now is the work I would do in the future. I was planning on moving cities and finding a new job but I have only been receiving rejections or no responses at all.

Recently a very big corporation (Autodesk) reached out to me regarding a job as a tech support specialist in the city I live in right now. I would be able to earn more and gain experience in IT and customer support. The company also has a lot of opportunities for growth, the person that held the position that is open now was promoted to another position. This is also a chance to work in a huge company, with a hybrid of in-office and home-office, which is my personal preference. I'm about to have my final interviews and will see if I receive a job offer. This position is specifically for Revit which I have experience in. 

I'm at a loss because of many points. While my current job has its downsides it's a stable job and I do gain solid architecture experience. However I do see value in a higher salary and a more healthy working environment.

I wanted to ask if anyone has had similar experience and what the outcome was, and if experience in Autodesk could be helpful for finding more work as an architect in the future. I am wary of taking the jump and regretting it. I love being an architect however I am open to trying new things. If I don't get the job offer I will continue trying to find other jobs in other cities, I just want to make sure I make an informed choice when the time comes and if a job offer is actually given.

Thank you!

Ps. I have overall more than three years of work experience in architecture firms as is. Hence why I am considering this slight career change to widen my horizons.",juju_pendragon,0,0.5,0,1718658079,2024-06-17 21:01:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1di8w0x/career_change_architecture_to_it/,6,2024
1di8gbq,What can i do for my career (im stuck),"Hello, I apologize to everyone for what might be a bit of a long post. But somehow I need to share this with people and I need help on how to proceed. Because I have no other friends outside of work life to share this with.

First of all, I am a 26 year old computer engineer in a small company with two offices in Turkey. I have been working here for about 3 years. After an internship period of about 6-7 months, I was offered a job and I am continuing.

First, I need to talk about my internship period, I think this is a key part of what I will tell, I had to complete internships in order to graduate, and I was interviewing with every place I could find. Most of them were negative, etc. It was a difficult process. Finally, the administrative manager of the company I am currently working for reached me and asked me directly about my salary expectation. I told him that I was not looking for a job yet and that I had to do my internship first.

They told me that we could have a face-to-face interview and called me to their main office. Only the boss and the administrative manager were working in this office, while the technical staff were in the other office. They told me that the technical staff were working in the other office and that only the management was in this office, and I told them that would not be a problem. I was a bit nervous when I went, because I am a shy person, but I think they liked me and the boss said that I could work with them in the office.

So it was agreed and my internship period started, I was only with the bosses while the other technical staff were in the other office and this made me quite nervous. But since I had a passion for this profession since childhood, I didn't mind, I tried to do whatever I was given.

Then the company said that they didn't employ technical staff in the main office, that this was the first time with me and they were happy with it, so we moved to the new office. After that, they hired a lot of people and a lot of people left. In the beginning I always felt like I was getting special treatment, I was with the boss, the others were on their own, etc. I was always afraid from the beginning, that people would think badly of me.

But the fact that I was the first technical employee in the main office and the boss started to look at me with a master-apprentice relationship was something I didn't expect, that is, from the very beginning (the internship period), the boss wanted to train me, he expected me to bring me to a certain place and do his own work and to help others.

This expectation existed all the time, a lot of new people came to the company, each of them told me to support them, that they wanted to make me a team leader in the future, etc. But I didn't want any of that. But I didn't want any of that, because I am an anxious and asocial person who has problems with himself, who has communication problems. 


I thought I should solve these problems first, but I was always under an expectation. Anyway, these discourses have decreased recently. Since we were working as system administrators, there were situations where someone had to take care of emergencies etc. And with the emptiness of breaking up with my girlfriend, I started to take more responsibility than my limit, I came in the evenings, I worked, I went to bed late at night, I worked, I worked on weekends. This caused indifference in people and created comfort in people, thinking that I would take care of it anyway.

And unfortunately the boss got used to this situation and started to have such high expectations of me. They asked me to follow new people, to help them, to be a big brother, etc., when my workload was high enough, when I couldn't keep track of my own time properly and I was voicing this. But no one asked me if I wanted such a responsibility or if I could do it.


My working life is constantly going through such expectations, untimely demands, expecting more than I can do, etc. I felt that I was tired. My boss is a workaholic and a philosophy lecturer, for example, when I was resting in the evening and he suddenly worked (you can see this in the job tracking system), I started to feel inadequate, and I gained an unnecessary psychology that if he is working, I have to work too. Because I felt like I had to be responsible, if someone forgot something, I would complete it, if there was something that needed to be done but wasn't done, I would try to do it, because I enjoyed it and I was in a vacuum, but I think this was a little misunderstood. On top of that, I started to fear what my coworkers thought of me.

From time to time, when I complained about the intensity, I was told to work extra shifts, go home late, etc., but when I look at the situation in general, I have never had such expectations from other people and I have never seen such demands for other people. Statistically, I am by far ahead in terms of efficiency with graphs, but still, such expectations, such discourses have become very tiring lately.


As for the office environment, there is a generally comfortable environment, the boss and I go to concerts from time to time as a company, we take trips, we drink alcohol at lunchtime, etc., but I feel as if he feels entitled to us for doing these things.

The strange thing is that I love this job and profession, I just didn't know what to do in this situation when I should be so focused on myself. It has evolved into a situation where I put myself in and people get used to it and exploit it. I don't know if I can do it in another company because I am a very anxious, very stressed person. At least I wanted to ask what I can do, at least I spilled my guts.

1di85qn,Considering leaving my job if I'm not promoted. Is this stupid?,"A new position opened at my company, one that I know I am more than qualified for. Would I be stupid for leaving if I dont get the job? Also any general advice on the situation would  be appreciated. I'm just very upset and conflicted.

I've been with my current company for about a year now, initially hired as an administrative assistant. Since then, I've taken on a ton of responsibilities that go well beyond what's typical for an assistant.

For example, I manage a fleet of vehicles across all our locations, handle employee insurance benefits and vendor relations, and I've even become the go-to person for creating essential Excel tools used by the team. On top of that, I'm a part of the billing process, and the poc/decision-maker for various services we use. That's just to name a few, but yeah I don't feel like just an assistant. 

When I first joined, I was promised growth opportunities, and I recently bought this up to my supervisor. She mentioned I could one day become executive assistant.. but I don't want to be an assistant at all. 

A few months ago, the same position I'm applying for opened up (the department is expanding so they're hiring multiple candidates,) and I wasn't even aware of the opening. It feels like a missed opportunity and a bit of a slap in the face. Especially because they hired someone (not from the company) who was a receptionist and had no relevant experience in the field 

I'm planning to email my boss with a cover letter and updated resume outlining everything I've been doing and expressing my interest in the role. But I'm also considering if it's worth staying if they don't consider me seriously for this position. Am I being foolish to consider leaving a stable job over this?

Any advice on how I should approach this situation?

I live with roommates and do not have family (dad is homeless in another state). I am now working in automotive, changing oils and stuff because I desperately needed to leave kitchens. The hours were long and wearing on me, longest shift I worked was from 9 am to 2 am. I just can’t do it anymore. Automotive is easier than kitchens in some ways, but it’s 110 degrees where I live and I go home miserable and exhausted. I want an office job and I want to be normal.

I don’t know what I can even do with my degree when I graduate, as I apply for jobs nonstop that aren’t kitchen related and mark that I already have my degree to see if they will get back to me and they won’t.

1di79zq,Should I go back to my first career path?,"I’m a 32 yo (m). Initially, I studied international business and logistics. My career began in shipping and receiving, which I found extremely boring. Fortunately, I later landed a consultant/sales role in a niche industry, where I spent nearly four years. While the job was relaxed, I didn’t acquire relevant skills, and I my personality wasn't the greatest to be a good salesman.
The company had a reputation for long employee tenures (some exceeding 15 years). However, I questioned whether I wanted to follow that path. I enrolled part-time in a two-year IT and computer program at a community college. The learning aspect excited me.
Fast forward to today: I’ve been working in IT as a helpdesk technician for about a year and a half. However, doubts have resurfaced. Perhaps IT isn’t the right fit for me, and part of it could be my current employer. Many techs at the company feel undervalued and underpaid. I wonder if a different company might offer a better experience. The pros of the job is that I do learn new things and I work fully remotely.


Every morning, I wake up with zero motivation, longing for the day to end. School resumes in August, and I’m torn about completing my associate’s degree. I’m even considering returning to logistics or business-related roles, but my scattered resume complicates matters as I feel I have committed career suicide already.

What would be the best way to ""restart"" my career back to business/logistics?

1di6rk9,Internship Wanting Me to Work More,"Hello!

I just recently started at a new design job working as an intern. There have been a few red flags recently as I just started last week but today is the biggest that has happened. I am currently in a summer class that is from 9 am to 12 pm Monday thru Thursday and it is important to getting my degree and leveling my designs up. When I first got hired I thought I would have open availability to come after class but I just found out I will need to do something for the class on Mondays and Wednesdays and I wont be able to work those days. I let my manager know and she is saying she is very shocked and disappointed and that my schedule is not ideal now.

I understand why they're upset but I genuinely had no idea my schedule would change like that and I can't do much about it.

She is expecting me to work Monday through Friday every week while in school and with my other job on the weekends. She is being very pushy about ""finding another option to be able to work Monday and Wednesday"" and it has really freaked me out. I feel like she is going to fire me.

Is she being unreasonable or should I try to work those days? I am a senior and I just don't want to burn out and have my designs suffer. Plus, it seems like she is trying to train me to manage the store by myself and I am not really comfortable with doing that as that was not the expectations she gave me when she hired me.

1di6kt5,Messing with my schedule,"For context I work in illinois and part time so that I can complete my college classes.

The schedule for the week starts on a Thursday and ends on Wednesday, they schedule me to work from Friday to Monday. I belive this is the normal shift pattern that they shove down all of their new employees throats.

This creates a 3 day time period where I don't come in and the schedule is not posted because the schedule only comes out halfway through the first day every week, Thrusday.

I belive they set this up this way so that if they have a new hire who is not to their liking they can change the schedule for just Thursday so that if said employees they don't like does not come in on Thursday, they can put them down on the schedule as having to work that day, then the employee is hit with a no call no show. And if the employee does show up that day then they can just shift the schedule so that they are not supposed to be working that day, and they only find out halfway through their shift.

I’ve been in college for 4 years now, and I have one semester left. For 3 1/2 of those years I had the idea of being a history teacher, so most of my classes were history classes or something related. Well, last semester I realized that I dont want to deal with high school students and decided to change my degree to University Studies, as it was the quickest way to get out of college for me. I’ve always half-assed my way through college, and definitely spent more time hanging out with people, going to the bar, etc, instead of focusing on my actual career. 

Ever since I changed my degree I have been on the lookout for other jobs yet haven’t really decided. I’m looking mainly for something in the business side. I’ve been offered an internship to become a data analyst, but I don’t really want to sit at a computer all day. Perhaps something kinda hybrid would be better. Whatever.

1di4jme,How do I help my husband with career path disappointment despite his great job?,"My husband has a wonderful job. He works for a prestigious company with great benefits and great pay. He works from home full-time and is going to be able to be a very involved dad when our baby is born in a couple months. The problem is that his job is not even remotely close to what he wanted to do with his life.

He always dreamed of being in law enforcement. It doesn't help that his dad and brother both have served either in the military or as police. He has this incredible spirit of justice and helping people, but he hasn't been able to break into the field. He hasn't been able to get past the lie detector interviews despite being the walking embodiment of integrity.

I've helped him how I can. I help him study for the entrance tests and practice interviews. I encourage him to try different avenues but it just isn't happening. It's been years of attempts and rejection. Years of grief and mourning a dream that will maybe never be.

I want to get to a point where I make more than him so he can have to space to pursue his goals. I know a part of him wants this too. I currently work full time in an industry that I enjoy but I make a little over half of what he makes. I'm trying to progress in my career to take the pressure off of him a little but I'm getting no where. At this point, I need luck and a masters degree to have a hope of growing. With a baby on the way, I'm going to have to wait a bit for that.

By social standards, our life is spectacular. I'm so grateful that we have a beautiful home, marriage, and future. It's just all built on the foundation of our hard work and my husband's incredible sense of duty to his family first.

1di424l,Am I being strung along and given bs reasons for not being promoted? 26F,"Background: I started in my current company October of 2021 as an entry-level sourcing coordinator. I then got promoted and moved to Germany in June of 2023 as a senior sourcing specialist. I’m the only one with my role who is currently overseeing all of our current and future customers in Europe. According to my boss and all of my coworkers, I am doing a great job. I always turn in projects on time, go above and beyond, am well-liked by the team, and am even currently working on implementing a software to help improve European sourcing.

Current situation: I have been in this role for a year now, and because we’re getting so much business we’re looking for one more sourcing person. I asked my boss if this one person could report to me since I wanted to be developed into management and eventually get more direct reports, and this person would come to me for everything anyway, and his exact words were as follows:

“There is a company policy that every people manager needs to have at least 4 direct reports. I think it’s because there were studies and reasons like if a team is too small people tend to not go to the manager as much. However, I want to be honest here that I would not recommend even if there would be no rule in place as I think it is too early for you. You need to find your place in the team, feeling comfortable and confident. As well as I think you need to complete your development plans like Greenbelt or improve your German skills. I like that you are ambitious and as I said I will support, but let’s work on it step by step. I will not forget about it, I promise. There is no need to rush things I think.”

During all these years, I never had a single scandal, I was very respected, in addition to my work, I also mentored new colleagues. Unfortunately, three months ago, I was offered a job at the company where my other colleagues worked. I didn't want to leave, but I was forced to by my family (the job was completely remote, one of my family members was moving abroad, so I had to agree). Also, at that time, many valuable employees left the company or moved to other positions, so I was overworking. In addition, I was finishing my studies at the university, so I was full of emotions.

In short, the new company didn't suit me: a boring project, arrogant colleagues, a mentor who called me insecure and forced me to overcome my habit of pleasing people by getting into conflict, constant criticism from colleagues, and a passive-aggressive CEO.

Three weeks ago, I tried to return to my old job, called HR and agreed with her that I would return to my team. But then the nightmare began: my colleagues from my new job started calling me, saying that I was taking a big step backwards in terms of my career, and I broke down after four hours of persuasion and intimidation from HR, a mentor, and a manager. I was promised that I would be treated much better, but this Friday, an unfortunate situation happened again. And also I couldn’t cope in WFH, so I can't sleep at night, wake up with terrible anxiety and take antidepressants.

When I cancelled my return to my old job, I thought it was over. After I found out that my position was taken by two people, I cried that I had given up under the influence of other people. But that day, two weeks ago, HR and my old manager called and said that they were still waiting for me, but not for long. So there is still a chance.

I’m looking for ideas to improve my work situation. The combination of a long commute (~50 miles) and doing nothing all day is becoming more & more mentally taxing for me. I’m looking for ways in which I can improve my in-office desk-job experience. 

For context, I’m an associate analyst for a small company where I have a hybrid schedule. No personal tech is allowed.

My issue is that the days in office begin to feel like cubicle hell. I’ve raised concerns before about my dissatisfaction with the working environment and I was fortunate to be placed into an office, which has been better since there are windows. The only downside is that the office is located right next to the boss, who is an old school micromanaging type. 

The average day can look like me doing tasks in the morning that can take me ~20 minutes, and I’m free for the rest of the day. In this time, I’ve grown more restless than anything. I hate being stuck in the office when there’s nothing for me to do, especially when we’re expected to be “working” but there’s no actual work for me to do. I hate having to look busy where I could’ve just worked remotely and give myself some autonomy.

I had two panic attacks, one during training and the other while I was working on the floor. It’s a little less nerve racking now. 

I am thinking about quitting. I think the job has the potential to be fun but the owner is a piece of shit and is constantly yelling and micromanaging us when we work with him.

TL;DR 
I'm too disabled to hold down a job but not disabled enough to not work and I don't know what to do

So, bit of a long one but I did a completely useless degree (photography - the last thing I want to do is free lance or event photography) and I need a sustainable job. Out of uni I got a part time job in retail while I lived with my dad. It's been a few years now and I've moved out, had multiple different full-time  jobs in call centres and as an admin and over the years my disabilities have gotten much worse, I'm trying to get help for it but it's extremely difficult when you work in an office with the same working hours as the doctors. I keep losing my jobs from being too slow, not good enough or being too ill. It has completely destroyed me being fired from 5 jobs in the span of 6 months. (That sounds literally completely fucking insane typing it out). 
I physically can't go back to my dad's place. It's a hoarder house , and has been ever since I remember. I'm pretty sure growing up with all of the mould, dirt and dust has exacerbated my mental and physical conditions growing up. I've tried fixing the house, but I'm so ill I can't do it. I had to move out to save my sanity and health. I'm so embarrassed of a lot in my life and I'm only 24. 

I don't know what to do, I just want a full time job that doesn't make me so unbearably anxious and can pay the bills. 

I've considered going back to college and do something that will get me a job I like, but I have no way of paying for bills 

I've tried getting a sick note but there's no guarantee that benefits will cover bills

I've considered going part time but again, no guarantee benefits will help with bills. 

I've considered just fucking ending it but I have people in my life that don't want me to do that 

I've considered going back to retail but what if the same thing just happens again? I'm too slow or too ill to do what they need.

I've thought about going back to therapy but that's not something you can do in a full time job. 

I've thought about opening my own shop for things I like and hire some friends to help, but I don't even know where I would start with that

I didn’t understand what this career entailed when I was in college. I’m now looking to make a career change, but I’m not sure what my options are. I’ve taken career aptitude tests, and they never feel effective. I’m open to going back to school down the road. In the short term I would like to use my current degree to get out of a hospital soon.

I was in the same city for college for only 3-4 months a couple years ago and really suffered mentally.

So I thought I could do it, but reality is hitting me and now I don’t think I can. To make it worse, I’ve been unemployed due to a layoff for just under a year now and feel like it’d be a HUGE mistake if I didn’t go. 

What are the odds of negotiating for fully remote work if 60% of the job is already remote?

Theres a questionnaire I'm filling out at the minute. One of the questions asks if I've ever been dismissed from a job for misconduct and another asking if I've been involved in any investigations.

Last year I was fired from an activity centre for getting high off of someones THC vape pen whilst off duty. I was under investigation and dismissed.

Since then I have volunteered abroad as a teaching assistant and sport coach, I am now currently working as an activity instructor at a different centre. In the application I didn't put my previous role for a reference. 

I've learnt my lesson and will not make the same mistake again. I've discussed with my mum in what to do. She suggested lying and not telling them about my dismissal.

I'm 23 years old with my associates in liberal arts. College was difficult for me at 19-22. I fought tooth and nail against my own self (don't we all) just to get the degree I have. I want to go to university in the fall, and I need to crack down on my major and ultimately my career.
I'm considering changing to an IT or cybersecurity major, as the job prospects/upward mobility/wfh positions are appealing to me. 
I love kids and I'm currently a nanny to pay the bills, and I considered pursuing an early education major and pretty much have an assured job out of school. However, I've substituted a lot, and I'm not sure the school environment is a good fit for me, especially every day. 
While I do believe I am intellectually capable of getting most degrees available to me, I want to avoid as much math as I can. 
I wouldn't say I'm a type A personality, but I still am internally motivated and I want to have a fruitful life. I want to be able to get married within the next 4-6 years and start a family soon(ish). I would love to WFH but even a hybrid situation would be amazing.

1dhykde,7 months without a manager.....,"Hello all,

Just wanted to reach out for some advice from this community as I'm struggling with who to reach out to regarding some things going on in my career.  

 To start it off, I work in a fairly large company in a technical environment and have been here for \~10 years and in that time, have been promoted \~3 years.  I have always been a go getter in a professional environment, out earned my colleagues and have been on a decent if not highly upward trajectory but that is OK.  I'm in a mid/high level position in the hierarchy, not management but technical engineering track.  The flexibility is decent and I'm able accommodate my kids schedules and have semi-decent work life balance.  

Where I am struggling is the company has been going through some internal reorganization for the past 9 months and has some new executive management making some big changes.  During that change, my manager was let go, the reason being he was remote working (as agreed by the company) and during the executive shake-up, the new leadership changed the policy and my manager couldn't move and therefore was let go.  After that, my group did get an ""acting"" manager, however, the technical portions were handled by another colleague and I.   Another piece of the puzzle, this company has offered buyouts and said acting manager will retire at the end of the year, so he does not have much incentive to aggressively take charge.  As the other colleague I mentioned recently left the company, most of the management has fallen on my shoulders despite my objections but so far nothing has been done to rectify the situation.  

Here is the dilemma - Unfortunately, I went through a divorce a couple years back and I do split time equally for my two young kids (part of my objections when I was pushed to take on ""a more active management role"").  I don't have the drive at this time to take on more work and I'm very happy doing the technical engineering work and having the nice work/life balance.  After this shake-up, I'm now ""managing"" 8 reports and driving a project of high visibility but not seeing any upside with the current setup.  It's now almost 7 months without a real manager and it seems light no light at the end of the tunnel.  My stress is through the roof and any attempt to try and push or balance things out is met by ""our hands our tied, we can't allocate more manpower or hire a manager yet"".  The worst part are some of the reports are starting to push boundaries and since the ""acting manager"" isn't really coming down on anyone, I'm basically a sheriff with no means of keeping order in check.  

I'm really at a loss on how to make light of the situation and improve the current working situation.  I feel very taken advantage of and even though generally the company has been great to me, it's not a situation that is sustainable for me long term.  Any advice is great.  I know proactive solutions to upper management are much more acceptable than just whining to superiors.  I have documented everything, had professional meetings with solutions and I still can't get any good resolutions so I'm at a loss.

I am writing as I would appreciate your suggestions based on your experience.

I am graduating shortly from a Business MSc from a Dutch university. I have been living in the country for nearly 4 years and I have also completed my BSc in Marketing. Next to my studies, I am working for a Dutch company in the Business field but no prospects of full-time job offer. This really demotivated me and started making me question whether it is time to move to another country. I have the possibility to extend my student job until the end of the year, however, I have no housing and with a student contract, while also being a recent graduate, it is almost impossible to find housing. I have looked for studios, shared apartments with friends, but we have not received a single offer so far.

On the side, I have been apply to jobs, but the market is quite though for Juniors and especially in Business, without speaking Dutch. I have been apply for over 3 months, without success. I also looked for Marketing, Innovation, Technology positions.

A couple of weeks back, I received an internship offer from a Spanish company and they would cover accommodation, however it is then not paid and I would have to remain a student until the end of the year. There is also no clear perspective of a full-time offer afterwards.

I am really unsure about the next steps as both opportunities seem to have pros and cons. What would you advise? Thank you.",No_Money9863,2,1.0,2,1718624381,2024-06-17 11:39:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dhvz2l/really_confused_advice/,6,2024

I have a passion for History and experience as a substitute teacher it's a decent job and I enjoy the flexibility and family-life/work-life balance. However, I keep being drawn to computer science because of the potentional better paying job opportunties and growth and it may also have a decent work/life balance. Computer science is a bit more difficult for me, I've struggled trying to teach myself to code but I've been told try learning in a classroom setting from an instructor and keep at it and I will eventually get it. I'm not crazy about computer science as I am with say history and philosophy but I do still find it intriguing. I figured I could get up to making 100K as a senior in  future if I become good at my job and ai have children so a high salary would be beneficial for my family.

1dhqod8,Switching from pure math phd to industry friendly career,"I'm 25 and in my third year of a pure math phd. I recently realized that this career path is unsustainable. The biggest problem is my CV has mostly academia related experience and just will not look good in normal job applications. Even without the CV problem, I would still have to study and prep to demonstrate technical knowledge for interviews (and to know how to do thr bssics for said job).

*Note: Math phds are almost always funded so I am on a TAship and technically have a job. I am not paying for courses.

*Note: I have not done a lot of math that translates easily to other career paths (ex. statistics because it was irrelevant to my focus area) but I know I can brush up on or learn it. Nor have I studied things like physics and chemistry to be able to easily transfer to engineering or adjascent fields.

I could do a couple of things:

1. Master out with a pure math degree and focus on getting jobs/internships straight away while studying for the relevant topics myself online (Say coursera or just reading up on books and doing programming projects, etc.)

2. Stay in my program a bit longer and take courses in other adjacent fields while looking for internships/jobs. Once I find a job, then master out.

3. Transfer to a new department for a phd/masters and focusing on internship/job search. I might even stay for the whole phd if I manage to do this and can find a good advisor (with the intention of getting a job in industry eventually). This will give me opportunities to participate in intermships and use the resources of the university to better my CV in the long run vs trying to blindly apply to jobs on my own with online certificates.

I would prefer option 3 but I want to learn more about other careers first and how feasable it is for someone in my situation to switch. I will post this in some of the subreddits for the topics I am interested in, but meanwhile, I thought might as well post here.

Some of the careers I was thinking of switching to are:
- Finance
- Economics
- Civil Engineering
- Data science (But I really hated working on machine learning and Im guessing majority of work is going to be ML/AI, so I don't know about this one)
- Software Engineering (but the market is saturated)
- Some sort of public policy direction (though unsure of what is the best way to get there, would economics, or finance, or civil engineering help?)

My current skills:
- Great analytic skills
- Have programming skills and have taken courses back in undergrad including a data science course (Though I would have to brush up on the languages/software that job descriptions require once I decide on a direction)
- Great writing skills (Have a paper published and constantly write documentation)
- Good communicator and presenter
- Have experience in initiating and organizing projects

If you guys have any directions, I'm all ears!",Mindless-Process-497,1,1.0,1,1718602293,2024-06-17 05:31:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dhqod8/switching_from_pure_math_phd_to_industry_friendly/,6,2024
1dhoxwk,My employer is back charging my paycheck because of a new policy.,"A new policy was ""created"" at the beginning of this moth (June) that states if a pest control technician is not on a property preforming a service for at least 20 min and the customer decides not to pay the bill for any reason, the technician will be back charged the full price of the service, (not the commission we make off of the service).

The reason I say ""created"" is because there was no official meeting held about this change of policy, nothing was signed by us stating we agreed to this change. I wasn't told this change of policy from management. I was told by a co worker.

So on top of not being told officially that this major change is taking place. I am being back charged for a service that I had preformed back in February. Way before this policy was created at the beginning of June.

The customer was able to be contacted via a brother who only speaks Spanish and told our company that the customer in question is in the hospital. So i would assume this is the main reason why they cannot pay the pest control bill. It has nothing to do with the quality of the service i provided or me being on the property for at least 20 min.

This is the first case of this happening at my company and i believe this will happen to every other pest technician that works with me. We all deal with high balance accounts each month, at least 1-5 accounts a month will not pay the bill and most of the time it doesn't have something to do with the quality of the service. We get high balances for a variety of reasons. Financial, moving house, death of the homeowner.

In this case it seems like the homeowner was hospitalized and that is the main reason the bill is not being paid. Everyone whom I've asked about this says this sounds illegal. What do you guys think?

For right now I am being back charged $50 for a pest service my company is charging the customer $120. I myself only make 19% off of that service. They state next time this happens it will be for the full price of the service in question.",iamthehorseshit67,27,0.9700000286102295,18,1718595784,2024-06-17 03:43:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dhoxwk/my_employer_is_back_charging_my_paycheck_because/,6,2024

1dhogc3,What can a job as a production/assembly operator lead to? ,"What can a job as a production/assembly operator lead to?

I’m a 23M and I recently got a job as a repair technician for an aerospace manufacturing company about 2 months ago and to be honest I am not to fond of it. Right now, I do basic testing and evaluation of customer returns and generate repair reports for the product which usually just involves replacing some components. 

I’m more interested in doing the actual repair and assembly of the product. My job sometimes has to do some basic disassembly and that’s when I enjoy my job the most, but it’s not common for me to do so. 

At my work place the repairs and assembly are usually done in the production/assembly department, so I thought about transferring to that department once I hit my 6-8 months at my current position. 

It’s probably weird for a technician to transfer to a lower level job but perhaps after I transfer I can always go to manufacturing engineering or be a lead or go into management after a couple years for a higher salary. 

What do you guys think?

1dhnxal,Quitting Early (Possibly?),"So I've worked at this company for over a year as an assistant teacher working full time hours (8:45 am-5:45pm). I have a very hands-on work ethic in the classroom and I have gone above and beyond my pay grade to satisfy the needs of the children that I work with. I have done lessons with them, gotten to know all of their families, have built a bond with the families and the kids, etc. I'm basically a second lead teacher in the room. 

Well, sometime in I think mid to late May, I put in my notice and my director seemed fine with it. I set my end date for July 31st which is about halfway through the summer camp that my company has. However, just the other day she came in and told me and my lead teacher that we were going to be separated and she was going to make me a floater for the rest of the time that I am employed at the company in order to give consistency to the kids. There are contradictions in her statement about that, but I digress because that's too long of a story.

 I feel very heartbroken that I'm going to lose the kids that I looked after even before my lead teacher started working with me. I feel even more heartbroken that I am going to be a floater (I jump from room to room doing whatever they ask and want of me, not having any say in the classroom/treatment of the kids/personal relationship with the families or anything). I'm not passionate about this type of work at all and this is not the type of work I signed up to do. I initially applied and got hired to be a full time assistant teacher and now I'm a floater? That's crazy to me. I wanted to ask my director if I would be expected to do my full time hours as a floater or if I could reduce my hours because all floaters are part-time and even get out way earlier (I'm talking like 3pm which would be amazing). However, my mom also told me that if she is to say no, to take my planned week PTO that I've had set for months, and then come back and tell her that I have to move my end date up to the end of whatever that week is.

So, my question is, what would be the most professional way to do that? Or how should I approach this in general? I don't want to mess up my prospects of a reference later down the line, so I want to approach this professionally, but also stick to my boundaries as much as possible. Please help (and be nice even if I sound stupid in this). 

TLDR; My employer downgraded my job position as a result of me putting in my notice. I'm not happy with said position or responsibilities in that position and now I want either reduced hours or I want to move up my end date. How do I do it professionally without losing a reference?

1dhmfjz,Quitting a job after 2 weeks,"Started a job 2 weeks ago. First of all, the commute is a problem. I have to be at work for 8am and I don’t have a car, so I’ve been Uber’ing which costs $18 each way, and at the end of the day I’ll take an Uber to the bus which is about half the cost of the morning. It’s damaging my bank account as you can imagine. I can sign up for a car share next month however when I get my license renewed.

On top of that, I’ve had 2 embarrassing ‘incidents’, don’t really want to go into detail, but I can. Which has caused the GM to want me fired. The owners however want to keep me on and give me a shot. The GM has been gossiping about me though to other employees who he’s friends with and it’s a small team and office, so in general it’s just not a healthy environment for me. Also my coworkers planned a lunch outting in front of me last Friday and didn’t invite me which I find to be straight up rude considering I just started there. As well, I don’t think I’m going to love the job. And really, the chances of them finding something to fire me for since they’re now looking for it seems to be likely. 

I could certainly use the paycheque but I’m not sure it’s worth it. I can feel all the gossip and the commute really sucks and my mental health has been wrecked the past 2 weeks. So… I am trying to decide if I go in tomorrow. Considering I can’t even afford the Uber there I should probably just write a resignation email.

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.

1dhl833,How do you land a think tank job when you have the connections but no open roles?,"Hi all,

So a little context here, I applied for a role in this small think tank about a month ago now, and the role's closing date for applications was on the 25th of May, around three weeks ago as of this post's time stamp.

Time has moved on and I have not heard a single word back from this think tank, which I took as a quiet rejection. However, I'm lucky to have the opportunity to have a one-on-one coffee chat with someone who works at the department I applied for, who also happened to have graduated from my university recently.

This think tank is rather peculiar in the way it advertises its openings. They promote their vacancies in tucked-away corners, not using more conventional platforms such as Linkedin or Handshake. However, they like to sneak in a new vacancy on their website, so I figured that having an insider in my network could help land me a referral to the company.

As the think tank industry relies heavily on networks, is this an opportunity worth tapping into? What might be a better approach for a graduating student with little applied research/no think tank experiences, if not for connections but still no openings then?",mehnameisash,1,1.0,0,1718583329,2024-06-17 00:15:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dhl833/how_do_you_land_a_think_tank_job_when_you_have/,6,2024
1dhl4zp,Need advice dealing with my manager,"I am a new mid-level leader at a tech company that grew very quickly. I've been with the company for less than two years and I've been in my role for half a year now. My boss joined the company at its early stages and has been with the company for a long time. My boss has switched between quite a few roles within the company, and their new role is something they haven't been doing for too long. 

In terms of the job opportunity itself, I love that I'm in a position to transform multiple areas in the company. The company's executive leaders also have me included in conversations where we can drive transformational change for the company. I would like to grow with the company to lead this transformational change.

However, I struggle reporting to my boss. We get along well, but I noticed very soon in my current role that my boss' lack of direction has been directly responsible for a large part of the challenges that exist with scaling/maturing my org. Some people have also openly shared in confidence with me that my boss ""just doesn't get it"", and unfortunately, I actually agree with this statement. While I've tried to make changes that were within my control, it has been challenging to get my boss' support to drive the changes needed. Two leaders who reported to her previously have left the company because they ran out of patience with my boss' inaction and lack of direction. There are days where I feel like leaving, because of how my boss operates. They're a good person, but empathy is about the only thing I appreciate in my boss.

1dhkgse,I Need a Change - Brainstorming My Next Career,"Hello all of you beautiful people.

**In Summary**: I have job that has no future and am looking for advice on a career path. I have a lot of free time to get any qualifications/certifications needed In whatever field I decide but I don't have a lot of disposable income.

**Current Situation**: I've been working in a warehouse as an operations manager for 6 years now. It's a unique position where I choose the hours I go in and out as long as I always get done what I need to I'm able to go home fairly early and I haven't set an alarm for a long time. It pays alright for where I live in South Carolina at just barely over $60k a year but the job has absolutely 0 opportunity for advancement.  
I know that even if I worked at this company another 6 years I would be doing the exact same thing and making barely more than I do now. On top of that I will have paid off no debt other than the minimum payments along with setting aside nearly nothing for retirement. The freedom this job provides is pretty much the only good thing about it as it offers 0 other benefits.

**Background & Experience:** I never finished college as I couldn't afford it anymore. Being an operations manager is pretty much the only experience I have in my adult life other than a year of landscaping and 6 months in fast food. My current job does involves a lot of customer service  so I do have experience in that aspect and actually do consider myself to be fairly good at customer service and building/maintaining relationships. 

**What I'm Looking For:** Every year starts with high hopes that this year will be different than the last and then I end the year just as disappointed in not accomplishing anything. I want to finally make a change and utilize the free time I have in this job to get some kind of certification or license to move into a new career so I'm looking for suggestions and advice, which any is appreciated!

  
**Options & Interests:** 

* I enjoy finance and I actually wanted to get an accounting degree but I owe the college I was attending some money before they will let me go back and finish my degree.
* I did do door to door sales for roofing for a couple months and while I was actually really good at building relationships and making sales I was not good at the actual roofing component of the job and most of the contracts I signed didn't get approved by insurance...
* I have a family member who has been extremely successful in IT and has offered to coach me and can help me get an entry level job once passing some of my certifications but that would involve a pay cut to start.
* I have another family member who runs a business managing amazon delivery drivers and she has also offered to tutor me in their program so that I could open my own business doing the same. The job would wind up paying very well after the training but would involve a substantial pay cut for about 2 years.
* I am very open to suggestions. I don't have a particular field i've always dreamt about going into. I grew up thinking I'd become an actor and that's not happening. Very excited to hear any and all suggestions!

 Thank you all for taking the time to read this post and sorry it's so lengthy.

I am 18 and looking for a job alongside my finance school. This lack of skills in communication has been making things difficult.

1dhj7x1,Need Advice on an Excuse for Leaving Work Early,"My job moved me to a new state a few months ago. I was offered a raise and made the jump.

Unfortunately, this state has incredibly high income tax rates. So with my raise, my take home pay actually went down. 

In addition, rent, gas and groceries are all also more expensive. I was not financially prepared for my bills to go up ($800/mo roughly) that significantly and continue making the same pay. 

That being said, raises are strictly given out annually and are all approved by the company President. These just happened and I’m not going to have leverage to get another one. 

I need a second job.

I found one with low enough hours it won’t affect my sleep or overlap with my current job. BUT I need to take off early 3 days in a row for onboarding. 

What is a realistic excuse to use for leaving 3 days early, 3 days in a row? I never take PTO and have plenty of it to spare. If I tell them I am looking to supplement my income I think it would negatively affect me.

1dhgp3v,Advice Needed: Should I take this employment opportunity?,"Hey everyone,

A little about myself: I am married with kids in my mid-thirties. I currently reside in North Carolina and work for a large construction company that’s ranked in the top 10 in the industry. I am currently an Estimating Manager for them, and they have communicated that they are very happy with me. There is a lot of opportunity for growth. We relocated here from Arizona and have been with my current employer for three years.

I interviewed with multiple companies prior to relocating, and one was a smaller company in Colorado. The owner has kept in touch with me over the last couple of years, and we have honestly created a friendship. He recently approached me and asked me to join his company as his Vice President. He is offering equity over the first couple of years and then a buyout agreement because he is in his late fifties and doesn’t want to work 10+ more years. He doesn’t have any kids to hand the company down to and doesn’t feel that his current employees have the capacity to run the company.

They perform approximately $30 million per year, so it is small compared to my current employer. With it being a smaller company, there are struggles. The problems mainly stem from nonexistent SOPs and not having the right people in the right positions. They have been around for 25 years. He is offering an employment contract, a great salary, equity over time, and a buyout agreement.

I guess my question is: Is it worth the risk? My kids are in elementary school and would feel horrible for moving them again because they love it here but don’t want to miss a great opportunity. Again, I have opportunities for growth at my current well-established employer, but I will never get equity or own the company. We don’t have any family in North Carolina, but my parents are in Colorado.

I appreciate everyone’s insight and feedback.

1dhg3up,Advice,"Hey everyone,

I'm a 20-year-old male, currently heading into my second/third year of a Computing degree. I've realized I don't enjoy it because sitting all day drives me crazy. I previously switched from a Finance degree after two years, and now I'm worried about making another switch only to find myself unhappy again.

I've come to believe that the idea of ""passion"" is overrated. What really matters to me is staying busy and making good money and being good at what i do. With this in mind, I'm exploring ways to enter the powerline technician or electrician trades as i believe i could genuinly excel in these fields. I'm considering applying to schools in Ontario and gain relevant experience by working as an arborist to get used to working at heights.

However, I also want to move out of Canada for various reasons, and it seems challenging to find opportunities for tradesmen abroad. What are your guys thoughts? I am 20 000 in debt currently from my 3 years of uni, and i have the funds to fund another year of uni without accruing anymore debt, but i dont know if i should ""waste"" another year in uni. 

If i continue my computing degree, i am not confident i will get a good job out of uni, as i simply dont believe i can compete in the field the way id like to. I am not confident that i would make as much as i would in the trades for atleast 10 - 15 years where i could make that much after obtaining my red seal. I am also not confident that i would even get a sponsor from an american company if i were to continue with computer science, so it all feels rather useless.

1dhewsy,Am I too late to ask for a payrise?? ,"I've recently migrated to a new country, and got a new job very soon after moving - the job is a maternity cover position, suited me well although I have no direct experience only transferable skills, and suited the company as I was available to start asap and happy with a temporary contract. 

I have worked there for 2 months now and done a very good job (I know but also this is the feedback across the board). When I first started I did not negotiate a salary since I was new to the work area, as well as country so also lacked some of the language skills, so felt insecure about this, but now I know I can excel in this job without this and have proven that. 

I am discussing an extension with the company next week and wondering - is this a time where I could bring up a pay rise? And if so, how do I do this??? I am working close to minimum wage and know this would be a big factor forcing me to look elsewhere - but I fear I have missed my chance already coming into the job to negotiate anything else.

Context: 

so I’m a nurse in Canada and Job 1 I currently work at where my title is not a nurse (they hired me because of my nursing experience). It’s a laid back job where I don’t do much and my bonuses are based on if we reach our sales quota. My fear is that the longer I stay here the more nursing skills I lose and because I’m not a nurse this job doesn’t honour the nursing wage grid so if the nursing union raises the wage for nurses I could miss out on that. 

Job 2 I would maintain my nursing skills. It’s a pretty good company (biggest IV clinic in Canada) and they offer “to purchase company stock through payroll deductions and at a
discounted rate”. Since it’s in health care I feel like it’s stable and recession proof. Only downside is that I take a pay cut as seen in the picture.

Job 1 : 
$39hr (hourly)77hr/bi weekly

Gross annual: $78,078
Net annual: $56,592
Net Bi weekly: $2,177

1dhd9mq,Do temporary promotions for hourly employees exist in corporate America?,"TLDR: One of the managers at my job (factory production setting in corporate America) is going on scheduled medical leave for 6 months and I've been training with them to be their de-facto assistant while they work from home in recovery. How can I expect to be compensated? The assistant manager position does not currently exist at this facility.

I've been with the company for just over a year grinding to work (hourly) my way up from the floor. It's an international company with facilities all over the world, ours having less than 50 employees and four Managers. I've been upfront with them about wanting a promotion and they were already exploring how to find/create a position for me to advance into, hence me being their first go to for this extra responsibility. The work will be mostly administrative (OSHA related inspections and paperwork) and is to be done during my normal hours alongside my production responsibilities and additional responsibilities that I've taken on to further my value and career there. Approximately 10-15 hours a month. 10 hour shifts, 4 day workweek.

During the meeting to discuss this unique situation, I asked about compensation since it is not a short stint and is beyond/unrelated to my previously discussed promotion interest. HR is at HQ which is off-site so they obviously gave me the, ""we'll get back to you."" I haven't heard back about pay and have already accepted and begun training (don't hate! I know the risks).

Had anyone else experienced something similar? What does a reasonable temporary compensation solution look like that might not involve a title change? Does corporate America even do temporary title changes? Is there a payroll mechanism for additionally pay similar to OT or bonuses that might apply? 

I'm not looking for ""is this a mistake"" or ""am I being taken advantage of"" because I already know the answers.

1dhbgzk,can’t decide what to take 🧪 or 💊,"Hi everyone,

I need help deciding if I should either do the program at NAIT for Chemical Technology 🧪 or Selkirk College for Pharmacy Technician 💊

I’ve heard that being a pharm tech is so-so unless you work at the hospital. I currently live in Alberta and the pharmacy tech program is accredited and all online except for the labs so there’s no problems (yet) with getting licensed in Alberta.

I recently came across the chem tech program, (and laboratory and research biotechnology program as well) and I liked what I saw in the site. Career outcomes, courses and all those. Currently it is on waitlisting now so if I do apply and get in, I may start this fall or wait for next fall. If I choose the latter program, I’ll need to take physics for the requirements, so it’s almost the same wait time.

I’ve done maybe 7-8 years of customer/patient interaction and I would like to take a break from it. I know being a pharm tech, you can work behind closed doors, making compounds (if I’m lucky but majority of the company hiring right now are shoppers, Walmart and etc.)

My end goal is to work in the pharmaceutical industry. I think chem tech will get me started. I am also thinking of doing the pharmaceutical chemistry program offered at U of T, if I need to take more schooling.

I keep changing my mind because I’m unsure of what to do. I’ve befriended a few graduate students from the chem tech program (in LinkedIn, I’ve been trying to network as a friend told me that networking will make everything a little bit better, applying for jobs, getting to know people and their jobs and etc) but I wasn’t getting the answers I needed. I’ve asked my partner an advice but he’s just the “I will support you in whatever you do” type so not a lot of help.

Please advice. TIA 😊",_minicandy,0,0.4000000059604645,0,1718555738,2024-06-16 16:35:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dhbgzk/cant_decide_what_to_take_or/,6,2024

1dha9ba,Senior Banker (60k base salary): should I negotiate?,"Hi, reddit. Should I negotiate and ask for more?

For a Senior Banker position at one of the top 3 banks, is 60k base salary on the low end or high end of salary range? I did search on glassdoor and reddit but need your advice. Possible incentive: $6k-$24k/year (not guaranteed. Depends on my performance/sales)
Location: HCOL area (not as high as NYC or San Fran but still high)

My last SALARIED job was $76k/year and it was fully remote. So I want at least $75k for the base salary. I don't have other job offers at the moment so I don't want to lose this opportunity. Realistically I'm not in a position to negotiate (even though they prob don't know it.)

More things to consider:

1. I have a B.S. in Business. I have 12+ years of combined experience in marketing, mortgage/loans/finance, management, etc. I've been looking for 100k+ salary jobs but haven't received any offer yet. Some recruiters have emailed me for 100k+ jobs but these were mostly commission only jobs. I've worked commission only jobs a few years ago but don't want to do that now.

I'm not in a good position to negotiate. I left my last salaried job ($76k/year) about 2 years ago. Since then, I've been working very little (contractor/freelance work.) On my resume, it doesn't show if my current jobs are full time or part time. So they don't know if I desperately need/want a salaried job. At least they don't know that I have no power to negotiate. No leverage.

2. This Senior Banker position also requires being fluent in another  language (Korean.) I also have years of experience working part-time as a translator/interpreter (it's on my resume.) I feel like I could be their most qualified candidate for this position. However, they might have a few other candidates (probably with less work experience) who would take the offer without negotiation. 

3. I applied for this job about 5 weeks ago. The salary range was not posted on the job description but during the second interview (phone,) the interviewer did mention the base salary range is $52k-$57k. FYI, this interviewer is not the hiring manager I'm talking to now. After 5 rounds (4 interviews and 1 language assessment) the hiring manager gave me the job offer on the phone saying the base salary is $57k. I said I would think about it and let him know. This was two days ago.

4. I didn't email him or call him back. That night, he emailed me first with more details on the incentive plan. Then he asked ""do u have any concerns regarding the base salary?"" So I replied asking more Qs about the incentive, PTO, etc. I also said ""Can you send me the offer in writing? I have 12 years of experience in marketing, finance, mortgage/loans, etc. I have worked as an interpreter/translator as well. What would be your best salary offer?"" I asked for an offer in writing because all I got was an offer on the phone. (I read a lot of posts on reddit today so now I know it's better to negotiate before receiving the written offer. But when I emailed him, I thought it would be better to negotiate after getting the written offer. I shouldn't have asked for a written offer yet since that seems like I'm okay with moving forward)

5. Then he replied: Base salary 60k (which is $3k up from $57k.) He said he can have his team write that on the offer on Monday. 

6. As I said earlier, I have 12+ years of related experience. But none of it was at a bank. All my skills, I believe, are transferrable though. 

7. I could not have higher paying jobs for the first 10 years of my career because of my work visa/green card issue. This was finally resolved 4 years ago. Then I was able to get the $76k/year job. Even $76k/yr is low for most people with 10+ years of experience. 

*******
Questions:

1. In this situation, is it better to just accept 60k base salary since I don't have other offers lined up? I do want a salaried job asap. I need money. 

2. Should I still negotiate for higher base salary since it would be even harder once I start working? The last thing I want is for them to pull the offer and go to the next candidate because I asked for too much. 

3. How much would be safe for me to ask? I really want minimum $75k base. If I asked for 75k, they might try to meet me in the middle or think even 75k is too high for this position. (I regret quitting my last salaried job. I don't have much power to negotiate. SMH.) I'm willing to accept $69k base salary (considering possible $6k-$24k incentive.) I was told that $6k/yr is doable here but only the best ones get $24k range incentive.

4. What should I do? I know it's safe to just accept 60k but I think it's too low for someone with 12+ years of experience and for someone who is a native speaker/translator/interpreter of the language required for this position. 

5. If u think I should ask for more, is it better to just ask if he's willing to negotiate? Or should I give him a number? How much is ideal in this case?

6. If you think I should ask for more, should I mention sign-on bonus as well? If so, when is it best to ask for that? BEFORE or AFTER the salary is finalized?

Your advice is greatly appreciated. It would be nice if a lot of experienced people (especially bankers and financial professionals) could comment.",khjforever,1,1.0,2,1718552377,2024-06-16 15:39:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dha9ba/senior_banker_60k_base_salary_should_i_negotiate/,6,2024

1dh9bnv,Business Degree or Enviro Science?,"This has more to do with degrees leading to a job rather than a job itself.

Background/lifestyle: 

I'm 27, work as a vending machine tech in a semi rural area (town of 70k), have a gf and no kids. am l looking to expand my horizons and do something I can enjoy and have more earning potential, I don't need to make much, I'd be happy with 40-50k/year, My GF is a sped teacher and is in the 75th percentile of our states average income.

School Choices/transfer credits: 

I would obtain my BS in Enviro Science online through SNHU. Whereas the BS in Business Admin would be through WGU. I have already taken all gen ed courses through Sophia and Study com including (for science degree) enviro science, chemistry and lab, biology and lab, Nat Science lab, ecology and enviro lab, geography, statistics and algebra (Not sure what of these would transfer to SNHU as they were done for a WGU earth science education degree I wanted to do). For the Business degree transfers I have completed Finance, business and econ 101, principles of management, project management, sociology and business law. For the business degree I have a total of 25 courses to do, of which only 14 would have to be done at WGU. For the SNHU classes, I'm not sure. I will say I enjoyed the science courses WAY more than the business ones since it was stuff I actually liked.

WHY I chose these degrees:

Enviro Science: I've always loved the sciences, specifically subjects relating to climate change, the environment, conservation and safety. I have certificates in water management and global environmental management as well as doing at home work like sampling soil for planting crops at our farm, and testing the streams and ponds next to us for excess runoff by testing nitrogen and phosphorus levels, volunteering for groups in my town that do river clean ups, and also study creek life and sustainability (crawdad population for example). However I've heard that getting a job and maintaining job security is tough with a enviro science degree and the pay isn't great (again, not a huge concern for me)

Business Degree: Honestly, it was just to get a decent job and have job security. I do invest and find the aspects of finance somewhat interesting, and do enjoy looking at balance sheets, income statements, going to company earnings calls, and did enjoy working in retail as a department manager. But that's really about it. I don't feel negative nor positive, just one of those ""Do what you gotta do"" vibes.

What Jobs I want or expect: 

Business- Honestly not sure, maybe a middle or frontline manager in retail, a job that I don't REALLY need a degree for but would definitely help compared to an employee who doesn't have one. Other interests and options would be a loan officer or risk assessment analyst.

Enviro Science: Consultant; guide companies on how to manage environmental issues and reduce their carbon footprint. field work; soil and/or water sampling in a conservation or agricultural setting. Construction industry; testing materials used in construction, on site noise levels, air quality, cement durability etc. Hazardous waste removal. Water quality analyst. 

As stated earlier, I don't think Id have any issues getting a job with a business degree, however with an enviro science degree I've heard from other people it can be a challenge.",mratt8,1,1.0,0,1718549740,2024-06-16 14:55:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dh9bnv/business_degree_or_enviro_science/,6,2024

1dh7woz,"Hey guys. Was fired this past Friday, need advice","Hey, so I’m 26 and work in the data space. Think analyst type roles. I have a passion for data, but a lot of these analyst roles nowadays want you to present your findings in meetings. I’m fine doing this over Teams, but not in person. 

So the problem as of why I got fired was just lack of reasonable judgement tbh. So I sold my car prematurely because I wanted an upgrade, and I decided to WFH. After lunch, I dipped out with my father to browse some townhouses and finalize my car loan. I was gone for 4 hours without letting anybody know.

Boss finds out, lets me go, now I am on the unemployment line after a year long tenure.. I’m def disappointed in myself, but in a way I look at this as an opportunity to actually get the role I want. I want something more “behind the scenes” focused, and this downtime will allow me to focus on these software programs that analyst type positions simply do not value. 

But man, I’m having an everyday struggle kinda beating myself up for allowing myself to fail like this. Like I have rent and a new car payment that I need to take care of bro.. and I lost an 80k salaried position knowing I had big responsibilities otw.. over something so avoidable. 

So I’d like a little guidance. I’m feeling pretty down not gonna lie. I have a great skillset, but my own personal judgement is not the best. How should I overcome this?

1dh7ozb,"Executive Presence: What it is, and how to develop it","In answering questions on the r/careeradvice and r/careerguidance as well as r/leadership, I've noticed so many questions relate to people looking for ways to demonstrate that they are ready for leadership roles, or would like to be seen as leaders in their companies. I thought it would be helpful to share a blog post with some practical tips about this particular skill and what it means. Source: I'm an executive coach with years of experience coaching tech sales professionals. 

What is executive presence? 

Executive or leadership presence is not just about having charisma or commanding a room, although that can be part of it. It's about connecting authentically, inspiring others, and projecting calm confidence, even in challenging moments.

Leadership presence is also a skill that can be developed over time. So even if you're nervous or feel like it's far out of your reach today, given time and practice, you can develop this critical leadership skill and gain more confidence as you grow in your career. 

Here are 5 practical tips:

1. Stand tall.

Quite literally - improve your posture. Roll your shoulders back, keep your head held high, and plant your feet firmly on the ground. This subtle adjustment can instantly make you feel more grounded and self-assured.

2. Make eye contact.

Direct, authentic eye contact is a powerful non-verbal communication tool that demonstrates confidence and engagement. It takes practice, but holding someone's gaze as you speak shows you're present and self-assured.

3. Slow down your speech.

When we're nervous, we have a tendency to speak quickly. But slowing your pace, pausing for emphasis, and using strategic silence can make your words land with more authority and impact.

4. Speak with conviction.

Try to replace language like ""I think..."", ""maybe..."", or ""kind of..."" with decisive, confident language. Own your expertise and opinions, believe that you have something to contribute, and let your tone and word choice reflect that self-belief. 

5. Breathe deeply.

Taking a few slow, deep breaths before an important meeting or presentation can activate your parasympathetic nervous system, helping you feel calmer and more centered. This emotional regulation will allow your leadership presence to shine through and create an energy that others will feel from you. 

Developing a compelling executive presence is an ongoing journey. Be patient, experiment, and most importantly, be kind to yourself - none of us are experts, we are all working to navigate our professional and personal lives as best we can. Hope this is helpful!

1dh7dec,interview successful? how to calm self down?,"I know nobody here can tell the future BUT what are you feelings on my interview process? good or bad? any tips to calm nerves while I wait for feedback?

I had an initial HR interview and they said my background is exactly what they're looking for and before the HR chat, the hiring manager had already requested me to be put through to the second round immediately. I passed the 2nd round and then did the final interview with the hiring manager.

In the 2nd interview, it was a chat with the guy i'd be working with and it was a pleasant conversation and a few jokes. He asked about a couple of things on my CV then he was trying to sell the company to me and saying things like 'when you join' or 'you will be doing this'.

In the hiring manager round, it was a little more serious but not formal, and I didn't feel any 'chemistry' with him and it was a bit bland like a Q&A. I think it went okay, I was able to answer all the questions and I wasn't grilled on anything. He questioned a few things from my CV that he said were interesting and that the company was looking to do these things too..but no difficult questions or anything.

HR then msgd me 3 days after the interview with an update:

I hope you are well. I wanted to update you- we have an offsite event for the rest of this week and then one more interview next week Monday. We should be able to give you feedback by the middle of next week. I hope this is okay.

I know I'm reading into things and I know I shouldn't, but I really want this job.

1dh70ih,Losing my job in six months,"Short version:

I’m 50 and I’ve worked at a corporate credit union for 25 years, in an office environment. My job is going away at the end of the year. I have roughly six months to find a new job. I never graduated college and I don’t have a lot of useful skills. I have a bad back and would like to avoid anything too physical. I’m looking for suggestions on new skills I could learn in the next six months.

More details:

I’m married, but my wife has health issues and can’t work. I currently make about $45k a year, which just barely pays the bills. Obviously I’d love to find something more lucrative than my current job, but I can’t afford to take any actual classes right now. People tell me I’d like coding, but I have no idea where to start or whether I could learn enough in six months to make it a career.

My current job involves branch capture. Credit unions send us imaged checks, I check them for errors, correct MICR lines, delete duplicates, send files, that sort of thing. A lot of what I do is extremely specific to our system and the software we use, and therefore difficult to put on a resume. I also do a lot of general office duties.

I type very fast, and I enjoy data entry. I’m also a decent writer, good enough for work purposes anyway. I’ve self-published six novels\*, and while I can’t say whether they’re any good (they certainly don’t sell), surely just getting them done and out there shows organizational skills. People often tell me I’m smart and creative. I’m also indecisive, have trouble understand social cues, and I might be autistic.

The older I get, the harder it is to learn new things, but I try to keep my mind active. There are some things I just can’t seem to learn, no matter how hard I try. It’s like a mental block. I’m worried that I’m going to pick one of your suggestions, invest a lot of my free time into learning it, only to find I just can’t make it sink in.

All my life I’ve been sort of a “jack of all trades, master of none.” I grew up writing, drawing, and programming (BASIC), but I split my time equally between the three and therefore never got really good at any of them. Sometimes I get obsessive about specific things and have to learn everything about the subject, so I’m hoping I can find a career that sparks that obsession.

I’m not a great team player. It’s hard for me to ask other people for help. I like jobs where I can be alone and figure things out for myself. I’m not a huge fan of customer service, but I can live with it. Sometimes I have trouble understanding what people say. It’s not hearing loss, it’s an auditory processing problem with understanding enunciation. (I have trouble with song lyrics, too). I don’t mind repetitive jobs, and I don’t care if I’m bored. I don’t like making decisions – I like jobs that have a clear, defined process with structured rules.

In addition to my back problems, I also get dehydrated easily, have trouble handling heat, and I have severe dust allergies. So working indoors is best. I’m also transgender, but I’m not planning to transition, so that shouldn’t affect my job. Still, it would be cool to get a job somewhere L-friendly. I know I sound picky, but I’m just trying to be thorough. I have six months, which is more than a lot of people get, so I have time to look for something ideal.

\* Note: I can’t use my novels in the interview process without letting them know I’m transgender. I also live in a very bigoted state in the southern US.

Suggestions of other forums on which to post this would also be helpful.",Muted_Violinist_4611,42,0.8799999952316284,61,1718542593,2024-06-16 12:56:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dh70ih/losing_my_job_in_six_months/,6,2024
1dh6u5w,Potential significant decrease is pay by returning as contractor?,"Saved up money and left a boring tech role in January, without next one lined up. Have been unsuccessful in finding a new job. Looks like a big pay cut if I can even land one. Feel pretty exhausted and desperate at this point, and that I had it better than I realized.

Old company called, asked me to come back. Said there were layoffs after I left and FTE headcount was frozen, but they can still bring on contractors as-needed. The offer, therefore, would mean being a contractor of a staffing agency they work with until the new budget for 2025 goes into effect, at which point they would allegedly hire me back to FTE.

For contractor positions, they said they're authorized to pay ""in the neighborhood"" of my old salary in hourly wages, but that wage would be paid to the staffing agency and it'd be up to me to negotiate with the staffing agency how much of that would actually be paid to me.

**Any idea what percentage these staffing agencies typically take, and how amenable or flexible they are to ""negotiating"" their percentage cut? Are we talking a few dollars/hour, or something wild like 50%? Any advice for negotiating with the staffing agency?**

While my old company did reach out to *me*, from what I've heard from a friend still there, there's really just one guy pushing to get me back and other leadership is neutral or may even see this as them doing me a favor.

1dh6ceq,Need advice on how to negotiate more equities with my current startup,"Hello, I am an AI engineer working in a UK startup, where I was in the founding team. We started about 6 months ago, are still not selling the product, but we are backed by some investors and won a grant, which apparently was quite difficult to get, I believe my novel ideas and vision and a major impact on this. I am not sure about the official term for which stage we are, probably seed?

In my initial contract there was a clause to give me equities based on my salary. My boss said that, if we had to utilize that, I would get something like 0.0 something %. Instead, he wants to give me 0.2%, to me and one of the other founding members, a designer.

We are also rediscussing my salary, and I already said the raise he proposed is too low, well below the UK market value. I could use it as a leverage.

The designer did not partecipate to the grant writing. Plus, the boss told me a couple of months before winning the grant that me and the other AI engineer (which has left) were going to have more equities than the designers.

And a few days ago he said he was going to reassign to us the shares of the other AI engineer and that the new hires will also get a percentage, I guess the same as me.

1dh5apa,I left my job and my agency client offered me a job,"Hi,

Three months ago, I decided to quit my job and take a little break before starting a freelance career. Two weeks ago, I announced it to one of my company's clients, and he immediately called me, expressing his desire to hire me directly. He offered to pay me the same rate he was paying my company.

I'm facing an ethical dilemma about this situation. I work at a small company and have a friendly relationship with my boss, which makes this feel wrong. However, in the past months, his leadership has been lacking and overall I think he deserves this because he is still on vacation and do not devote much time to the company.

1dh52je,"Canadian top 5 Bank changing every policy of their initial job offer, help wanted","So I accepted a role with a Canadian bank who's logo is green (need I say more) about a month and a half ago. The job posting seemed appealing so I applied and got accepted and started. On the initial job posting it said it would be a hybrid work arrangement (3 days remote, 2 days on site) which drew me to the position.

Everyday I'd go in I was curious when this hybrid work arrangement would begin, so I asked senior management who told me it would begin in 1-2 months time based on operational standards, I said okay makes sense. I spoke with some coworkers who had said in the contract it states it will be hybrid after 60 days. Okay Fine.

Now I've been in this arrangement for about 1 month and we all receive an email that says that because of the data and privacy nature of the position all contractors will not be eligible for the hybrid work model and it will be fully on site. Their full-time employees (people they had transferred from other departments to this team) can have a hybrid work schedule. 

To be honest I'm tired of having to wear business casual clothes everyday for shit pay and have to endure a brutal commute both ways. I was looking forward to having my 3 days remote. One of my coworkers mentioned sending an email to my agency to enquire about a higher wage because of commute etc etc, but this is bullshit to be completely honest.

On top of all this, they've done assigned seating (locking computers to certain desks) after we've made friends and had our seats picked, have given all Fridays off since the beginning (even though the contract states 37.5 hours, we've only gotten 28 hours per week). It feels like I'm SOL because they know they can take advantage of us because in Canada employers can fire anyone they want without any cause and so it's harder to speak up and additionally its easier for them to fire us since it's contractors. They're hiring all new contractors and telling them in the interviews it's fully onsite.

What should I do?",jj11224,3,1.0,0,1718535324,2024-06-16 10:55:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dh52je/canadian_top_5_bank_changing_every_policy_of/,6,2024

1dh4qeh,Should I look for another job?,"Hey everyone,

I would like to get your opinion on this matter.

I have been working at an IT company for about 6-7 years. During this period, my salary has increased maybe three times, but only by a very small amount. For the last three years, I have not received a raise, and over the past year, it has become clear that things are going downhill with the company. People are leaving departments and teams, and there are no real replacements. When there are replacements, they are usually from overseas (cheaper for the company) and often do not provide us with much support and have little accountability.

As a result, there is a lot more work and responsibility, and I am now backing up my manager in his absence (vacations,...), which can be quite stressful at times. Our team consists of only two people, and I am worried that if my colleague leaves, everything will fall on me. The understaffing is quite noticeable; sometimes there is no work-related response from other teams because they are also understaffed and overworked. This situation is becoming quite demotivating.

The only benefints are that my manager is fine, and I know that he cannot do anything with the raise, because the higher managmenet is pulling the strings, also the scope of work is fine, but I'm really worried that I will experience hell soon if I will not change something.

Do you think things will get even worse? Do you have any experience with this? Should I start looking for another job or endure this and maybe it will be better? I'm also really afraid of change, but not sure what would be worse., the complete change or to stay and it would be only worse.

1dh4nyo,Package is more in Product Management or IT roles?,"
Hi All
A brief background 

I did B.E in Comp Science (2016 - graduate)
However for next 33 months I was working in a startup in the Management types of roles 

I did not want to code such so I was happy on getting the opportunity from startup.

I did MBA (2021 - Post Graduation)

Currently working in the MBA roles in Finance industry...

However when I see the package that IT folks get I feel like maybe I should switch...



I have few questions -

Should I try and move in Product Management type of roles (hopefully I shall earn similar packages)?

Are IT packages high for all the levels or is it that during the starting years the people get 100% jumps however later on they earn on the same level as the MBA folks?

Should I learn some coding and consider a career switch? I am also concerned about lay offs 


Please advice 

I am looking at a high paying job and obviously job security and mental health should not be taking a toll


So only if these 3 are matching then I shall take the step to move to different career

1dh4ka1,Please give me advice.,"I hate my job. Fucking hate it. I am a content writer and I earn peanuts cause I'm a fresher. But wait, before i get jumped on saying fresher salaries are like that. Lemme tell you. I got this through placement and my peers are relatively earning better than me, for a freshers level.

Now a year has gone by, i gritted my teeth and worked through it for experience sakes. And I wanna quit. I am gonna hand in my resignation pretty soon.

The main reason: I hate it. I was unfairly put in PIP and I survived. I didn't change one single process of how I worked, still did it the same way.

Pre-PIP they were like your performance is concerning and post-PIP they were like you have improved 🥰😍. And the feedback is even more stupid. 

1. I am too creative. Tone in down.
2. Stop asking basic questions for someone with 1 year's experience. ( I only had 9 months of experience during this time)

And I know once I hand in, hr and my manager are gonna try and decipher my decision as to why. For a couple of reasons:

1. Somone is already leaving and we're short staffed ( this person and I are in good terms)
2. I do the heavy load work. I am the sole person that works on the project that half the team dislikes. Even me. 
3. Hiring and training newbies, even experienced ones will take time because we follow some stupid format.

How do I professionally tell my hr and manager when they call me in a meeting that the reason I am leaving this company is because my job fucking sucks and i cannot stand it anymore, politely?

1dh3z2b,Why corporate career progression is so unbearably slow? Or is it?,"A story. I spend most of my friday on a ""succession planning"" session with my company's leadership team which I am a member of as a CTO. We are \~1500ppl IT services and part of a 15000ppl global group. This was essentially about who is a good backup candidate for key roles in the company and who is a target replacement in few years. Time well spent, overall.

One thing struck me. With many people we were discussing we were like ""yeah, he/she is a good candidate for X, but needs another 3-4 years to develop."" And we were talking about people **IN THEIR 40s.**

I can't stop thinking this is insanely long for a mid-life person, who is often already senior to need another few years to grow into a more senior position. 3-4 years is time that is enough to grow own business from zero to milions. I know what the differences but still can't stop thinking about this insane amount of time needed to develop a corporate career.

What your experiences are? Do you have any idea why it is like that? Is this because corporate world is so complex due to number of people and budgets involved? Or maybe my company is a bad example of slow career progression?

I can't help thinking that for most of these people the better choice is to drop the corporate world and start their own business to speed up their career development 10-fold.

1dgz391,"Should I quit: 60k AUD bonus in December, but mental health tanking?","Hi everyone

Not sure if this is the right subreddit but looking for some advice ❤️ I know this dilemma I’m in is incredibly privileged and others have it far, far tougher

I’m working a finance job that is killing me. The culture is very very intense, no WFH, very cliquey, but (fortunately/unfortunately) very well paid. I stand to make a bonus of 60ish k AUD if I stay until December, but my mental health is and has been tanking since last year. The question is whatever I leave right now, forgoing the bonus, or leave in December. Either way I plan on leaving this overpriced city and going into another field after taking a bit of time out to recover.

My hair is falling out (25m, no one is bald in my family so think stress related because falling so rapidly), am depressed on the weekends, and am a shell at work. People also just comment that I look exhausted lol. I’m just concerned of the long term health impact when I know I could quit and go home to my family in another nearby city and take time to recharge/travel, which I am super fortunate for. I’ve never wanted to be someone who gives their all at work just for money, but this bonus would more than double my savings and could naturally change my life. However similarly I’m not in financial distress and so can afford to leave work for a while

Any advice would be much appreciated. Am I being naive/“Gen Z” for wanting to get my life back and not slog it out for 6 more?

1dgvfxf,Needing advice about next move in my career,"Hopefully this isn't too long of a post but I just want to give some context here.

I graduated back in 2009 with my BA in business administration and turn turned around and went right for my MBA after completing my degree.

While I was going through my masters program, I worked at a major telecommunications company.  It was such a stressful job but I did well.  I was making 65-70k per year doing customer service and sales.  I ended up leaving and going for a contingent job making less than 40k.  It was a big financial mistake doing that.  

Shortly after getting the job contingent job at the new company, I got pregnant.  (My husband and I had been trying for over 5 years.  I didnt think it would ever happen) When I was out on maternity leave, the company canceled my contingent position saying lack of work needed to keep someone employed in that role.  My goal was to eventually get a perm job at that company.  I have really bad anxiety and so I think between my anxiety and pregnancy hormones, my anxiety messed me up bad enough that they didnt like me.

I got a job at a different, much smaller company.  I had to start working 3 weeks after my c-section bc they wouldn't wait for me to get through my full maternity leave.  After having my daughter, I was a mess.  I had really bad post pardom depression.  I had a really hard time catching on to things when I never had problems before.  I was diagnosed bipolar and was put on a ton of medicine that made everything worse.  Way way worse, especially with my cognitive function.  I was eating nonstop, I wasnt showering so I smelled bad, it was such a terrible time for me.  The company that I was with really gave me a hard time.  

I ended up leaving but I bounced around for a long time.  I had issues really bad with my cognition.  One of the medicines was known for that.  So after several years of bouncing around and dealing with horrible colleagues that treated me badly, I wound back up with the same telecommunications company that I left a long time ago but in a different department but similar objectives.  

The job is still very stressful.  Its been almost 8 years since I had my daughter.  I was re-diagnosed as having dysthmic disorder and general anxiety disorder and taken off all of the meds that made my life hell for a lot of years.  I am not on a good combo of medicine.  I've lost a lot of weight so I feel better about myself and I feel like my cognition is back to the way it was prior to pregnancy.  

Anyways, I still dont like my job.  I make pretty decent money and have great benefits and it's all work from home.  I really dont like what I do but I am afraid i'll leave and realize the grass isn't always greener on the other side.  I like being at home bc I am shy and have had a really bad experience working with peers in the past but I feel really unfulfilled doing customer service work talking to customers about billing questions all day long.  I also have a horrible schedule and with an 8 year old, it's almost impossible for work/life balance 

My question is, should I make a career move and potentially risk losing these great benefits or should I stay?  I also worry about potential employers contacting past employers while I was jumping around for all of those years.  I was a hot mess emotionally for a lot of years and I am afraid that it will continue to haunt me when trying to find other jobs if they contact to ask if I am rehireable and what not.  Im so confused but I just feel like I need a change.  I worked for my company for 6.5 years before 2009-2015 and I literally bounced around every yearish until I came back to this same company back in 2020.  

Any advice?

1dgu28q,Handling big job gaps on an already limited resume,"Alright lads figured I'd throw this one out here and see if anybody has any sage wisdom. I am an older attorney with some ugly resume skeletons and I need some advice on how to cover these gaps or dance around them.. To be honest I am more than willing to make shit up within reason and if it will make me look good. I've already doctored up a few embellished resumes which I detail below.

Alright so before I make it too long winded, I'll just say that I have been an attorney in California for almost 5 years and haven't really done ""notable"" practice for the last 3 years. I basically didn't do much of any work besides a few demand letters and eviction cases tbh. Unfortunately I have had lingering PTSD and had ultimately hoped that going to law school would be nice pivot from doing military related work (and I had dick else lined up for me at the time). So I took that plunge almost 10 years ago.

Well it ended up turning out that I had no idea what I was doing, school was frustrating, and lost a fiance so I tumbled my way to finally passing the bar 2 years after I graduated (so already a bit of a gap in my resume). By this point I didn't want to be a litigator but I wanted to prove I could pass the bar so I did.

Like most young attorneys I didn't know what the hell I wanted to do so I just jumped into a collections job as an attorney. This would end up being my only real long term attorney position. After getting let go during covid I jumped into litigation at a bigger mid size firm.

Andddd this is when the wheels fell off! I should've listened to my younger self but the idea that maybe I could become ""a big shot attorney"" was prevalent in my mind. Unfortunately my past demons came back to haunt me quite fiercely and I ended up bombing out of a good 10 firms for the next 18 months or so. I just kept taking new jobs (and quitting/getting fired) because I needed the money and the only things I could get in private practice were litigation associate roles.

Finally I listened to my wife and stopped taking the litigation jobs and got myself into treatment. It was LONG process for me (and it's still ongoing). I basically was on food stamps, minor gov assistance and unemployed from 2022-present.

I'm finally ready to go back into the working world (well more like I have to) and I've been running into common problems with my resume at jobs I've been applying. It seems it is a death kiss for me to have such gaps in my resume and I was even trying to be somewhat creative by putting non-legal roles I helped family with while unemployed. The last couple of months I've been tweaking my resume to fill this 3 year gap by stating I worked for my friend's law firm (spoiler alert: I didn't) and did contract work.

This seems to be working A LOT better to at least get interviews. I've had way more interviews now although the eventual ""uhh so what have you been doing for the last 3 years?"" has been hard to defend without downright fibing about practicing for the friend's firm.

As I mentioned earlier I don't even want to be a litigator anymore, I tried and it did not work for me. It still seems that is all that's calling my number. I have a family to support now and my long treatment is starting to end. I'm not even sure how to address these gaps if I were to apply to a government job.

Thoughts on any of this would be appreciated. Thank you!",ArmyFun3820,0,0.5,2,1718492876,2024-06-15 23:07:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dgu28q/handling_big_job_gaps_on_an_already_limited_resume/,6,2024

I plan on doing something with data science, data engineering or machine learning.

I've never had a nickname nor have I ever considered one because, for the most part, once people hear the pronunciation of my name, they don't have an issue with it.

1dgrlt6,Venture capital company about to transform us,"I run a team of 70 people, doing a specialized service inside a company that also provides other services. We are the leader in our market with 85% of the industry as our clients. About 18 months ago we were purchased by a venture capital firm.  They have offshored jobs, fired tons of people in other areas, and are now getting around to us. 

The plan is to start by slashing a third of my team, offshoring the jobs, and I can see they are going to decimate us. I’m being asked to lead this entire “project”. I feel sick, not only thinking about my team members, but also knowing how the quality of our work will crater and our clients will be very unhappy. A part of the goal is to keep customer satisfaction high. It’s going to be impossible. I feel like my reputation in our very small world industry is going to be damaged. I’ll be the face of this dismantling. 

I’m in my 50’s. I don’t make a huge salary but it’s twice what I see when I look at the lower level job listings in my field. (If I could even get hired at my age). Leaving won’t stop this change from happening. I know they will probably use me to do all this work, sell the company, and I’ll be fired. But is it better to just hang on until that happens?  Make my salary while I can? 

Should I look for something else now before I have to go through this?  There is no point in saying that I think these changes are bad for business.  They are trying to put a good face on it, making it sound positive, but I don’t believe a word they say.  It’s going to be so depressing to be providing worse and worse service, taking all the complaints and firing people. I’ve struggled with depression, and the position I’ve obtained at work has been a very positive thing in my life. I like the recognition. 

I want to be realistic about my options at this point.  I’ve heard finding a job after 50 is almost mimpossible.

1dgqs0j,Putting in 2 weeks notice at a small firm that’s understaffed,"I could use some guidance, reassurance, or just a little push.

I’ve been at a small law firm for 9 months now as a receptionist/client support assistant working 30 hours a week while I’m a full time online student. This job was to help get me exposure to the law field after working in tech/wanting to consider a new career path. The job is definitely not just answering phones/scheduling. I do marketing, tech support stuff, legal secretary work/filing with the court, plus I’m helping automate some of their process. I only make $19 an hour in CA.

Since I started, our team of 7 (2 attorneys, 3 paralegals, 2 receptionists) has dwindled to 5. 1 paralegal retired and the other was let go (with the intention of using software to replace her drafting responsibilities, but that didn’t really work the way they thought. I’ve absorbed a lot of work without any change to my hours. So has everyone else. It’s been 3-6 months since the staffing change and they don’t have intention of hiring new people.

I’ve been struggling to make progress on projects b/c they just keep giving me new ones and they change their process so often b/c they are also building out software they want to streamline/sell to other firms.

I’ve recently started to really struggle with my mental health & to really absorb knowledge like I want at school. Plus I have a lot of money saved and my partner can support us. I wanted to get to a year but I don’t think I can keep this pace for much longer. 

They did just sign a leash on a 2nd office, and they intent to hire a receptionist to work there (instead of actually staffing their headquarters properly smh). They haven’t made the job listing yet and are pretty picky so it might be a month or 2 until they hire someone.

Part of me wanted to stay until they hired someone new so my coreceptionist could have support (we’ve become friends) but I think I just want to peace out. I want to leave them in a good spot and not burn bridges (esp b/c I’d love a letter of recommendation from the managing attorney, but tbh we haven’t really clicked so idk if she’ll give me one anyways, recently she started saying snarky things in front of everyone as “feedback” and I just don’t respect that). 

Anyways. I just needed to get this out there. I’m tired of being overworked without support & I don’t like what this job is bringing out of me.

1dgqgrn,Salary is only one part of a job.,"I know, we all want to make as much as humanly possible. I do too. However you should always consider the whole package.

For instance, 401K match. That's free money. Some companies will contribute even if you don't. My company does this but it takes 3 years to become vested. Based on age and service time, it starts at 4% of your salary and goes up to 6%.

Insurance. I live in a HCOL area. Insurance from a company based here is stupidly expensive. My company is based in a state where the insurance is much cheaper for the same coverage. I'm talking about $800 a month cheaper. 

Commute. Sometimes you have no choice but factor that in. When an 8 -9 hour shift turns into a 10 - 11 hour ""out of home"" shift, that has a cost. Not just gas/tolls/train/subway/wear and tear/etc but the loss of the extra time in life. 2 jobs ago, my commute was 15ish minutes with no traffic or 30ish min if I took the backroads. 

PTO/sick time/flexibility. Can you come in late for a doc appt or will you have to take PTO/sick time? Will you have to make it up? PTO has a definite value to it. Can you roll it over or is it a use it or lose it. If unlimited, is it legit or like pulling teeth to actually take a day/week? How long does it take for the PTO to grow?

Hybrid/remote/in office only. How strict? How flexible? 

Stability/long term growth/industry. Is this a fly by night company? Startup that is a shoestring budget? A field that is long established? Up and coming field? Is the company profitable?

1dgq8os,Failing probation…,"About 7 months ago I started a new job in a new industry, so a little bit of a career change after 10 years of working with the same products. My new company seemed nice but I realised almost as soon as I started that it was the wrong decision - I definitely didn’t vibe with the people and the job was not what I expected. I also think they think I had different experience than I do. Since I started I’ve been trying to put in goals with my manager to understand expectations/get a description of the job and was ignored, until 5 months in they put me on a development plan as I’d been underperforming! News to me at the time as I’d received no feedback before then. I also received no job description. I was also quite upset that one of my official goals included working on my professional appearance, despite me not looking or dressing any differently to anyone else.

They then extended my probation by two months, with similarly vague goals. My manager doesn’t seem to want to help me achieve these goals as she thinks I should know what I’m doing even though I’m perpetually confused as it’s a new industry and role and I was brought in at a senior level and told I would be giving training. I’ve been quite open that I have some quirks (I’m awaiting an official autism assessment) and that I’ve found all the vague answers around the role difficult to understand. 

If I fail, is there any chance they’ll still give me a good reference as I don’t think it’s because I’m doing a dreadful job, they just need someone more experienced in this field and it’s not me?

Would it be better to hand in my notice asap rather than risk them letting me go at any moment or could they give me a bad reference anyway? Or any advice on how to handle this situation would be appreciated.

1dgq6vf,Seeking Advice: Moving to Canada at 21 with Baking Experience,"
Hi everyone,

I’m a 21-year-old from Africa, and I’m considering a big move to Canada. I’m reaching out to this community for some advice and guidance. Here’s a bit about me:

	•	I didn’t finish high school, so I don’t have formal qualifications.
	•	I have significant experience working as a baker(self taught), which is my passion.

I’ve been feeling a strong urge to move to Canada, but I’m unsure if it’s the right decision given my current situation. I would love to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation or has insights into the following:

	1.	Immigration Options: What pathways might be available for someone with my background?
	2.	Job Opportunities: How is the job market for bakers in Canada? Are there any specific areas where skilled bakers are in demand?
	3.	Education and Skills: Should I consider completing my education before making the move, or can I find opportunities in Canada that might allow me to continue my education there?
	4.	Life in Canada: What should I expect when it comes to living and working in Canada? Any advice on settling in and adapting to the new culture?

I’m really passionate about starting a new chapter in Canada, and I’m open to any advice or experiences you can share.

1dgpfk8,"Torn: US or EU/UK, tech guy, mid 20s","Hey everyone,

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice. I’m from a developing country, currently living in Europe (think of Germany/Czech Republic)  and I’m considering moving either to the US or staying here in Europe  (probably Germany as the tech scene is descent here)   
  
**Background:**

* 27 y.o, no kids, no wife, no pets, no debt 
* 6-7 years of Product Management experience (SaaS primarily)
* Can **legally stay/work** in both EU/US (I know, it's rare and I am kinda lucky to be in such a position but it adds even more uncertainty, you know) 
* Managed to put some money aside so I could last probably for another 1-1.5 years in the EU/up to 1 year in States while I'm looking for new opportunities

**Here’s where I’m torn:**

* **Europe**: Weeeeelll,  while I like the idea of living in Europe (and traveling), the salaries don’t seem as high and the taxes are quite high. However, I’ve heard that the work-life balance and quality of life can be better (i read it as **boring)**
* **US**: On the other hand, the US has a very **competitive tech landscape**, with many top-tier **tech guys** from prestigious schools like Stanford and MIT. The salaries are higher, and taxes seem to be veeery reasonable (a friend of mine paid around 22% last year, pulled in around $200k/ann). The current tech landscape doesn't look promising (layoffs, a bunch of ""inflated""FAANG folks are on the market looking for a job).  However, if I think of like 10-15-20 years perspective, the only way out is just going there and hustle opportunities in the US (even not in tech)

Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. I’d love to hear from those who have **lived both in the EU and US for some time**, so you can compare the upsides and downsides.

Thanks, y'all!

1dgp23v,workshadowing in social field: got traumadumped by a client and am unsure about this joboffer ,"

Hello,

Im trying to make this as short as possible.

  
backstory:

Because people said volunteering would be good and Im struggeling to find a place, I gave volunteering a chance and signed to attend an event for disabled person.

I told the organisator that Im jobseeking and through that she offered me to apply for a job as an assitance for disabled person working with them to handle their free time (going to concerts, visiting a doctor, etc)

I visited them 3 times, plus the event.



The (maybe future) coworker which organised the disabled person going to that event organised it very bad. She told me I wouldnt need to think about giving a man, who cant speak and sits in a wheelchair, something to drink, as other staffs would do that. Turns out I should have sone that, as another (in future) coworker reminded me during that event. It was so stressful and bad organised, that I got herpes.

  
Situation, which overwhelmed me:

today I went to the house, were the disabled person, live together. I wanted to talk with the boss about the contract, but there was no time because she had shift.

When I got there she asked me, if I could do some assistance work with a client.

It was nothing stressful, but she asks me to work as a freetime assistance, when I dont even have a contract (yet).

A disabled person, which I met earlier and found very nice because she is funny, cares for her roommates and is intelligent, asked me if she could show me her appartment.

She showed me the music she likes and suddenly she talked about her childhood.

\*\*\*\*triggerwarning\*\*\*\*

About her drugaddicted mother, about rape, that someone tried to kill her. How her sisters were molested.

I think she talked about 30 minutes and I freezed.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* TW end\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

  


I asked her if she had therapy and also said that was much what she told me and that I need to talk with the working caregiver (which also would be my boss).

I told her that I feel overwhelmed because of what the woman confessed to me.

She was a bit...dont know how to describe it, but she didnt take me seriously. She said that I shouldnt take it too serious and next time just try to change the topic.

I told her that Im not a licensed therapist and have NO education in a social field.

I know feel pretty unsure about that job. I like the coworkers and I also like the clients, but ...I dont have a stable income, I dont have a job scription and probably am asked to work ok demand, which I dont want.

I already quit my minijob to work there, but now Im asking myself if that was a good idea.

I think you need to have some stability in your life to help others. I dont have that.

And one reason I wanna work there is also because I like the coworkers and the boss, because I dont have a family.

But Im also a codependent and I dont feel good about some incidents.

please share your opinion. thank you.",unregularstructure,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1718478248,2024-06-15 19:04:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dgp23v/workshadowing_in_social_field_got_traumadumped_by/,6,2024

I’ve always been more of an arts person, and even though I know most of the time you spend working in interior design/architecture isn’t necessarily doing something creative, it’s at least related to it.

As for fashion design, all I hear is that it’s a useless degree. 

I hear so many people complain about the industry and advising against it, but at the end of the day, I feel like I would be happier working on something I’m actually interested in. 

I feel too old to go back to university, but I am willing to do it. I just worry that I may have a romanticized vision of the job and I would be trading “stability” for something not worth it. 

If anyone could give me some insights about the industry, I would really appreciate it. 

I considered investing more in creative hobbies instead of completely switching paths, but part of me still feels like I should work on what makes me happy.

1dglshf,Is a pay cut worth it?,"Hi all,

I’ve been in my current role since I graduated college, about 5 years. My pay is primarily from commission, some bonuses, and a small base salary. All together I’m tracking towards $125-$130k this year. I have a ton of job security as well. I make great money and I’m really good at my job, but I hate it. When business is good and I’m making a lot of money, it’s fun, but with the economy the way it is, things are pretty slow right now. 

I am constantly stressed, dread going to work everyday. The Sunday Scaries are horrible. There is little room for growth at this point, and any move I make into a different branch of the company would be a significant pay cut. 

I’m considering another role, similar on-site requirements to my current job, but would be going downtown instead of a suburb. It’s in a similar line of business, but would be salaried between $98-105k. There is a lot of room for organic growth, opportunities to go into other lines of business if I want to. I know someone on the team and they love it. 

I love the people at my current job and I would be sad to leave them. It would also be a significant pay cut, at least for the first few years. On the other hand, the stress of trying to keep my commissions up would be gone and my income would be more predictable. Part of me really wants to try something new, but the other part feels like this would be a huge mistake.

1dgkjqo,Do I just leave or tell my bosses my concerns,"I will be in my current position for about 5 years this fall at a very large Fortune 500 and actually enjoy the work. The problem is my management is not very great and we have a lot of turnover leaving us with more workload. When I started we had 2 admin positions that moved to another department. The new admins quit in less than a year and they never backfilled the positions. This left myself and my other coworker who were hired to manage projects to take on most of the admin work. 

This other coworker had a higher pay grade, title, more responsibilities, and likely pay. I only say likely because the pay grades do overlap where I am on the higher end of my pay grade/range. This January that coworker resigned leaving me with all the responsibilities. I have done extremely well and was given an award with a small monetary value for my extra work. Cool to be acknowledged a few months of doing this alone but it’s not sustainable. 

Fast forward to March, the replacement was onboarded. She now holds the title/pay grade which again is higher than mine. This new hire has a masters degree while I never finished my bachelor degree but have 15 years of project management experience. I think education is the biggest reason I was not promoted because my senior manger is about optics. I think my direct manager would have promoted me. 

Now that it’s been over 6 months since my coworker left I absolutely assumed her role. I like my position but am becoming pretty annoyed that they hired someone who is not taking over the bigger responsibilities like my previous coworker because I can only do so much in an 8 hour day. I do not think after 90 plus days the new hire is good for the position she was hired in and should have been hired into a more junior role like mine. This means my boss is giving me the more difficult responsibilities. 

I have started applying internally and if I don’t find anything by end of summer I will begin externally because I like the benefits and pension.

My question is do I have a meeting with my boss and discuss my concerns or do I just move on to a new position? I did ask the differences in position our very first project review meeting when the coworker was hired but my boss made it seem like there was no difference. That’s when I gave myself 3 months to help get them up to speed then I was attempting to switch departments.

1dghu3f,Struggling to Choose a Study Path After Realizing Business Management Isn't for Me. What should I do?,"
Hi everyone,

I really need some advice on choosing a new study path. This year, I completed my first year in Business Management( bachelor), but I’ve realized it isn’t something I’m passionate about or interested in continuing. A friend suggested I look into ICT and Cyber Security, and while it sounds cool, I’ve heard that you need to be really passionate or interested in the field to succeed and that made me doubt a lot abt my ability to continue that study. Unfortunately, I don't have much specific interests or passions, which makes deciding on a new path even harder.

I want to study something that will allow me to make good money after graduation, ensuring financial stability and good job prospects. I’m not keen on office jobs or sitting behind a screen all day, which is a concern with Cyber Security. Additionally, I want to study something in demand so I won’t have much hardship finding a job. I also prefer to be surrounded by people and not always isolated in my work environment. I can’t afford to waste another year, so I need to choose something soon and commit to it.

 There was also a mention of studying Biochemistry, but I really have no clue what to study and do at this point. Even if I don’t end up loving my study, I want to make a financially logical decision.

Given all this, I’m feeling really lost and overwhelmed. Cyber Security sounded good initially, but I’m worried about the sedentary nature of the job and whether it will remain in demand. I’d love to hear your thoughts and suggestions on what fields of study might be a good fit for someone in my position. Has anyone else been through a similar situation? How did you decide on your path, and what advice can you offer?

Thanks in advance for your help💞

1dghaqa,Career crisis after graduation :( helpp,"Hi guys.....

Im a 21-year-old undergraduate who just graduated from a music college, and experiencing a career crisis rn....... 

lemme explain my background a little bit......

I studied piano teaching and have been learning the piano since I was 7. u might wonder why I wldn't want to be a piano teacher, given my background. 

playing and teaching piano should be a relaxing and fulfilling job, rite? I understand that music teaching can be meaningful n fulfilling, but heres the thing......Im not rlly that passionate about playing the piano. I chose music teaching coz I'm naturally gd at music, and I dont dislike the piano. 

I like music, but Im not as passionate about it compared to my peers who are incredibly passionate........ I decided on music teaching because it's smth I'm good at and don't dislike......

but since graduation, I haven't touched my piano for more than a month. I feel directionless n uncertain about what I truly want to do.......even though Im set to become a music/piano teacher, it doesn't feel right in my heart. It feels like smth's off, and it feels like my heart is placed elsewhere.........

but I'm only good at music.....when I was in pri/sec school, I struggled w other subjects....... music is the only subject I excel at.

If I don't teach piano/music, I'll lose my source of income, as my dad wont help me financially due to our poor family background. I also hv a belief that if I give up on piano, I'll be left with nothing coz Im not good at anything else.

I do hv a wide variety of interests, like building Minecraft builds, customizing my phone's screen, making 3D models, drawing, building fictional worlds and OCs, tinkering w ChatGPT models, watching interior design videos, designing logos....... etc. 

but honestly all these interests r very surface-level n broad, and I even get uninterested w some from time to time, smtms even being uninterested in everything.........

Idk much about 3D modeling techniques, drawing techniques, basic architecture principles, animal anatomy, etc.

The only topic I hv a deeper knowledge in is music, especially classical music, since I studied that during my college years.

but honestly I dont rmbr parts of music history that I've learned, and until now, I only like and admire classical music. I still prefer pop music tbh.......

And regarding those other interests, Im just a beginner and cant say that Im gd at them.......

Thats why Im having a career crisis rn..........

What shld I do??? Is there anything that really resonates w me and makes me feel like its my true calling? I haven't found my innate purpose yet. My younger sis (7 years younger) alrdy knows she wants to be a singer or zoologist. 

My pri sch and college friends all hv a clear sense of what they wanna do........ 

........yet Im still wondering what I shld do, even after graduating. I envy those who know their path from the very start........

Any thoughts n advice? Please help....I rlly want to get out of this depressing rut.......",Sea-Ad-477,2,1.0,1,1718455915,2024-06-15 12:51:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dghaqa/career_crisis_after_graduation_helpp/,6,2024

I pursued graphic design, have the BFA, got a production job for a couple years that gave me very little to show off, left it for an opportunity that ended poorly, and am back at square one with a shit service job to (barely) make ends meet. I'm 30, not a fresh graduate, don't qualify for internships, seemingly have too much experience for junior roles (more than 3 years), not enough experience for intermediate (no creative design job except hit and miss freelancing), no idea how people are supposed to juggle full time and part time work when both are day shift, and the industry itself has gone down the shitter for various reasons. Feel like everyone suggests freelancing to scrape together experience, but full-time jobs seem to look down on freelancing as filthy job hoppers (maybe I'm projecting).

1dgayrl,50% More Pay or Better (Potential) Stability with lower Pay?,"**To start, I apologize, I never posted an inquiry on Reddit before. (Though used it for years to view comments) So this is my first time asking my own question.** 


OK - A lot to unpack below, sorry for long details but is essential to my inquiry / predicament. Ultimately, moving from one state to another (which will come into play shortly) to be closer to family with my wife and young daughter. I’m at a crossroad in decision needed to be made with below companies + career path + compensation, all in one. 


Company A (Current): 
1) Current Pay: $127k, 15% bonus.
2) Told was leaving for Company B as geographically I could not stay in state A in moving to state B now with specifically the position I am currently in. Company A understood, wanted to keep me, and offered $145k base counter + 15% bonus AND could go fully remote. Awesome, I was iffy about the work as it’s tough hours / clients but knew was to good to pass up and thought the money /remote was best for medium-term. 
3) However, they came back after talking with HR. Legally they can’t hire / keep me if I live in state B.  Which we are 100% living in now as we just bought a new house. So, I said, easy decision, will stick with Company B / New Offer.
4) Extra however, they came back again. Stating a consulting company they have close relations with could hire me through them and sub-contract me back to my company. But opens up risk for me as I am not working for Company A no longer, now a Company C (we can call it), that is specifically a consulting firm. Noting that benefits / 401k structure are not the same and if say an economic downturned happened, Company A cuts sub-contractors first and looks out for employees, which I wouldn’t be no longer.
BUT point being, they’re offering the same raise in compensation structure but now with this extra lair of risk. 


Company B (New Offer): 
*Disclosed current pay, ($127k, which is really $145k base now) max would give me: $100k base, 10% bonus 
*Seems like a potentially better work-life-balance and job itself. BUT do have to commute in a few days a week. (~30mins each way) 3 days in office, 2 remote. 

**SO, with above, summary statement being…Company A/C could be fully remote, $167K total comp, which is $57K total higher comp than company B at $110K with commute. However, potentially like Company B / job better. Though that is the issue of unknowns. Could I get $100K again if I pass Company B and go for more money with Company A? Probably yes, which is why I am considering. Can I have a more stable / rewarding career with lower pay for now with Company B? Potentially, though do not know that. If this was a $20-30k comp difference, I would choose Company B. But being almost $60k in the switch, it’s hard to pass that up. Though I am also trying to think long term and seem to not see that with Company A/C.

1dgauzp,Decision to make- better lifestyle with offered job but less money,"(29M) I live 6 hours from where I grew up. Moved to a place where I have no family due to personal reasons a few years back. Really enjoy this area. Before I moved, I worked in education as a paraprofessional. The pay wasn't great but I lived with my parents then so it didn't matter as much. When I moved, I left the education field, however I am now looking to get back into it. I plan on pursuing a Master's in either teaching or school counseling (my bachelor's isn't in education, hence why I can only be a parapro if I work in the field). I currently do a Security job where I make decent money, a little over $21 an hour, which is decent for the state I live in. However, it is night shift, and it is absolutely killing me physically and mentally. I've gained weight, and often find myself depressed and feeling like I'm not living since I have to (attempt) to sleep during the day, and work all night. I don't have many friends here, but a lot of that is due to my schedule and inability to meet people outside of work. I have to work every other weekend, and every single Friday night, which isn't fun either. On my off days when I sleep at night, I physically feel so much better. I don't switch to a day shift at this job though, because I make $4.50 extra to work night shift. 

Today, I was offered a Parapro position at an online school. However, the pay is only $16/hr which is non-negotiable they said. I could probably swing it, but it would be super tight, considering I'm on my own. Rent is around $800/mo. Car payment around $375/mo. Also eat out a lot because of my schedule and I don't like cooking at all. If I lived with someone bringing in another income, I could do it. This is the industry I want to work in and I'd hate to pass this opportunity up, but I know there are other similar positions out there that pay more. I also think this would be a good job to have while I pursued my Master's, just given the schedule (M-F 8-3). It would make going to school a lot easier. I know I'd feel better mentally and physically. My parents said they'd help me out a little each month if I took this job, but I don't want to ask them for their help or expect them to. If they're going to help me financially, I'd rather it be helping me with tuition in the future (which they offered when the time comes). I don't want them to have to give me money just so I can live. I want to go for the Master's, so I can actually make money in education, but in the mean time I need to live too. I also don't think I can do a Master's program on this night schedule.

  
Anyhow, what do you all think? Just so much going through my head right now and some tough choices to make. Do I leave this comfortable, decent paying job, for less pay and a better schedule with room to gain experience in the field I want to work in? Or do I stay put for now and hope a better job in education comes along? Thanks in advance.

1dgahvt,Can I get any WFH jobs with a Software Engineering degree?,"There are no SWE or web development jobs in my small town, and I really don’t want to have to move to a big city to get one. 

I’m pessimistic about my chances of getting a WFH software engineering or any kind of online web dev position remotely considering the job market right now, and the leetcode grind is absolutely brutal, I also don’t have any internships. 

all I have is the degree, a cloud practitioner basic cert, and an itil cert, but no work experience aside from a janitor position I had a few years ago.

I don’t care what the job is as long as I don’t have to do 3 months of prep to get it, just something WFH and preferably 70k up, through if it’s like a junior position where I could work my way up to a higher salary then 40k up.

Are there any such positions? Or will I have to either get a job for IT support paying 50k which I could have gotten without the 4 years of college, or have to move from my family to a city where I can get a SWE junior position.

The job I'm leaving isn't anything special. But it's not necessarily a risk to stay here (though wouldnt say I'm living my best life here either)
 but it is a risk to leave because despite the new job and new destination I can explore and people I can meet, opportunities etc. There is still a lot of unknown. Will I like the city, the people etc.

Will I be happier doing travel or staying where I currently live doing the same mundane thing. I feel like that's the safer option but not necessarily the right?

1dg9m26,I Have Sent THOUSANDS of Job Applications and No Job Yet...HELP!!,"Hey everyone,

I'm reaching out to this community because I'm at a bit of a loss and could really use some advice or insight. I graduated with the class of 2023 with a degree in Computer Science. Since then, I have applied to over 3000 (no exaggeration) jobs, and it’s been a frustrating and disheartening journey.

Here are the specifics of my situation:

* I’ve only managed to land 4 real interviews in total.
   * Rejected from 3.
   * 1 interview is ongoing, but it’s for a government programming job, so it might take a long time to hear back.
* I have rewritten my resume multiple times to try to optimize it.
* I even paid a resume writing service to help make my resume as strong as possible.
* I’ve tried messaging recruiters directly.
* I’ve used every job board website out there.
* I’ve reached out to people on LinkedIn for references and networked as much as I can.
* The job listed at a startup clothing brand on my resume was a brand my friends started, and I helped set up the website.
* I’ve also tried reaching back out to the place where I interned, but no luck there either.

I feel like I’ve tried literally everything and I am barely getting any responses. Is it really this hard to get an entry-level software engineering or related role? I’ve been applying all over the country, so location shouldn’t be a limiting factor.

I’m attaching an image of my resume (with personal details redacted) to this post. I would appreciate any criticism, suggestions for improvement, or general tips on what else I could do.

1dg8drz,Did Well On My Interviews But I Have More Questions & Don't Want To Make The Wrong Decision ,"Some background on my situation:

The past three jobs I have had, including the one I'm currently at, have all caused me a significant amount of stress due to the work environment/culture and all of them being relatively small companies expecting a lot from their employees. At the time that I took those positions, I always felt some sort of hesitancy that maybe it wasn't the right job for me. The first of the 3 jobs I got during COVID and it was tough to find work. While I liked the job itself & my duties, and started to dabble in some other departments, management was incredibly toxic (they were all related) and I had to leave. I left that job for another which paid more and and I thought would allow me to focus on my hired role but quickly mirrored the previous one in being toxic & all over the place. I moved on to my current company which I saw a lot of growth potential at but I should have listened to myself when I got a bad vibe during the interview. This role, while it has provided me with a lot of experience in my new career path, I found myself again in another toxic situation. Long story short: CEO doesn't know what he wants out of my department, doesn't believe in the value of marketing, and all of the staff members are overburdened with unrelated job tasks because or poor organization/planning and high turnover. 


What's Happening Now:

Recently I had two interviews with a subsidiary of a multinational company. They're going through a transition period right now but there is a lot, A LOT of growth happening & would be a breakthrough into something big. I don't have any formal education in my career path but am a self-learner & have taught myself everything thing I know (shout out to Google & YouTube) and I have never worked at a company this big (the direct hire company is ""small"" but part of a 400+ location brand which is part of a multinational corporation). I did really well in the first interview and this second (& final) interview but I was completely off during the second interview. I had had a long, stressful day/week beforehand and this interview was right after work but again, I did well & got a lot of positive feedback from the 2 managers on call (which also through me off as I had thought I was meeting with each one individually but on back-to-back calls). I would be the third person joining this department so a total of three of us which means a lot of work/different tasks for the firdt bit but they see this position no longer existing next year as we will have several specialists in the department that can focus on their specific job and someone to managde them all. While my stress and fatigue probably wasn't shown, I felt it & I also messed up in forgetting to ask a few key questions. I did get answers to other questions that were related but the fact that the prospective role & company is intimidating on its own, I feel like I would be more confident if I had asked all of my questions. 

Everything being crammed into 2 interviews was a lot at once, and I should have been more prepared but my day/week was just not working with me. After my interview, I didn't feel confident in how I responded, not because I got poor feedback but because I didn't feel like I was the best I could be and again, I didn't ask everything I want to know. So now, while I don't have an offer yet, I am worrying about if the job is right for me. Would it be unprofessional if I ask to have another chat when/if I get a job offer to ask outstanding questions? Does that look bad on me as a potential hire if I request to meet again and ask questions I should have asked initially? Is it really the lack of questions asked what is worrying me about my fit for the position or am I letting my anxiety & past experiences with switching jobs that's getting in the way? I don't want to keep ending up in a toxic situation & I don't want to take a job I might not succeed at, but those are both possibilities with any job. 

TL;DR: Did well in both interviews for a job but I still have some questions and don't know how that will come off if I ask now when/if an an offer is made. 

TYIA to all that take the time to read my little ramble. I appreciate any advice I can get :)",Introvesi,2,1.0,0,1718420562,2024-06-15 03:02:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dg8drz/did_well_on_my_interviews_but_i_have_more/,6,2024
1dg8bti,Should I stay Part-Time after Graduation,"I am graduating this Fall with a BS in Integrated Studies and a minors in Economics. Before anyone tells me how stupid the major is, I know. It’s been a rough three and half years, and I have a lot of regrets, but towards the end I found what I wanted to do…ish. I started taking courses geared towards data analytics, but I am not excited for the competition and I don’t have any hands on experience in data analytics (internships or proven work outside of school). 

I am currently working for a YMCA and I love it. I do see myself potentially working my way up to a director position, but in the meantime I don’t meet the requirements (not 21 nor have I worked 2+ years). With that being said, even after I meet the 2 year mark I’ll only be 21, and I don’t think this organization would hire someone as young as me since I don’t have as much experience as others.

I have a chance (30%) of getting a job as a full time marketing analyst when I graduate. The probability of me getting any analyst position is low because of my degree and experience, but I do have some amount of course work in business analytics. 

I am happy with either position even though they vary in requirements. I plan to stay home for another 2+ years to pay off debt, but I do want to move out ASAP. 

Anyhow, should I try to get a full-time position or stay home and work part-time at the YMCA until I get a full time position (might be a VERY long time, and I ideally don’t want to work two part time jobs)? 

TLDR; wanting to move out asap, but don’t have qualifications to get a full-time position in ideal positions (Director or Business Analyst).

Hoping to hear some good news back for a data analyst role that I’ve interviewed for as I’ve gotten some good feedback at the last stage. Back in the initial screener call with HR, when they asked me my salary expectations I said i was looking for between 30-35,000 and the recruiter said that the actual band for the role was 35,000-40,000 depending on experience.

I’ve obviously committed a rookie mistake and now they know they can lowball but I wanted to ask if it was possible if I could get the 40,000 number should I be offered the role. How would I go about positioning myself to try to get that or at least a number close to it?

For context this would be my first data role as I was previously a sales development rep at a tech company to make matters even worse. Do i have any chance of getting more than the 35k?

Do I dislike my career? Or am I just burned out?","Hi all - apologies if this is not the right subreddit for this advice. I could really use some guidance and thoughts from others on my situation. I am 26F, with a bachelor's and master's degree in information technology. I currently work full-time in my field and am pursuing a Ph.D. part-time. I have worked the same job since I finished undergrad about six years ago, progressively working my way up. When I first started, I was extremely passionate about my field, constantly studying and learning new things. Over the past year, I have become extremely depressed and it has been difficult to gain my passion back. FWIW, I work at a start-up company in data analytics where I'm consistently changing roles, bosses, and peers due to high turnover. I stay because I have great mentors there, but I also have subsets of individuals who consistently belittle me. I have no clue if it's because I'm young/female because I feel my counterparts who are men are treated differently. I recently took a semester-long break from my Ph.D. program and have been pursuing a certification in personal training and Pilates instruction. I have really enjoyed learning about anatomy and physiology, and in general, I feel excitement again about pursuing something that has been a long-time hobby of mine. I know this 'side gig' is not even comparable in terms of my current income/chosen career, but I am considering a switch to a different field (maybe nursing?) where a career might be viable. I am a first-generation college graduate and have a lot of pressure to continue my current path. I know my family will be disappointed if I don't complete my Ph.D., and I feel some level of disappointment for getting so far into a career I am not enjoying.

  
tldr; Beginning to dislike working in the tech field, to the point where it is affecting my mental and physical health. Am I stupid for wanting something else at this point? Or, should I stick it out and hope things get better?

He sometimes lengthens my leash, but I sense he mostly wants me keeping my talents in the team. This is despite me never missing deadlines and always turning great work, even if I'm working on special projects.

Now I feel stifled and think I have more to offer. I'm planning on going to my bosses, bosses, boss and proposing a fixer position for me that would let me fix well known issues in the company under his direct guidance. Right now I have the potential backing of 2 VP in other groups along with various other random folks. I also have new but decent relationships with the big wigs I would be proposing to. 

 I'm planning on putting together a job description and analysis of key points of interest along with strategic plans and my updated resume. I think there's a moderate chance of success here. (60 - 70% if I convince the VPs to openly back me.) If this doesn't work, I will propose a similar but smaller plan with the VPs backing me. If they also won't open a role for me I will likely leave the company.

My big question- how do I proceed without pissing off my current team in the event of success? 

Do I tell my current boss before I make the proposal?

Trust is big in my team and I have a good relationship with my boss. I worry he will feel slighted if I don't talk to him and at least let him know my intention.

Other reasons I'm leaving include over-work (worked nearly 40 days straight upwards of 80 hours a week on my last big project), poor and frustrating systems, an unrewarded team (we never get off-sites or team building of any kind), and little near-term career growth. I want to make director in the next year if I can, but I don't think there's room for another director within my team- neither payroll or responsibilities.

So what do you redditors think?",MyPenWroteThis,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1718404617,2024-06-14 22:36:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dg3a3x/how_do_i_propose_a_new_role_to_management_without/,6,2024

It does not help that I work with people 30-40 years older than me who complain at me for taking a job that someone who is more in need might need like a mother with children. I find that very inappropriate because they know nothing about me and my situation, however it means I can't even talk to someone at work about how I am feeling because they just disregard me. It has definitely taken a massive toll on myself physically and mentally.

I kept trying to push to get the CFO Venezuela job which is a rank 4. It’s extremely rare to get two ranks jumps but since no one wants to go there, I wanted to give it a try and to push in this direction with the higher ups.

So far they’ve been pretty open about it but they never ever guaranteed I’d be the chosen one. They also never declined. The big issue here is that no one knows when the current CFO Venezuela is going to live. On a side note, I visited Venezuela last November and liked it. 

Very recently, I was in discussion with the CFO of Mexico and there may be a good position which is ranked 5.

So basically I either pass on this offer without any guarantee to get the Venezuela job or I take it and may regret later if the current CFO Venezuela leaves in 6 months.

1dfzmhv,Dont really know what to do,"Hi everyone,

I work at a software company, mainly in research and data entry for a product I've been involved with for almost two years. Although I'm not a developer, I have extensive IT experience and have been passionate about computers since high school. This background has made me a great fit for my current role.

I've worked for major tech companies in my career, so I know how to communicate with managers and handle professional correspondence. My current company is smaller, and many employees lack this experience.

Unfortunately, I made a poor career move when my wife was pregnant, which led to a significant pay cut. Thankfully, a friend recommended me to this company, where he also works. I accepted the job because of the better salary and the opportunity, despite limited choices at the time.

After seven months, I mastered the product and was promoted to admin. When my co-admin left, I took on more responsibilities, including creating guidelines and training newcomers.

The company is German, and although I don't speak German, we conduct meetings in English. Most of my colleagues from my home country struggle with English.

After ten months, I was moved to another project for a major client, working alongside the same friend who initially recommended me. Despite his lack of contribution and poor English skills, we both got significant raises after a year—50% for me and 40% for him. Now, I'm the go-to person for any issues or questions about the product.

I'm frustrated because my colleague's lack of skills means I do most of the work, yet he still receives almost the same raise. I'm learning SQL to improve my prospects, but I worry I'll face similar situations elsewhere.

I'd appreciate your advice on handling this. How should I approach this situation without letting it affect me too much?

1dfwzqr,Frustrated ,"Not sure if this is the best place to do so but I need to vent.

A couple months ago, I had multiple interviews with 2 different companies. Both wanted to hire me, the one offer was for much more money than the other. I was just getting back on my feet from a surgery in October of last year. So I was concerned about the physical portion of the job. I'm not afraid of work, it's work I have done my whole career, but was concerned that while my mind said I could do it that my body would say FU to my mind.

The other position would have some physical work to ir, but nowhere near as much. Plus it was an opportunity to learn about a different set of products.

I did not want to start the one job and find out I couldn't do it and have to quit I'd be embarrassed to do so. So I had a decision to make. Take more money and possibly not make it or less money but could be happier with my choice. 

You can probably guess from my tone I took the less money job. The location was supposed to open in May, then there was a delay in another project which was going to push my location back. A couple weeks later I followed up with them to check the status. The owner was extremely focused on this other project and had the whole company working on it. 

Fast forward a few more weeks and I send another email. That was Monday morning. I did not hear back until an hour ago. So I tried to get over being ignored all week and read it. Basically the contact tells me that during this time waiting they kept interviewing people and picked someone else!! I was like WTF! Went on to tell me that they would still like to have me for a part time role, AND I'd have to interview for it!!!

I was so mad I couldn't see straight. I was patient, understanding and then I get blown off like hey sorry.
It took me a while to gather my thoughts and respond to them without going scorched earth on them.  I somehow kept it professional while expressing my disappointment. 

How in the hell can someone do something like this? As soon as they ""found"" this other person I should have been told then so I could resume my job search!

1dfvf97,Where to go from here,"I am a transitioning teacher. I left teaching due to a variety of factors. I have many transferable skills due to my background in education and program director roles in the past and have amazing recommendations. The problem is, I’m fairly young. I’m in my late 20s, and most of my experience is teaching as I graduated with my master’s in teaching in 2020 and have been in schools ever since. I was a program director at a small startup in 2018 when I graduated college, and then went to grad school soon after. Though I am competent and great at what I do, I am aware that many other applicants have more years of experience.

I’ve had my resume professionally edited. If I apply to a job, I reach out directly to the hiring manager or recruiter. I have great experience for the positions I’m applying to including instructional design, creating educational marketing content, data analytics, etc. However, I am not getting any bites.

Currently, I work at a college in enrollment. It’s the most under stimulating job I’ve ever had, which wouldn’t be a horrible problem except that I’m not getting paid a livable wage. The job was not at all what was advertised, and the college is honestly just a shit show. It is most likely going to lose its accreditation in a couple of months after a multiple year battle. My partner and I moved in with family for the time being, as he is starting his own company and I was transitioning careers. We don’t have to pay rent currently, so at first I didn’t mind not making a ton of money. However, now, I feel stuck. I make less than what is considered a livable wage for one person in this state and struggle to pay bills. I am bored and broke.

I’ve used my desk time to apply to 100s of jobs, tailoring each application and writing cover letters for each. Rejection after rejection. I even had a call set up with a higher-up at a large company that I was excited about so that I could at least network and ask questions. They completely ghosted me. 

The last thing I want to do is sound whiny as I am technically lucky to have a simple job and some sort of income. However, I aspire for more - I am very purpose-driven, hence my desire to become a teacher in the first place. I am simply frustrated that I chose a career in a dying field, and now cannot find something that supports me. I am experienced, capable, and passionate. However, I can’t help but feel like it’s a game I don’t know the rules to.

I wanted to let y’all know that I’m launching my coaching business.  Leadership Coaching, Career Coaching and Life Transition are three of my specialties. 

I have over 20 years experience in leadership positions(Team leader in Special Operations, Tactical commander in private security contracting and multiple leadership positions in the corporate and startup world). And have worked every job you can think of. From McDonalds to Special Operations to retail, service industry and now corporate America and startups. I’ve worked in other countries and have also successfully made many different life transitions (military to civilian life, major family deaths, relocation, and many more). 

A requirement for my international coaching certification says that I have to give a certain number of coaching sessions so I came on here to see if any of ya’ll would be interested in doing one free session with me? Any following sessions would be at my normal hourly rate but the first one is completely free with no obligations.
If anyone is interested please reach out via my website and go ahead and book an appointment. You can schedule directly on my site by going to the ‘Services’ nav bar menu and selecting ‘Book Appointment’. I use calendly so it’s very easy and straightforward. 

I hope I’m able to help some of you with your ife journeys!

1dftqeq,Which IT Co-Op should I choose? (URGENT!),"
I have two Information technology co-op offers, one from a government job that pays $17.20 and one from a smaller and new growing company that pays $21.00. The smaller company has quite a few opportunities for growth, and I’d be able to move around likely to another department. In addition to that, they like to keep people on co-op for at least 1 year, if not as a permanent job. The government job with the city though also leaves room for growth, and if I do well I could probably co-op there for more than just a semester too. It seems like the job with the small company should be the clear winner, but the thing is if I was able to get a job with the city, even if there is an economic downturn city jobs likely wouldn’t be impacted as much. At least that’s the advice my parents gave me. I’m still not sure though. The pay difference is quite big, but my main worry is whether or not a co-op with the city would end up offering me the opportunity to co-op for longer than a semester and turn into a job.

1dfthr7,Researching careers - any advice?,"Hi everyone, I'm a freshman in college and I'm starting to look at career options as I begin my internship search. I'm at a non-target school but on a full ride in the best honors program, and it's very likely that I get into my school's investment management group (which has a 100% job placement rate).

I'm looking for something financial, although I'm open to other suggestions, with reasonable WLB (50-60 hours a week, although I'm ok with higher for the first few years), something that isn't primarily sales focused, and something that pays in the 100k range to start with 200k being reasonable as mid-career pay. My end career goal is to end up in a CXO position, although not necessarily for a F500 company.

I have technical skills (including Python, R, Stata, SQL, and Excel) that I am looking to utilize (although not in a primary data analysis role), as well as a dual major in Economics and something more technical (I'm considering Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics, and Statistics). I will also conduct quantitative economic research over the next few years.

Additionally, my scholarship pays for me to get a masters degree in the same 4 years it takes to get my undergraduate degree, so can anyone recommend a good degree to pursue (I'm considering Applied Statistics, Applied Mathematics, and Quantitative Economics, but I'm open to suggestions). Whatever degree I pursue, I plan on taking some advanced (PhD-level) mathematical and economic classes to develop skills like quantitative economic data analysis and demand estimation.",DaddyOfSwag,1,1.0,0,1718378730,2024-06-14 15:25:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dfthr7/researching_careers_any_advice/,6,2024
1dftdlj,Should I Pick Up a Second Job?,"Hi everyone!

I just started my full-time job at a non-profit after graduating college. It's a typical 9-5 and I usually go to the gym or find plans after work. It's been really nice having weekends free because I've been working them for years in the restaurant industry. Recently, someone offered a guest bartending position on Saturdays and I'm really debating taking it. It's a classic sports bar so it'll be loud and full of drunk people.

The extra cash would be nice but is it worth going back to an industry that I was so happy to leave behind? I have some big expenses like car insurance coming up, so I don't know if I should conservatively budget a salary of $55k or pick up this gig.

1dft4y1,Interviewing with another company where they know my Managers - Can they tell my current boss?,"
 I work in media/advertising sales. I have been in my current role and company for about a year making $55k and was promised a commission structure to be implemented since I started which hasn’t happened and I feel stagnant now in my position despite asking my manager for more things to take on constantly with no changes. One of our competitor companies just opened up a position nearly identical to mine with a salary of $80k + commission. I was already a connection with the hiring manager and I interviewed on Wednesday (which went fabulous) and have another final interview today. I really want this position but i’m worried now because the manager I interviewed with said he knows all of my managers and several AEs I work with due to some of them previously working at this other media company. Is there any like silent rule that it’s not ethical to let employees/managers of my current company know that I’m interviewing with this other company or is that typical across industries were there are mutual connections? I am not scared that they would have anything negative to say about me if he mentioned me interviewing - but am more worried about if I don’t get this job, then they know I am actively searching for something else and could fire me? Is that possible? ",bunnyfunnycute,2,1.0,2,1718377835,2024-06-14 15:10:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dft4y1/interviewing_with_another_company_where_they_know/,6,2024

The big problem is, no more flexibility. After the first few months when I'll go to the office every day (which is fair) to get used to the job, I might get 1 day a week to work from home. I feel like I'm crazy to give up so much flexibility, where I get to do my job but it's not my whole life.

1dfrvad,"Been stuck in a cycle of stagnation, and need to make a change. Need advice/recommendations on what my best prospects or avenues might be.","Early 30s and stuck working in a senior claims analyst role in the death claims department of an insurance company. I like the company and have advanced this far, but it has become increasingly evident that there will be little room for advancement at the pace im seeking, nor will I be able to attain the pay I need to accomplish my personal goals outside of work. I make around $50k. Ideally, I would like to make between $70k to $80k which I feel isn’t completely unrealistic, but even $60k would make a huge difference in my life personally. Obviously the more the better.

The initial step I took was looking for similar positions and higher titles with other insurance companies, but those positions are few and far between in death claims. Most claims jobs hiring are property, casualty and auto and my experience does not appear to translate given the number of “you don’t meet our qualifications” emails I receive. 

I’ve also tried switching departments, but even with the assistance and recommendation to those department heads by my peers, that has also currently gone nowhere. 

Lastly, I have a bachelors in psychology. However, a bachelors only gets you so far in applicable fields, and jobs that would take a bachelors where I could apply my degree are mostly social work jobs that pay way less than what I currently earn.

So at this point I’m really not sure where to go/what to look for. My first thought was to look at sales jobs. I don’t have much experience in sales, and wouldn’t consider it something I’m exactly good at, but have wondered if I should just learn and give it a shot given the potential to earn more.

I’m also wondering whether I should go back to school. I could start over and get a degree in finance. Or I could look at masters programs for industrial and organizational psych. However, this means more student loan debt, which is a problem I’m already trying to solve. 

And that’s where I am. I’ve hit a road block mentally and need outside perspective. Your input is greatly appreciated.

TLDR: Mid 30s with a bachelors degree in psych, working as a senior analyst in life insurance death claims department making $50k. Need to turn things around and earn more and need advice.

1dfru76,"Help! I need to quit my job for my mental health, but my struggling boss needs me","Hi everyone,

I am really struggling right now with my mental health and my job, and I wanted to ask for some advice. I am a GIS analyst who works for a small GIS company. I have been struggling with depression for many years, but this job used to be a good fit for me because I worked for a boss who allowed me a lot of flexibility with hours, taking time off if I needed it, etc. He was also reasonable in his standards and was clear and open in communication.

Six months ago, my boss retired and sold the company to his co-owner, so now the co-owner of the company is my boss. She lives two states away and I have never met her in person. The job is now completely virtual, and I work at home. I had had some work interactions with my new boss in the past, but we never worked closely together on a regular basis.

Now this job has put me in a real bind. My new boss is terrible at communicating her needs, and she is completely overwhelmed with her own tasks because she didn't plan effectively for running the company alone. She is so stressed that she forgets to tell me important details, gets angry at me for not matching her sometimes ridiculously high standards, and is honestly just draining for me to talk to. Dealing with her has been making my depression much worse, and I am really struggling to just get my job done to the standards that are required for our clients.

I want to quit. My mental health is suffering immeasurably, and I have already told her that I am leaving the job at the end of the year to move overseas. I don't particularly need this job for my own benefit (I have money saved up) anymore, and I am moving away from the professional world for my future goals. So I feel like I am not personally invested in this job in any way at this point.

The real bind I am in right now though is that I am her only real full-time employee and the only employee that has the technical skills required to complete many of our tasks. If I quit, she is completely screwed, and her company which is already struggling may collapse. This company is her livelihood in a way it is not for me at this point.

I feel completely burned out right now, and I'm worried that I am about to hit a wall in terms of my depression. But there is this massive added pressure that my depression may be causing someone else to face literal financial ruin right now.

What should I do? I really feel stuck in a bad place right now.",eriserror,0,0.5,14,1718374414,2024-06-14 14:13:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dfru76/help_i_need_to_quit_my_job_for_my_mental_health/,6,2024

1dfr9b7,Should I stay or should I go? ,"I cannot decide what to do!!! 

Option 1.
Stay in my current job. It's pretty easy, I feel comfortable and it's stable, good salary, 3 days in the office (long commute 1.5 hours each way) but the hours are flexible and i do my own thing. I don't feel valued, no one pays any attention to anything I do. I have no ""friends"" there, it's not a fun environment. There's no care for the staff. But tbh I don't care about my role, this career is not my passion. 

Option 2.
I've been offered a new job for a huge company. The culture is a big positive as they really take care of their people. The salary is the same. The job title is similar-ish (well it's technically a step down) but I don't care about that. The hours are flexible and it's 1 day in the office per week/fortnight (longer commute than my currently one). I'd be travelling to south east asia every few months. 

I've been agonising about this for weeks. The change terrifies me.

If I don't go for it, then I'm stuck in my boring, but low stress job and I feel I'll regret it. If I do go for it, it's a huge transition period of new people, new processes, everything... Months of stress... I might hate. I also lose the stability that I have now.

1dfr3sp,My pregnant mentor gets irritated and angry easily. Im new and this frustrates me so much Im considering quitting.,"Hello careeradvice,

What should I do?

Background:
So I just joined a company last week. I was supposed to take over her responsibilities until she comes back and then I'll be given another project. My first week was fine. Its apparent shes really talented, good at her job and has a lot of experience. Me and her are about the same age if I were to guess but I graduated late so Im still a junior engineer.

I kinda noticed shes really vocal about other people. Our team is really new, like shes the only one with the most experience, even our (f) manager seems younger than her.  I kinda noticed shes really vocal about other people. Shes even sour with our manager (who is like a very nice lady). She talks about how inefficient other people are with other coworkers in our office. Everyday is the same. She constantly speaks loud I cant even concentrate at work.

So heres where I come in. Im a newbie in this company. Idk, maybe its the accent, maybe theres too many things I have to pay attention to and do at the same time. Im just slow for some reason and sometimes I had to ask her to repeat a few times, which she will snap.

Mind you its my first two weeks, and if I dont get things right the second time (because obviously everyone can do anything with just a piece of note and having seen things done once), she raises her voice, scolds me like im a fucking child, tells me I need to do this, and that, and Im unorganized and she constantly reminds me and other people that I wont be here in the team for long and when shes back shes gonna fix any mess that happens while I take over. I mean Im supposed to take another project with another team after that, but that is like very inconsiderate and condescending.

What frustrates me is I came from another company with a better IT system that I dont have to rely on 10 fucking Excel sheets, 100 pages of scanned PDF, 5 tabs open just to put more info in a horribly built Excel reporting. So not only do I need to improve my technical know how here, I need to somehow get used to the way of working that SHE created and done for 10 years.

I feel like shit when I come to work. I lied to HR yesterday for a review meeting when they asked me  if I feel happy here. I do feel great when shes not snippy. I dont want to be confrontational either but to think that I gave up a second offer just be be treated like this? I cant deal with this toxic mentality. And the constant reminder of ""oh he will just take over for a few months and then he'll leave our team"" make me fully regret my decision despite having a great manager, a great office, great pay, great commute.

What should I do here? Im a temp worker that takes over different projects in this specific company for different departments. Im new and shes like 10 years of experience. I dont think filing complaint will do any favor. 

At this point I really dont know if its her being hormonal or her being an asshole. Im not a confrontational person so i just keep it in. But at some point I feel like I will pop.",wasgayt,2,1.0,3,1718372445,2024-06-14 13:40:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dfr3sp/my_pregnant_mentor_gets_irritated_and_angry/,6,2024

1dfojxi,Here's How to Choose a Job Like a Heartbreaker,"A follower asked me how to choose between two jobs:

* **Company A**: It's on the rise, I like it, and I'm good at it.
* **Company B**: My former boss (several levels up) is there, and its reputation is better than A's, but B is on a downward slope.
* The compensation is the same for both.

I suggested he choose Company A.

# Reasons:

1. **Former Boss at Company B**: You're a newcomer there, and the KPIs are heavy. Survival is a question, and you might not report directly to him.
2. **Downward Slope at Company B**: In a declining company, there’s a lot of internal politics and complexity. While you can learn about human nature, it's hard to achieve anything.
3. **Upward Trend at Company A**: In a rising environment, young people have important growth opportunities. A has a promising future.

# Recommendations:

* **Politely Decline B**: Don’t reveal your real reasons. Keep in touch. If you choose A and it’s a mistake, you can still go to B. But if you choose B and it’s a mistake, leaving can break connections. Wait until your former boss stabilizes B, then consider switching from A to B, which could even boost your value.

# Job Selection Formula:

1. Upward Business Trend
2. Direct Boss’s Character
3. Business Line Boss’s Ability
4. Business Line Boss’s Character

1dfo1j8,Startup or Multinational?,"Hey everyone,

I'll get straight to the point. I am 25 years old, have 2 years of work experience as a strategy analyst and product analyst at startups but i graduated a couple of months ago (I worked and went to college at the same time). Anyways, I'm currently working at a startup as a Financial Analyst earning 1000 USD per month (not from the US). I'm not in love with the job (not really my strong suit) and I have two offers, wondering which you would take:

Offer 1: Working as Chief of Staff for an early stage startup focused on the medical device sector (Huge potential, but a lot of roadblocks ahead, mainly related to getting the device approved by our FDA equivalent, getting patent approval, and finishing the medical study). Salary would be significantly lower (800 USD per month), but I have been told in 3-6 months my salary COULD be improved to 1200 USD per month, assuming the company meets certain goals. I would also get equity in the company further down the line, but this is also contingent upon company goals being met. (Obtaining a patent, getting a medical license for the product etc) I feel slightly underqualified for this role, as I only have two years of work experience (In startups though), but the opportunity is huge, albeit VERY risky. I also don't like the amount of roadblocks that are ahead in order to launch the product, as many of them are things out of our control. 

Offer 2: Working as a Strategy Marketing Analyst for a ride sharing company. Salary is SIGNIFICANTLY better (1400 USD with all benefits) and I get private healthcare insurance and other benefits. However, I have NEVER worked in Marketing in my life. I have worked in strategy (part of the reason I got the offer, as the job includes many strategy related components)  but I am worried about making a jump to such a different career path without any previous knowledge or experience about Marketing, and also worried this job experience might narrow any future opportunities I might get, as i'm aware first jobs tend to shape your CV.  The company is also known for being extremely competitive with VERY long hours. (But I'm used to this working for startups, so it's not a HUGE disadvantage).

What would you do? Any help is much appreciated!",simat007,1,1.0,1,1718362458,2024-06-14 10:54:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dfo1j8/startup_or_multinational/,6,2024

I would just like:

1. Flexibility on hybrid schedule, if not fully remote - I’m disabled and my illness flares up, they don’t make exceptions or “provide long term accommodations at this company”
2. No dual monitors! I’m tired, my eyes hurt. Laptop preferred but not required.

I know most finance companies are doing the in-person thing again and my CEO said “you don’t have to work here” in an interview so I don’t care anymore.

1dflwxn,Should i quit my first job already?,"I’m 17 and 2 weeks ago i got my first job at walmart which was pretty exciting considering ive never worked before. The minimum wage here is $15 which is fine by me and i actually quite enjoy being a stocker there. i’ve made a few mistakes such as stocking the wrong department, leaving pallets and such in the wrong place for back room and putting boxes on the wrong pallets when unloading a truck. All things my sup has corrected and so far they are both really nice and haven’t given me any problems. Well today i guess i made a much bigger mistake that i knew was wrong, it was just one of those things where you’re working hard all day and then the one second you pull your phone out, your supervisor comes walking by and then tells you to get back to work yknow? I was really rushing today as i was told and so all my overstock i just put on the side of the aisle out of the way to be more efficient (i was told to do this since it saves time). Well today i had 4 pallets left and i got them all done in 2 hours but i had to clock out at 10, well 10 came and i still had 2 more pallets that i needed to clean up. Problem was, they had no space since it was all just empty folded boxes and plastic on them. In this situation i’ve been told that it’s fine just find your supervisor and let them know that there’s still boxes and overstock that needs to be handled. in the past, i have done this. Well this time i just ended up walking across an aisle and letting my friend know that i was clocking out and that i would see him tomorrow, then we got to talking about the weekend, well my supervisor saw this and comes walking over, before i could say anything he asked to talk to me which was fine, he asked if i was clocked out, to which i replied yes. he then told me that i can’t leave the boxes on the side of the aisle like that when i clock out, “i can fire you for that”, he also said that im distracting my coworker while off the clock to which he also said “i can fire both of you for that as well”. He just let me know that if i absolutely have to clock out then to let someone know. I already knew this but again it was wrong time wrong place. An hour later i’m home and my friend calls me to let me know that i did a really bad job and that i left a mess (i had left about 30 boxes small to medium sized on the side of the aisle by my 2 pallets). He also said that both my supervisors as well as a few coworkers were cleaning it all up and were talking about me, saying stuff like “it looks like a 12 year old worked here” and laughing about how bad of a business decision i made. He even told me that they said “i don’t know how he could think this is ok” It’s been eating me up all night…i feel like i’ve ruined my already mediocre reputation, ive let down my supervisors, my coworkers and my friend by getting him trouble. I feel dumb and useless, like a burden to everyone else for doing that. I haven’t slept all night because of it and i’m more nervous to go in today then i was on my first day. Do i just quit? and not go in? i dont need this job and i feel like at this point ive done nothing helpful and only made everyone else’s job harder, sorry if this is really long, i have no one to talk to or ask questions to so i just let it all sit on my mind and it eats me up. thanks to anyone who responds.",Majestic_Ad7055,1,0.6700000166893005,7,1718353448,2024-06-14 08:24:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dflwxn/should_i_quit_my_first_job_already/,6,2024

1dfl5iu,"I went for the ""brand name"" instead of ""job description"" and I now regret it. Is it too late to jump ship?","I am a sophomore majoring in economics, wanting to work in the data science/ policy anaylsis field. Currently I am doing an internship at a bulge-bracket bank, but at the compliance department. I absolutely hate it here. The work is super boring and there's also no real work to be done here as an intern. I was told I'd be conducting research in policies, but effectively I am only doing administrative work. Even my managers at work are wondering why I was placed here in this department. I sort of expected this tbh, but I thought maybe I could apply some programming and DS in my research, but in reality, I was mostly doing so many insignificant tasks I'm not even following a project of any sort to apply my skills. I now realise that I am not advancing in my career in anyway by choosing the brand name.

The story is a bit complicated: so, everyone who's trying to break into DS knows how bad the market is recently and I was forced to take anything. Originally, this compliance internship was my only offer and I accepted it, but a few days after accepting, another small consulting firm with actual data science job duties invited me to an interview, and I was so glad but also torn between whether I should go through with the compliance internship. In the end, I was appealed to the security and certainty of the signed offer, as well as the brand name of the bank, and rejected the interview (In hindsight I could have still gone to the interview).

Dear human resources managers, would it seem too desperate for me to email and ask them for another interview opportunity? It's been about 2 weeks since I've rejected their interview invitation, but I am not sure if they have already recruited anyone yet. How should I explain in my email of this sudden turn in attitude? Also, am I basically burning a bridge at my bank if I terminate my contract as early as one week in? Thank you everyone.

1dfipsg,Is this wording professionally acceptable to tell my former team lead and her current interim supervisor I'm off a case?,"I was promoted last month to an advisory position for my former unit. I've had a new supervisor since then, unrelated to my former unit. Former supervisor has retired. Former team lead is probably going to get the vacant position. Another unit supervisor is interim over my old unit until a replacement is selected. I was transitioning into the advisory role while primarily closing out my cases. Former lead has gone Rambo on me and is nit-picking my work to death (not unusual for them, this is a running concern if they become supervisor). I see the writing on the wall, and, combined with other elements I have going on in my life, I've submitted my 2 week notice which I'm almost halfway thru.

Still working to tie up my cases, one of which is a program which *technically*, team lead should have taken over the car when it became a different program; instead, we have two cases running, mine and theirs. 

A third party inquired about the status. Team lead throws it to me to respond. And apparently, I responded incorrectly. I literally can't get work tied up for all the mistakes being sent my way. I challenged her interpretation of something, she ""says"" she sent it up for clarification and that she was right and I was wrong. *Which is fine"" , but, now I have all these instructions on what to do and I know team lead is going to scrutinize every step I make when they should really do it themself. Is the following email reply ok? Interim supervisor would be cc'd (and there's a chance they'd tell me I'd have to stay on the case):


"" I was certainly incorrect about the letter and I'll alert George to my mistake. He said he sent this to you on April 22 with the FL2 - had you mentioned to him that the letter wasn't acceptable? I sent requests on the basis that the client could competently sign his name.

I'm feeling very ineffective at getting any further progress done on this case, and, this is an higher program application - George was looking to you for guidance on how to proceed as they're trying to get the client placed.

1dfhs7g,Same exact comments from last years review with a new direct report,"I could really use some guidance or advice as I’m unsure & young in my professional career. I work in a corporate setting and have been in my current role for three and a half years as of this month and with the company for over 4 years. About 9 months ago my direct report changed to someone who’s been with the organization for 20+ years, but new to my department with no previous experience in our field.

Today was my performance evaluation. The discussion went well and I understood the ratings. However, I feel that I was rated unfairly on a few items. I pointed out one thing that was updated after discussion. I felt like I had improved from the previous year and I took on more of the extra items with professional development & leadership training, certification, mentorship, training interns/a new associate, and leading a few projects. After thinking on it, I was curious and wanted to compare this years review to the previous years review. So I pulled up all of my previous reviews and quickly saw that all of the comments left on this years review were copied and pasted from last years review with the exception on two of them where an extra sentence was added or slightly worded differently.

I received a lower rating on this years review compared to last years review on 4 items where they were “commendable” on last years review, but not on this years review even though the comments were copied and pasted. So I had better quality work and was more involved and received a lower rating this year compared to last. The comments on those items were the same word-for-word. I suppose they thought I wouldn’t notice.

I’m not sure how to feel about this, because I’m not sure if these reviews are just for the budget in the end and if this even really matters in the bigger picture. To me, it should really matter though because I’m the only one responsible for my career. But how much of that (my career growth) also falls on a direct report or management?

Is this something I should address or move on from? 
I had a discussion with my mentor this afternoon, but at the time I hadn’t investigated to see the copied/pasted comments. I plan to update my mentor on that to get their feedback.

Background info:
 
21F currently working as a system administrator for a local government for 1 year. I consider it a fake sysadmin job, I don't really do much for the system I manage (enterprise asset management). This is pretty much a dead end job

I have 4 years of experience as a IT specialist for a small car wash and 2 years of experience as a IT service desk/consultant for a local university. 

I have my bachelor's in business administration - IT management and a MBA focusing in IT management 

I would want to do the CompTia Trifecta certifications. I currently only have the Google Cyber security certification 


Here is my thought process on pros/cons for each 

Doing the program:

Pro: 
I'll finally feel complete with my education 
I'll be able to get the doctorate at 23
I know it won't help me right away, but I would imagine in 10 years or so it might give me a leg up on competition 
I could maybe teach adjunct 
Program would only take 1-1.5 years
I love school, so I'll feel happier being back in school

Cons:
Kinda expensive, ROI is somewhat in question 
Would be hard to manage work, school, and family (my daughter was born 2 months ago, she would be 4 months when I start the program)
There is a slight chance I won't want to finish the program, therefore wasting money 

Skipping the program and doing certs:

Pro:
Cheaper, might spend 1-2k vs 12-18k for the doctorate 
Easier to balance home and school life 
I would likely see a sooner ROI if I can land a new job from the new certs 
Would add more credibility to my resume
Not as much money wasted if I decide I don't want to do a certain cert 

Con: 
Wouldn't feel all that satisfaction after finishing the certs
Might not actually land me a new job. Market is rough in IT right now 
I would have a harder time studying the content for the certs vs the classes I would take with the doctorate 

I feel like either way I can't go wrong, I can always do certs after I finish the program but I don't know for sure if the doctorate would actually help me",AslAware,1,1.0,4,1718335769,2024-06-14 03:29:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dfhfqd/doctorate_or_certifications/,6,2024
1dfhdry,How do I tell my boss I'm quitting?,"I currently work for a job that I love, in a tiny firm that has a crazy low hire rate. It's in the finance world, and there's definitely information that I handle daily that you wouldn't want competitor firms to know. Unfortunately, for personal reasons not at all related to work, I need to move to another city in August, and this city that I'm moving to has a pretty obvious firm that is a direct competitor (and likely who I will work for in the future).

I might be one of the few people who say this, but I really do like my boss-- I entered this field as a young professional who didn't know where she was going, and, in the past year, I've learned so much and I've found my passion through him. I've literally grown a decade of industry knowledge in a few months because of him. He's been super supportive, and I genuinely couldn't have asked for a better office environment.

But now, I don't know how to tell him that I'm quitting. There's no contractual obligation for me to tell him until the week before I leave, but it feels like a shitty thing to do to tell him so last minute. I'm scared that if I tell him in the next few days, he'll fire me on the spot as a means of damage control for leaked information since, next week, we're doing an overall portfolio holdings review. I have no intentions of sharing this kind of information, or really even staying in the same industry, but I don't know how to convey this. My boss is a great person, but loyalty to the firm is his top value pillar, and the last guy who quit and went to work for someone else is not spoken of well in the office; since my boss is so well-connected, I'm nervous that this kind of move will damage my future network for years since I'm so young.",PrizeDesperate7091,4,0.75,13,1718335583,2024-06-14 03:26:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dfhdry/how_do_i_tell_my_boss_im_quitting/,6,2024
1dfh99g,How can I get over the past?,"Hello! I'm new to this sub and wonder if anyone else can relate. I would appreciate encouragement.

I'm 33 and will graduate with my master's this year in a field that I am very excited about. At age 29, I got my ""dream job,"" worked there for a few years, and would love to get a similar job after graduation. Overall, I feel confident in my skills and ability to land another great job.

However, I am also fearful of re-entering the workforce and have very bad memories of the early part of my career. I did my undergrad in an unrelated field and was totally miserable from ages 21-28. In this period of time, I was let go from four different jobs. These were professional jobs (not fast food, retail, etc.). My supervisors yelled at and insulted me in front of my coworkers. They told me I was incompetent. Many days, I went home crying. It was traumatizing to lose multiple jobs and struggle to pay my bills. I was so anxious and depressed that I went on meds. I didn't have a boyfriend or support system, and my parents were disappointed in me. It was honestly the worst period of my life.

Most successful people say that their mistakes taught them something valuable, but I don't feel that way at all. It feels like those years were a literal waste. I was in the wrong field. I was surrounded by rude people who didn't respect me. My self-esteem was non-existent, and it destroyed my mental health. Instead, I could have found a job that was a much better fit, maybe stayed with the same company and gotten promoted, etc. It hurts to think of the meaningful things I could have been doing with my life.

Sure, I'm successful now, and I'm making my dreams come true. I realize that I will never see those people again, but it's a part of my life that I wish I could erase. It makes me cringe so bad. It doesn't inspire me. The memories still haunt me to this day, and I'm not sure how to get over it and move on.",beautifulllstars,3,1.0,2,1718335159,2024-06-14 03:19:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dfh99g/how_can_i_get_over_the_past/,6,2024

1dfgocy,What’s my career path from here?,"Hello everyone. I have a masters in Industrial Engineering. I joined my current company in 2019 when I was jobless and took whatever I could. They are in the wholesale business and distribute finished goods. I was an Operations Engineer and there were a lot of improvements to be done on the floor since a new Warehouse Management System (WMS) was just implemented. There wasn't anyone on the WMS team other than 1 guy who was immensely overworked and he was also handling the ERP system and ad hoc analytics from the leadership team. That's when I decided to take on some of the WMS development tasks myself to avoid delays on my projects (which turned out to be a huge mistake). It was easy to learn the system since the entirety of the system was SQL-based. Fast forward to today, they've made me the manager of the WMS solution and I have a team of 3 software developers. Most of my daily work is being spent on resolving WMS tickets from the warehouse, coaching them on the Agile framework, reviewing their code to make it better and I feel I've completely deviated from what I want do for my career, which is supply chain/Industrial Engineering. Over the last 5 years, there have been only a few projects which were related to those. The reason I had stay here for this long was because of my green card application. I've also brought this up to my manager every year that I want to be involved more on the Analytics/Engineering side but all he says is to get the WMS to be stable and that I don't have any other choice. Now am the crossroads of what I need to do to get back on my career track and the fact my company isn't supporting my career growth in any way and that am spending my peak career time doing irrelevant work, is giving me a lot of stress. All my visa and green card applications are done and I've been applying to other companies for over a month. The response currently isn't that great. I am willing to  leave my manager role and move to a senior engineer role but even for those positions, I don't meet all their requirements. If I want to move to an entry level role, either the company is rejecting me since am overqualified or the salary is way too low than what am making now. I don't want to apply for a manager role since I feel I don't have enough experience with the fundamentals.

Any suggestions from other supply chain / Industrial Engineering folks here?",moss_shrute,1,1.0,0,1718333209,2024-06-14 02:46:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dfgocy/whats_my_career_path_from_here/,6,2024
1dfg2k6,What did you get your master’s in?,"What was your route to where you are?

Hello. Im just curious on what master’s some of you have gotten that have led you to where you are? Like the routes you are taking/have taken?

I have a BA in psychology and am currently looking into master programs. I always said I wouldn’t go to grad school when I graduated undergrad in 2021, but I changed my mind after working at a crisis stabilization unit. I worked with alot of mental and behavioral health professionals like LCSWs, PMHNPs, LPCs, BCBAs, Psychologist, etc. There was a little bit of everything. Working there made me realize why I fell in love with psychology, again.

My goal is to become a Psychologist with a focus on ABA(possibly). There was one that worked where I worked (The crisis stabilization unit) and she was absolutely amazing. 

Now you maybe wondering why I want to be a psychologist? Well, there are alot of reasons. I like assessments: I’ve had the privilege of watching some assessments being completed and learning about them through both my past work and school. I like research. I like the idea of figuring out why we do the things we do and how these thoughts have an impact on our emotional well-being. I also have an interest in behaviors and how certain mental illness and use of substances have an impact on our thought processes and how we function. I’m in an abnormal psychology class right now and it’s- by far- my favorite class.

 I understand that some go straight out of undergrad into their PhD. That’s just not how the cards are rolling for me. My GPA is fair and the only research experience I have is what I did in undergrad for classes like experimental psych and for my advanced capstone over grandparents families. I’ve tried for over a year to get into a RA position at colleges around me (UK, WKU, UofL) but I’m have no luck. They’re either not taking anyone for their labs right now or they are not responding. I like the experience and know I would have no shot getting into a PhD program, right now. I’m trying the best that I can. I’m currently taking classes at a community college to get my GPA up a bit, as well as gain recommendation letters.

I’ve talked to some people who have many degrees: one who got a masters in ABA and a PhD in Clinical Psych, one who got a PsyD and became an PMHNP as well, one who is an LCSW and a PMHNP, one who got a masters in CMHC and got into a PhD Clinical Psychology program but then decided not to go. 

I know a master’s is my best bet, but in what?
I’m curious on the path’s that people have taken! 
Also, If you have any idea on what other careers sound like it would be up my alley, I’m open to suggestions!

1dff8s0,Being the Joke in a Team Meeting (56M) and (27F),"I'm feeling a mix of emotions right now – hurt, sadness, maybe a bit of both. 

After dedicating three years to my job at the dealership, enduring a lack of proper management, I finally got the chance to participate in my first team meeting with my new manager and coworkers. The topic was the process of vehicle branding and service, and I was both excited and nervous to be there.

Things seemed to be going well until the Service Director, whom I was meeting for the first time, asked for some information from my coworker. Thinking I could contribute, I raised my hand and said, ""Excuse me, if I may add..."" But before I could finish, he interrupted me with, ""Not now, \[My Name\], we'll talk about your raise later. Not a great time."" The room erupted in laughter.

To add context, my previous managers had promised me a raise after I helped recover a significant amount of money – figures ranging from six to seven digits – that the dealership had originally lost. I had put in a lot of effort, even communicating directly with brand representatives to achieve this.

Everyone on my team knows me as someone who is sweet yet serious about my work. 

So, I'm at a loss for how to handle this situation. Having faced bullying since childhood, being treated like a joke by the Service Director is particularly painful.

In that moment, I wondered if I got the wrong idea – maybe they were just trying to make a joke? Or was it actually aimed at me? I stayed quiet because I didn't want to make things more awkward. But inside, I felt really out of place and uneasy.

Now, I'm unsure about what to do next. Any advice would be appreciated.",SnooGiraffes8857,15,0.800000011920929,31,1718328638,2024-06-14 01:30:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dff8s0/being_the_joke_in_a_team_meeting_56m_and_27f/,6,2024

1dff3fr,HR Career Advice,"Hey everyone! New Reddit user here. Go easy on me! I have a few questions that I was wondering if some more seasoned professionals within the HR world could lend me some advice as far as my career path goes.

I am a male in my mid 30's living in the St. Louis, MO area. I have multiple years of retail and hospitality management experience and have recently decided that I want to get out of the retail world and begin my path into Human Resources. I have had some HR duties/roles (Interviewing, hiring, reviewing employees) from some of my past retail work experience (Sam's Club and Total Wine & More etc..) and I really enjoyed that part of my job. However, with those jobs the HR functions were just a small part of the overall job responsibilities. I am more interested in doing that full-time as opposed to it just being a small fraction of my job.

In January I started an MBA program with a concentration in Human Resource Management. I have about another year or so until I graduate. One of my main questions right now is, Should I look for a different job that is purely an HR position (recruiter, specialist etc..) or just stick with my retail management job until I graduate from school? I feel like trying to get my foot in the door and gain some valuable HR experience would be beneficial. My current role has some limited HR duties but definitely isn't a pure HR position that will stand out on a resume for when I graduate. It also looks to be a bit difficult to get into the HR field without any direct experience. I am shaping my resume to highlight my HR related skills so that it will hopefully benefit me and allow for someone to take a change on me.

I also understand that there are some certifications that can make an individual more marketable (SHRM for example). Would I be too ambitious to try to go after that certification while also working full time and attending MBA classes? I don't want to bite off more than I can chew but I also want to get things rolling in the right direction sooner rather than later.

I know I am not taking a typical career path to Human Resources but I feel like my past professional work experiences and skills should translate fairly well. Anyways, if you got this far into my story I want to say thank you!

1dfetxx,Should I sign a trial contract in hope for w2?,"Hello everyone!  
Im trying to decide what to do with my current career situation.

I’ve been in my field for about 4y and I have two offers now:

One is 21/h with no growth, doing some repetitive work. Im sure I will handle it and stay there for as long as i need to(unless i get bored to death lol). I do not see any career advancements there- i could get a management role in 6-12 months but its not guaranteed

Second is 29/h with great growth opportunity(in the craft itself and possibly vertically) but they ask 15-30 days to be on contract (paid) before the w2 - for evaluation. They are very demanding and there’s a chance I will fall short.

1dfepei,"Flunked first year uni. Took a year off to work in sales, doing great. Not sure what to do next. Help?","(TLDR: Wanted to be a lawyer, flunked first year uni, worked in sales for the last year, turned out to be good at it, what now? Back to school or keep working?)  
Hello,

(BTW I am 20 years old)  
I am at what feels like a crossroads and I'm unsure of what to do next. I will preface this by saying I was always very lucky to be naturally good at school, and coasted through high school with high 80s and low 90s (although I really should've been getting all 90s). My initial plan was to be a lawyer, so I took political science at the University of Ottawa. To make a long story short, my academic year was a disaster.

It's not that the work was too hard, rather I had 0 discipline and was mentally out of it. I stopped attending most of my courses after 2 months and isolated myself. I was living with 2 roommates who I barely spoke to and had no friends - mostly because I made no effort to speak to anyone or to foster existing relationships. I still got good grades in a couple of courses that required next to no effort, but I failed the rest due to not completing coursework/final exams.

So I was withdrawn from my faculty. I had the option to apply take the incomplete courses off my record or get an academic reset. I decided not to go through with those and take a year off to work and get my head straight.  
I was lucky enough to find a job at a local real estate team in sales. To keep it brief, my job is to call our leads and convert them into phone appointments. These are exclusively online leads, and the occasional office call-in (but my manager handles 90% of those). Then when those appointments close as deal, I get a bonus. I get paid 21$ per hour and 400$ bonus per deal. I am currently at around 20 deals and am hoping to be at 50-60 come the end of the year. My boss has hinted at the potential of growth in the company but I am not sure how much I believe her - and if there is that potential, I think it's quite far away. My current lead manager (used to be in my role) was only promoted when the old lead manager had to go on maternity leave and he's 26. She's hinted at ""new positions"" being created but again not sure how much I believe her. All I know is I'm giving the company a lot more than what I'm paid for. For reference, there's been a lot of turnover in my position. My most successful predecessor not including the current lead manager closed 12 deals in her year at the company. Most others have only lasted a few months before moving on. I could be getting greedy/impatient, please advise! Should I just graft it out here until I get promoted?

Since beginning work, I have acquired the mindset and discipline I lacked for so long. I believe the skills I have acquired will translate into the academic sector. With that being said - a year in the workforce has made me realize some things. I'm quite good at my job and (not trying to be arrogant) have realized that I'm already more capable at it than most people I work with (realtors or otherwise), despite only having around a year of experience. I have developed some traits I always had into skills which can translate into the professional world - phon skills, persistence, public speaking, presentations, following-up, self-regulation, communication skills, accountability, innovation, CRM skills, and (What I believe to be my strongest) analytical skills.  
I now believe that if I went back to school, I'd do much better and be able to pursue my old dream career path. However, is it worth it anymore? Now that I've got my foot in the door, should I just keep working with no degree?

Do I just say F it and pursue a career in sales or real estate with no degree? Or is that gambling my future, in addition to not being lucrative enough?

Or, do I take my newfound discipline and grind the next 7 years to become a lawyer which was the initial plan? Or is there a more lucrative field I should apply myself to with my skillset?

Really, I'm just trying to figure out how to maximize my skillset in order to obtain the best financial future for myself and family.

1dfdxu3,Asking for a Raise/Promotion,"Hi everyone. I can't sleep because this has been weighing on my mind and I'm looking for some advice on what i should do. 

I'm working in finance as an analyst (it's my first full time job) and my team is really small - literally me, my manager and my colleague. My manager had asked me to help her with a task and with me being the hardworking employee i am, i read the email chain from the bottom to get a good understanding of what needed to get done. She did not realise that my colleague's compensation was included in the email chain and i basically found out that my colleague is earning two times as much as i am.

As you might imagine, I'm obviously not very happy about this. Logically, the obvious reason is that my colleague has had previous employment (i.e. work experience) which would allow her to command a higher salary. Don't get me wrong, I'm honestly really happy that my colleage is getting paid well and normally I'd be fine with that, but there are two reasons why I'm currently on my rant. 

1. I don't see her any difference in our daily tasks to justify such a significant pay difference. For context, she specialises in system A and i specialise in B, but i am fully capable of handling system A as i have covered all her work when she went on leave. Furthermore, even if we consider our additional tasks (daily and monthly), i dare say that i do have more things on my plate than her (we have a tracker that shows our outstanding tasks and if we count i have almost triple her tasks). If the expectations for my colleague were obviously higher, i'd be understand. But at least right now, i don't see any difference in what we're doing.

2. The first time i asked my manager ""what can i do to be considered for a promotion?"", her response was ""huh, you want to talk about this now?"". Granted, i was only 7 months into my role so i wasn't asking for a promotion, but i was at least hoping she could give me some direction regarding what it would take to be considered for one. During our next one-on-one a few months later, i brought this up again, and she still could not give me an answer (her exact words were ""why not you have a think of what you can do and we can talk about it next time?""). She's really busy so it's extremely tough to schedule any one-on-one time with her (i've rescheduled our next one-on-one about four times now and they've all been cancelled). Honestly, my manager is really patient and quite nice, but in the words of a friend of mine, loyalty doesn't help me pay bills.

I'm hoping to get some advice on a few things:

1. How should i go about asking for a raise? Would it be better to be a little more indirect (""What can i do to be considered for a promotion/pay raise?""), or highlight all the work I've done and ask if it's enough for a pay raise?

2. If she mentions i've missed the promotion cycle, but she says she'll recommend me for promotion next year, would it still make sense to stay? I'm looking to put down a downpayment for a house in the next 2-3 years so the money is kind of important.

3. If she says nothing can be done till the next cycle, is it time to quiet quit and find another job? Or just continue to work hard and try for the next promotion cycle? 

Honestly this feels like inequity to me because unless my colleague hasn't been updating the tracker, i don't understand why I've been doing so many additional tasks, especially when i don't feel like I'm getting the recognition and equitable compensation for my efforts. I know that life isn't fair, but i think i have to at least try to fight for what i think i deserve.

Advice to any/all the three points and any other relevant advice is more than welcome. Thank you so much in advance for any replies and advice given! :)",iamabigbluebox,1,1.0,0,1718324479,2024-06-14 00:21:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dfdxu3/asking_for_a_raisepromotion/,6,2024

1dfcelu,What jobs should I be aiming for with a background in AI chatbot development + a decade of delivery driving?,"I've been making 30 an hour on an AI chatbot website for the last 9 months as an ""expert creative writer"". It's good money, I like it and I've learned SOME skills (mostly improved my grammar/writing and research skills). It's pretty simple and doesn't require a great deal of technical knowledge and I've only developed a couple of hard skills, though. I know a handful of HTML, and I'm proficient with markdown. 

The downside is it is contract work so I'm completely at their mercy- no benefits, they can change my pay for any reason with no warning (went from 35 to 30 an hour). Plus it's not a W2 job so I'm really getting worried about how I'm going to afford the huge tax bill. Lastly, it's technically a project. I'm pretty sure I could get switched to a different project when this one ends (it's coming to a close soonish) but I don't have a guarantee on my pay rate when I get switched to a new project. 

I'm on LinkedIn and I keep getting recommended SEO content writer jobs, stuff like that. Most of them involve using AI to mass-produce web articles. I enjoy writing prompts for AI, so I guess I'd enjoy the work. The problem is I've gotten nothing back from the hundreds of applications I sent out. I know this is due to my lack of experience as a content writer. I have seen a handful of internships but they seem to be looking for people in school and I graduated 6 years ago. Plus, I can't afford to do an internship. 

I took a handful of courses on Coursera (SEO knowledge, CRM, CMS (WordPress) and added the certifications to my LinkedIn/resume. It didn't help and I've even gotten a handful of scam emails/texts pretending to be real companies. I'm starting to get discouraged and my debt is piling up. 

Debating if I should just suck up my pride and do amazon for 4 days a week since at least I'll have way to pay my taxes and it'll be a consistent 40 hours a week.

Should I keep pushing forward and pull back until I’m paid my worth?,"I know as an employee you’re just a number but that was a sucker punch. When you’ve been working hard consistently. Passed every performance review and checkpoints, first one to get in and last one to leave. Solid relationship with manager.

No pushback but says he needs more time to get everything together like title descriptions and such. Is there no money in budget? Is manager worried it will ruffle some feathers who have seniority against me? I don’t believe manager is making excuses but I’m running out of patience. It keeps getting pushed back! The new hire will work alongside me and asked for a higher salary and they got it. Why is it easier for a new hire to ask for a raise then it is someone internal who’s been working non stop for years!

1df9ytc,Almost 30 feeling worried ,"Hello! I’m 27M having trouble deciding where to go next with this chapter of my life. Got out of a long term relationship recently so I have a lot of motivation to dedicate myself to a path. Here’s a little about me ( based in Bay Area ) 

Education: B.S in Economics from a State University 
Google Project Management Certificate

Work Exp: Worked in banking the last 4-5 years with 3 different companies
( 1 of those years being WFH ) 
- never been fired before, only left for educative purposes or cause a contract ended. 

I’ve now been without work since January and the tons of rejection emails are getting to me. I’m looking to dedicate myself to a path that can provide these qualities:
- non laborious/ back breaking 
- job security 
- at least 40/hr and room to climb upwards 
- ideally only needs 1 year of school/ program 

I’ve been thinking about jobs in the medical field such as surgical technician or dental hygienist. I want a fulfilling job that makes one feel proud of myself. Moving numbers around all day was mind-numbing but easy, I’ll accept any advice..thank you!!",JLHAllah,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1718313363,2024-06-13 21:16:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1df9ytc/almost_30_feeling_worried/,6,2024
1df9xd9,Trying to find a career fast—am  I on the right path?,"I know this is a shot in the dark, but I am kind of desperate. I’m just looking for any kind of insight, suggestions, advice—-whatever. Beware some sensitive content. 

I wasted a good chunk of my 20’s being an alcoholic, and though I’ve been sober for the last 3 years, trying to get my life back has been hard. I’m fast approaching 30 and still working as a server in a restaurant, and there is NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT for people who enjoy it, but I’ve been doing it for the last 12 years of my life with no breaks and it’s actually killing my soul. I need out.

I’m a writer. I like to write, it’s the only thing I have “talent” in, but I have no idea how to monetize it, and I need to make enough money to have some stability. Going to school for something English/Communications or even marketing or journalism would be easier for me, I know, but my concern is finding a job and job security.

Finding a career that makes a comparable amount of money to the service industry has been hellishly difficult for someone in my circumstances, I have found, so I started researching jobs I might like that I could make a decent living at that would afford me time to write on the side.

I started taking classes again a year ago because I thought joining the Radiology Tech program at Delgado Community College in New Orleans would be a good fit. I believe I would really like to be Nuclear Tech or specialize in CT/MRI or something, because it’s interesting to me and I would have free time I could use to do things I really like.

The problem is, my original college credits I had really did nothing for me as far as getting my prerequisites for this  out of the way, because I was an English major, so I’ve spent the last year (and have one more semester) where I have to do those before I can even apply to the Radtech program itself. 

I’ll be 30 before I graduate from it, if I make it that long, and that’s IF I get in my first time. Delgado only accepts a handful of applicants in February, and there are 0 guarantees I’ll make it in my first go (many don’t), which means waiting another year.

I do think Radtech (and specialties in it) is something I would like. I want a career where I can make decent, consistent money. Move somewhere in Colorado, upstate New York or Upstate Washington, and try to find some peace while I write a couple books, maybe go on a couple trips—- I’m not looking for a get rich quick scheme, I just want to start an actual life. 

I thought going to school first and then focusing on moving would be my best bet—but is that stupid? Should I move first and go from there? 

I assumed having a career beyond serving would make moving to a new state better/easier vs trying to do it now, truthfully. 

The longer this is taking though, and the more blind I feel trying to find my away around it, the more I’m doubting the current route I’m taking. Is there a better way to be going about this? 

I’ve also considered medical lab tech schooling (but I don’t think it makes nearly as much money), OR trying to get my Bachelor’s 
 and go the PA route (pathologist assistant specifically). Neuroscience/Neurobiology also really fascinate me—but those were things I figured I could dig into more once I had a stable career of sorts. I could go back and get a Bachelor’s if I wanted, theoretically. Same goes for pursuing any kind of MFA (being a lit professor or writing teacher of any kind also interests me greatly— but English doesn’t exactly pay any bills. That’s why I am shooting for the science route and pursuing those as a secondary possibility.)

To put it plainly, Radtech/radtech adjacent careers seemed like the fastest way to get out of the service industry while still making decent income, and thus the fastest, most easily attainable route to starting my life somewhere. Having that kind of stability/break, I think, would help me get some of the other stuff sorted as well. 
However, the way things have been panning out, I’m starting to really doubt this. 

 I’m burnt out beyond belief, and I’m having a hard time moving forward. If my cats weren’t around, I’m not sure I’d be alive. (I’m in therapy and all, I’m just trying to stress how desperate I am for solutions here.) 

Is there a better way for me to get where I’m trying to be? Is Delgado just not a good choice?   As far as I can tell, many Radtech programs are selective.
Is there something else I could be doing to help? Should I focus on moving to a different state and then pursue school? 

Literally any advice would be helpful. I’m sorry if this is a lot. ",Suspicious_Wasabi_84,1,1.0,1,1718313260,2024-06-13 21:14:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1df9xd9/trying_to_find_a_career_fastam_i_on_the_right_path/,6,2024

1df72ls,Trying to get back into my career field with a long break. It’s stressing me out How hard is this going to be? ,"
Help from anyone in comms & PR would be nice and anyone who has taken time off their industry and how they got back into it. 

I get so much anxiety just trying to apply right now. I’m not worried once I’m in front of an employee, I’m good at interviews. I am worried about getting looked over because of the gap. 


 I’ve taken two years off from PR besides a little side social media jobs. My moms health was bad and then I got care giver burn out. I need to go back to work but I’m freaking out about where to start.

For background I have lots of schooling. I have a masters in journalism and a graduate diploma in public relations. As for my work history, I did a lot of short term contract work because I liked to change things up but I also know it’s not the best on the resume either. 

My work history goes like this. 

Lead writer and editor for a SEO company. Technical writer

Lots of freelance writing for some pretty big sports websites(espn, tsn, complex magazine). I have a decent amount of published work. I also have freelanced produced, edited and hosted podcasts. I did this for other people and myself. 

I worked for a professional MLS team doing comms work. I was in a PR role starting with media monitoring, press release etc but also did lots of journalism work because they were too cheap to hire more than one journalist. 

Then I went onto influencer management during the pandemic. Job sucked. A lot of pitching, negotiating and management of clients on top of being the only technical writer for the small business. But I worked with lots of brands and learned a shit load of social media. 

Lastly, I ended up consulting for a few non profits doing donor,media and corporate relations for the charities. But since the budget was so small I also did the website building, social media management and all of the comms work. 

I’m just finishing up my personal website with a portfolio. It actually looks pretty full with a little bit of embellishment. I do have some pretty good references from well known media members and journalist as well. 

This is from 2018 - end of 2022. Since then I took time off to help family and do some writing. I have been learning to produce AI content creating, developing advertisement AI to add to my portfolio and script writing. I also have media editing experience. Photo, video and audio. 

Basically I need some reassurance going back into the workforce and where should I start? I haven’t worked at any big PR firms, I’ve done some work with boutique agencies. 

Any suggestions would be great. Thank you!

1df6nmr,Police or Army?,"I posted this in an AskLE, but I would like other opinions on it too. 

I (17F) just recently graduated high school, so the pressure to figure out what I want to do is getting stronger. It's not that bad because my parents are very supportive and are fine if I don't choose to go to university. I am taking a gap year to travel around the world, learn Mandarin in Taiwan, and figure out if what I think I want to do is what I want to do. The two options I have been ping-ponging between ever since I was 12 years old are either enlisting into the Army or going the ""police"" route. I have done a handful of research on both, but haven't come out with much. 

What I know right now is that it is quite hard to even be screened to become a police officer and that sometimes it takes years (??). Eventually, I would love to be a detective, but I don't know much about that career option either. 

I have wanted to be in the army for as long as I can remember, but recent research has made me wary of the idea. Many people have said most of what they do is janitor duties and long, tiring, underpaid hours. My reasons for wanting to enlist range from: being able to protect myself and hold my own as a female and protecting people who can't protect themselves. Is that a naive stance?

I want to go to university, so I was wondering what courses I should take for either career? I heard criminology would benefit becoming a detective. Is there anything else? Also, a desk job doesn't sound so appealing to me but I have no hands-on experience in that area because my past jobs have been very active. I do love to study, but I was a student-athlete my whole life, so ""just studying"" will never cut it for me. 

Also, such a rookie question, but is being a spy a real thing? How does it work? 

Also, how do I approach either idea to my parents who think I want to go into business because I was too scared to say anything about either of the career options I want? Not to even talk about the stigma that may surround either?",Ill-Preparation-4504,0,0.4000000059604645,13,1718304943,2024-06-13 18:55:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1df6nmr/police_or_army/,6,2024

Context: I recently resigned from my job after nearly 3 years. I quit before and was retained because I was working crazy hours and the only person in my department at a start up. This time they did not try to retain me, but I would have rejected any offer because I'll be making $20k more now. It's a professional corporate job.  
  
Anyway, I gave 3.5 weeks notice as a courtesy. Boss was initially nice. Boss' boss who initially was my boss and doesn't value my work (they honestly don't understand it) has said nothing, even after I emailed them a small appreciation note. Now everyone is acting weird towards me and I just want out but don't want to burn bridges. I want future recs. However, I have some major and very stressful projects I have to finish. I'm so stressed out about them and they're part of the reason I'm leaving.  
  
My line of thought is why am I killing myself for these projects when this guy who has literally called me at all hours, worked me on the weekends, and etc can't even email me back? Why am I still here? I asked my boss if leaving a week earlier would work since my final week has a holiday but no response.

1df4s4n,Post: Should I Pursue an Electrician Apprenticeship Given My Current Job Situation?,"Hi everyone,

I could use some advice on my career prospects and possible next steps. Here’s a bit of background:

**Current Situation:**

* **Current Job**: Age 34. I’m currently leveraging my Japanese skills to work as a liaison-style sales engineer selling factory automation technologies for a Japanese trading subsidiary. I earn about $67,000 a year (excluding benefits) and spend time talking with engineering managers and factory production maintenance technicians. Although I have had great flexibility to work from home, my company is now asking me to spend more time at our main customer’s (a famous Japanese automotive company) factory due to a new $500 million investment project. I plan on staying at my current company as long as possible to improve my people skills and broaden my network. There is little opportunity for internal growth, and I have basically learned all of our main technologies, so I would only be here for the money and minor yearly raises.
* **Job Security Concerns**: My direct manager hinted that he and the president of the company are looking for my replacement. I’ve had to take significant time off to care for my extremely sickly sister and my father, who recently passed away. I fear my relationship with my employer has been damaged due to my absences. I recently, saw an email from one of our company’s main recruiters agreeing to meet with my bosses in KY to discuss their request. Given, the various opportunities our company will have with the 500 million in capital investments, I think they might also be hiring a second rep to help with the likely high loads here in San Antonio, but there is also a chance they are in fact trying to hurry and get a replacement to capture sales I might not get them.

**Career Considerations:**

* **Apprenticeship**: I’m considering starting an electrician apprenticeship with SOTX JATC in the case that I do get laid off. The starting pay is about $17/hr, but this would allow me to avoid frequent travel and overnight stays away from family (previously to places like Houston, Laredo, and Kentucky) and focus on hands-on work that I’m passionate about. SOTX JATC mentioned they are always looking for apprentices.
* **Challenges**: I’ve reached out to 14 recruiters for other Sales Engineering positions without much success, likely due to the influx of people moving to Texas from California and the saturation of white-collar workers laid off from tech companies. Also, my preference for fully remote positions hasn’t helped. Generally, Japanese companies I could sell my skills to are located in Chicago, Kentucky, Ohio or West/East Coast and would require me to fly over for training for weeks at a time. Given my sister’s worsening condition, this is not really an option like it was 3 years ago. This is why I’m considering such a drastic change in my career.

**Background & Skills:**

* **Education**: I have a bachelor's degree in Japanese language and spent 6 years living in Japan. My wife is Japanese, and we speak exclusively in Japanese.
* **Technical Interests**: I enjoy working with MCUs, welding, 3D printing, and adding branches to my home electrical system.
* **Home Projects**: If I become a licensed electrician, I plan on completely redoing my duplex's 1947 fuse and cloth insulated 100 A electrical system to a 200 A, which was quoted at $30,000. Texas law requires a licensed electrician to perform all electrical work. I have experience designing static structures like electric patient lift trolleys, MIG welding furniture fixtures, designing and implementing IP home surveillance and Human presence detection systems using ESP32 and Raspberry Pi servers, troubleshooting low voltage electronics, and doing various home repairs (drywall, HVAC, plumbing). Additionally, I have experience scripting language learning tools and desktop work automation tools.

**Future Plans:**

* **Skill Leveraging**: In the future, I plan to leverage my Japanese language and cultural skills, technical abilities with electricity and coding, and my previous experience working at our Japanese Automotive and HVAC customers to apply for new positions. I think 5 years from now, there will be little opportunity for me to improve my job prospects with computer & foreign language skills because of rapid advancements in AI in both of these fields, so I am leaning more towards sales and hands on work. I figure as sales operations get automated more and more, the requirement for me to travel will only go up, in order for me to maintain my current salary. Whereas, with electric work, wages will stagnate, but at least I will have more opportunities to be there with my family while we try to provide as much comfort as possible for my sister.

I’m at a crossroads and would appreciate any suggestions or insights on:

1. Is pursuing an electrician apprenticeship a good move given my situation?
2. Any other career paths or strategies I should consider?

The pay at my job is really good, although there is little opportunity for internal growth. I just fear I may be on the verge of losing my job, and maybe an electrician apprenticeship would work better for my family’s situation.

Thank you for your time and help!

1df439e,Am I going in the right direction ? 27 F,"I feel like there has to be a background before I explain where I am at now. ( also in no way am I telling a sob story or “stuck in the past. I just need to explain my age with my current skill set.) Graduated highschool in 2016 went to UNF majored in graphic design didn't like it ( too young and dumb) switched to fine arts. Loved it had a great time was dealing with an abusive bf and depression from type 1 diabetes went into a coma and had to leave school. 2019 has to regain my strength decided to go back to school UNF said I couldn't come back applied to colleges no one would take me because I went into a coma during finals my gpa tanked. Went to Full sail ( big mistake) because they would take me and I was already considerating going to grad school for animation.

Graduated fullsail hated every minute of my program but it was far too late to change attempted to get jobs in animation coordination / production so I am not doing the actual art. everyone said I needed experience or needed to move to Cali, I'm already $46,000 in debt no help from anyone or parents what so ever. So I took a job as an art teacher to try it out, I like it but I don't wanna work in the school system because I don't wanna get put in any ""active shooter situations"" keep in mind I'm based in FL and don’t like that politics are bleeding into the school system so heavily. So became a registered behavioral technician ( working with littles with Autism) was thinking about becoming a BCBA have done it for a year love the kids but too dangerous and I want to have children in the future and there is no work life balance. 

I love art but know I can't make it a career for myself this late in life and can't get my masters. WHERE I AM NOW I have a close friend who works in email marketing and tells me that I would be great in marketing I've always be tech savvy and have grown my own personal social media channels with SEO and leaning how to track trends and analytics. I'm decent at graphic design but have more experience in illustration. I've been applying to internships but have been out of school for 2 years so they don't really take ppl that far out from undergrad. I recently been taking HubSpot courses in digital marketing to add to my resume. 

Now with that background : 
I'm feeling defeated and unsure if I'm cut out for the "" girl boss"" life , and no I don’t care about my “image” too much. I'm doing everything I can on LinkedIn everyday trying to cold email network. What should I do ? Can somebody guide me or mentor me ? I have a chronic illness and really need a stable job that will provide me benefits and I would prefer to work from home in the future just because in my current job they won't even give me time off to see my endocrinologist. But I don't necessarily need to WFH rn I'm even willing to move out of state at least a year to get experience in a role , money will be tight but I want a career. I want my future children to be proud of their mother , I want to be able to make enough money to even have children :(. But what should I do ? Am I am in the right direction with this marketing journey ? Does anyone see me excelling in a different career ? Should I be a teacher ? If you need anymore background let me know lol , I would really appreciate so guidance if possible. Also please be kind I put the stuff about my future family because I’m 27 will def be an older parent and I have a chronic illness, so that’s already a high risk pregnancy . I want to be realistic with my family planning and have got some hurtful comments from another group.

1df3wg3,Feeling deflated after being passed up again. Actionable next steps?,"
     Hey all feeling a bit down after being passed up for a promotion I really wanted, so I’m looking for advice from career minded people who can hopefully impart some wisdom. Trying to keep it vague for anonymity.

     I’ve been working for this company for 15 years. I’m in my early 30s. I spent 10 in the warehouse where I was a team leader training new employees on operations and assisting managers with logistics/routing/invoicing etc., and where I befriended the marketing manager who hired me as a merchandiser, which I hoped one day would give me the experience and qualifications to move into a sales route in the same market I merchandise in (it’s a common trajectory in the industry). I’ve been in merchandising for 5 years now. 

    I’ve applied for the sales position twice now. The first time they hired from outside the company, and I’m not sure but I think nepotism played a significant role (friend of the managers), ok fine. The second time was last week. My reasoning was that after 15 years of experience with the company, already having great relationships with the buyers in the market (having been their merchandiser for 5 years), and the knowledge of our brands and operations, I was perfectly qualified for a seamless  transition into sales.. instead they hired a 21 year old from our market that has less than a year of work experience in the field.

   It feels like a slap in the face, I’m decently upset, they are extremely vague when I ask them what I’m doing wrong to not be promoted, and I feel a distinct lack of respect from their end. I’m now wondering if I’m falling victim to sunk cost? Has anyone else been in similar circumstances and found a way to succeed? Would a different company value me properly? Any and all wisdom you folks can impart would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

I want nothing to do with retail anymore. The only issue is, I’m at the mercy of having “golden cuffs” on with this company because they do pay VERY well (I make over 6 figures and get close to 30 vacation days a year). There’s been a lot of changes in the upper management that has made this company unrecognizable and I don’t want to be a part of it anymore.

1df2sxr,Negotiating a pay raise after the raise was given to me.,"I’m a full stack software dev and yesterday I had a 1:1 meeting with my manager where we went over my yearly pay raise (of 2.8%). After sleeping on it and crunching some numbers, I think this is too low. It basically covers only inflation on paper.

I want to bring it up and open a discussion with my manager but I feel kind of dumb doing this after our initial meeting where I should have discussed it. Even when he asked do you have any questions I said none for now. The new salary is retroactive as of June 1st.

What would you do in this situation? What kind of tone would you use? Should I send an email or have a teams call?

I have a percentage in mind for what I expected. 

Also it’s worth noting that I’ve been with the team only for the last quarter. The first three quarters I worked my ass off with another team and was moved in a re-org that I had no say in. So my manager has no context on my performance with the other team.

1df23k1,I’m 35 and need a career change,"As the title states, I’ve come to the point where I need a career change, or at least a change in my career.

I’ve worked as a bartender for a long time, and have been in the hospitality industry for many years more, filling most roles except for mid and upper management. I specialize in craft cocktails, and am widely regarded as one of the leaders of the industry in my area. 

However with my state leading the nation for inflation in my industry, stagnant wages, and people dining out far less, I’ve had my income drop significantly. I’ve watched restaurants and bars in my area constantly close (6 in the past week that I know of) This past month I made roughly 40% less than last month, and nearly 60% less than this time last year. I had planned to open my own bar at one point, and had even gone through raising investors, starting and LLC, and looking for property. But the economic climate is making me really nervous about doing this long term now, let alone opening a whole new business.

I have no degree or certifications to speak of outside the hospitality industry. I can’t afford to step away from working full time as I need to make at least $55-$60k annually to cover my financial obligations.

I’m in a tough spot where I’d like to move to something more stable but I have little experience in other fields that pay what I need. I’ve considered trying to get into sales but I can’t stand cold calling or door-to-door. I’ve considered getting some sort of certification in the technology sector, but most of those seem useless without a degree. Really I’d just like to get into a field where I can maintain my current financial obligations and work towards eventually making 6 figures.

Any suggestions would be appreciated, I’m really trying to brainstorm here.

TLDR; I’m a career bartender without any schooling, and I want to get out of the industry due to uncertainty/inconsistency of income recently. I need to still make $55-$60k.",Kimomono1,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1718293438,2024-06-13 15:43:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1df23k1/im_35_and_need_a_career_change/,6,2024

1df1r1o,Being completely lost in life as result of dreaming big,"
I can pour my heart in one go in this post, but I have so much to say.. anyway after years of hesitation about whether or not using the internet as an outlet of my thoughts, here I am publishing my first ever thought ! 

Here is a pickle : a 29 yo female consumer of social media (always been on the receiving end of content), got convinced (by the internet) of leaving my career to pursue my dreams, because boy do I have some dreams, big ones, I wanted to be something big, since I can remember. Being extremely ambitious by nature which can be a curse .. 

Now, I left my job, and found out I don’t have the b**ls to be an entrepreneur, nor an idea, nor a passion, nor the finances, basically a weak mindset besides ambition… and I can’t roll back to my career that I don’t like either (my professional career is over because of a series of unintended mistakes of job switching), the thing is, I can’t stand not working/producing it’s actually killing me slowly. 

I am litterally going crazy from realizing my new 
reality … I am unwell .. just a big dreamer of nothing, tricked by my naiveté and stuck like a glue with this huge problem. 
And No I don’t want to be on social media. 
I think about my problem 18 hours of the day everyday, I think about what to do ..

So how much lost in life can someone actually be ? 
How much pain is enough pain ? 
How many people failed and never recovered ? 
What am I supposed to do ? I am sincerely out of ideas … 

There is still more detail to the story but writing this much is enough for now as it is triggering and hard enough ..

1df03bc,I am lost and don't know what to do.,"Hi everyone, this might be a bit of a long read, so sorry in advance. 

I have always been interested in foreign cultures and languages and as a result of this majored in this subject at university. While in college, I was thriving and genuinely enjoyed my life. I loved being surrounded by like-minded people and going abroad and exploring the unknown and from different cultures.

However, once I graduated I received a pretty good job offer for a job at a large logistics company in my home country. I decided to accept the offer because I was familiar with the company (had a part-time job there, performed well, hence the immediate offer when I graduated) and they also offered good money. It was for a leadership role, and in the beginning I was excited about it, but I quickly realized that I made a huge mistake as I do not enjoy being a leader at all. I genuinely despise having to be the center of attention all the time, and what I hate the most is having to deal with difficult subordinates (as in toxic people). I just genuinely hate it, and it makes me depressed. I came to the conclusion that some people like the attention and the power that they have over people, but not me. I do not enjoy management. I do not enjoy 4 hour long meetings and presentations.

I feel like such a loser because I can't do anything with my degree, yet I hate the industry and the role that I am in... I just feel like if I had known that I hate working with people this much I would have made a more conscious choice during high school... 

I have been thinking about switching industries entirely. I have also been looking for jobs that require me to work alone most of the time, but most of them require some IT knowledge... If you guys could help me out with career paths where you can work with very little social interaction I would really appreciate it.

TLDR; I have a bachelor and masters degree in foreign cultures and languages, ended up in a leadership role at a logistics company, absolutely hate my career path and don't know what to do + looking for a new industry/career path where I can work ALONE.

After 4 days I got a response about how he thought I had been hired and asked me to verify if I had been. 10 minutes after verifying that l, in fact, had not been hired, I received an ""automated"" email saying I wasn't a good fit and they had voided my eligibility for the job.


Now l'm curious how quickly others do/would have followed up with an application after talking to recruiters. 

Second question, if you apply to a position but don't receive an email verifying your application was received or anything like that, would you reach out to someone on Linkedln or anywhere to verify they received your application and to hammer home your interest?

1deynpc,Flying back and forth for work? Realistic?,"

How realistic are these two scenarios:

Working 8 days and 6 days off

Working 3 days and 4 days off

And flying back home on my days off. 

I was offered a really good job opportunity out of state but I’m unable to relocate my family. So I was contemplating on doing this but I realize it’s probably unrealistic. I also realize I’d probably spend a good amount of time flying so that takes away from my time off. Trying my best to convince myself this is possible but seems unlikely. 

Main reason for doing this is because I have a 1 year old that I want to be with but at the same time I need to provide. 

I also know there are some workers who are away for months. I just can’t do it. This is my maximum.

1deymny,Part time staff stepping on my feet and taking charge of my job,"So I started as a marketing officer, the only marketing staff the business has so I am basically the marketing manager without the title. There is a person that comes in 1 day a week to help make social media graphics, the communications staff member. They are meant to only do social media graphics, and I give them a plan of exactly what I want to post, what I want it to look like etc. 

Honestly, the posts created looked really bad, so many errors and spelling mistakes and they’re reusing the same stuff. I have been dropping hints lightly that I want the stuff to be improved. Any posts I’ve made because theirs wasn’t able to be put up it was that bad, I’ve gotten a sneaky comment thrown my way regarding the font etc. Anything ive suggested they have shut down, saying it won’t look good for the brand (somehow posting reviews of customers won’t be good for us?). They keep doing this and it’s really started to make me hate working with them. 

I am a recent college graduate from a highly respected college and course. I’ve worked in marketing previously, so I do have the knowledge and experience to trust my own judgement. The other staff member hasn’t ever worked in this space, hasn’t studied marketing or communications or branding and is around 20 years older than me. (Recent college grad so do the maths).  Would my age and the level of authority I have be a factor is them acting like this towards me?

They’ve actually started asking to edit my work, which would be fine but they wouldn’t allow me access to their work when I needed to post it. They’ve also started to make print marketing materials on their own accord, when that aspect has nothing to do with them. They keep saying from a branding background, I think this etc, when they have never worked in that space before. I made a portfolio full of all documents, pictures and work for both of us to add to but they won’t add any of the work they’ve done into it, even though I need to access pictures etc, won’t allow me because they took the pictures? lol.

Has anyone dealt with a situation like this? They continuously disregard my ideas when I’m the marketing manager, have recently graduated form a top university and am young and know the marketing space here now.

1deydxf,Career at an early crossroads,"Hi All,

  
Looking for some advice

I (25M) finished my chemical engineering degree last year in Ireland (I'm also Irish). Wasn't the best degree as I dragged myself through a lot of the course, but from the most prestigious university in Ireland. Currently just finished a year in a design company in Ireland and realised that this is not what I want to do at all. Can anyone give me advice on what other industries that a chemical engineer is sought after?

I would consider myself to have very good interpersonable skills and absolutely love public speaking. Sales was always on the radar, maybe tech sales as it pays quite well. I've heard of other engineers going into Big 4 consulting roles but I'm not sure if that is for me either. Looking for a change in either Dublin or London perhaps. A job where I can communicate, deal with people on a day-to-day basis and solve problems is probably what I am looking for.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",Irish_explorer,1,1.0,1,1718283551,2024-06-13 12:59:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1deydxf/career_at_an_early_crossroads/,6,2024
1dey8oz,Help for choosing a career,"Hi everyone,

I need help for choosing a bachelors degree.

A bit about me...

When I was younger, I really liked assembling things together, for example jigsaw puzzles, diy model kits, etc.

Also, I loved (still love) watching big and complex machinery do their job (in factories mainly)

However, when it comes to career selection, I need my job to be involved with tasks, not only assembling parts together, but also creating these parts from scratch. I need both, theory and hands on approach.

Ideal materials for me are all different kinds of metal and rubber.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but candidate career paths for me would be (from what I have found):

- Mechanical Engineering
- Manufacturing Engineering
- Mechanical Engineering Technology

Mechanical Engineering is a bit intimidating, because I do not know if I'm capable enough for this.

The other two are a bit lighter, when it comes to STEM courses, therefore I feel more confident about them.

What is the right path for me? Is it something from above or anything else I haven't mentioned allready?

Thank you in advance",Silly_Tax_6286,1,1.0,3,1718283121,2024-06-13 12:52:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dey8oz/help_for_choosing_a_career/,6,2024
1dexs1s,30 years old and at a complete standstill on what to do for a career. Not getting any younger and getting desperate here. What are some suggestions?,"Hey guys, so i'm going through my 1/3rd life crisis at the moment and am trying to figure out what to do for my career. I never found out what that was in my 20's and I don't want to waste another decade being idle. I'm eager to just start a career and make money and support myself and i'm just wondering what kind of suggestions you may have.

Unfortunately I have no education beyond my high school diploma. I never went to community college or university in my 20's. I'm not opposed to going to school now in my 30's (even though I really don't want to, but i'm also a realist)... But I obviously need to make it count more than ever given my age. I got great marks in high school and I am a bright individual, but it's just finding something to apply that to that's been my biggest issue. 

I know obviously skilled trades are the main suggestion. And i'm certainly not ruling that out. But i'd like to know what other suggestions you may have on careers to consider. Sometimes I think about maybe just going to community college to do something broad, like a 2 year business diploma or something to dip my feet in, then see where my interests take me and maybe look at transferring to a university if i'm inspired enough to do a degree program. But again, given my age and the costs involved too, i'm hesitant to commit to something unless I know there will be valuable pay off career wise.

Right now my main focus is just trying to find something I can do that's in demand and pays well and that I might enjoy enough to get out of bed to go do it every day... I live in a very high COL area (near Toronto) so I can't realistically even be considering any career that would pay less than 60-70K. 

I do have a few strengths worth mentioning too. I can type very fast and am an excellent writer. I am good at coordinating people to do something or to be somewhere (some may call it being a 'control freak' haha. Guilty. I am good at it though). I am very analytical and have strong attention to detail... I do also enjoy working with others and also by myself. A mix.

So I know I have some strengths that would be well suited to certain jobs/careers. It's just figuring out what those are so I can apply myself to them. 

If you have any suggestions, PLEASE list them. Especially ones that require minimal schooling... But I will consider full length schooling too. I will look into literally any and every suggestion you give since I am very desperate. Thank you!",3BordersPeak,14,0.8700000047683716,16,1718281688,2024-06-13 12:28:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dexs1s/30_years_old_and_at_a_complete_standstill_on_what/,6,2024

1dewjvm,Dissatisfied with career and don’t know what to do! ,"So long story short, I’m a personal trainer, and I also work 14 hours a week at a fast food place as my personal training business is self employed and so those 14hrs give me a safety net in case clients drop off or through slow parts of the season (anytime that’s not around the run up to summer or around new years)

I love being a personal trainer however to work at the gym I have to work 12hrs a week where I am “paid” but then the gym takes an amount for “rent” which is the amount they pay us for the hours we work plus a bit extra (so already without clients you’re at a loss from the get go) and as part of the hours we work we have to teach fitness classes something which I’m realising I don’t have the personality for and is very draining both physically and mentally which is making me hate the job which is a shame because I love working with my clients I just hate the essentially free fitness classes so this is where I’m conflicted because I like the fitness industry but group exercise to music classes just aren’t for me. 

Secondary to this I hate the second job I have but I have it because I know the manager and they have worked around me and my pt job in the past and do give me the days and hours I want. 

I have a bachelors degree in arts (film & tv production) where I specialised in sound recording and design. And then most of my cv is filled with retail jobs (which I can’t stand anymore and need to get out of this sector of work)

I’m 26 so I’m starting to panic a bit about not having a real solid idea on what I want in terms of my career, ideally I’d love to make music for a living but right now that is a hobby and the “big dream” I guess (I don’t wish to be mega famous and I realise that will likely never happen I just wish for my music to pay for me to be able to live comfortably and I’d be happy) 

I don’t mind retraining (if it’s not to late to do so) but  I have no idea what I’d even do, I’m just tired of being dissatisfied and feeling like I’m never going to be financially stable or enjoy my work life. 

So to summaries my qualifications are

Fully qualified personal trainer (have been for 5 years now and have been working for 5 years now)

Multiple retail job experience ranging from a regular team member, to a service leader. 

A bachelors degree in arts for film & TV production

What are my best options? I know I need to get out of retail/fast food work, and I need to get out of group fitness classes, my thoughts have been to look for other gyms that don’t require me to teach group classes and is more one to one focused, or I can just wipe the slate clean retrain in another skill and start again in a completely new field of work but then my hearts telling me the past 5 years in fitness will all have been for nothing…I’m so conflicted ",Difficult-Camp4854,5,1.0,2,1718277486,2024-06-13 11:18:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dewjvm/dissatisfied_with_career_and_dont_know_what_to_do/,6,2024

1devouf,What to do if two warring offers potentially coming at different times?,"I am a UK based scientific business developer and I have two companies I've been told I'm the frontrunner for by the representative recruiter (for whatever that is worth). They are both roles I would jump at over my current job, but there is one I definitely prefer.



Preferred Role: I have the third (potentially final, potentially 3/4) interview with the role I want most on Friday (HR Rep). Second interview with the sales director was apparently the big obstacle. They have told me I will find out about this role by the end of the month.



Secondary Role: The representative is speaking to me tomorrow to arrange a second meeting with the senior vice president next week. I have been in process with this role for about six weeks due to some internal reshuffling - this meeting could be anything from an explanation of the delay, the final interview or a non-zero chance of an outright verbal offer.



I am aware this all sounds very airy fairy but I believe both are strong possibilities so I want to be prepared for any contingency - there is of course always the chance both amount ot jack all. My concern is that if the secondary role interviews me and offers me or just outright offers me the role in a meeting next week, this leaves me in a position where I have to ask for too long a wait to accept their offer - or I sacrifice the offer for the other role and potentially lose both.



My thoughts are:



I am away at a conference in France next week, I could feasibly ask that the meeting is delayed until Monday 24th which would allow time to consider both. However, I don't want to be seen as not prioritising the role by waiting so long for a chat as it is still a brilliant opportunity.



I could explain the situation to my rep for the preferred role and ask if they could suggest expediting the decision making process.



How do I treat the recruiters in this situation, transparency? I would prefer to be as frank as possible with them as they have both been brilliant and the other companies being aware I am in demand can't be a negative.",Fast_Shopping1891,1,1.0,0,1718274267,2024-06-13 10:24:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1devouf/what_to_do_if_two_warring_offers_potentially/,6,2024

I want to get back there, but I’m very aware that with that isolation comes a drop in job potential. It’s evident that in that scenario my two options are to find a travelling job where my location is less relevant, or a fully work from home job that has no preference at all, and neither of these fit with the current job I have. 

So ultimately I’m asking the experienced careers men and women, how to you switch sectors and/or find you way to a profession that work for what you want out of life?

1det3ln,High school senior with a career crisis!!!! Please help! ,"I am a high school senior and I have no idea what career to pursue. I am so conflicted between choosing a job for money or something that seems tolerable and fulfilling regardless of the lower pay. To be more specific, my top options right now are nursing and becoming a high school Spanish teacher

For context, I live in Southern California, and I do want a lifestyle that can sustain living comfortably and I know that the cost of living here is insane. My mom is a nurse and I know she makes a good amount of money considering that she is the only one making money for our family of 4. She has even encouraged me about travel nursing which makes a LOT of money. I also am aware that it is very easy to secure a job in nursing as there is a big shortage. As much as I like the fact that I will be able to help people and that everyday would be different, I know how much being a nurse takes a toll on the body physically and the emotional obstacles I would have to overcome. That is not even considering how difficult nursing school is. I am also Filipino, and I want to break the stereotype of becoming a nurse lol. 

As for becoming a Spanish teacher, this idea blossomed in my freshman year of high school. I took Spanish and completely fell in love with the language. I took it upon myself to immerse myself in the language and learn it at home, so much so that I was able to go from Spanish I to Spanish III Honors for Sophmore year. I was able to finish AP Spanish this school year as a junior and currently looking forward to my 2 week summer Spanish immersion program in Mexico. You get the point, I love Spanish. I have also been close to almost all the Spanish teachers in my school and they have really been fundamental in my high school journey and I consider them to be important people in my life. I want to be that person for a future high schooler because at home I don't have a strong support system aside from my close friends. On the other hand, I am scared to major in Spanish and realize, ""Oh crap I don't want to be a Spanish teacher anymore"". That is my worst fear because if I don't want to pursue teaching anymore, I don't know what else I would do with my Spanish degree. I also am aware of the horrible salary and I see first hand how much work goes into teaching as my teacher who I TA for works past contract hours and often has to stay after school to lesson plan and grade.   


Being a therapist has also crossed my mind. Even my own therapist told me I should become a therapist. But dealing with other people's personal problems sounds too draining. That is taking account people I know I would hate to interact with like psychopaths, sociopaths, abusers, etc. But just thought I should mention it anyway. 

Sorry if this was too long. Even though I considered myself to be an introvert because I was shy, I have come to realize that I am a person who loves helping people and interacting with them. It is those interactions that motivate me and makes me want to get out of bed every morning. There is no way that I can just sit down on the computer in my little cubicle all day long. But I am scared to make a career decision based on my personality, because I am only 16 years old. Sure, I can stray away from the STEM field and be true to myself right now, but what if my goals and motivations drastically change when I get older? I am sure they are bound to. I just feel so stuck.

1deszqv,"Torn between GIS and data-related IT, which career path should I follow?","I'm 21 and I feel like I can pinpoint what job characteristics would suit me well, yet I struggle to match them to actual professions and decide on a single path. I am sorry if this post is long and rambling. 



SKILLS/INTERESTS

I've always had an interest in cartography, I enjoy drawing and analysing maps, as well as map-related things such as transport networks. I used to spend hours making up administrative divisions, planning public transport routes, country subdivision rules, just to never look at them again after I made them since it was the process itself that's very enjoyable for me. This enjoyment applies more broadly to any kind of work that is solitary, structured, based on following guidelines and handling/transforming data. I value stability over money and I'd be fine working a normal office job where I'm fully dedicated to work during work hours and  free afterwards. Working remotely sounds amazing, but it's more of a wish now since companies are switching to hybrid. Money-wise, I'm fine with earning a given country's average salary. There is another very important thing for me and that's 



LOCATION

I am from Poland and the bachelor I'm currently doing is in Denmark. However, my future plans lie in neither. I have a pretty clear vision of how I want to live in the future in terms of location:- Live in either Sweden, Norway, Finland or Estonia.

- If the job is non-remote, live in a village 30-50km from the city I work in and commute by car

- If the job is remote, as far away from people as possible :) 

In general, natural, spacious and quiet environment are very important for me and I'm willing to compromise other factors if my location plan was to work out. Language-wise, I'm fine with learning another one. 



BACHELOR/SWE

Currently I'm on a 2nd year of a Software Engineering bachelor and the parts I liked the most was the database course, as well as documenting the systems we created, eg. by creating class diagrams, since they fit the characteristics from the 3rd paragraph. What I don't like at all is constant instability and stress this profession entails. When I enrolled in the bachelor, the market for Software Engineers was still great, now it's horrible for juniors and nobody knows if it will recover. Also, constantly learning new technologies in order to stay afloat feels like unpaid work and I wouldn't like it if work constantly consumed my life outside of work hours. 

In general, I feel like I'm more suited for documenting/auditing rather than creating.



MASTER/FURTHER PATH

Now I'm thinking about what master to choose and I'm considering 2 major paths:

- GIS degree - this would align well with my interest in cartography, however I'm skeptical about employment opportunities afterwards because of small job pool. It sounds more likely for me to be struck by lightning than to find a GIS job in eg. Estonia. It sounds too obscure to bring stability. But this was my initial plan in high school - to do a SWE bachelor and GIS master, and if I can't find a GIS job, I'll have the SWE ""backup"". 

- CS/IT degree - taking this path, I would try to specialize into something more suited to my abilities/preferences and more IT than SWE. I am especially thinking about going into a Database Administrator route. This path is safer imo, and would give me a larger job pool than GIS. 

I would greatly appreciate any ideas on:

- Which other jobs fit the characteristics from paragraph #2 where SWE educational background would be appreciated or at least it would be possible to transition with masters?

- Which of the two paths should I choose master-wise, or maybe another one?

1der21g,Just started training with my job but wanting to leave,"So after 10 years with this company I finally put myself forward and asked if they can put sponsor me through some higher education, I'm 29 work in the building industry as a handy man. The company agreed to put me through a diploma of building and construction, the course is $1200 and takes 18 months to complete. To complete the course you need to be working under a registered builder for some of the assessment work to be signed off.

Unfortunately I very much feel like leaving my job. Since trying to organise this it has been extremely hard to get the boses to talk with me about what this course could mean and what I will need to do. There are technically 3 bosses as its a family business, a Mum, Dad and Son. Today I asked the Mum boss about this Diploma and she said she didnt even know I was doing it and will have to talk to the Son to get details about how they might go forward (usually when they say this they dont talk and you really have to push for anything to happen). Ive already paid for it as its not that expensive so I kinda dont want them to pay for it now and get me to feel like I owe them after a $1200 course.

Theres more then the diploma, a work provided car thats old leaking oil that they dont want to fix. A work provided phone that's an iPhone 6. When you tell them we need new stuff they kinda just say yep and shrug you off. The work is so unorgansised, often I sit around with no work booked in just filling my hours with nothing, sounds great paid for nothing but it gets so boring. I'm wondering if its worth sticking the diploma with this headache or if this is just a dead end and I should try do the training somewhere else?

In all honesty I'm not even interested in staying in building at this point but its the only job ive had since 17 and currently hold no qualifications. I'm actually more interested in Sound, Audio and media.

1deqpa3,advice for hard left turn in biology career,"Not sure where else to ask this!

**context**: I'm currently in my mid- late 20's. I majored in marine biology with a strong emphasis on the molecular bio side of things, originally wanted to be doing field biologist type work out of love for the coastal ecosystem of west USA. Immediately after graduating, Pandemic hit, and basically hurled me into a molecular biology career, first working in covid diagnostics, then plant virus research, and now doing more niche, but similar research in a pretty advanced role. It's been a bit over 4 years, and pandemic is over. I'm doing very, very well by most standards, however I've realized that this work is making me miserable; not being outside ever, not using biology to help the natural world, and living in major metropolis biotech hubs, which is exactly where I don't want to be. I've got the opportunity for direct admit for a PhD in another biotech-heavy metropolitan area, but I don't know if I want to double down on molecular biology as my life.

Any advice for escaping the path I'm pretty far down on? or spinning it into something more towards the ecology side? Or finding a niche within biotech that would be more enjoyable?

I got into bio to engage with nature and help the world, and I have no idea how I'd go about restarting the life I wanted before COVID . I have a good amount of experience relating to the more green side of biology, but it's totally eclipsed by my molecular research career. Of course lots of experience presenting science, teamwork, etc. I'm looking for advice on ways that I could use the experience that I have to move my career more towards something that would align more with my values—both in terms of gratification from doing work that feels meaningful, and that would allow me a better work-life balance and to live outside of one of the few major US cities that allow for biotech careers.",escapeplan-throwaway,1,1.0,0,1718253731,2024-06-13 04:42:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1deqpa3/advice_for_hard_left_turn_in_biology_career/,6,2024

Another issue would be having to lie about going to school in August at a place like Home Depot or Target which I feel like if I quit within the next few months to go back to school they'll be hesitant to rehire me again and I'll stuck somewhere else in food service for the future. But I think it would help a lot to be making $15 compared to $11 in the short amount of time I have to save up before I leave.

  
My goal is to make as much money as possible and work as much as possible to save up before I have to return to school. My family is telling me to do what's best and it's best to not burn bridges unless is somewhere I down want to return to by I'm still undecided.

1demnnl,Which IT Co-Op should I choose? ,"
I have two Information technology co-op offers, one from a government job that pays $17.20 and one from a smaller growing company that pays $21.00. The smaller company has quite a few opportunities for growth, and I’d be able to move around likely to another department. In addition to that, they like to keep people on co-op for at least 1 year, if not as a permanent job. The government job with the city though also leaves room for growth, and if I do well I could probably co-op there for more than just a semester too. It seems like the job with the small company should be the clear winner, but the thing is if I was able to get a job with the city, even if there is an economic downturn city jobs likely wouldn’t be impacted as much. At least that’s the advice my parents gave me. I’m still not sure though. The pay difference is quite big, but my main worry is whether or not a co-op with the city would end up offering me the opportunity to co-op for longer than a semester and turn into a job.

1dem80k,Coping with a Petty Manager,"I work for a mid size pharmaceutical company in Clinical Operations. I report to a Sr. Manager. 

Late last year, I didn’t meet her expectations on 2 items. The problem was, she never communicated what her expectations were. Instead of guiding me on what she wanted. She acted very passive aggressive and petty. Example, one of the items I didn’t meet her expectations with was creating a PowerPoint slide for a meeting with a cross functional team. The Director for the team we met with doesn’t like people wasting time on slides. She would rather just have a conversation. Hence, why I thought slides would not be needed. The short meeting went well. We answered all questions asked of us and got some feedback to help us start our project. My manager was very upset with me. After the meeting she tore into me about my unprofessionalism and how dare I meet this group unprepared. She then tore apart the wording in the Outlook invitation I sent and told me how she would have wanted it worded. She said I made her uncomfortable and embarrassed her. 

After a couple of these experiences, I went to HR to see if I could get reassigned to a different study / manager. She was mad I went to HR and things got worse for a short period of time. Eventually things went back to a “good place” and we’ve been in that good place since December. I get 1:1 meeting minutes from her every week and there has been nothing but positive comments since then.

Fast forward to today. I made a mistake and I didn’t handle something the way she wanted. I take full ownership of my mistake. She noted clearly what she wanted but I didn’t address it correctly. That’s on me. She called me to address what happened. I owned my mistake, apologized profusely, said i need to do better next time. I asked her what I could do to rectify the situation and make her happy. She went on and on for 15-20 minutes about how she couldn’t trust me. She kept saying how she had a hard time wrapping her head around this being a mistake. It’s like she was looking for something deeper than a mistake. During the conversation she brought up how I went to HR and reported her. She made a comment about even after what happened, she is still working with me and how that doesn’t happen often. I reported her because of this type of behavior. I got the sense she really doesn’t like me and that’s possibly why she was analyzing this mistake as something more. It sounds like after the HR issues, she was forced to continue working with me but that’s not something she wanted. I didn’t want to work with her either but i’ve tried to make the best of it. She accused me of being defensive even though i owned my mistake,apologized profusely, and asked how i could fix it. Towards the end of the call, she must have released all her rage, because the conversation pivoted to moving forward. How sometimes we read emails and then realize we could have addressed things better. She wanted to forget the conversation and move forward. 

After the phone call, I sent her a follow-up email. I apologized again and outlined a few point on how I will do better moving forward. I said I valued her and would never do anything purposeful to essentially ruin the peace we’ve had. 

The program I’m on is ending soon. I will potentially be transferred to another team where I will not report to her anymore. I’m not okay with how she spoke to me today. Part of me just wants to stay quiet because I think a new assignment announcement will be released soon. The other part of me wants to go back to HR and report this. It’s not okay. This would make things worse though. She would be more angry I went to HR a second time. I feel like quitting but I also don’t want to let her win that way. 

I don’t know what to do here. Any advice from folks who have experienced something similar? ",LiveLongandProsper29,2,1.0,0,1718239108,2024-06-13 00:38:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dem80k/coping_with_a_petty_manager/,6,2024

1del0yj,Career suggestions for a wordy and dissatisfied environmental consultant?,"Salutations! I am hoping for suggestions on career next steps, as I am currently dissatisfied with aspects of my current job and am considering looking elsewhere. However, I don't know where else to begin looking and am concerned I might miss something I may enjoy simply because I don't know it exists. If you please, might anyone have suggestions what alternate careers I may consider?

Sorry for stilted language, I am endeavoring to evade parlance and cadence recognition by colleagues I know frequent Reddit. TIA for feedback, and sorry if I do not respond - it likely means I lost the login after creating this account.

I work in environmental consulting. My degree is biology, but I work environmental projects. I did not intend to be here, it was a position available during the Great Covideo Panini. I enjoy the variety, being outdoors, picking up new skills, and occasional projects that feel like the make a material difference such as remediation. I do not enjoy that we are required to ""fill our own plate"", which requires nagging increasingly peripheral contacts to see if they have a project that needs staffing, and leads to taking any work that comes your way no matter what (I have had 14 hour days 6 days a week in the sun where we could not wear sunscreen or risk contaminating the sample, or had to conduct customer service calls and client lead cold calls, all of which I hated but had no other choice of work). I do not enjoy how little genuine time off we have (7 calendar holidays and ""flexible"" time off that requires approval dependent on billable %s that are frankly unachievable without working weeks of OT to compensate). 

I enjoy work that feels like it's making a difference, and have liked the emergency/disaster response projects I have done. I like working with animals, being in the woods, and solving problems on the computer (R scripting, GIS mapping, and such). I don't like using microscopes (they hurt my eyes and body). I like jumping between lots of pursuits, and hate feeling boxed in or tied down (one of my fears for specific career pursuits). I like some of the flexibility of working remotely. I like writing and researching, and editing others's writing and research. hate constantly not knowing what I will be doing for work next week, month, so on - and the prospect of having to dig into my time off to compensate if I can't find anything. I like working overtime to bank it for time off when I want to use it, instead of have to. I would like to actually be able to schedule my life/have a life.

Outside of work, I enjoy swimming, hiking, photography (especially nature photography), learning about industrial, aviation, and natural disasters (focus on causes and consequences), working with my hands, long drives thru nowhere, watching Youtube video essays, and gaining useful or unusual skills and certifications. I do not believe all of those translate into jobs, lol.

Now that this exhaustive and too long background has concluded, I thank you for patience. If you have suggestions what I might like as a future job, I would greatly appreciate your feedback. Thank you!",Ok-Marsupial4057,1,1.0,1,1718235552,2024-06-12 23:39:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1del0yj/career_suggestions_for_a_wordy_and_dissatisfied/,6,2024
1dekyid,Absolutely hate my sales job but feel like it’s my only option at this point,"I (m29) graduated college in 2019 after changing majors several times and finally landed on a communications degree. My first job out of college was a in the office sales development program that I enjoyed due to the hands-on and face to face aspect of being in the office and on job sites to learn about the construction industry. After 2 weeks on the job COVID hit and I essentially became a telemarketer. After about a year I quit the job and moved home telling myself that things would be different after COVID settled down. During that time I became incredibly depressed since I had no direction, passions, or purpose. I worked several odd jobs and tried to figure out what I wanted to do but it seemed that the only avenues available to me were recruiting, account management, or outside sales. I’m now working in sales again and hate it every day. I’m fairly socially outgoing with friends but in a work setting I’m completely introverted since I’m still battling depression and do not feel comfortable in a corporate setting as it feels completely disingenuous. I feel like I’m completely stuck in this dead-end job I hate and don’t have the experience to apply for anything better. I’m strongly considering a complete career change and pursuing something in the trades, particularly carpentry or welding.

1dekuez,How to approach asking for a new title and a raise in this situation? ,"Hello. I work at a small (ish) nonprofit with about 30 full time team member and 30 part time team members (depending on the season). I work in the Philanthropy department as the philanthropy coordinator. My job is supposed to be like an admin assistant but with a few more responsibilities. I had a lot of prior experience in development and donor databases, so I have been given a lot of extra responsibilities, which I didn't mind because I'm trying to build my career. 

  
When I started, there was 5 of us: myself, a manager of individual giving, a maker of grants, a director of philanthropy, and the chief philanthropy officer. In January, the Director left and our organization decided not to rehire for her position. This meant myself and the two managers essentially split up her job duties and have all been in charge of new things. I have taken the lead on event planning and analytics, the manager of grants has taken the lead on sponsorships, and the manager of individual giving has taken on a lot of strategic planning efforts. Around the same time, our chief started undergoing treatment for cancer and was out of the office more and more, which means we all learned to work independently and again, started taking on more responsibilities. 

  
On Tuesday, the three of us were called to the CEO's office where he let us know the chief has been let go and they have decided to restructure the philanthropy office. We have all been promised that we are not losing our jobs and that they hope we stay, but they haven't mentioned to any of us any kind of restructuring with our roles. With both of our leaders gone, there is no longer any one in our office who can make high level decision, and our new direct supervisor is the CEO. 

  
I feel this is a good opportunity for me to bring up to him how we have all been working beyond our roles/salaries but I've never had that kind of conversation with someone before. I'm not sure if I even should. I'd love some advice how to approach this situation.

1dekixa,"I never progressed in my career, now I'm 10 years in and feel totally stuck...","I (32F) have worked for many companies from the start of my career, all in recruitment.  For the first few years I got promoted, moved around, and had a great career in a Fortune 500 firm.  I moved to another position during the pandemic that paid more for a ""sexier"" company, but hated the job.  Moved to a tech company after that and loved that job, but got laid off in 2022.

  
Long story short, I am now in my early 30s, working in a very remote location in NY (moved here to be with husband), and took this corporate job (still in Fortune 500) working remotely basically doing admin work for less pay.  I am miserable in my job, I feel like my core skills are dying and I'm my team's bitch.  I don't even have the ability to talk to candidates on the phone anymore, other than scheduling interviews.

  
I'm trying to do some personal and professional L&D but I'm struggling to stay motivated/keep my sanity.  My stress has gotten so bad I've had to start to see a therapist.  I'm getting good feedback at work, but more aligned to administrative tasks, not the core work I was hired for (which they changed on me weeks in, but I was in a contract role with no options). Being remote, I really have no work friends either, and whenever I go into the office it's awkward since I don't feel I fit in, and none of my team sits there.  The round trip is 5 hours, but I have a sister who lives closer so would be an option to go in...

The problem is, I'm the primary bread winner and my husband and I rely on my job's benefits since he doesn't have any.  I feel like I never really specialized in anything as I stepped away from full-cycle recruitment years ago, and now I'm feeling super isolated and awful about my lack of career development.  I sort of feel like I ruined my career and now may have to be stuck in this forever until they decide I'm not needed anymore / eliminate my job or I leave and am screwed.  I'm transparently feeling so bad about myself at this stage, it's hard to even interview or network.

  
Husband and I have talked about moving in the next year or two, but that will probably align with starting a family, so would be harder to find a new job and career.  My question is, should I stick it out and make the best of it?  Does everyone feel this way and is it okay to not love my job in order to provide for my family??  Any advice would be appreciated!

1dekc0c,Taking on colleague work load; should I give an ultimatum?,"Hello all. I am faced with a predicament that will require me to make a big decision within the next couple of months. I am part of a large organization and my team is small with 3 people. We accomplish a lot of work and I have a strong record of success. 

I also think it's important to give some info about the company. It's not your typical for-profit tech corporation (like FAANG) and as far as I know, there have never been mass layoffs- it's non-profit and funded by government contracts. Our work is not motivated by quarterly sales but rather delivering quality solutions that adhere to the contracts and the deadlines are important. I think this is important to consider as I try to decipher the motives of my employer.

Upper management is disconnected from the contributors. Many of us question whether or not they care at all and feel replaceable. They tried, unsuccessfully, to bring people back to the office after covid despite acknowledging the studies showing higher productivity for remote positions (BuT ThEY MisS OuT on THe CulTUre)

Middle management is better and I think they genuinely care about the well being of the staff. I could be wrong though as I only meet with them maybe once a month. I have certainly seen unfair treatment of others but I don't know the whole story.

My team is amazing and we all have each other's backs. I am very happy working here.

Due to frustrations with upper management and some unfair treatment, my colleague has gotten a job elsewhere (I am stoked for them, they deserve it!).

I am the lowest ranked person on my team. The highest ranked person (apart from our manager) is the one that is leaving. During the next 3 months, their duties are going to fall on me as I am the next highest skilled contributor and can actually do the work.
Additionally I might get promoted after those 3 months.

When I got promoted previously, it took everyone (middle management and HR) almost 4 months to complete the process. The pay bump was about 30% so I am wondering if that was motive for the delay. This new promotion would be another 30% bump.

Here's my predicament. Many friends, family, and colleagues all say to stand up for yourself and advocate for yourself. My colleagues recognize that I do a great job and am also just as skilled (and more so) than other people multiple levels above me. In past jobs I have had similar experiences where I have quit those jobs (twice) because of broken promises and people trying to squeeze more work out of me without any promotion or pay bump. Needless to say, I am highly skeptical of this potential promotion and I would like to have a job offer lines up so that I can give THEM the deadline.

On the other hand, I cannot be the only one experiencing this. There are thousands of employees in this organization and some of them have been there for over 20 years. Have they all put up with BS and been walked on in order to stay there? Do I need to be more flexible and let them take 4-6 months to drag their feet? Or should I truly stick up for myself and risk being fired or laid off?

On that note- my industry is competitive and very hard to find work. There's a high chance I will not have another job lined up before then.

TLDR: Employer giving me another employee's work load with the ""possibility"" of a promotion. Do I demand that promotion in a timely manner or get another job? I LOVE my job and would like to stay here forever but I do not want to get taken advantage of.",Alternative_War_9052,1,1.0,0,1718233638,2024-06-12 23:07:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dekc0c/taking_on_colleague_work_load_should_i_give_an/,6,2024
1dekbkq,Late thirties in a low level/stress design job. Any advice on how to pivot?,"
I work at a University Extension. If you don’t know what Extension is, it is a sector of the University that has various programs that involves research and teaching the community. We have programs such as 4-H youth development, horticulture, SNAP-Education, Etc. We do all types of community outreach across our state.

That said, my job title is administrative assistant/graphic designer. I started from a totally different background working as a case manager for children in social services. I’m a creative and completed a graphic communications certificate on the side. I was able to get out of case management during COVID and landed my current role. I thought of it as a pivot to move higher up into something else and I’m still here 3 years later.

The tasks that I do are basically a marketing assistant. I create graphics using illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop and sometimes Canva. I make marketing materials such as brochures, flyers, etc.  I help create social media posts, help monitor analytics, work with content management systems and do some front-end web development.

The University has its own marketing team of course.

I am feeling stagnant in my work because I don’t really have anyone that I can learn from and our office has always been a little behind (i.e. Some people in our office still use publisher.) I also don’t have any seniority because I am an admin assistant. In a way it is nice because this is a fairly low stress job and I never take work home or work weekends. I also have a hybrid work schedule. Sometimes I wish I had more seniority and would want a faster pace work environment with people who are more like-minded and up-to-date on current marketing trends.

I find myself being drawn to SEO marketing when I have to take time to put information on the website and check analytics. I’m really not up-to-date on marketing language because it’s not even my background but, my first degree was in journalism/advertising so I do have some school experience. I’m trying to explore if there is a more technical side of marketing that I could learn on the side and branch out to.

I also commonly read about people in marketing and design who wish they worked with more non-profit work that is more meaningful, which is what I currently do.  Right now I make 60k. My husband makes around 250K BEFORE TAXES. I mostly work to have insurance but want to do something I enjoy.

Sorry this is a little long winded but wondering if anyone has any advice on where to branch out to or should I stay put in a low-level not super fulfilling job? We also have a 1.5 year old and i just turned 37 so my time is a bit limited with going to school again but I am open to it.

I had expressed my concerns to them but they brushed it off but some of them still jokingly threaten to send it to everybody so I won’t be able to go to university.

Preferred Role: I have the third (potentially final, potentially 3/4) interview with the role I want most on Friday (HR Rep). Second interview with the sales director was apparently the big obstacle. They have told me I will find out about this role by the end of the month.

Secondary Role: The representative is speaking to me tomorrow to arrange a second meeting with the senior vice president next week. I have been in process with this role for about six weeks due to some internal reshuffling - this meeting could be anything from an explanation of the delay, the final interview or a non-zero chance of an outright verbal offer.

I am aware this all sounds very airy fairy but I believe both are strong possibilities so I want to be prepared for any contingency - there is of course always the chance both amount ot jack all. My concern is that if the secondary role interviews me and offers me or just outright offers me the role in a meeting next week, this leaves me in a position where I have to ask for too long a wait to accept their offer - or I sacrifice the offer for the other role and potentially lose both.

My thoughts are:

- I am away at a conference in France next week, I could feasibly ask that the meeting is delayed until Monday 24th which would allow time to consider both. However, I don't want to be seen as not prioritising the role by waiting so long for a chat as it is still a brilliant opportunity.

- I could explain the situation to my rep for the preferred role and ask if they could suggest expediting the decision making process.

How do I treat the recruiters in this situation, transparency? I would prefer to be as frank as possible with them as they have both been brilliant and the other companies being aware I am in demand can't be a negative.",Fast_Shopping1891,1,1.0,0,1718229888,2024-06-12 22:04:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1deixcr/what_to_do_if_two_warring_offers_potentially/,6,2024

So after that, I took a grossly hyped-up tech bootcamp ($$$) that promised a lot of things, but ended up leaving me unemployed for over a year because the tech industry went through a huge overhaul (plus AI takeover) and the bubble burst for the field I was in… So now I’ve got an extensive amount of knowledge in two fields that I can’t work in and a huge gap in employment…

1deicmg,Career opportunities vs mental health? Please advice.,"Hello, Everyone. 

I have just finished high school and am about to start university. I am currently living in the UK with my parents.

They don't treat me nicely, they don't respect me, respect is far-fetched; they don't even talk properly. My parents constantly taunt me, compare me, force their wishes on me, and try to control me in every single aspect(career choice, eating habits, workout habits, and everything else, heck! even mobile phone data plans).

They keep giving me the silent treatment from time to time. They shout, they cuss, and criticize every single move of mine. It is impossible to have a civil conversation with them about differences of opinion, they gaslight me and blame everything on me.

My mental health has taken a huge beating because of all these, I'm improving myself and learning stoicism.

I can move to my home country of Bulgaria and live with my grandparents there, but I would have to leave the UK and move to Bulgaria to complete my undergrad(I will also graduate with zero student debt if I move to Bulgaria). The only concerning factor is career opportunities, after completing my bachelor's in Bulgaria there will be limited career opportunities so I'll have to do a master's back in the UK(I want to settle in the UK).

In Bulgaria, I'll be able to live comfortably with my grandparents. If I think about moving out in London when I'm in university; it is going to be extremely hard as I'll need to work 25 hours a week alongside university just to survive(I'll get very few student loans in the UK as my parents income is very high but they are not going to help at all).

I am going to study mathematics, then I want to do master's in data science to move into data science or do master's in mathematical finance and move into finance.

What should I do? Is it worth going to Bulgaria?

1dei8yb,Switching fields/major from CS to DS ?,"My background is in computer science. I know python, Java, html,css JavaScript (basics for all languages). Interested to learn react, Mongodb, etc... to complete full stack development. Although my heart is with data science 

I am second year student in college. I have less interest in attending classes but want to learn through books, videos, boot camps, maybe internship also.  

I have wanted to data science since high school. I am fine with computer science, especially after finding my areas of interest. I find it more challenging and I like that I find it challenging. I synchronized myself with learning CS. does that makes sense? I mean I know what I am doing 

I have always found data science interesting. I love math and stats. I don't know much about it. Getting a job in Spotify, Netflix, etc excites me

I am PURELY asking the question from an ECONOMIC perspective. I am emotionally fine with any decision 

1. Social media brands that are going to have a big influence in the future. I think data science is gonna skyrocket. Think about things like neuralink or Tesla. Data analytics is going to matter and I love analyzing data in mathematics, sciences. I think data science has high scope in the future like software did with our parents generation. It holds the future in my opinion. What do you think? I would love to hear your thoughts 

2. Software engineering might ware out. 
a. Because all tasks are automated or will be in future AI
b. Programming languages are becoming easier and easier to learn (look at python and compare it to Java)
C. I think demand v supply is decreasing. 
d. I just think salary is just less and will always be less anyways because of other factors I can't think about right now (sorry I am in a hurry)

Everywhere I am seeing - YouTube videos, people blogs posts, YouTube shorts (those guys who interview random people) data science seems to be the better option. (Purely numbers)

1dei4s0,Seeking advice on career path after big work reassignment ,"Just want to apologize upfront on vagueness but I work in a very specialized field so too many details can give me away

So yes, specialized technical field and I have spent my entire career at the same company. My company has been through some controversy over the last few years and morale is low at the company. That said, I was in a rare place where I was passionate about my job and the product and I have spent my entire career in one area of the product where I love the technical aspects of said product. This has helped me become a high performer along with the general wisdom experience brings. We have also lost a lot of experienced people at the company which has helped my upward mobility. I am not a manager and am an individual contributor and was exactly where I wanted to be, enjoying myself and was deeply involved with my area of the product, despite the low morale at the company overall.

Due to a recent event, a high priority project came up and I was hand selected to lead it. I do not want to do it and it is in an area I have zero prior expertise on. I was ripped out of my role where I had specialized expertise and historical knowledge that very few other people could claim. There was zero transition time. Communication from management about details was crappy at first and it felt really bad. At first I thought it was borderline unethical for them to ask me to do what they asked. After more communication, the ethical dilemma was cleared but I had reservations about what this would mean for my career path. I had spent my entire career on a different area and now was being sent somewhere unrelated which I view as derailing. Management argued that it would help with a future promotion. I eventually bought in but under the condition that I get to go back to my old job when the assignment is  done. A demand that management promised would be met.

Unfortunately there was no backfill for me and in a very short period of time, that promise was broken and they hired someone to take my old role. After discussing this with management, they tell me I will go back as a senior person overseeing the person filling my old role along with other people on the team. I see this “senior” role as more hands off, high level and probably more boring though on paper is a bigger responsibility. It doesn’t come with any extra compensation either or any true title or promotion changes. Just a new word in my email signature block. It may help in 5-10-15 years time when I would be due for the next level upgrade but this next level upgrade is very hard to come by and most people cap out where I am now. It requires certain responsibilities at the time of promotion and cares less about what you’ve done in the past. Thus the uncertainty in timing of when it could happen, if ever.

I feel lied to and cheated. Bait and switched. Management hasn’t even had the courtesy to come talk to me since this new person was hired. This is not close to the first time they’ve fumbled in the art of “caring for the team” so there’s already some frustration there with many people. Part of me wants to make a stink over broken promises. I’m not really interested in ladder climbing so the senior role doesn’t mean much to me. I want to be hands on and involved in projects rather than consulting from a high level, but I also know that turning down more responsibilities can be career suicide.

Maybe I’m just here to vent but if anyone’s been through anything similar and has words of wisdom I’d love to hear it. If you think I just need to grow up then that’s fine too. Thanks in advance.

1dehqu6,Need help choosing between two job offers,"Just looking for some insight from folks... I've been going back and forth over the pros and cons of each job and am having a hard time deciding which is the best path forward. 

Fed job: Learned today after emailing HR to request status update as I received another job offer that my step increase (G9-1 to G9-6) was approved, but have not received FJO. Approximately 45 min commute, no telework potential. Job is related to my area of expertise/interests, but not an exact match. More opportunities to advance or make a lateral move if desired (particularly to get a position closer to home).

Municipal job: Pay is higher and health insurance for family 100% paid, but when considering additional commute costs and lack of retirement match, not much difference. Retirement plan offered is 8% employer contribution (nothing required from me), which sounds soo generous until 10-year vesting (!!!) schedule is considered (I do not see myself staying in this position for 10 years, so essentially no retirement benefit). No telework. 24 PTO days off (vs 12/12 PTO/sick for feds), 14 holidays vs 11 feds, 8 hour work day includes lunch (8:00 - 4:00), which would slightly offset longer 1 hour commute. I think I would like the day to day tasks of this job more and it is a senior level position (Director). No room for advancement/lateral as I'd be coming in at the top of my department.

Additionally, as I mentioned, I don't have the FJO yet from the feds so I am concerned about turning down the municipal job and then the fed job falls through. I have to provide a response to the municipal offer by tomorrow morning.

1dehm5c,2-3 month IT Contract vs. IT Adjacent Job,"I think I have 2 opportunities on the table in the next few weeks. No official offers yet, but im nearing the final interview stage.

1 job is a 2-3 month IT contract for an MSP and the hiring manager said he wants to get it extended if possible with the client. This is more in line with your typical IT help desk/L1 job. No benefits.

2nd job is a hardware support job that doesn't really have IT responsibilities outside of answering tickets and imaging devices. This job is more about shipping/fulfillment rather than your typical IT help desk job. This is a full time position with benefits.

As someone with no experience in IT and just the A+, which seems better to take on? It's possible I get an offer from the Hardware support job first before the I get one from the IT contract job. I'm leaning towards the 2-3 month IT contract job simply because theres chances of extension even if small, and I get experience and things to add to my resume.

Simply put:

1) Which job should I accept if both are given?

2) If I get an offer for the hardware support job first, how should I handle it since im still waiting for a reply from the IT contract job?

1dehfgq,Quit job for film opportunity?,"I’m currently 24 years old. I went to school and recently graduated a year ago with a degree in Media Studies.

Fast forward to now, I got a great opportunity a few months ago to be a video journalist at a big station in a top #50 market. I enjoy it but honestly don’t love it.

1degwns,Struggling to Pick College Major ,"I (22 F) am in my third year at a public school in the states and am struggling to pick my college major. It’s getting quite anxiety-inducing and I just want to get on some sort of path. My first love is medicine, as I grew up with (and still have) chronic health issues and have always wanted to be the empathetic medical provider that truly “gets it” that I never had (biology is also really intuitive for me). However, I worry I won’t have the stamina to endure so much additional and particularly brutal training. I also struggled greatly my first year due to some personal circumstances and did less than stellar academically (have been on the Dean's List every semester since though!). My current focuses (meaning I’m taking all the classes but haven’t declared the majors) are biology and math. I am a very analytical person and am a fan of puzzles. I also really like planning and managing, which is a large part of my current job (private educational coach/tutor; basically I make sure kids meet graduation requirements, get their work done, and help them apply to colleges).  I took a CS class and really did not enjoy it. The actual coding was ok, but the pace and culture of the class was rough, and I don’t think I’d be happy if a huge majority of my job required in-depth coding. I’ve considered Information Systems as a major, but at my school it’s much more business-focused (around 85% of the classes are pure business) and I don’t know how I feel about that (I worry it’ll put me at a disadvantage over CS/more technical IS majors). I took Intro to IS and found the technical aspect really interesting (like cybersecurity and how the internet works). I’ve spoken with advisors at my school, but they haven’t helped very much honestly. The “requirements”, for lack of a better term, for my ideal career would be:



-Less than 50 hrs/week of work 

-$150k+ salary after 10 ish years in the SF Bay Area (I know this is steep, but I have significant medical costs and would like the option to have kids and maybe buy a home close to my parents someday)

-Somewhat limited people skills necessary (I work well with others and like socializing to some degree, but I am pretty introverted and something like sales would kill me)

-Some semblance of job security (I know in today’s world it’s rough out there, but having job security is quite important due to health insurance and such)

-Not super monotonous (ADHD makes repetitive/understimulating tasks difficult for me)

-Aligned with mental health, tech, medicine, data, or helping professions

1degah6,Industrial engineer trying to go remote,"I am a UK based 32 year old with 12 years experience as an on site engineer. I’m electrically biased and apprentice trained working mostly on industrial machinery and automation. No further education. I’ve worked in a variety of roles and unfortunately never really specialised in anything. I’ve always started jobs and contracts and picked things up quite quickly and then never got trained properly. The job becomes very repetitive and I end up moving on. 

I’m a good maintenance engineer, fixing breakdowns, improving machine performance and good installation skills. I can navigate most PLC software for fault finding purposes and have a lot of commissioning experience. I manage teams and projects well also but it’s not something I’m that interested in. 

Currently I work everyday on site, selecting, programming and installing VFDs and motors for customers. Both reacting to breakdowns and sourcing/ programming replacement drives  to get machines up and running and planned upgrades. Some being DC to AC conversions and servo motor upgrades. 

To be honest, i really enjoy the problem solving side of the job but I just hate the site work. There’s always so much nonsense that comes with the job and working on noisy industrial estates and stuck in traffic working long days. 

Does anybody have any ideas on how to turn something like this into something remote/ hybrid? I need to move somewhere quiet in the country and enjoy my life a bit more. Not spend all my days inside a dusty control cabinet that looks like a bowl of spaghetti.

I feel lost and am looking for advice for how to get back into the job market. Does anyone have any tips or has had a similar experience? 

After getting my BA in business (marketing/data/sales), I took what meant to be a gap year, but ended up being two to travel. It was one of the best decisions of my life to reset from school, working since an early age, and facing barriers with the relationship with myself, others, and bad habits I used to escape stress.I realized I wouldn't be able to put forth my best effort while living in a state of chaos and distraction.  

I made my way through 20 countries in Europe, Asia, and South America. I gained a confidence and sense of independence I never attained before and reconnected with my inner child. I learned about different cultures, languages, and how to navigate any challenge that came along -- whether trip planning, communication barriers, and even dangerous situations. I had nearly too much fun along the way, but I'd say my more applicable experiences include volunteering in a couple hostels, getting my yoga teacher certificate and briefly teaching, and trekking a pilgrimage for a month. 

Although these past years have been filled with what will become lifelong memories, I feel completely lost coming home-- as if I'm at square one after graduating. I would love to do work within natural health/ fitness, and something that genuinely helps people on a personal level, and it's my dream to have my own business in the future. At the moment, I am looking to apply to jobs within digital marketing, sales, communication, client relations.. pretty general business just to start somewhere. 

I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience finding their career after a long gap. What would be the most important things to highlight on my resume/ cover letters, and throughout the process?

1deend5,Should I Stay or Go,"I have two degrees and experience, but because of the economy, I took a job at a deli within a large store. There is a person there who has been there many years, and is a trainer/lead. I see her on most mornings, but not all day. Initially she really hated me, and I couldn't figure out why. I came to realize she felt threatened by me, for whatever reason. She has threatened to not train me because I asked a simple questions, made observations, asked for clarifications, etc., and seemed very territorial whenever I had a clever observation about something or offered to help.

A week ago, she yelled at me for telling her how we organized a space by alphabetical order and was just clarifying to her how it was done. I was shaken by this experience and was afraid of her, especially after she said she needed a witness when I asked to speak to her in private. When in private, I told her that I knew she didnt care for me, but I knew she had been there for quite some time, and that I wasn't there to cause her problems, in other words, I'm not there to steal her cheese or advancement opportunties which I was trying to convey indirectly.

She seemed shocked by this statement, by her facial expression. After that conversation, she totally changed how she is interacting with me for the better, but it's only been a week.

I have plans to interview with another place where I worked over the holidays, that had a positive work environment. Should I stay or go? Do you think my interpretation of the events is correct, that she is threatened, and I addressed this? Is she a narcissist, and should I not trust her to remain cordial/non-threatening?

Also, both places are big corporations, but there is a very remote chance of me working for the corporate office of either place if I stay a long time or move up. They have similar opportunities but the place with this women (the current one) has a corporate location with jobs in my area of study, and both of them have corporate opportunities in my secondary area of study, but I'm not sure of my chance of getting these jobs.

1dedpn3,"In Your Experience, When can You Ignore Minimum Years of Experience on a Job Application? (Recent Graduate)","Hello everyone,

I graduated a month ago in Engineering (MechE with a minor in AE, in case anyone in that field has personal experience with this). During my degree I completed 3 internships, 2 of which were in the aerospace industry, which is where I want to pursue a career in. In my final semester this past spring, I was given an absolute mess of a senior project thanks to my sponsor, which took up the majority of my time. This meant I was not able to apply to that many positions before graduating. 

I feel that most positions for recent graduates have been filled, leaving the majority of open positions being Mid and Senior level or higher. However, I still have managed to find some that require very little to no work experience (1 year or less). I have been really focusing on tailoring my cover letter and resume to better highlight my skills in relation to the job description. While I have applications out for companies of all sizes, I typically spend more time doing this for smaller companies. I feel like they do not use an automated rejection system as much as larger companies and there is a generally lower volume of applicants, so the recruiters are able to be more thorough when reading applications. 

(Side note, I could be completely wrong about that last sentence)

This leads me to my question in the title. At what point am I wasting my time and the recruiters' time by applying for a position where I don't meet the experience requirements? Since I'm spending a good amount of my day revising my application documents, I want to avoid applying to positions that I am without a doubt not qualified for.   

As I understand it, recruiters don't typically use the number of years for minimum qualifications as a hard requirement. Because of this, I have been applying for jobs that require anywhere from 0 to 5 years of experience while avoiding any position with a number higher than that. Obviously, every company is different, and even recruiters within the same company will differ on their opinion of any given applicant, but is there a general rule of thumb? Are there certain keywords in job titles that should be avoided in my case (i.e., ""Senior"" or ""Principal"")? Is it worth the time investment to apply anyways in case they have a better fit somewhere else? I've heard some recruiters will even send your application to other companies if they know you fit the description for one of their roles, but is the likelihood of that worth a revision to my cover letter and resume?



TL;DR - I am a recent college graduate with 3 completed internships, 2 of which are relevant to the industry I want to be in. I spend a lot of time revising my cover letter and resume to better highlight my skills based on job descriptions. At what point, if any, is the work experience requirement too high to the point that I am wasting my time as well as the recruiters'?

Thanks in advance!",CH1M1CH4N64,2,0.7599999904632568,3,1718216794,2024-06-12 18:26:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dedpn3/in_your_experience_when_can_you_ignore_minimum/,6,2024

1debmzv,How do I find jobs that align with my passions?,"I've felt stuck in jobs that I'm not passionate about but seem to do adequately well in (though my imposter syndrome says otherwise) and I'm struggling to find worthwhile jobs or career paths to potentially pivot towards that align with what I genuinely enjoy doing.

I'm currently managing IT Service Desk at an MSP where I've worked for the past 8 years. I started as a helpdesk agent, moved to lead, then supervisor, and have been managing various desks or working on different projects based on business needs. I accidentally fell into IT after working at Geek Squad for awhile, which was another position I accidentally fell into where I was an Operations Agent handling administrative duties before becoming a Supervisor (acting Manager for most of the time). 

I have a BA in Performing Arts, which isn't going to be particularly useful anywhere. I moved to Los Angeles after college to pursue acting, where I did some student films and a couple commercials but ended up getting stuck in the consistent paycheck/work grind and lost track of my passion. While I would love to be able to pursue a career in acting/voice work I have failed to hustle, am tired of the audition process, and would need to get back into classes to sharpen up my skillset. I'll admit a couple years ago I had a friend help me put together a VO reel and the few hours I spent in the booth recording did light a fire in my soul that I have missed for quite some time. I would love even just to get back on stage for a small production sometime in the near future...

I'm personable, well organized, and tend to always fall into leadership positions despite hating managing people. I love having the tasks I need to complete and being given space to go and do the work without need to babysit others. I enjoy organizing, I don't mind creating documentation (I create knowledge base articles for troubleshooting etc and very much enjoy proofreading and editing board game manuals when helping with playtesting), and it seems administrative work or providing guidance to others on how to handle the issues they're supporting is something I don't mind at all. I'm a very efficient typist (average 80-90 wpm with 100% accuracy) and have excellent communication skills. I'm also fairly good at multitasking (especially if it's managing multiple chats/teams and bouncing between different browsers for different client environments etc etc). 

I'm making \~75k at the moment, which is okay but not amazing (especially in LA) and would love to increase this. I understand I could hunker down and get certifications to further my IT knowledge and expertise and make my way to bigger and better positions...but I don't have a passion or drive for IT. I also have plenty of personal issues I'm dealing with in life which don't help me in giving the time and energy I need outside of work to bolster new skillsets or pursue the things I'm more interested in, which I understand is a massive issue that needs to be tackled and overcome for a myriad of improvements. 

I love acting, I love board games (playtesting, manual layout/proofreading), I love film and film analysis (have considered starting a podcast but everyone has a podcast), I love organizing, I enjoy creating documentation, I love video editing (which I haven't done in some time), I enjoy doing graphic design (I've messed around doing minor game layouts and such for personal projects), I would be interested in potentially learning coding (for video game design, application management, etc) and have a very experienced friend who has told me I'd likely excel at it if I gave it a chance. While I'm great at talking to people I don't want to do so for my job, and I absolutely disdain retail/sales. I don't want to have to travel either, and would love flexibility to work remote (obviously most folks do nowadays). 

In the end I understand I need to tackle the issues in my life stopping me from pursuing and prioritizing the things I'm passionate about or interested in learning. Outside of this I'm really curious if there are recommendations on positions I can search for or more-so well-paying career paths to jump into and focus on growing within that may align more with what I'm good at and what I care for.

","I (28F) work for a conglomerate with an investment company, bank and real estate. I have an undergraduate and postgraduate degree (for context of my education level). I currently work for the Group's strategic department and make 55,000 annually as a strategic analyst (8 YOE). I applied internally for an Investment Manager role within the investment company - so it would be a move from the group to one of the subsidiaries. I got an offer, but the job is offering me 2,000 more. The other benefits are pretty similar. A few things to note:

* When I negotiated my salary now, I came in at a good time when they desperately needed an analyst and ended up getting paid as a manger with an analytical title.
* My assumption is that the new job would put me on a trajectory to getting other managerial jobs and or promotions - which I would like.
* My current job has me working regular-ish hours whereas initially the other job would be more work now but I suspect more reward later.
* The new job would have me supervising one person whereas now I am working more as an IC.
* The group strategy department has stated that there will be no promotions or salary increases for another one - two years at least.
* The group is struggling with the investment company having to bail out many of the other companies, there is no talk of layoffs yet. But it has been suggested that if it happens, the investment company would be the main priority as it is the cash cow.
* I am in the UK.

I would like to climb the ladder and I have been struggling to get an interview for any management jobs. I would like to be on the management track and would like to know if staying as an analyst for any longer might make it harder to become a manager at the ten year mark.

1de98lt,Company Retreat,"Hi guys so a few months ago I accepted an invite to a two day (overnight) expenses paid company retreat (20 employees)  in rural Northrtn Ireland. (We are a NI based company).

The week of the event, I realised that I have no option at all for someone to mind my dog while I am away, between me not being able to drive and my partner working long hours, and the dog not being able to go to doggy daycare from a missed vaccination and no insurance, I'm just stuck. My family lives too far away to drop the dog off before and stay overnight.

Now, I did only give three days notice that I can't attend but I have seen a bit of pushback from the boss saying can I even go for a part of the day (still can't!) as we have people on the team travelling in from all over Europe.

The people who can't attend (a visa issue and declined first offer) have been told they don't have to work on the days of the retreat. I've offered to work the days as it's remote working so I don't really mind but I haven't heard back yet if it's ok to take the days off or not.

1de8zat,"How to tackle my boss whenever  he brings up ""this is the perfect time when you should learn as much as possible since you are in your early career"".","Hi all ! 
 From the above title anyone would be thinking it's such a good advice and I wholeheartedly agree with the statement too. Of course I should be learning to help in my career growth and to gain overall knowledge and experience. However, my boss seems to use the sentence as an excuse and not really mean it. He uses this statement in his/company 's favor and making me do things which any other employee would not usually do it. For example, if he needs me to stay extra hours for a project delivery and I would refuse for obvious reason then he will bring up that saying how I should just be more hardworking and stay late and I would be able to learn more and how in his days he used to do the same but now a days young people are not like that. Another example is once he had assigned me a task which  was actully his job to do ( preparing a PPT )  and he asked me to do it which I could not refuse but since I had project work in my hand I wasn't able to finish this ppt and was taking more than usual and when I actually explained my situation saying I won't be able to finish his PPT in time he just asked me to do it on the weekend with the same reason again that I should not refuse and how I should have a  learning attitude. 


In reality I am actually very studious person and always ready to learn new things of my interest. But at the same time I am not able to tolerate when company keep asking  me for extra free effort by bringing up that initial learning phase card. It makes me very annoyed. There are few seniors who have also adviced the same many times but their advice was genuine and I have learned many things from them while working together,  but on the other hand I feel my boss just uses it as an excuse for free labor and somehow succeeds in making me feel bad about myself and my abilities if I refuse him. 


Please help me...how can I handle this type of situation in workplace.",Lotus_buds,3,0.7099999785423279,9,1718204929,2024-06-12 15:08:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1de8zat/how_to_tackle_my_boss_whenever_he_brings_up_this/,6,2024
1de8qom,"Do I stay safe and prioritise my family, or go big but risk a horrible work-life balance?","Hopefully this sort of question is allowed. I appreciate it is perhaps more of a personal question rather than purely Career driven, but it is triggered by a potential change in career.

I have recently been offered a new job that could potentially see my earnings increase significantly, but would require some sacrifices and moving across the country.

To preface, my current job is not bad at all (in fact its very good). I earn well, enjoy it and have good career prospects. I also live in a cheaper part of the country, have a lovely house that we have spent the last 2 years renovating, and have overall a good quality of life.

The new offer is also extremely interesting to me. I would be able to advance my career along a similar path to my current role, but the compensation (inc. bonuses) would increase from \~£70kpa to \~250kpa - A serious jump.

The concern is whether the sacrifices I would have to make for the new job are too much? They include:

* Selling the house and moving towards London. We would probably have to rent for the first year or so, and even then the cost of houses may leave us worse off?
* A much increased commute time. My current commute is <30 mins door to door, but I doubt I would get away with less than 1 hr into London.
* Likely an increase in workload and unsociable hours. I currently work in consulting so the hours can be tough, but this would be a move to banking so I only expect it to get worse.
* These points are particularly important because my wife and I recently found out we are expecting our first child, and I don't want to miss the formative years because I am always at work.

The pro's include the obvious financial aspects, but are also:

* We would be moving closer to family so would have more support with children (where we are currently we have none)
* It would be enough money that my wife would not be required to return to work if she didn't want to.
* If she does wish to return to work, the cost of childcare would be more affordable making that process easier.

My biggest hang up is that I don't have a good understanding of the demands of the work, and whether that would result in me being home so little that I risked relationships. The logical part of me says it must be manageable otherwise every banker would be single or divorced, or their children would resent them. The emotional part of me is quite scared of this though. The extra money isn't worth losing it all.

Any advice or anyone who can share their experience of working in the investment banking world would be hugely appreciated.",sgtstock,1,1.0,3,1718204365,2024-06-12 14:59:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1de8qom/do_i_stay_safe_and_prioritise_my_family_or_go_big/,6,2024
1de8i1u,BSc chemistry-graduating end of year. Should I apply for graduate programmes from multinational companies?  ,"
I’m in New Zealand and  finishing up my BSc in chemistry at the end of the year. I potentially have a job offer afterwards at the company where I’m doing an internship. Their graduate roles as an analytical chemist is 57k which is quite low. I may get offered a bit more than though as I’m already technically working for them. 

All other chemistry or lab related jobs in my country pay even less for a grad job. Our crown research institutes have suffered massive cuts since the right wing political party came into power so jobs are scarce too. 

With all this I’ve thought about applying to a graduate job at huge multinational companies with branches in NZ such as rio Tinto, unilever, acciona, Suntory Oceania etc. In addition to some very well known nz companies such as fonterra and Douglas pharmaceuticals. My question is, since they’re quite decently paid grad jobs, how much competition is there? 

Student wise I’m a mature student with very average grades throughout my life. I’ve had two exceptional opportunities during study though. One being a summer research scholarship and another being an internship at a very well known government entity. I think I can get written recommendations from both parties. I have very regular voluntary experience in conservation as well as one uni award. 

No sports, extra talent or leadership experience. 

I’m okay writing elaborate cover letters and also semi decent at interviews. 

Do I have a chance at any of these graduate programmes? ",Ok-Good7637,1,1.0,0,1718203748,2024-06-12 14:49:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1de8i1u/bsc_chemistrygraduating_end_of_year_should_i/,6,2024
1de7zp7,"Where to go in my career from here? (Consulting, Supply Chain Management)","Hello folks! I‘ve unfortunately lost my last job due to the company going insolvent and I‘m pretty clueless on where to head career-wise from here on. 
I’m from Europe. My CV so far looks the following (chronological order):

Bachelor of Engineering in Textile Engineering
- Good grades, but not excellent

Product Development and supply chain expert (2 years)
- Started working at an influencer-backed fashion label whilst studying
- Helped them build up product development processes and a supply chain, enabling them to became independent from a production agency and bringing everything in-House
- Solely steered their production
- Was the first person in the team and helped to grow it to include a head designer and 2 interns
- Quit because of personal differences with the management

Operations Associate (1 year); Operations Manager (6 months)
- Started at a Tech Startup that was developing solutions for the fashion industry, working with both smaller and bigger fashion labels (f.E. H&M)
- Managed and grew the supplier network and manufacturers (Basically a sales function, visiting fairs, doing inbound and outbound outreach, cold calls etc.; Also had a sales trainer and a couple of sessions with them)
- Ensured customer success, working with brands to achieve successful production runs, learning about their problems and finding solutions for them
- Helping to translate industry problems and learnings into product feedback for our tech team, closely working with the product manager
- Tracking business KPIs, working on customer cohort analyses

So now to my problem, for the majority of my life I didn‘t really care too much about achieving a good salary or having an amazing career, I‘ve just wanted to work in a creative field like the fashion industry, doing something with passion. Now in my last job, I‘ve had way more operational tasks and worked closely with the CEO, who has formerly been at McKinsey and taught me quite a lot about Consulting work and Data Analysis, which was so much more fun to me than everything I‘ve did in the fashion industry before.

I am now thinking about moving out of the fashion industry, but don’t really know what to do and how. I don‘t really mind traveling for the job and don‘t mind working long hours, so I thought doing a couple years of consulting would be a super interesting position, but since I don‘t have an economics degree, I‘m having a hard time seeing how I could get into that field of work.

Any recommendations or personal experiences that could help me out? Or any further questions?

1de68wn,Job Insecurity,"Hello! 

I am currently 7 months in at my job, and I really do enjoy what I do. My boss began as a little disheveled and unorganized, but that’s my strong suit and we work very well together. My company is pretty small, and it is only the two of us in our department.

I’ve noticed lately that my boss has been under a lot of pressure and has started to become somewhat abrasive towards me. Which is a complete 180 in their character than what I’m used to. I made a few mistakes, 3 in fact, but two of them were not my fault - but I was blamed due to a VP not wanting to take accountability and the other was due to unclear direction from my boss - still I took accountability . The third was my fault and I took full accountability because I was overwhelmed due to my boss’ disorganization and the sheer amount of tasks that needed to be completed, I genuinely forgot if I submitted the task into our portal (it wasn’t submitted, and I apologized). 

The problem is, my boss told me that they don’t know if they can trust me due to my mistakes. Which completely threw me for a loop because I didn’t and don’t believe that it was a matter of broken trust. I’m human, and I make mistakes sometimes. 

Since then, the stress has only gone up and my boss has been short with me, or not even speaking to me much to give direction. My job is dependent on the tasks I’m given, because I can’t really do anything without approval due to company structure. I don’t know if I should just ignore it and do my best when the stress is high, or if I should take to my boss (though I’m not sure how to without sounding accusatory). 

I haven’t ever felt this unstable in my job, there are processes in place to ensure that employees would know if they’re on the chopping block. But I’m having a tough time not worrying about it - because I never make the same mistake twice and I feel like I haven’t been given the opportunity to fully make it right without over apologizing.

1de62is,Not sure if I should take the jump into a new job,"I’ve been at my current company for 2 years and my current role for 1. I work as a “project manager” but in reality I just work as a liaison between our company and the actual project management company handling the remodeling of a new facility for us. I haven’t really felt like I’ve gained any PM skills in this job since like I said, I’m more of a liaison and I primarily just host weekly meetings, keep track of progress, and answer any questions the actual PM from the third party company has on behalf of our company. I don’t feel fulfilled in this job as I feel like I’m not being utilized to my full potential and just doing secretarial work. I also don’t feel like staying here would help me gain any experience for my future careers as I’m still in my mid 20s. The only positions I can grow into are Facilities Manager for our own facilities which honestly does not interest me, or upper management which I would not feel ready for/qualify for for yeeeeaaars to come. My boss is controlling and doesn’t give me autonomy; I can’t do a lot of things without verifying with him first. I work from home twice a week and my commute is about 35 min in the morning and 50min-1hr in the afternoon (21 miles) I just got my pay up to 78k recently. I have a good amount of paid holidays and free health insurance. 

So because I’ve been feeling so meh about my job, I applied to an outside position. I got an interview and I humbly killed it and consequently got an offer. Here’s where I need help!!

The new position is at a big company in a very cool industry (cruise line). From a friend that works there, I’ve heard great things about the environment and that the work is fun. It would be a new thing for me as it’s not project management, but data analytics (I do have experience with SQL, which is why I was able to get the interview/job). Im honestly really interested in it and the woman who would be my boss seems awesome and really liked me. The issue is the benefits. Wfh is only once a week. The commute is about 45-50 min in the morning and 50 min-1 hr 15 min in the afternoon (25 miles, but near downtown hence the worse traffic). Health insurance is $60 a month. I do get a free cruise vacation once a year. The biggest con I’d have to take a pay cut down to 70k (which I’m going to try and negotiate to 72-73k). There are lots of growth opportunities from the position i’d be taking (data analyst -> senior analyst -> lead -> manager, etc). There is a high possibility if you do well then after the first year you get promoted to senior which is a 15% salary increase and comes with 5% bonuses around Christmas time. Same amount of paid holidays.  

Idk if it’s worth to try out something new in a refreshing environment bc I truly feel stuck/stagnant, or if I should just stay put. Idk if the pros outway the cons. Although I feel like the new job is an investment in my future.

I'll get straight to the point.

Anyways, I'm currently working at a startup as a Financial Analyst earning 1000 USD per month (not from the US). I'm not in love with the job (not really my strong suit) and I have two offers, wondering which you would take:

Offer 1: Working as Chief of Staff for a reallly early stage startup focused on the medical device sector (Huge potential, but a lot of roadblocks ahead). Salary would be significantly lower (780 USD per month), but I have been told in 3-6 months my salary could be improved to 1200 USD per month, assuming the company meets certain goals. I would also get equity in the company further down the line, but this is also contingent upon company goals being met. (Obtaining a patent, getting a medical license for the product etc) I feel slightly underqualified for this role, as I only have two years of work experience (In startups though), but the opportunity is huge, albeit VERY risky. I also don't like the amount of roadblocks that are ahead in order to launch the product, as many of them are things out of our control. (Approval times for FDA (or equivalent government organization in my country) approval etc.

Offer 2: Working as a Marketing Analyst for a multinational company. Salary is SIGNIFICANTLY better (1400 USD with all benefits) and I get private healthcare insurance and other benefits. However, I have NEVER worked in Marketing in my life. I have worked in strategy (part of the reason I got the offer, as the job includes many strategy related components)  but I am worried about making a jump to such a different career path without any previous knowledge or experience about Marketing. I'm also a recent graduate, so I know the first job experiences really set up the future of how your CV looks, and I'm scared of entering Marketing and not liking it further down the line. The company is also known for being extremely competitive with VERY long hours. (But I'm used to this working for startups, so it's not a HUGE disadvantage).

In 2021 i left my job as a technician / fitter (not qualified sorry if that offends people) - a role i really shouldn’t of ever had, through nepotism. With that came a lot of imposter syndrome. Even though i was good at the job and when i left they asked me to come back twice. In 2021  at the age of 29, i decided it was finally time to go get qualified in something. 

Well when you’re looking at the world in 2021, lockdown is going on, AI hasnt come out in the mainstream yet. IT seems reasonable, i went down the software development route. 

Now in 2024 i have finished the degree, nobody is hiring graduates, or they are but in Australia alone from 2022-2023 there was a shed load of tech layoffs. So graduate roles are being filled with people with 2/3 years of real time experience. During my studies my study schedule was so intense and changed every 4 weeks (days and hours). So to compensate for this i got casual engineering TA roles. Which used me and binned me apart from one which was full time and just didn’t work well with my study schedule, so i had to leave as my grades dropped massively. 

Anyway my point is or the advice im seeking is, has anyone else been in this position?. When i left to do this degree it felt invigorating and inspiring. Finally i was going to be something that i was qualified in and in my own working dominion. To be at the bottom of a new eligible career path. Now im 33 soon, cant find a job. And i feel my resume now just looks like a fucking mess and screams ‘this person is all over the shop’

If it matters i want to get into database admin and feel like im at a good level to get an entry level position. Although they do not fucking exist anymore. I also achieved a HD average throughout my degree.

Im not someone who feels sorry for themselves, i just go to apply for jobs and don’t even know who i am anymore. Im not a fitter, i cant get a IT job. Any inspiring stories or advice will be appreciated. I cherish life and don’t take my life for granted, any harsh criticism wont make me cry either. 

If you read this, thanks! Hope you have a good day.  ",AspWebDev,5,1.0,1,1718187244,2024-06-12 10:14:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1de351g/career_advice_for_someone_who_feels_like_they/,6,2024

1de2tbf,My company gives special wfh privileges to certain people (regardless of rank or years of service) and this bothers me - mostly because I am not one of the chosen ones even after asking for more flexibility. Is this enough to leave a job or am I being spoiled?,"I recently moved and my commute is longer than it was. Before moving I asked my boss to go remote and he denied it because he needs at least one attorney in office. This is understandable - I was hired for in the office I should do the job I was hired for. 

Then he asked me during our one on one if I thought we should hire the intern next year when she graduates- I said she was very capable and if we had the capacity we should. He said “I will need to come up with a cheap remote position for her”.  This felt like a slap in the face.

We hired a paralegal last June- she was in office and supposed to be supporting the mail room as well. Her husband moved to Texas and she followed him and they let her go fully remote.  She told me they pay for her to meet with the partner once a month (rental car,flights, hotel etc) 

I feel like I’m being given the run around. Why is it ok to be flexible with them and not me? Feels like first world problems but it irks me.

1de2f5z,30yo tired of scraping by,"Hello everyone.

I graduated from college with a BA in Psychology. My intent was to get my Masters and become a LPC or LMHC.
Unfortunately, I didn't have the finances or support for a graduate program; so I turned to work full-time. 

I've spent the last 10+ years working in non profit work helping others with mental health issues. 

I currently make ~30/hr and make about 55-60k a year. It's OK for living in CA. But I'm getting exhausted. We don't get holidays, or much time off in general. Management demands more and more from us every year.

Lately the stress of work with a combination of medical issues it's become apparent that this is not sustainable and I need something flexible enough to allow me to focus on my well being. 

After dedicating my life to public service, I now want to shift focus on financial stability and hopefully, financial freedom. 

Are there any highpaying low entry jobs out there? Should I get a MLO lincense or Realtor's License? Should I suck it up and get a govt. job? 

Ideally, I want to work remote and a job that allows me to travel 1-2 times a year. ",Calm-Chemist-6982,1,1.0,4,1718184257,2024-06-12 09:24:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1de2f5z/30yo_tired_of_scraping_by/,6,2024
1de26po,Job Options? Which should I take?,"I just want advice really. I've asked family and friends and I know it's my decision and I need to do what makes me happy, but I don't know what that is.

 I have a job (non-managerial) that I enjoy some things with, but struggle with others. 3 days a week, but a mixture of 9-5 working from home and travelling 2-3 hours away/early mornings and late evenings.

I have accepted a job with better progression (managerial) and more money, but would mean full-time 9-5 with some days in the office an hour away.

My 4 yr old daughter starts school in September, so would be roughly 9-3. She currently goes to nursery 8-6 the days that I work and my partner drops her off/picks her up when I'm working different hours, as the nursery is over the road and he can walk (he cannot drive).

I am worried about taking the new job, as it would mean my daughter would have to go to after-school club everyday until 5:30pm, which I feel would be a lot for her, especially when she first starts. When I'm in the office, I would need to send her to breakfast club and after-school, but these are only 8-5:30pm, so would actually have to find a child minder/external provider to allow me time to travel back by 6/6:30pm. The additional cost of this would also take any increase in wages. My partner would be unable to help with the school runs even when he's working from home (2 days a week), as it is too far to walk and like I said, he cannot drive.

My current job don't want to lose me and have been offering me a lot more money to keep my role, which would be more than the new job and more flexible over only 4 days a week. This would be perfect if I enjoyed the job, but I am not happy with certain aspects and the travelling is driving me mad (e.g. 1 travelled for 2.5 hours each way for a half hour meeting) - I also lease a car, so it affects my mileage each month and I have to pay if 1 go over it. I also have no progression here, so wouldn't have the chance to manage people and increase my skills in this area for future opportunities.

So I keep changing my mind which job is best and feel like it comes down to my future career or my daughter's happiness and wellbeing. Maybe neither job is right?

So, I applied for another role (and have an interview) which is 18.5 hours a week, Mon/Tues (8:30-4:30) and Wed (8:30-12) and the office is local -literally in the same town as home and school. It would mean that I can do breakfast club 3 days a week, afterschool 2 days and be around a lot more for my daughter, especially in the school holidays! This would also mean saving a lot of money on childcare.

However, the role is admin, which would be going backwards career wise and a lot less money. Financially, we could do with higher earnings (e.g. we are behind with some priority bills and don't go on holiday, etc.), but at the same time, my children's happiness is priority for me.

Does anyone have any views on if I should:
1.) Keep the current job more money, flexibility, BUT additional child care/driving costs difficulty in finding late night child care when my partner can no longer help with school runs due to not driving, and 1 am not happy there.

2.) Take the new job - mostly set hours, career progression BUT lots of childcare needed (especially in the holidays) as it's fulltime and new child care needed for days in the office. 

3.) Interview and potentially take the 18.5 hours job, meaning a lot less child care needed, BUT a setback in career progression (I am already 32) and a lot lot less money

I also enjoy going into the office as much as possible and get lonely working from home (the reason left my previous role). Option 1 is a mixture of both. 2 would be working from home the majority of the time (whilst trying to manage 8 people remotely) and 3 would be always in the office.",Sad-Fondant7820,1,1.0,2,1718183208,2024-06-12 09:06:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1de26po/job_options_which_should_i_take/,6,2024

1de02es,Should I join TCS or continue in my current small fintech company? ,"
Hi guys.
As the title says, I have an offer from TCS for the ninja profile. Currently I am working as an intern in a small-mid product based fintech company as a java backend developer intern. TCS offers 3.5LPA and my current company has given me a PPO of 4LPA. 

My tech stack is java+springboot. I feel the work is good and the technology I am working on is also in demand.

1) Should I continue in my current company, keep learning and get experienced in my current stack and then switch for a better package or should I join TCS, stay for 2 years and use the tag name for a better offer.

2) My main concern is about the type of work would I get in TCS. Should I risk getting a support project or old technology for the brand name and leave my current stack.

1ddyy47,How do I know I made the right career move?,"I had a stable career path going at a solid company. Worked there a year and won an award even. However, I literally couldn't keep up with the hours. If I was sick I couldn't always call out. It was a highly coveted position and i felt that I just couldn't physically keep up. I ended up getting really sick right after quitting because I worked up to the very last day that i could give them because i felt bad for leaving so soon after being hired. They tried offering me a 20k pay raise, more pto and more 401k match but I was honest with them that money wasn't why I left. I tried negotiating my hours but they couldn't budge (it's a 24/7 shift job, not their fault) but under staffed so I had to leave. It hurt a lot. I loved working there. I was damn good at the work too. Trained everyone. I was slated to be in charge and get that huge pay raise... I miss the people. And tbh it sucked walking away from such a huge counter offer. But I'm trying to prioritize my health for the first time in my life so I made that difficult decision...


 Luckily I had some network who hooked me up at another place, a smaller company but much higher pay. 10k less than that bonus salary at the old job, but my hours are so much better. Benefits are about on par so no change there. The downside is... the people kind of suck. They're all pretty sexist and borderline racist at times. At work events they drink heavily. I don't always have to interact with them but I want to make a good impression. They just make me feel uncomfortable. I honestly wish I could go back to my old job, but the damn hours... it nearly killed me. I miss it so much. They said they'd take me back any time but I can't do that same job.


I'm not sure what to do. I've only been at this new company like 6 months and it's not leaving a great taste in my mouth with how unprofessional everyone is. I feel like i should stick it out for a couple of years for my resumes sake (I don't want to look like a job hopper) and then maybe contact my old company to see if the schedules had any changes? Or should I just forget them...

1ddy2zl,How do I properly negotiate a starting wage when they are offering less than the wage range in the job description?,"For context I applied for a job title for the city I live in. I went through multiple rounds of interviews with different departments who pulled my name from a list of applicants in the city. Meaning I was getting offered interviews for different departments under the same job title that I was classified under once I got my foot in the door. 

From there I did not end up getting the initial job with the department I initially wanted, but was offered a new position with the same department that would better suit my skills and experience. 

At first I was not interested because they offered it to me starting as a part time position which was a red flag to me because I was applying for full time positions only. However they assured me I would be able to get full time and move up fairly fast within the department. To add, because I applied for this job title for the city, the job title would still be the same, just a different branch in the department would differ, meaning the salary range would be the same. Or so I thought. 

Fast forward past months of a background check process and waiting, I finally received an offer letter. The offer letter offered me almost $2 less hourly than the initial hourly wage range offered in the job title description and this change also wasn’t mentioned when I was offered the position. 

Also, the range listed could go up to $37 an hour. The minimum was $31. And they offered me less than the minimum. It’s still a lot of money nonetheless, but I did feel sort of confused about it and asked if it might’ve been an error to which they responded my rate was different because I was starting part time. 

This doesn’t make sense to me because they are already saving money by giving me less hours to start with. Now on top of it they are shaving off a couple dollars from the minimum hourly range which just doesn’t sit right with me. Would accepting this make it harder for me to essentially “move up” like they said I could once I got my foot in the door? Or is this just a tactic to have me start a little bit more behind than I would have starting full time? 

This is my first job in my career path since graduating so I’m fairly new to negotiating and the process. I really don’t want to lose the opportunity but I’d also love insight on what to do better next time.

well I've been working as a software Qa engineer for 3 years now and gained some nice automation skills at the first year but the company I've been with for the last 2 years is kinda all manual and we use tools for automation.

Now I'm looking for a new job and automation won't be a big issue for me as I can work my way into it but the problem is with new company requirements they're all asking in depth knowledge of AI algorithms !!!!!! Like for what ? 

And I looked up a few things online looks like there's nothing out there on how to test AI modules??? Its all related to the performance and accuracy based on equations so idk why they need us to have that knowledge in the algorithms themselves!!!


Well that's the first thing and the other thing is now at 29 I feel like tech is overwhelming you gain skills and try to land a better job but 2 or 3 years later all what you've learned have changed and each company uses a different set of technologies so I'm kinda thinking about switching into a more stable career with growth with the goal of opening my own company or my own thing even if its small but honestly I don't want to stay an employee for the rest of my life.

1ddxy72,Musician PhD seeks non music career for a better life but has had little success in job search and isn’t sure where to look.,I need to change careers in order to provide better for my family. I have training in music and work as a professional performer and teacher. I have a PhD in music but felt I was less inclined to academia because of the poor ratio of work to money in that field. I’m good at music and school but not top shelf. I could be top shelf if I practiced but can’t find time to practice between the stress of work and family. We can live on what I make but not save or live in a safe neighborhood. I am looking for a career which would allow good earning potential and allow me free time to play music I enjoy and spend time with my family. I am not opposed to retraining and learning new skills but I would prefer not to go get another college degree or take out a loan for a bootcamp (so many seem to be a scam and not reflective of an actual job market anyways). I am pretty good at self teaching and independently learning things from books and videos. Reading posts on job searching advice seem particularly discouraging right now with people applying to tons of postings and having no success so I see networking is encouraged over cold applying to jobs online. The common advice I see people giving involve asking “what kind of work are you interested in?” or “is there anyone in your network that could give you an in?” My answers are that i don’t know what I like besides music (though I’m willing to give anything a shot if it will help my family be more secure). I would prefer to avoid physical jobs like the trades or military/police because of the potential for injury. Getting a hand injury or getting shot are job hazards I would like to avoid. I’ve applied to government jobs and not had a lot of success/response. I started learning programming but was inundated with messages that programming will soon be obsolete from ai. It also seems that there is massive job layoffs in tech since the pandemic and job competition is extremely high. Cybersecurity seems to have a lot of job growth potential but a lot to learn and high competition to get an entry level help desk job. It seems discouraging hearing that college grads who majored in computer science are having trouble getting a job so why would someone want to hire me with less tech experience?I’ve considered trying sales but haven’t gotten much response after applying for a while. One sales job I found through a friend. It almost went through but the pay/hours weren’t going to work so I backed out. I often see people suggesting that academic researchers often can transfer their skillset to data analysis type positions. I guess I could go try to learn excel or look at one of these data scientist bootcamp curriculums and try learning those skills to see if that’s a fit? Anybody have any suggestions here?

1ddxt0i,Wondering About Internships.,"Every YouTube video I hear about how to create a plan for your career or just for college, says that it’s super important to either shadow a professional in the field you are interested in or be able to get an internship in that field. 

I’m interested in a STEM field and leaning more towards aerospace engineering, and I want to be able to see what that career is actually like or be able to get some experience and insight. But, I have no idea how anyone gets internships in high school. I’ve been able to get summer jobs and join clubs in school but all of that is so straight forward. 

How could I actually get an internship or be able to shadow someone? Do I just need really good connections or do I go through my school? Can somebody help me with this?

1ddvp92,Being assigned extra work compensation?,"Hello! 
I am an admin assistant and have been with my company for 1year and 3 months. I have a coworker, we'll call them Taylor, who is also an admin assistant and has been with the company for 1 year and 2 months. We have separate supervisors and teams we work with.

Taylor and their supervisor started their positions relatively at the same time, which was about six months before their biggest responsibility of the year came around. It was even asked about and tasked about in the interview- it's literally half this person's job. I have no idea why they are still employed. Well, long story short, they messed this responsibility up so poorly that our boss gave this responsibility to my supervisor.

Which means that I /also/ get this responsibility. On top of my other responsibilities. I made a calendar for the upcoming year of things to sort of expect and I'm dreading most of it because I will be (imo) overly busy and pulled in many directions working with my different teams at the same time. I basically don't know if I'll be able to ever go on vacation because it will never be a good time for me/the calendar. 

Now it might be too late because raises are already locked in and I haven't seen what mine will be, but I feel like I should have talked to my supervisor about how I will take on this extra responsibility with extra compensation of a certain amount. Or at least ask them if that was being considered at all. HOWEVER even in my job description, it does say that the job description doesn't describe all duties but I really feel like this is something different. Is it? I don't think I was given this task because my boss trusts me and I do a good job- it's really because this person and their supervisor messed up so much and it's too late to hire/train. 

Is this something even worth bringing up to my supervisor? I showed my supervisor my calendar and they know how huge and time consuming this new task will be, but perhaps I should've been explicitly clear that I want to be compensated appropriately instead of /just/ receiving the annual cost of living ""raise"". Looking between 2-5% and I just do not think that's fair.

1ddvkbi,First world problems?,"Currently in house and am the only counsel in the office out of 5 attorneys +gc. I love my job and I’m good at it. But a year ago it became insanely easy. Also I knew I wanted to move further away from the city eventually. 

They hired a paralegal who went remote because her husband moved to Georgia.   My gc said she “needs someone in the office and unfortunately that’s you bc paralegal moved”.  Im annoyed because this means I’m taking on paralegals in office admin jobs. I am also frustrated by this because I asked for more challenging work and they give it to the intern or give me more work of less challenging things and say it’s challenging. 

As I said I wanted  - I moved 40 minutes further away from the office and they said I could come in once per week. However they “really need” me in the office. I talked to the paralegal today and they told her that they want her in the office once per month but will pay for her travel, rental car, etc. 

Today was my first day back at work after moving. Several people including my boss asked how the commute was and I said it was ok. And he  said well we need someone in the office so you’ll live. Also it was your decision to move. I said he was right- it was my decision and I wasn’t complaining. He’s not wrong but I have this chip on my shoulder since it seems like they give others special privileges and not me (for example one of the attorneys worked from Florida the entire winter and he has only one more year experience than me)

1ddvh3n,Career path for 23yo looking to get back into tech,"In 2023, I graduated from a top university with my bachelor's in data science and a few internships under my belt in software engineering and technical consulting. In November of 2023, I got my full-time offer for my prior technical consulting role rescinded when it was supposed to start in early 2024. I got very lucky and started a data analyst role (w/ security clearance) at a government contractor this week so I can gain some experience in tech-adjacent roles.

I'm thinking that since most of my experience has been in software and that I had been getting a decent amount of interviews while I was applying, that may be my best bet, just not with this current job market. I was also leaning into data science in the future as a lot of the roles and experiences I have can be very beneficial for a technical business-focused role like data science (although a lot of data scientists typically get Master's degrees).

My question is, I have a lot of breadth in experiences but not as much depth as I would like, so how should I market myself in interviews going forward when I look for roles? Is it nice to be seen as a jack-of-all-trades type of employee in my early career? What type of companies (start-ups, F500, mid-sized, etc.) would you target with my experience? Cheers!

I've been working as a data analyst for a higher education institution's central communications and marketing office for about 1.5 years now.

Our office has annual performance evaluations every year in March, which determine raises and promotions for the next year. Although our office does not have a formal career ladder for employees.

Should I bring up my interest in a promotion during my next performance evaluation discussion in March with my manager? Or should this discussion happen even earlier, perhaps around January of next year, when my manager can find out if there is enough funding in our office for my promotion?

I'm confident I could eventually secure an entry-level position in tech sales or as a consultancy analyst (estimated comp $70k + commission).

Here's some additional context: I'm not passionate about sales; I prefer building things. Ultimately, I aspire to own my work in a startup or as a Product Manager. If I pursue the master's program, I intend to network with industry professionals, I will most likely also apply for a PhD afterward.

1ddqb62,Dilemma with job offer ,"Hi I just got a job at a decent very small law firm as a admin/legal assistant. The pay is great for my experience level as I am graduating college early and do not have any work experience. I accepted their offer very quickly as they offered me the job an hour after I interviewed. They seemed like nice people and  its a good opportunity  but  I am kinda second guessing my decision because they want me to start right away and I was looking to take a couple of weeks to job hunt  to  see my family and celebrate a milestone bday. I been living far from home for school  as well and  r an hour out from SF.  I feel like I prob sound  stupid as hell  but other jobs reached out to me and I got invited to tour an office  the financial district in SF, which has kinda always been my dream to work there (although its not in my desired  industry). I also am going to move very close to financial district. 

With this firm I said yes to, I would not be able to get any time off and I am not used to working in such a small team, so I am nervous about it. I asked if I can start a little bit later and they just extended it one more day, so I don't imagine I will get that day off for my bday which is July 2nd. Maybe because July 4th but we'll see. I know that I am lucky to be given a job  but I am having doubts,  plus I would need to commute for this firm. I know I am def not guaranteed another job, but I do kinda hate not looking at other options before I said yes. They also have not sent me any paper work yet, which I am assuming because they are very busy and only have  one admin worker there. 

I do want to go to graduate school or law school in the future for context.  I am very grateful to be given this job, but I really do not want to start working just a couple of days after moving and graduating college to start working. I also already cancelled a trip to Europe to start working, but I did not think I get a job so soon.

1ddp8jx,Career choice advice,"Hello there!

I am having a bit of an internal conflict surrounding my career choice. For context, I am a 27 year old man with a masters degree in social work. I have worked in the field for over 3.5 years and very much enjoy the work. I received a job offer for law enforcement, this is a field that I have always thought about pursuing. 

There are various pros and cons. I would be taking on a significant pay cut to start ($30,000) for two years but would eventually far surpass the income in my current role (by about $30,000 p/year). That said, my current role is 9-4:30 Monday to Friday with every holiday off. Law enforcement, as you’d probably guess, does not afford this perk. Law enforcement does provide the “30 and out” pension which is a very big draw as well as the post-retirement benefits.

I know you can’t make the decision for me, but any advice is welcomed. Even if this includes your personal experiences in the field of law enforcement.

1ddp704,What are non strategic roles that don’t limit career growth?,"

I [30F] am a product manager for a finance company. I would not consider myself a true product manager as my role is a lot more on the go to market and marketing side. 

I will be in my role for about two years soon and I recently received feedback that my strengths are: execution and results driven, very detail oriented and I am very good at PMO (program management). However I could improve a lot more on the strategy side. 

I have been struggling on this weakness for awhile and my manager gave advice that I either could find roles internally on other teams ,with her support, or continue to stay in my role and work on this weakness while passively looking for a new internal role. For context my company encourages internal movement A LOT. That’s how they retain their work force. I am also new to this industry and role as I previously got my masters in public health. My previously job experience was implementation based at a health tech company.

I asked my manager if I was limiting myself professionally if I wasn’t pursuing strategic roles and she said no not necessarily. Sometimes success is more about excelling at what you’re good at.

I also don’t necessarily love strategy. I prefer more execution and like the gratification of short term results. I’m also figuring out if it’s because my role is in an industry that I don’t particularly love? 


I wanted to see if anyone has any personal experiences with this or are in non strategic roles and what those roles are. Feeling a little discouraged and lost. 


Also please be nice I’m sensitive

I work in a rural area where job opportunities are few and far between. I didn’t go into teaching because I had a particular passion for it. I just picked it because nothing else came to mind when choosing a major. I question if I made the right decision almost daily. Now, I want to pursue something in higher education or academia, but I don’t know what exactly, or how realistic these hopes are.

1ddonng,I made an awful decision and I need some help.,"Dear lurkers of r/careeradvice,



I'm 38 in the US, have been unemployed for a year (by choice). Previous job was at a call center that did sales/customer service (WFH, base + commission). I was the model employee, dependable, professional, exceeded sales goals, problem solver, quick to learn, was always given special projects, supervisors would ask for my help etc.. Bottomline, I kicked ass for 6 years but it drained me when they restructured to the point I got burnt out and I quit because there was no growth. Me quitting was encouraged by my partner because it was taking a toll on me and it was very visible. I was encouraged to take a break for 3 months, but we travelled a lot so it turned into 6 months and then here we are a year later.. Fortunately, I have savings and my partner does well enough for us to be comfortable in a single income household but I think it's time to get back to work again and be a functioning member of society.

However, I have a few problems:

1. I hold a bachelor's degree in marketing (which is funny how Reddit randomly assigned me this username) but I think since it's been so long, and so many new advances to this industry which I'm not updated on makes my degree useless. 

2. I wish to work from home since I am unable to drive. I never learned to (I'm terrified of driving). During my break, I did try to learn on the road but encountered situations which traumatized me some more. I will revisit one day. 

3. I'm old. Do companies even hire older people nowadays?

  
But now I'm back to square one. I feel like it was a bad decision quitting and I should've just stuck with it despite being mentally/soul draining. All WFH jobs I'm seeing that I think I'm capable of are all call centers and I don't want to do that anymore. I'm stuck between just getting a random job just to have one no matter how draining it can be and wanting to actually have a career with growth opportunities. I want a career but how do I get there? This may seem like a silly post but I've just hit that wall today. 

I've seen WFH sales positions but with no base salary. I'm not sure if I even have that sales drive anymore or how to get it back. 

  
I've looked into studying again, maybe something with IT but starting over in a field I have 0 knowledge of is terrifying especially for this age. When I look at the free courses and posts about free courses vs. actually studying for it I just feel discouraged and overwhelmed with everything that needs to be learned, money to be spent, where to start, and instant regret that I quit and if it's even worth it studying again. 

  
I do want to work though. Something with training, and a lot of room to move up but I don't know which industry would be best. 

I'm just looking for individuals with similar circumstances and what they did. What got you back in your groove? 

Any advice you'd want to give this lost rotting soul?

1ddofso,Contractor looking to apply at client company,"Hello everyone, I work as a contractor at a major tech company (think largest jungle river) in a non-technical position. I have 5 months left on my contract but I found a great position in a different organization within the company that likes me as a candidate and invited me to some interviews. 

As a contractor, my official employer is a staffing agency. My contract with the agency has a Restrictive Covenant. This basically says that I cannot ""directly or indirectly, solicit Client or engage in a like or similar profession or occupation at Client’s facility or at any other facility at which you are directed to or actually perform services under this Agreement"". The contract mentions paying damages should you break this agreement. 

I'd like to know if anyone has similar experience with breaking this type of clause? How strictly should I be looking to adhere to the ""similar profession...\[or\]...client facility"" parts of this if I am looking at another job in a different internal org?

I don't feel great about asking the hiring team as I think it would make me a less desirable client and I obviously don't want to ask my agency.

1ddnp1j,Has anyone else had a potential employer change the role you're interviewing for without your knowledge? How should I navigate this situation?,"Has this kind of thing has happened to anyone else before, looking for any advice or how to navigate this situation.

**Context**  
I applied for a job at a large, well-known company, and my first interview with in-person with the Senior Recruiter. Upon following up with a phone call, she told me the department heads didn't think I was a good fit the role (Sr. Graphics Web Designer) and asked if I'd be open to a different role that they didn't actually currently have a listing for (Senior Print Designer), to which I said yes. I'm eventually told to come in for an in-person interview with the department heads for the new role.

The interview is a week away, and I ask the HR Coordinator for the job description of the new role since there's no listing for it. I receive the description along with a job description for a Graphic Designer role, and she says that the Senior Recruiter ""also indicated that the team was most likely considering you for a Graphic Designer role"".

This is the first time I'm being made aware of this Graphic Designer role, and the Recruiter had never communicated this change to me at any time prior. Based on what I could find, the pay difference seems significant. I'd say around a $15k/year difference.

What should I do? Should I bring it up with the recruiter? should I go into the interview prepared for the Senior Print Designer role and bring it up then? Is this a big deal?",rvyas619,1,1.0,0,1718136354,2024-06-11 20:05:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ddnp1j/has_anyone_else_had_a_potential_employer_change/,6,2024
1ddn27t,Am I ready to make the jump?,"Howdy. I'm in my mid-30s and was a bartender for a decade. About a year ago, I started a CS degree program with a focus on Data Science. Around the same time, I transitioned to an entry-level Tech Support role. I quickly moved up and was promoted to Tier 2 with an SME title in Security and Data after leveraging my SQL skills to track down some fraudsters on our platform.

Since then, I've built several New Relic dashboards and alerts, created automated reporting exports using SQL, Python, and Google Sheets, and generally leveled up my skills significantly. I'm grateful for the opportunity to showcase my capabilities.

However, there have been some concerning changes in the company over the last two months, making me wonder if it might be time to move on. Several cuts to our already small teams have made it clear that my presumed path to the Dev Team is no longer viable. The work assigned to me lately has been menial, such as writing tedious KB articles and working on projects that have been made redundant by more senior teams. Additionally, there's been a noticeable amount of disorganization, along with sudden changes to pay packages, leaving me questioning the company's longevity.

All this to ask: Is my \~8 months of experience using New Relic, SQL, and Python in the real world, without a degree, enough to land me a role elsewhere?

1ddmvg7,Take a job in a different career field?,"The basics of the situation are as follows:

Have 5 years of experience in sales, 1 year of experience in product management with my most recent employment being in product management.

I was laid off in February and been applying to PM jobs with little success. Found a great job posting for a sales position, applied and after many rounds received a great offer. 

At the time of my transition to PM, I thought that was the career path most aligned with my work style and interests. It was a difficult year with lots of internal issues at the company which I don't think gave me the best representation of what the role could be in other situations. 

With that being said, I was successful in sales and there were certainly aspects of it I enjoyed, just didn't seem like the career path I wanted to pursue for my long term.

What I'm looking for advice in is if this pivot back into sales could be a negative move for my career (if I decide to try to move back into PM), if I don't see myself wanting to stay in sales long-term? My thought is that getting a job is better than staying unemployed and it is with a great company, with an new rising product and a strong pay package.

1ddlxgy,Redundancy and other career setbacks left me in mid 20s career crisis. What can I do other than a corporate job to build a meaningful life? ,"**Background:**   
I'm 27M, an Engineer turned UX Designer (if anybody cares). A lot of things (art/music/science/sports/travel/physical skills etc) interest me upto an intermediate-advanced intermediate level, jack of all trades master of none kinda thing.   
  
I'm quite happy with my current profession given that it has the capacity for meaningful impact for people.    

**Current Situation:**   
I've had 3 major setbacks (\~6mo each; covid, career switch, job hunting) that have wasted 1.5 years of my life. Immigrant based in UK right now, was working with a stable healthcare giant till they made me and few hundred others redundant based on organisational restructuring, not on performance. Until then I was nailing my work. This has been difficult for me to digest as I'm not used to things turning utter crap after giving my complete best. It left me without VISA, with not enough experience to go for senior roles to get VISA sponsorship and not enough time to find VISA suitable roles. Finally after 4 months, I have secured a role within the same organisation but in Portugal now with Visa.

***What still puzzles me is; if a supposedly stable healthcare giant can do this (even senior people were made redundant), then where is the safety in intellectual corporate roles? To keep myself safe and have a meaningful life I think I must start something on the side and this is where I need some ideas.***

**Factors to consider:** 

* I'm enthusiastic about and natural at understanding people and exploring cultures without judgments/biases. Most of my friends are from different Asian countries and I have been able to develop a ""Call me whenever you visit my country without hesitation"" relationships. I love stitching the boundaries between different people and bringing out the best in them as a person. 
* I'm super rapid at learning physical things (sports/skills) upto an intermediate-advanced intermediate level. Currently learning badminton (\~1 yr) and may be able to be a coach at some level if I keep going at this rate for 4-5 years. 
* I've got an artistic eye for video/photographic frames but particularly I'm good at ""chasing candid moments"". I've got an Insta 360 go3 and have been capturing candidness with friends, gatherings, travels etc. just to be able to use it someday somehow. 
* I want to be able to help/change something in people for the good throughout my life. I cannot think of living a life with money but no meaningful impact of my work (like dropshipping/affiliate marketing etc). Currently I spend about 7% (I save a lot of the rest) of my monthly income to feed homeless people directly (not putting it in charity as I like to talk to them usually).

  
I've thought about social media content creation based on cultural exploration/badminton/travel to explore people etc. Maybe learn Badminton good enough to be a coach at some level (could add social media badminton content to this). I've also thought about those global work travel things where you go to a different country and volunteer/work odd jobs (not really keen on the odd jobs part) for the opportunity to explore the country. I'm running out of ideas beyond that.

Throughout that time I have held 5 titles, including my most recent role in learning and development. My previous boss identified my work ethic, determination, and ambition and quickly promoted me through the first 4 roles. Now after sitting in L&D, I am starting to wonder if I should look for something else within the same company or leave entirely. 

My issues with my department include leadership issues (my direct and the level above), no desire to change, inconsistencies in policy and procedure from team to team. It's made doing my job mentally exhausting. I have mentioned solutions or willingness to participate in process improvement and I'm met with responses like “we know but we can't change it” or “everyone feels that way”.   It feels like insanity. They began micromanaging tactics and are tracking employees who tap into flexibility (wfh) and their reasons why. Yet, from the head of HR
“Tap into flexibility as you need to”

My issues with rhe company is that each department operates in a silo. In addition, C-suite executives provide contradictory statements yet they influence so much that everyone runs around like a chicken with their head cut off. 

(There are load of more scenarios) 

Are these problems normal for large organizations? Or am I just a complainer with too high of expectations?

1ddkn3d,Ex lawyer who wants to be an entrepreneur... no idea where to start. ,"**NOTE TO READERS:** 

**Please provide sincere advice, as lectures on the challenges of entrepreneurship will be disregarded (i.e. having to report to customers instead of a boss, risk of failure etc). I understand the risks but believe the rewards of independence and flexibility outweigh them.**

  
-------



Hello,

I'm a 32-year-old male and former lawyer, having attended a top T14 law school. Here's a brief overview of my professional journey:

- Initially worked in the tech industry for a year after college (marketing).

- Pursued a law degree partly for the title and the belief that it would open up diverse career opportunities. I had a full scholarship, so financial concerns weren't a factor. I saw it as a valuable educational experience with potential applications in business.

- Accepted OCI offers and spent two years in corporate law at global firms.

- Transitioned to sales at a large tech company for two years.

- Returned to law briefly in an in-house role at the same company for a year.

- Recently shifted to marketing within the same company (after realizing law is DEFINITELY Not for me having tried both firm and in house)...now 7 months in.



My career trajectory has been somewhat erratic, but a consistent theme is my aversion to traditional employment structures. I value independence, creativity, and the ability to work autonomously without the fear of being at the mercy of an organization.



**Here are my career aspirations:**

1. Location flexibility: I aim to work remotely.

2. Autonomy: I prefer working for myself without a boss.

3. A blend of creativity and analytical skills: I'm drawn to opportunities that allow me to utilize my artistic side while leveraging skills honed during my legal career, such as negotiation and deal analysis.

My current salary is $300K, and I have significant savings and assets. While I require health insurance, I'm open to self-insurance or being covered by a spouse.

I'm seeking advice from anyone who has navigated a similar career transition, whether from law or another field. Despite feeling like a jack of all trades, I'm determined to forge a career that offers location independence and allows me to be in control.

  


**Here are some potential career pivots I've considered:**

1. Consulting: I believe I could leverage my diverse business and legal background to assist companies, although the specifics are unclear. Would love ideas if this is a route you have also taken.

2. Real estate: I'm intrigued by real estate investing, having already invested in three properties. However, I'm unsure if it could sustain me full-time given the capital required. Rich Dad Poor Dad was an inspirational book for me, as was the FIRE Movement (to some degree, while I believe it to be a bit too restrictive). Real estate provides a mechanism to ""buy back your time"" and I am all for that.

3. Starting a product-based business: I've contemplated launching a niche product line, such as an active lifestyle/clothing brand, but worry about startup costs.

4. Business brokerage: I wonder if I could utilize my legal expertise in this field, although it may require additional licenses and mentorship.

5. Property management: While potentially lucrative, I'm hesitant due to the high-touch nature of the business.

6. Career consulting for lawyers: This option appeals to me due to its low startup costs and flexibility, but I'm wary of being perceived as a ""life coach"" and offering subpar advice.



My Myers-Briggs personality type is INTJ, if that adds any insight into my preferences and tendencies.

I'm open to any additional suggestions, particularly those involving ""boring"" or blue-collar businesses that offer stability and resilience against automation.



Thank you in advance for your insights.",AgileConsideration39,2,1.0,0,1718128940,2024-06-11 18:02:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ddkn3d/ex_lawyer_who_wants_to_be_an_entrepreneur_no_idea/,6,2024
1ddk1hk,should i start looking for a new job ? worried about looking as a job hopper ,"i graduated in may of 2020 (during the pandemic) and i had a pretty nice job lined up but that job was rescinded due to covid. 

so my first job ended up being a not so desirable job that i took that i worked for 9 months (worked night shift from 10pm to 9am) 

my second job i worked for about 1yr and 7 months and that was related to my field

my current job im at nearly 2 years (2 years in august) 

im not super happy with my job right now (but i kinda stay at my job because of the salary is pretty high) 

however, im trying to debate whether or not i should consider to look elsewhere for better WLB. is there any reason for me to NOT look around ? the only reason that ive not looked yet was because i was worried that I might look like a job hopper and did not want to ""burn"" an interview if i know i need to start applying for another company later. 

i work at a company where layoffs are pretty common so im just trying to play it tactically right now. 

  
tl;dr 

3 jobs in 4 years. 

* 1st job - 9 months 
* 2nd job - 1 yr 7 months 
* current job - nearly 2 years in august. 

my company likes to do layoffs every 6 months so im refraining from looking for a new job because of: 

* fear of being seen as a job hopper and immediately failing the interview because of that. 
* wanting to ""save"" these potential interviews in the event of a layoff so i can interview with them later and then also NOT be seen as a job hopper at that point.

1ddiz56,UK people only!! ,"For context I’m 22 and have wasted the past 5 years rotting at home and neglecting myself completely. I finished my a-levels in 2019 and everything went downhill from there. I didn’t pass any of my subjects due to how bad my mental health had deteriorated and I couldn’t pick myself back up, I just gave up. I remember it being so bad that I would cry to my teachers because I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I would always want to do better and be better but I kept procrastinating and pushing productivity to the side to the point where it’s now been years. Time really flies and oddly enough it feels really fast? Especially since I’ve been doing nothing with my life (I would’ve expected it to feel slower). 

I’m still very depressed and anxious but this time I have a little hope. I’m tired of living like a lost cause. I feel so much shame that I’m the only one in the family who just let herself go. I always feel like I’m the odd one out and that I have something wrong with me. I don’t know why it’s taken me this many years to do something with my life, I don’t think I’ll be able to forgive myself for it. I hope one day I won’t need to live in regret. So much time wasted because I gave in to depression and anxiety. I feel so disconnected from reality, I don’t feel like I belong anywhere as I’m always disassociated. Everyone tells me I’m great with speaking to people but I genuinely feel like I’ve lost my social skills, my brain feels foggy and I struggle to spit words or sentences out. I feel like there’s always a block in my brain and that I make no sense when I speak. Sometimes I struggle to even form basic sentences so I choose to stay silent instead of embarrassing myself. 

Anyways, I’ve always loved children and have always seen myself working with them. This is just an impulsive idea so I don’t know if I’ll go through with it or not but I wouldn’t mind being a reception teacher. I would prefer to work with children 0-5 years but mainly kids in reception. The only problem is that I don’t have my science and maths (gcse). The fear of failing is holding me back as I know I’d have to resit, I’ve always struggled with basic maths my whole life. I know that maths is a requirement but I’m not so sure about science since I won’t be teaching older primary school kids?  

I don’t know what route to take between an apprenticeship in early years or uni. For now as I’m indecisive I think it’s best to not go to uni as I don’t wanna end up changing my mind midway. I don’t know where to start and how I would go about resitting maths and science (if necessary). Are there any alternative ways to make up for them?

I’ve done my fair share of research but they’re not descriptive enough in answering the many questions that I’m asking right now. I’d appreciate anyone reaching out and helping me understand better as I’m clueless asf on where to begin and how to make my way up.

1ddhzrk,Don't know what to do - passion or money,"Hi, this is probably a post that gets added to this sub like twice a day or whatever, but I'm really torn about this and would appreciate any and all advice.

I currently have an English masters degree (in a country that doesn't speak English) which I absolutely loved - I love English, I love writing, I love reading, I love research, etc. But finding a job has been horrible, especially since I am looking for communication jobs in the artistic industry (notoriously horrible to find a job in). Even when I branched out and applied for jobs that I really should've gotten, I got nothing. Additionally, I have been struggling with seeing people around me do successful jobs with high status and loads of money (I had a job as a project manager and the pay was absolute dogshit). I am very ambitious and am leaning towards doing another degree to increase my income. 

I have been thinking of going into law school (yes, I know). I do think law interests me (at least some law does) and would do good in law school as someone who is very studious and passionate to learn new things. However, I would do this mainly for the money (you don't have to go into debt to attend law school where I live) since I am very scared of what the future has in store with inflation and just general horribleness. The problem is, I am like 90% sure that I would find the job very boring - I absolutely despised my office job and it's not a job where I can be creative. Plus, the people that go into law jobs are really not my kind of people...

Basically, I have to choose between doing a job I love for horrible pay or a job I will most likely (might not though!) hate but with good money and a nice status... I really really do not know what to do. It is absolutely eating me alive.

I've looked up signs that a job is a scam but I'm not sure if it's a scam since it came from a company email, but I can't find that person on LinkedIn connected to this company (they could have their name/profile hidden) and the job postings they have on LinkedIn are software jobs located in India (I am not applying for software jobs, the position emailed to me is not a software job, and I do not live in India).

Here is the email with specific info redacted:

I have applied to jobs posted by ""middle man"" sites like acttalent, jobot, and ripplematch, so maybe this company is from one of those applications.
I'm thinking it's a scam because:
1. the email has a name, but they didn't have a signature with that name and their position in the company.
2. If I applied, why wasn't the email addressed to my name specifically?
3. A read somewhere that if they use the word ""kindly"" it's likely a scam. I'm not sure why, but I guess most people don't use that word often.

1ddgymo,"Seeking Career Advice: Moving Up in Tech Without a College Degree
","Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some career guidance and advice 

**Current Situation:** I'm currently wearing multiple hats as an Executive Assistant to the CEO. Basically serving as an Interim Developer, and an Events Coordinator. I have heard I'm very competent in my roles, and I have been viewed at every company i worked at as reliable and very willing to learn but I'm looking to transition into the tech industry more permanently.

**Background:**

* I don't have a college degree and would prefer not to go back if possible.
* I was pretty far along in my Sociology degree before leaving school. Before that I studied classical instrument at a pretty prestigious school - however I had a huge mental health decline  that left me hospitalized
* My resume isn't bad, but I only have one tech job under my belt as support at a startup (though I did much more than that, similar to my current job).
   * I feel like this has helped me develop a good eye and feel for what people find attractive and desirable. Also gives me a leverage on team work, professionalism, time management and more
* I have a bit of marketing and event experience, having successfully coordinated events with over 1000 attendees. Marketing and event planning come naturally to me and are both fun and easy.

**Goals:**

* I would like to move back into tech.
* Ideally, I see myself in a managerial position in the near future, possibly by moving up within a company.
   * product manager

**Additional Qualifications:**

* I'm currently working on a Project Management certificate and a UX Design certificate in hope to improve my assertiveness. 

**Questions:**

1. How can I leverage my current skills and experience to transition back into tech?
2. What steps should I take to position myself for a managerial role in tech?
3. If returning to college becomes necessary, what major would best complement my background and career goals?
4. Any tips for improving my resume and job applications to highlight my diverse experience and skills?

1ddgyft,Which to choose?,"As a bit of context, I'm a 22 year old based in London. Long-term I'm training to be a solicitor: I have a training contract with a Magic Circle law firm and have just finished the law conversion course. My law firm has two intakes, one in September and one in March, and I have been allocated to the March intake because I haven't yet had a gap in any point of my education. The plan has always been to spend until the end of September working, then go travelling until January, come back to London, and find somewhere to live that's not my parents' house. 

  
I'm currently working at a research agency which runs a big legal industry award. My role primarily involves conducting 15-30 minute interviews with people who have been nominated for the award. The work is really straightforward: prep questions for the interviews, conduct the interviews, neaten up the transcripts; it doesn't feel very much like I'm using my brain and it has made me lethargic and sad. The company has an office which we're welcome to use, but it's not mandatory so I work from home 4 days a week and go into the office 1 day a week. I get paid £2,500 a month, which is pretty generous. 

  
While I was looking for a job, I also got offered a role at a PR and comms agency which works primarily for start-ups and venture capital outfits. I know nothing about PR, but I love writing. I'm regretting not taking this offer, despite it being paid £2,000 a month and requiring two-three days in the office which will cost me another £200 or so a month, meaning I'd be about £700 worse off. However, I think I would enjoy the job more and hence feel more energised. I'm contemplating contacting them and asking if they would still have a place for me if I'd like to join them, but I don't want to do that unless I'm 100% sure I'd take the job if offered. Any advice? 

  
TLDR: boring job that pays well and is essentially fully remote v more interesting jobs that would result in me being down £700 per month. ",LeadingPercentage625,2,1.0,0,1718119772,2024-06-11 15:29:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ddgyft/which_to_choose/,6,2024

1ddf3x1,Transitioning from Business Owner to Remote Worker,"Hey r/careeradvice,

I started a social media marketing agency back in 2018 but fast forward to 2024, I think I want to look into my options for a career change.   
  
I used to enjoy the freedom of my own schedule and not having a cap on my earnings in terms of signing on new clients. However, being a business owner is extremely difficult. There are months when profits dip, and I break even after all my expenses.   
  
I wonder now if it's the right path for me. I would really love to have a set salary these days when the cost of everything is rising, and I want to start a family one day. I want to know that I can provide and not have to fear every waking moment of my days.   
  
For transparency, one of my fears is that I lack a college degree in marketing. I studied for my Bachelor's degree but dropped out when I got tired of paying for classes that had nothing to do with my field of study. I knew that the college curriculum was not up to date on marketing trends, and I was being taught by dinosaurs.   
So, I embarked on my own path and built my own business.   
  
Now that I have been considering working for someone else, my biggest fear is they will want me to have a degree to qualify, and I'm 28 years old. It is a bit old to be going back to school and investing tens of thousands of dollars in an education.   
  
I feel like I have got myself stuck in a situation I might not be able to crawl out of. I took a risk and bet on myself, and it paid off initially, but now I'm unsure of my career and financial future.

I'm wondering if anyone here has even been in my shoes before, or has any advice they could offer me?",corcoran_jon,1,1.0,0,1718115129,2024-06-11 14:12:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ddf3x1/transitioning_from_business_owner_to_remote_worker/,6,2024
1ddeze6,Looking for advice on the missing piece,"Hi all,

I’m feeling pretty stuck and unsure of which direction to move forward.

For some context first: I went to a great school, was a military officer for 5 years, then bounced around the corporate world for another 4. Got laid off from my “dream job” and decided to start a small business. I’m married and my partner works a job where they travel about 50% of the time. 

That was about a year ago, and it IS going well. It’s not quite as lucrative as I hoped yet, but with time I’m pretty sure it could get there. However, I feel a huge lack of intellectual challenge. 

I love the freedom I have with my current set up, but truthfully I miss having more structure to my day and being around people. I work behind a computer all day, and with a partner who’s gone a lot it’s pretty depressing. 

I’m asking for advice because I truly don’t know what I want. I want some flexibility to enjoy my partner when he is home, I want intellectual challenge, and I refuse to be in a shitty work culture. My “dream job” was a major company that had recently gone through a merger, and the culture (and my boss) were awful. 

The market scares and discourages me, especially having been away from the corporate world for a year. 

As far as talents - I’m a great writer (my last role was corporate comms), I am extremely well spoken, and overall have an acumen for communication. I’m about 2 classes away from finishing a comms master’s degree (not that it means shit these days).

Would genuinely appreciate any guidance here. ",No_Ideal_5641,1,1.0,1,1718114798,2024-06-11 14:06:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ddeze6/looking_for_advice_on_the_missing_piece/,6,2024

1ddcofu,"Wanting to Leave Teaching, But Lost","Hello!

I just finished my 5th year of teaching and it pretty much did me in. I'm trying to leave the profession. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and a Master's Degree in Math Education. I have been self teaching myself programming on the side in an attempt to transition to the tech industry. However, nothing has come of that yet.

Does anyone have any advice on how to leave teaching? Are there specific jobs I could look for that pay relatively well enough? I would love to do something math-related or tech-related but I have zero idea on where to look or how to fill out a resume to stand out in those fields. I live roughly 30 minutes from STL. Does anyone know of jobs where I could leverage any of my skills/degrees? I am just feeling a bit lost.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",hutchkey23,1,1.0,3,1718108216,2024-06-11 12:16:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ddcofu/wanting_to_leave_teaching_but_lost/,6,2024

1ddc7fi,I hate my workplace and the people in my team ,"I absolutely hate every second at work. I joined this team last year, and it’s been around 10 months since I started. It's my first ever job, and I was so excited to begin. But it’s a nightmare here. There’s no proper work and no project for us even now. Everyone’s working on personal collaborations. Since I’m a recent college graduate and a newbie, they sort of ignore my existence. To make things worse, I had some sort of misunderstanding and rift with the team lead because he said some condescending things about me in a team meeting, and I retorted. I’ve been nothing but respectful, but he somehow finds ways to say condescending things to me. Ever since I talked back, we aren’t on speaking terms, and he ignores me like the plague. Since he’s the lead, he controls the group, and I am sort of ostracized. I absolutely can’t wait to leave this place. My manager is a nice person, but he gets influenced by the team lead, so I’m sure even he dislikes me.

1ddc4wi,Issues with undeserved authority. ,"How do you guys deal with having a supervisor that knows nothing about what's going on and yet is your boss and orders you around? We recently got a new supervisor she worked with us before and we all knew her. 3 of us applied but she was the only one interviewed and got the job. I have 5 more years experience than she does and my colleague who also applied has 10 more years experience than she does and yet they didn't even have enough respect for us to even interview us. So now our boss is a little girl with no experience. And she's asking us questions about fixing complex issues and all I can say back to her is well aren't you the supervisor? Didn't they teach you this? 

My issue isn't with her. I liked her before. What I don't like is she didn't deserve it. We've put in years of time and waited our tun just to be jumped over by someone who can't do basic things.

And so my plan has been to just sit back and watch her fail.

To her credit she is very smart and a very fast learner so I doubt she will fail because the upper management won't allow that to happen.

But in the mean time there is an extreme tension between us to the point we aren't even speaking anymore. My productivity has tripled because I'm pissed and not speaking to anyone right now because if I do I might say something I'll regret. So I'm keeping to myself right now and working harder than ever.

1ddbvb1,"Based on my qualities, what do you think would be a career path worth looking into?","Hey guys,

So i've always referred to myself as a jack of all trades, master of none. I'm kind of good at a bunch of different things, but not an expert to the point that I was drawn to a specific pathway. For years i've struggled with finding a career pathway that's right for me... Seriously, i've debated between wildlife photography, to piloting, to being a doctor, to working in media, to animation, to medical lab science, to project management, etc etc... I've found appealing aspects to lots of lines of work, but also want to make sure I choose wisely.

I currently am slated to begin school for medical lab science this fall... But i'm of course having doubts as to whether that is what i'd be best suited to doing for a career. So i'm debating other options before fully committing.

My strengths are:

- I'm an excellent writer. I can type fast and have a knack for writing eloquently and effectively. I enjoy it too. Not like, creative writing as in novel or story writing. But just general paragraphs of explanations, information and opinions.

- I'm a creative person for sure. I enjoy flexing my creativity and bringing new ideas and fresh perspectives.

- Sometimes to a fault, I can be a bit of a control freak. I like to organize for the future and make plans that can also involve others (hence my mention of project management).

- I do like to be autonomous, i'm not a huge fan of authority. I have been described as having an ""entrepreneurial spirit"" about me. But obviously, I know reporting to someone is typically a must. So this is obviously more of a wishful type thing.

- I enjoy working around people. Though I do like to do my own work and work independently, I do like being in a team in some ways and having interactions with other people often.

- I have been told I have a ""radio voice"". I would definitely be open to using that in some aspect of a career since I do like to talk and be creative. 

And as an aside, if any of these careers are on the visa list to the USA, i'd certainly take that into consideration as i'd like to have that option. But it's not a must. 

If any come to mind based on my strengths, please do let me know!!",3BordersPeak,1,1.0,3,1718105490,2024-06-11 11:31:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ddbvb1/based_on_my_qualities_what_do_you_think_would_be/,6,2024

1ddaks9,Took a step back at the age of 30+ to move overseas. The new company management and culture suck. Fearful about my professional future and career development.,"I (34F) worked for 5 years in a niche industry that gave me a lot of exposure to senior leadership and high-performing professionals. The market turned bad where I lived (Latin America) and I was laid off, so I accepted a job in Europe as a Business Development Analyst. This job is below my experience/skillset but the pay is way above average for the position, I wanted to immigrate and took the offer at a boutique tech consulting company.

Originally the person who did the first interviews was a junior manager, but it was agreed I would report to the CEO. I had one meeting with him where he showed up late, clearly had no idea what to do with me, and gave me a research task. We agreed to schedule a second meeting. **It has been a month and I simply can't get a hold of him. He doesn't answer my meeting invites.** 

In the meantime, the junior manager who interviewed me is acting like my direct manager, delegating menial tasks but at the same time doing zero of the career development / project assignment work that a manager should do. He communicates pretty badly, has less business experience than me and it hurts my ego working under him (I know this is arrogant of me but can't help it) since I used to report directly to high-profile individuals. 

Needless to say, the company culture is bad. The sales team hates each other because roles and responsibilities are not clear. 50% of the people I message simply won't answer me. 

I am trying not to be shaken and do my best. I scheduled calls with the people that answered and I am taking notes, learning, and trying to find a project to implement. 

I have never worked in a place with such terrible management, I know I agreed to it but I am so worried about everything. I changed my life for this job, how can I make the most out of this situation? Looking for another job will be a challenge since I don't speak the local language fluently yet.

1ddaj37,Got an IOU with a counteroffer,"I felt this was odd and I want 3rd party opinion of my situation. I worked for my company for 9 yrs. I am highly specialized in what I do but way undervalued. I am a fully certified life insurance underwriter without a title. But compensated as a case manager (low level employee in my company). My company is trying to take low level employees, train them to do high level jobs and never change their role, their title or pay. Instead they give pizza parties and an extra day off here and there. I had 3 companies approach me the last few months and offer me a lot more money then I could ever make in my current role. This last one was the first that was actually worth it but the risk takes me away from what my director and vice president are promising me. A promotion into my dream job. Only problem? It's a 1 to 2 yr wait or whenever business picks up and they never put it in writing. So I went to the new place got the written up offer and they called my director and v.p. about it. (They are a partner of my company so this is normal) I am not worried about being labeled a flight risk, as I am already. I hold a lot of leadership responsibilities, again without pay, and 1 is to attend leadership meetings in which they listed out whom in the company is a flight risk and why. I was due to skill set and many partner companies stating their interest and openly advising they would contact me this year. 

Here comes the weird part. My company knew about this all year The meeting was in January. Yet their counteroffer was lower and mainly contingent on commission, which I still to this day, have never earned and an IOU for my underwriting title/job and they would give it to me in 1 year. Wouldn't you think they would have made a better offer? Or are they assuming I won't go?

I am just confused. I have never heard of a company giving an IOU. My family says run and go to the new company. It may be starting over toward my dream job but this place is using me.

1ddag2q,Should I quit?,"So I landed a pretty decent paying job a month ago and was happy to relocate to a new country and start fresh. But the day I walked in, I've been bombarded with tasks beyond my capacity with no training and mentoring from anyone. I'm supporting consultants across three functions of the unit, working late nights and weekends just to make sure my task is done. This has been going on for a while and I feel completely burnt out. What's worse is that my boss is a toxic person who has made several nasty remarks about me. One that sticks out was the one when he said that the new person who would be joining a month after I was hired would get up to speed quicker than me. This person has joined and the way he treats her is completely different. She's working remotely and on her second week in, he's taking her with him to attend a high-level meeting in France. Mind you, we're in the same position and I did all the work for them to attend this meeting. The membership process and what not. She's been assigned more interesting projects and will be only focusing on those whereas I'm supporting so many people and still don't get to be on any of the major deliverables of the unit. She's less experienced than me but still she got all these interesting tasks to do without the boss even assessing her quality of her work or performance. This was solely preferential-based decision because she's white and I'm not! I'm beyond disappointed and frustrated about this and want to quit. Any advise?

I've had several mental breakdowns in the past few days. On Friday evening, he yelled and blamed me for some discrepancies in data due to some mis-reporting from other units. But how is this even my fault? There's plethora of these incidents that have happened in the last two months since I joined and I kept my head down hoping things would change but it never did.

1dd9ul3,Past burnout from previous job. Carried over as depression in new job.wwyd?,"Long story short my last job (I'm not going to specifics) had mold that I breathed In for a year or more, and I had no breaks. I had severe burnout or adrenal fatigue that I needed to take supplements for, and my psychiatrist wrote a note that I needed breaks and wanted me to go back on Prozac for my anxiety attacks. I got a new job it's amazing I know people in the company, so it's less scary since I can message them with questions. The only issues here is my self perception is destroyed, my nervous system is compromised, & My home life isn't good. I have hardly 10k saved since my sibling is finically dependent on me, and they refuse to get a job..due to agoraphobia..plus keep procrastinating getting any financial aid...and I can't afford to move closer to the public transit. The crossover between these jobs was 9 days, so I haven't recovered from the previous burnout.. I always had trouble recovering from severe stress..it can take months or years..my ocd tendencies has me ruminating on how I let myself get to this point. I get stuck in this story and I'm overthinking. my nervous system is so wrecked I wake up with sweats and heart palpitations. My cortisol peaks in the morning. It's giving me brain fog and fatigue. I learned not to overwork myself from this experience. My supervisor is showing concern after I called in sick today, but I had to call in sick already before on probation. My perception of myself is so ruined. I was so tired that a few customers at my last toxic job comment on how ""anorexic"" my face has become. I hate how I look now when I took pride in my health and appearance. I loved dressing up..my last job was uniform. My hair is shedding and I even got my first stress white hair. I feel so depressed that I question how I'm going to work full time at all in this state. I should have left my last job as soon as I found out there was mold, but was finically pressured until I had a new job lined up. Debating on getting government assistance if I need to take a stress leave. I'm hoping the burnout just goes away. But it's been 4 months and it's still here. Basically this whole exciting, new job experience was tarnished by the burnout that I developed a whole month before I even received this job offer...I don't even know how I did the onboarding process..adrenaline maybe.. and I feel like I'll never be myself again. It's sending me into a severe depression. My only options are wait out probation and get my benefits and start seeing a new doctor. Or try to go on lov or stress leave which my body needs, but I know I would be disappointed in myself. Either way I'm screwed. I don't know what to do. I just want to feel like myself again. My family and friends know my situation and it's mixed opinions. I wake up every morning with a nocturnal panic attack for the past 3 months. Sweats, tension headaches, and racing heart.

1dd9ows,Electronic engineer move to another job to be team lead or not,"Hi all, I'm 34M, digital designer for ASIC/FPGA (electronic engineer) in Spain. 

Currently I work remotely for an American company of about 500 employees, have been 2 years there, and make around 80k€. I don't have any people under me, and there's plenty to learn from in the team where I work and in the company in general, specially in related fields. 

HR from a small tech consultancy contacted me to see if I'd be interested in a position as team leader, remotely, having as client a Dutch company of under 50 employees. The client company is based on a single technology, which is interesting. And they potentially can pay some more of what I earn, around 90k€. My role would be in constant contact with the client, as if I'd be integrated into their company. 

On the negative side, I have doubts of what to do because I'm looking to be a father in the following year, so stability is a plus, and I do want my parental leave. Additionally, I already had a position as a team leader for about a year in my previous job, which ended being a disaster, since I had a ton more reponsability, my team was not up to the task and difficult to teach and I only earned +10% of what I did without being team lead. I also felt like I wasn't learning much, since I didn't really have who to learn from. 

On the positive side, it pays some more, and probably advances my career. I feel like, eventually, the only way forward is to be a team lead, which could be wonderful if the team is good and the client decent, but I have seen otherwise, too.

1dd8052,how do I make the most out of my VC internship?,"Title. I landed a VC internship at a small firm abroad through, not gonna lie, familial connection. I'm extremely excited about the role however but I want to make the most of it. The firm is relatively small and was founded in 2022, so from what I'm hearing they don't really have a structured role for interns within their firm. Further, they mainly focus on biotech/pharm investing with some tmt, and as not only am I not from a science background, I'm also an Econ major so I'm not the greatest at interpreting financial statements. I really do find VC interesting, but just don't feel I have the tools needed to really contribute to projects. Currently, I am supporting by finding KPI's, some qualitative analysis, and attending and note taking during meetings but I just don't feel I am doing enough, or really learning much. It's only been my first week so I understand I have to ease into it but I just want some advice as to how I can contribute the most and make the most out of this opprtunity?

Hi there- I work for a company in the entertainment industry. I am currently assistant controller, below a controller, who reports to a VP of finance, who reports to a CFO.

I have always wanted to be someone who helps influence the score rather than just keeps it, and I love analytical work and don’t love typical accounting work. 

I have an opportunity to potentially move myself over to FP&A manager. This role would report to the VP. I would much rather become the VP or CFO than the controller. 

Just wanted to get the thoughts of the group- does FPA Manager or finance manager seem like a step down from assistant controller? I understand it may not be a step up, but I had always considered it to be at least a lateral move based on how my department is structured. 

I am fighting for it to be a director title, but expect the offer to come in as a manager title since I have only been with the firm a few years. 

Let me know thoughts, definitely don’t want it to seem to outsiders and other companies as a “demotion” from assistant controller to FPA manager, but do want to steer my career more in the direction of day to day work I actually enjoy ",Grand_Sprinkles6131,1,1.0,0,1718073174,2024-06-11 02:32:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dd3jiz/fpa_manager_or_asst_controller/,6,2024
1dd3csm,Advice on internal promotion,"I was told once I get the necessary credentials for my field I would be eligible for a title change and pay increase. I’ve put in the work over the past two years and have finally achieved the certification. Now it’s time for the promotion. For context the new title would be Controller in the commercial real estate sector/private equity. 

My immediate supervisor says that she has put in the recommendation for the promotion but remaining c-level executives have reservations that include my lack of participation in meetings and whether or not I can perform in the role due to not speaking up and being vocal on certain topics. I can admit that this is true, because I’m not an expert in these topics. These topics include investment strategies and forward looking strategies. I’m an accountant and most of my knowledge involves actions in the past and how to account for them. But when accounting subjects are brought up I participate because I have knowledge of that topic. Another reservation is if I am given the title change that I will leave the company within a year. This one makes no sense to me but maybe I’m missing something. 

This was told me 3 weeks ago and 1 week later I was told I will definitely receive the pay increase but not the title change until these reservations can be satisfied. (Pay increase is still pending to take effect)

I want advice and suggestions on how long should I wait to improve on their reservations, 3 months? 6 months? Because I know that I can’t just magically have input on topics that I don’t have knowledge of in 1 week. Any other advice is also appreciated and welcomed as well.

1dd2s9i,Mid-30's women w/ impending Autism diagnosis seeks grad school/career change advice,"TL:DR - mid-30's woman with impending mid-life high intelligent high functioning autism diagnosis seeking recommendations for graduate studies and career shift from sales to analytical roles. If you have earned a Masters or PhD in a math field (calculus, actuarial science, finance, data science, and so on) what do you do for a career? If you made a mid-life career change that was emotionally hard I would appreciate your wisdom as well.

I've spent a decade in the nonprofit and sales career, job hopping, feeling miserable and unfulfilled. After getting sober and addressing trauma I began treating an eating disorder and that's how I discovered an extensive (and previously undisclosed) family history of ADHD and high-functioning high intelligence autism.  It explains everything, every weird symptoms, the strained relationships I never understood, the misdiagnoses...you get the point. 

I've already spent the last year making lose goals to go to grad school to study math before neurodivergence was proposed so I think I've been coming to this realization for awhile. My Bachelors is in Marketing from a top ranked public school. I'd love to get a Masters degree (even open to a doctorate) in something mathematical but I'm too old to take out student loans so my hope would be to pay my way as I go. It's a huge undertaking because I'd have to take non degree seeking classes before applying anywhere. It'd be great if I could leverage my sales experience with a math degree that's relevant to companies. I have a ton of legacy ties to the University of Michigan and I'd love to go there if I could get in but I'm open to others as well.

I present as a neurotypical mid-30's attractive straight white woman but once you get to know me, it's pretty clear I'm a little off. I'm an amazing writer and fully understand metaphors and sarcasm but I really really struggle with mind blindness. 

I need advice on these things: 

1. What kind of part-time, full-time or freelance remote careers should I get to tie me over for the next few years? I'm passionate about freedom of the press and a journalism fact checking/research would be perfect but I don't have a background in that. I've considered assisting a private investigator or something, and I've applied for AI coaching jobs. Any sort of math/accounting/editing/research career would be better than sales but I don't know how to break into that if it's not my background. Remote or hybrid-remote would be strongly preferred to help me manage my symptoms and decide make plans to move for school

2. I need to figure out what I want to study and really solidify a plan to make money.  I've considered actuarial science. (Should I get a MS or Phd?), theoretical or analytical statistics. I don't have a clear understanding of what people with math advanced degrees do for work other than teach. Many have suggested data science but I very worried about competing for those jobs with people who've been programming since they were 7. I don't have a super clear understanding of what options there are.

1dd2mob,Fired as an intern. Can I appeal? How over is it for me?,"
I started the internship a week back and already got fired 💀. The reason is I had made a Reddit post about that firm which was mainly asking about its reputation and exit opps. However, in passing I mentioned that they had a relationship with a pretty good firm to show that they have strong capabilities in some divisions. I basically said word for word”this place also works with X firm” and left it there. 

I got called in by HR and they claimed that my post by itself was alright and didn’t seem to have any ill intentions but the fact that I mentioned that they had a relationship with that prestigious firm was a breach of client information. Mind you I only said that they had a relationship with them. Nothing else. 

I made that post on literally the second day of my internship. I was just mentioning their name in the air. Nothing about the nature, structure, or details about the relationship. On top of that I literally had asked one of the people during my networking days if they had a relationship with that firm because they’re based in the same city. They said yes. 

While hearing this I was in shock because I didn’t know what to say but when I left I did a simple google search and there’s literally an article about the collaboration of these 2 firms. 

So I’m not sure how anything I said is proprietary. This is my junior summer and it really screws up my future. I’m not sure what I should do because I’m terrified and lost. Frankly in shock because I feel like my career is over. I feel terrible disappointing my parents but truthfully I just didn’t see this coming. Any advice would be appreciated.

I am happy with my current employer and was not actively trying to find a new job. My previous supervisor switched to a new company a few months ago and hounded me to apply for an open position he had until I finally did. I work in a niche position, there aren’t many people who do the type of work I do, I am very very good at it and have earned an outstanding reputation throughout the state since I started around two years ago.

I interviewed for the position two weeks ago and was told by the director within a couple days that they will be offering me the job. I am waiting for HR to contact me by the end of this week with a formal job offer. The director stated my salary will be 61k - 63k, but I guess that’s not official until I receive the job offer. I currently make 49k. I wanted at least 65k. There are opportunities for a supervisor promotion within the next 3 years, which would pay at least 90k, but the promotion not guaranteed of course since it’s years down the road and a lot can happen with a company in that time period.

The biggest down side is the new company is almost an hour away from my house. I have 3 kids and it worries me how a much longer commute will affect them. My current employer provides me with a vehicle (I drive a lot for work during the work day), and the prospective employer will not provide a vehicle but will pay mileage. My current employer provides a work cell, and the prospective employer will not, they just provide a phone stipend which I think is around $30 a month.

Also, my current employer is aware that I will probably be scouted since I am so good at my job. She has promised me the director position as soon as the current director retires in the next couple years, maybe earlier, in exchange for my loyalty to the company, but again who knows what can happen in reality. She is not open to increasing pay right now. She doesn’t know that I have interviewed elsewhere and will probably be pissed if she finds out I have another job offer.

The team is only expected to get bigger and I can’t take on anymore tasks. I am at capacity. To give background I am a supervisor for 2 teams and honestly if I had it my way I’d get rid of half of these people because they are unable to complete tasks without being told what to do at every turn. 

 I have never been given a list of expectations or been given feedback on how I’ve been doing. I’ve been in the role for almost 1 year. 

What do I do? In my heart I’d love to be honest with her boss but at the same time is it worth it? I am actively looking for another job. So far no luck.

1dd0d8q,Free vocational training opportunity but little direction.. HELP,"I’m currently a SAHM with my almost one year old (couple weeks shy) before having her I was an elementary school teacher (which wasn’t a good match) and my bachelors degree is actually in theatre (great experiences but proven to be an incredibly impractical choice to take student loans out for 💀) I now have an opportunity to do some free vocational training through EmployNV and WIOA. The problem is there are 50+ pages of available programs and I’m just so lost on what I should try out.

For additional context, I’m not super concerned with the income of the job since my husband is working but it would be nice to find something that pays well. I do need to consider child care and weigh pros and cons there. Before I chased passion jobs that left me burnt out so I’d love to find something that I can feel good/productive/fulfilled but not something that has me bringing home a ton of work and making life completely unbalanced. My interests are so wide spread that it’s hard to hone in lol I basically feel like I could do a number of things ranging in a lot of different industries and be content.

One of my biggest concerns is picking a program that actually holds value in that industry. Most of the list is certificate level training and I know depending on the industry it could be either enough to land a job or just another paper with no real leverage. I just don’t want to waste state funding on something I could learn myself from YouTube or Coursera/udemy etc.",chongxi,0,0.5,0,1718063485,2024-06-10 23:51:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dd0d8q/free_vocational_training_opportunity_but_little/,6,2024

1dcxy7i,"Please help me asap, I need it more than ever..","Hello. I’m creating this post while in the middle of a full summer course load and under tremendous stress. I’m really looking for genuine advice and could you both uplifting words as well as the hard truth from someone with experience where I am at.

I am an undergraduate student going into my senior year at a well known private institution. I’m majoring in biochemistry and I am on the pre dental track.

Throughout my college career I have done many extracurricular activities to try and build up my resume to eventually apply to dental school. I have 200+ hours in a dental lab working with hybrid implants and received an amazing letter of recommendation from the owner of the lab. I joined the Academic Events Committee for the Undergraduate research program at my university where I led my own events and seminars. I worked as an extern at a local dental office. I took a course and got registered as a dental assistant. And I am shadowing a dentist gaining hours to help my resume. I am also joining a research lab which is held in high regard for my university.

My problem starts here, and I am going to be brutally honest in hopes of receiving the best advice possible. I am very shaken up at the moment and struggle immensely with over thinking, so I honestly don’t know how bad my current situation really is..

I went through some ups and downs academically with my father (sole provider for my household as my mother has back issues) was diagnosed with colon cancer and went through two pulmonary embolisms during the summer before my sophomore year. As stated, I struggle immensely with overthinking and the thought of my father passing was a lot for me. I also knew that if this happened I would have to leave my current university as it is very expensive and he is paying for it. This immense stress led me to do poorly the year following these incidents. I began rebuilding in my junior year and came back very strong and retook a lot of the classes I did poorly in. My current GPA is 2.61 and after I use my last two academic forgiveness requests I will be at a 2.7 cumulative.

I understand this is very, very far from ideal for a dental school applicant. However, I STRONGLY believe that after my senior year I can be above a 3.0 cumulative, possibly closer to a 3.1-3.2.

I believe I have done a good job building up my extracurriculars and really feel as though I will stand out in that area.

I am taking the DAT this August and really do feel as though I will be around a 24-25 average in each category. I understand this is very ambitious however I have been involved in multiple prep courses and programs and have been excelling so far.

I have been researching pre-dental MBA programs to possibly attend before dental school in order to significantly better my chances. There are many of these programs designed for people like me who are planning to apply to dental school afterwards. This however, would be a two year commitment and extend significantly the time before I would theoretically graduate from dental school.

Here’s where I need some honest, hard truth advice, as well as some uplifting words to ease my current mental state.

Am I screwed? Did I ruin my chances at a field in dentistry when I let my grades and mental state slip? 

Any advice as to doing the MBA before dental school?

Do I even stand a chance against other candidates at this point?

Will my strong extracurriculars even help me?

Please, please help me.",ComfortableDirt3459,1,1.0,0,1718056917,2024-06-10 22:01:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dcxy7i/please_help_me_asap_i_need_it_more_than_ever/,6,2024
1dcxmv4,Am so getting a pay cut?,"After a year of dedicated service since joining fresh out of college, I've been instrumental in generating valuable content for my company. My initial salary stood at $50k, but now, transitioning to an hourly wage, I find myself at $22.50 per hour, which feels like a step down considering my previous equivalent hourly rate would be around $24.04. While there's potential for increased earnings with overtime, it's concerning that overtime isn't factored into my base hourly wage. This arrangement seems unfair, especially considering the extra effort I've put in to benefit the company. Furthermore, witnessing colleagues being sent home early to avoid overtime only adds to the frustration. It's disheartening to feel undervalued despite my contributions.

1dcxlp9,When is it too soon to go to HR?,"I started my dream job 3 months ago. However my manager and coworker haven’t been the most pleasant to work with. My manager is very intense to say the least. If she’s having a bad day, everyone will know it. Her and my coworker are friends, yet my coworker is terrified of her. She has voiced that to me many times. My coworker is always afraid to let my boss know that she doesn’t know something and my coworker is my trainer! It’s made it so hard to catch on or learn things because my coworker doesn’t know certain things and refuses to ask my boss out of fear or tells me wrong information and leaves me hanging once I say the wrong information that she told me. My coworker also has a tendency to swoop in when she does know something (almost to make herself look good and esp if my boss will see it). But if I ask her something privately, she doesn’t respond to me for hours. Also if my manager asks to work on something together my coworker will do it herself and turn it in saying she did it. BUT if something is wrong suddenly “WE” worked on it together. I don’t know what to do. My coworker will flat out lie to my boss that she understands something she asked us to work on and then when we work on it she says she has no idea how to do it and then we both get yelled at for not turning it in on time or correctly. I actually typically catch the brunt of the verbal lashing, bc my manager again is friends with my coworker. I don’t want to throw my coworker under the bus. And don’t think my boss would care because she likes my coworker. 

My boss had a previous person in this role who left and according to my coworker was on her “bad side” I also found chains of messages between them and my boss was very nasty to her. She also tried getting her fired by putting her on a PIP. I’m almost positive my boss was reported by this previous employee. 

I want to raise a red flag that I’m being led by fear and trained by someone who is scared of their leader thus making it difficult for her to train me.

1dcx28h,Should I accept the offer for now?,"I have been working at my current company for a year now. I love my coworkers and the culture here, but the low pay for my position has made it very difficult to stay. I recently entered the job market and have been going to 2 to 3 interviews a week, and had made it the final stages for a decent company for a sales position.
Last week my current company presented an opportunity for a marketing position I had been very keen on. My manager has been adamant about me pursuing the position as well. (I had expressed interest in the position a couple months ago but there currently wasn’t any opportunities to pursue at the time).
I let the Director of marketing know I will be applying for the position, and he was very happy for me that I was pursuing it. (The Director and I are pretty close and have had many talks about me joining his department too). I submitted my application last week on Thursday.
So here comes today, the Director said me and him will talk more tomorrow about the position, but then I also just received a call from the recruiter from the other company and they want to extend an offer for the sales role. They said I have by 11am tomorrow to make a decision. 
I would much rather stay at my current company and pursue the marketing position as I have always wanted to pursue a career in marketing and exit sales, however I do not want to reject the offer in case the marketing position doesn’t work out. 
What should I do, should I accept the offer for now for the safety and wait to see if I would be considered for the marketing position? I know I still have to talk to the director tomorrow, but it was an informal meeting and we did not set a time, but I know for a fact we will be talking tomorrow to discuss the role.

1dcwyxw,26M Lost and stuck… Need advice on finding direction and rediscovering happiness. Help!,"I'm struggling in the job market and lack direction in my life. I don't have a reason to get out of bed and am desperately searching for excitement, adventure, and a bigger purpose.

For years, I've been stuck in this rut, and i’m not happy. There are moments when I hit the gym daily and adopt healthy habits, which improves things a bit, but there's still this significant void lingering within me.

My first job, which I held for about two years, was at a small family company selling work clothes B2B. Initially, I had various tasks and lots of freedom, handling sales, building their website, and making deliveries. I loved it, but I left when the job became increasingly administrative.

After that, I worked for my dad on the farm, then briefly in retail for two months. I also had a short stint in an office for two weeks before finding temporary work at a factory, where I stayed for six months. I kind of enjoyed that job because I was valued at the company and given a lot of responsibility. Unfortunately, they had to lay off many employees due to the temporary nature of the work, which deeply affected me.

Next, I worked as an account manager for a very toxic company. I didn't research the company, focusing only on the job title despite having a bad gut feeling. It was the worst decision of my life. 

I'm currently in a customer service job and have been there for three months. The first month was exciting, but now it's becoming increasingly difficult to get out of bed each day. It feels like another dead-end job.

I always work very hard, but I get bored really easily and need a challenge. I feel different from my colleagues because I can't function in a boring, dead-end job, while they appear to manage just fine. 

I took this job because my confidence was shaken after my previous experience. I'm a perfectionist and struggle with performance anxiety, which stems from my abusive childhood (for which I've sought therapy).

Despite achieving results, and achieving my targets I constantly doubted myself and was micromanaged every day by my boss. It was the worst boss i ever had and awful in combination with my anxiety. 

Things i thrive on; 

1. Passionate about engaging with people. 

2. Enthusiastic about crafting, building, and enhancing projects or systems.

3. Driven by the thrill of solving very difficult problems. 

4. Thrive on embracing and conquering exceptionally challenging tasks and obstacles.

5. Competition 

6. Improvement 

What should I do? Constantly switching jobs isn't sustainable. I need to escape this situation, and I believe my best option is to pursue part-time college. It might not be ideal, but it offers a path to a future that's hopefully less bleak.

I'm a 27yo Belgian with a MSc. in Business Administration (major in Services Marketing & Strategy) and a Bachelor in Marketing. I have been working for 3 years as Personal Banker for DB and obtained an ""Advisor of Personal Financial Planning"" degree. 

I would like to find a position in really competitive sectors such as PE, M&A, portfolio management, strategic consultancy or at EU  institutions. I have unfortunately not done any relevant internship in a fancy investment bank or PE / M&A firm.

Today, I received an email from the university I graduated from about an interesting advanced MSc. degree in ""Sustainable development management and economics (1 year, evening and Saturday courses). 

Based on: 

- how ESG and sustainability are becoming more important than ever and impact regulatory in finance
- how the programme seems interesting 
- how an advanced ESG-relevant Msc. could be plus-value to differentiate my resume or allow me EU institutions positions I could not access without a link to sustainability and environment

-> Would you think this advanced MSc. degree could really be relevant and useful for my career or shall I allow this time at something else?

Hi all, seeking some advice on current situation.

I recently left a relatively high paying senior role  (~170K TC, 8 YOE, VLCOL state) due to lack of faith in company direction after very bad recent management at the national level (and by extension, my future with the firm). 

I left on very good terms and with a strong track record, and after ~3 months, during which I haven't yet found a role I'm interested in (relatively niche field), I've been offered to return.

Effectively, majority of employees who remain are demotivated and morale is low. At the same time, I'm concerned about the reputational risk and embarassment factor of returning.

Any advice is appreciated to help me find a way to make this work, I appreciate full transparency but need guidance. i understand working while in nursing school is a no-go for most people, but i am not willing to give up my career goals.

1dctir1,Accept the job offer opinions??,"So I currently been with my job for 1.5yrs been doing alright got a 60cent raise last year went from 17.20 to 17.80 plus a taxed bonus since the companies profit did well only reason I got a raise from what I was told but was still super happy about it .. they transferred me to their smaller location this year since both locations around 15-20 minutes away in the opposite direction…they needed help with loss products/sales with more tasks like inventory & sales/ pick up (now with sales I don’t make the commission the actual sales reps do at my home location since its their customers ) we only produce certain products at each location (home location has around 10x the employees / products/ sales) I do less than a fraction of what they do at my home location but this to me is a new position w/ new tasks,  I was a delivery coordinator last year this year I don’t even have a new position title as I was told they haven’t come up with one it’s been about 2 months… I call the position office admin since I’m the only one here to do all the paper work and be the “open line of communication” which on their end is a lie since they never answer the phone. 
Now I can work over time if need be kind of, this year is weird because technically it’s a seasonal job but there are things to do if I didn’t want to go on lay off just wouldn’t be 40hrs until the season picks back up (I dont typically do OT at this new position) 

They did want me to continue to do my old position on top of learning the new  position even thought I make roughly 100-150 calls a day so I honestly can only focus on one
Position at a time… I was working sometimes for 7am-7pm for the first 2 weeks w/ no life couldn’t cook dinner , do chores because I needed to be in bed by 8-9pm to get enough rest,  last year I was told we don’t leave until our work is done because we work 2 days ahead etc etc 
Anywho I got a fulltime job offer for 20$/ 5 minutes from my house but no OT , after 90 days there is a eval to be considered for a raise. My long time friends works there who pmo and can confirm they do raises as they promised & timely. With my current job you have to wait until the end of the year to be considered for a raise. I was told by my old boss at the home location I couldn’t ask for a raise even though I’m doing 2 different positions since the 2nd one is “temp” because they don’t how it’s going to go. But financially I can’t stay at 17.80 making around 570$ weekly

Is there anything else out there or am I doomed to be a data scientist?

1dcsz25,"My boss hired me and then quit 4 months into my job, what do I do now?","I was head-hunted by my boss for this specific department and they unexpectedly quit when I was only 4 months into this job. Now, I'm the only other person in this department and anyone else who sort of works with me has no idea what goes on in this office to even begin attempting to help me. They've had horrible turnover from what I've learned anyways so it really should't have been that unexpected. It's been 1 month since they left and my boss's boss (my assigned higher-up) has barely spoken with me about the next steps.

People in my personal life keep telling me to ""just keep your head down and collect a check"" and I can do that to a point, but I believe they're asking me to do work that is out of my scope of work. For context, I'm a program coordinator and therefore I don't have any managerial responsibility except for of interns which we have literally nobody here but me.

My confusion on what I should be owed as far as information goes is due to my job description (like many others) having the ""projects and responsibilities as assigned"". After the first week of my boss leaving, I tried to meet with my now supervisor but was turned away and told to continue working and email them if I have questions. I feel comfortable and confident but because I don't have the ""managerial responsibilities"" in my job description, that's where I feel I need something in writing otherwise almost everything I do I feel like I'm just walking on eggshells, leading myself and hoping I don't get in trouble or do something wrong. Since I was head-hunted I do have a significantly higher salary than what is normal and want to keep it, just completely unsure of what I should be doing in this situation.

I have an Operations Management Degree. School did not offer internships at the time. My first job I had starting before college for 8 years was grocery store general duty (part time turned into full time). I eventually got nauseated with customer service and managed to switch to an Army Civilian internship (verifying technical accuracy of manuals, logistics, stuff like that). 

It was supposed to lead into a full-time position but they said I wasn't good enough at leadership, communication, and hidden messages. Upfront I told them I had an autism diagnosis, and I did my best, but it felt like it was never very supportive. I also learned sitting at a desk most of the time isn't for me, if I can help it. 

  
Anyway, almost all positions near me seem to be medical care or 10+ years' experience in certain things. Now I am struggling to find positions I am qualified to even apply for, let alone any I'd be happy with myself and life doing. Please suggest ideas on what to do if you can, thank you!

1dcsuni,How to handle a negative performance review despite my boss not being present for months? ,"
I(32F) work for a couple abroad at a startup. The startup consists of 2 businesses, one being partially hospitality/tourism. I do all the media- I am trained as a photographer and designer but I’m also doing everything from socials, content creation, website, print media, some copywriting, for both businesses. I also help out with guests and handle hospitality needs as I have a background in that. I often work weekends and later hours than 9-5. 

While I am passionate about this job and the people I work for are kind people with good intentions it’s become clear they either don’t want to be present or aren’t able to be in the office much. The man I work for has another job consulting right now and his wife is about to leave for a contract abroad. For business owners of a fledgling business, they are oddly not available much. 

I have struggled with deliverables due to being one of two employees and the only person here who is a creative. There has been no structure or formal metrics set up for performance other than “post on instagram x times a week.” Often their directions are contradictory or unclear, which leads to a lot of lost time trying to decipher what they mean. They have also never given me any concrete business or marketing goals despite me asking. Adding to this difficulty- I have ADHD and need structure to thrive at work. 

I was also informed by my female boss that my male boss would not be involved in day to day operations for the time being so I haven’t been communicating with him as much about details. He hasn’t been involved much since March. 

Today I received a performance review email from him that overall felt very negative, stating that I’ve missed many deadlines and have recently had a decline in work produced. Some of this feedback was fair and understandable, but I’m really confused and affronted that he sent a google doc outlining all my time off- some of which were sick days. Many of these dates were incorrect. All of my time off I had asked permission for. Strangely, he put that I was “only at 10% capacity due to a bad breakup” for the entire month of October. I’m not sure how he would measure this as there are no metrics in place. 

I am not sure how to handle this feedback other than to present my ideas for a stricter more consistent meeting schedule. How can I make it clear their absence and lack of information is making it difficult for me to do my job? I do not want to quit but I’m flabbergasted.

1dcsjob,Technician job or random part time job?,"Hi guys,

I have graduated 6 months ago and have had 7 interviews so far.

I am a mechanical engineering graduate from the UK

I am currently applying for graduate/entry level mechanical engineering roles

Currently I have a dilemma;

Either I take a mechanical engineering technician role to gain experience or take a part time job and continue to apply for graduate/entry level role until I land one?

For the technician role, I am planning to do it for about a year and then I will try to go back to applying for graduate/entry level mechanical engineering roles again

Essentially; Is it worth it doing the technician role to gain experience or am I better off doing a random part time job until I land a graduate/entry level mechanical engineering role?

Also, would taking the technician job ""Pidgeon hole"" me into only being a technician in the future?

TL/DR: Should I take a technician job for a year to gain experience or am I better off doing a random part time job and keep applying to graduate/entry level mechanical engineering jobs?",Distinct_Ad_7532,1,1.0,0,1718043788,2024-06-10 18:23:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dcsjob/technician_job_or_random_part_time_job/,6,2024

1dcs0n0,Salary advice needed,"I work as a worker at a private medical company. I started working there in December 2022. We agreed on a salary of 1320 euros with the promise that it would increase after a year. In February 2024, I initiated a conversation with the chief doctor about a salary increase, and the response was that it was not the right time yet. I believe this is just an excuse and that it is not fair, as I am doing an excellent job.

Currently, we have 2 machines and a total of 4 shifts, which means we need at least 4 independent workers to cover all shifts. Initially, there were 5 of us. The head colleague went on a leave at the beginning of March 2024, and one colleague resigned last week and will work until the end of June 2024. The first thing they asked him was if he was going to a competing company. No, he is going into a different branch

So, there will be 3 of us remaining, and the employer is not making any effort to find someone new. Even when they do find someone, that person needs at least 6 months to start working independently. Now, it is almost mid-June, and I had the idea to ask for a raise again because they cannot afford to lose me. I was thinking of lying that I received a better offer from a competitor, with a salary of 1750 euros (which did not happen), and if my current employer is willing to match it, I would be happy to continue working there.

1dcr4et,"23F, Bachelors in Economics and finance, unsure what to do now - all opportunities seem very poorly paid and boring.","Background story: 
Straight out of high school I enrolled into computer science. I failed most of the subjects, couldn't focus, fell depressed. My parents pushed for me getting an economics degree and here I am now. 
At first I hated the idea but I quickly loved how well I did in it. 

Job experience:
Got a 7 month internship as an auditor in my second year due to good grades and a math competition I got a bronze medal in, but on the job itself I received a bunch of meaningless tasks. The office culture was sad and I didn't like any of my coworkers. 
The good thing is that I definitely know I don't want to be an accountant or do a masters related to obtaining ACCA or similar.

Dream ""job"":
I've always wanted to be an author but I'm afraid the market is too saturated, I'm not that good at writing and I'm worried I'll fall under depression again if I don't find something to do soon.

Initial plan:
High school was a smooth cruise and I thought I could do whatever I want, so my family and I agreed for me to do medicine to become a doctor. In my country you're supposed to do extra paid classes in chemistry or biology to pass the entrance exams, which they didn't agree to enroll me in AND I didn't study hard enough on my own, I felt it was a hopeless task. I never applied to med school and I may have come to terms with it. Studying for 10 more years under my parents' roof sounds like hell even though I love them, they are extremely religious, in a dysfunctional relationship and used to yell a lot (not anymore but it was very different when I was younger and I took that decision).

Immigration:
I am open to immigrate in another country in the EU, study master's there although I'm not sure what I want to study. 

My dream is to travel a bit, build a family, have my own house and not be embarrassed by my job because truthfully I am embarrassed for studying business, everyone kept telling me I could do better and it stinks. I'm not trying to be condescending to people who enjoy economics or the fields related, I enjoyed them somewhat, I just have personal issues I don't think I can deal with. 

What should be my next step?",CutAccomplished358,2,1.0,3,1718040310,2024-06-10 17:25:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dcr4et/23f_bachelors_in_economics_and_finance_unsure/,6,2024

I saw her work and it is an eyesore. She put some borders on all sides of the design even though a simple logo and company details at the top is enough. It even took her 3 hrs. I suggested she use Canva (i freelance and Canva is one of the easiest tools for designing). She won't listen.

A month ago, my boss asked me to do the letterhead. But because we are still transitioning (we are sharing office with a different department because our office isn't ready) plus so many works given to me, I couldn't give time to the letterhead since we won't be using it yet. Now that we officially moved to our office, I am ready made it. In fact, in just one hour I completed 4designs of the letterhead.

1dcowo6,Not in job long enough to apply internally?  Big jobs with big corporate policies.  ,"TLDR: Big company policy says I can't apply for new internal role in another division that I want really badly because I haven't been in my job more than 1.5 years (1 year so far), but if a ""business case"" existed, could be moved anyway (can be their choice, not mine).  I may reach-out to hiring manager and need help deciding if appropriate.  

I was at a giant company, 3 massive divisions for about 15 years, left for 1.5 years for a great startup opportunity that went sideways.  I was called back to the old giant company for a different role, pretty far removed from the make-the-thing part of the company, but in the same division.  Sr Director level roles here.  I'm back at giant company for about 1 year and really just hate the job, it just can't touch/feel the role.  It's all corporate this/that vs make the product better/faster/cheaper/more accessible and I'm drowning in ambiguity and fluff.  My manager is newish, very much a perception manager and you can tell is working on their resume, not our business.  Several at that level are those types.  

There's a position in another division that is right up my alley.  I'm considering reaching out, even though I'm not allowed to apply (less than 1.5 years in position, can't apply by policy).  The role is an obvious next step for the role I was when I left.  I was Sr Dir, this is Exec Dir (so many levels, ugh).  If my manager (VP) or their coworkers finds out, the perception of greatness they are trying to manage will be damaged and I don't think they'll take it well.  After 6 months back, 

I can't apply through our system, was thinking to ping the hiring manager and just say:   
""I'm from XYZ side of the business, I don't think we've ever met.  A job posting for the Exec Director of ABC that looks to be in your org was shared with me by a colleague, thinking I may be interested.  I joined the XYZ group \~1 year ago, formerly held progressive roles in ABC throughout XYZ to Sr Director position.  I think a policy (18 months in position) precludes me from formally applying for the position that was shared, but wanted to reach out to at least connect our internal networks.  I may share my resume via email just so to introduce myself.  We can connect briefly to network further if you have the time.""

1dcowdb,Quitting job whilst in training,"Hi folks. I’ve just started a job and I’m now just over a week into training - it’s a fun job. The team are lovely and all seem to enjoy what they do but I’m just not sure it’s a fit for me. There’s been a few red flags from the management side already.

1) when I interviewed for the job they said I’d hear back in 2 days. It wasn’t until a week later that I heard back after I had to email them personally to chase them up.

2) I accepted the job on the understanding that it was a schedule of 36 hours per week but in my first week I clocked 48 hours not getting home until 8pm having left my house at 6am most days.

3) I’ve had to ask for a contract twice already and yet neither myself nor my fellow trainee have received one. I don’t want to have to ask again.

3) We haven’t been getting our schedule until 8pm on the Sunday night and this week I only got told what I was doing for the next day. I still have no idea what I’m doing tomorrow or indeed the rest of the week. Feel like I shouldn’t have to chase them for a rota. This should’ve all been sorted for us starting. 

4) after realising the reality of the hours i emailed the manager to say that the full time position doesn’t suit me and requested part time instead on friday. They said they’d get back to me on the following Wednesday as they were on tour (the company is a tour company).

It’s frustrating as I left my last job because management were so disorganised and I never got a contract from them either. Getting a lot of dejavú and don’t want to deal with another company like this again.

How would you suggest I go about leaving the job? I’m still obviously waiting to hear back about the part time thing from the manager but I just don’t think it’s going to be worth it. I have another job anyway so I’m not desperate for the money and so far it’s just been more hassle than it’s worth. 

Any advice is helpful! Thanks in advance!",Zestyclose_Command56,0,0.5,0,1718034846,2024-06-10 15:54:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dcowdb/quitting_job_whilst_in_training/,6,2024
1dco9d8,Should I stay or look externally?,"I have been with my company for 8 years now. I had been in one department for 5 1/2 years. 7 months ago, I transitioned to a new team. It is not what I envisioned and it’s not a good fit for my mental health. I did want to note that I’m also expecting a baby and due this December. 

Recently, a position opened back up on my old team. I truly loved that role and only left as this transfer was seen as a good career move. I did apply to the opening on my old team and had a discussion with my current manager letting her know. Basically, because where we are at in terms of work load - I would be asked to stay on my current team until November.  However, if I were to go on maternity leave, I would realistically not be able to start on my old team until March 2025, once I return from leave. 

There’s definitely no guarantee that they would hold the opening for me that long and I highly doubt they would, understandably so. 

This role has affected my mental health and I have not been able to enjoy my pregnancy because of it and feel like I’m adding stress to this baby, which makes me feel even worse. 

What would you do in this situation? Can they legally make me stay in the role for another 6 months? If that is the case, do I need to look at leaving all together? 

TLDR: looking to transfer internally within the company, asked to stay another 6+ months. Should I look externally? ",Longjumping_Break114,1,1.0,0,1718033251,2024-06-10 15:27:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dco9d8/should_i_stay_or_look_externally/,6,2024
1dco4jx,Will I Get Fired If......,"I have a hybrid job for a corporation working 3 days in the branch and 2 at home.  My manager is remote and never knows if I am in the office or at home, and the people in the office never tell her if I am working from home (they've known me for years and there's been a few times I've just stayed home).  None of the work I do involves actually being in an office, the company just makes hybrid people go to a branch for whatever reason.

I am using 2 1/2 weeks of vacation and moving.  My manager/employer doesn't know.  My plan is to log on and work a couple days after I move, on the same time zone from where I am supposed to actually be.  After a couple days I'm going to give my 2 weeks notice.  This may result in me telling my manager I'm not at the branch anymore.  Not to get into a long moral discussion, but I am not going to directly lie but at the same time I am not going to reveal unnecessary information unless I have to.  

I am doing it this way because I want to use my vacation time to move AND I don't start my new position for like a couple months after I move.  Any working time after I move make a big difference. 

**So my basic questions are:**

1) Will I get fired or denied/revoked from using my vacation time (already approved) to move if I declare my intent ahead of time?

2) Will I be fired on the spot because I am not in the branch anymore afterwards?

Thanks.

1dcnyox,I have been getting late for work. How hard is it to try?,"* My shift is from ""10:30-7:30, Mon-Sat."" It has become impossible for me to get to work on time.
* It takes me half an hour to reach my workplace, so I need to leave before ""10,"" but I also need to have breakfast as I live alone and don’t get time to prep for breakfast.
* I leave from work around ""8"" at night, and it takes me about half an hour to get home. So, I’m only left with a couple of hours for myself, which is not enough because I feel like time passes faster after ""9."" It’s very hard to convince myself that this is life and I gotta follow the schedule even if I don’t get time for myself, but I am failing at it.
* Today, I got two hours late for work. FYI, I do extra hours whenever I go late. HR got very angry and asked me to give a solution from my side to end this, as it's a small business. My boss is involved in day-to-day activities as well, so he’s also kind of fed up with my behavior. Today, this is what he said:“This coming in late has gotten in the way of your work twice in the past two weeks, and honestly, I’m sure both you and I are tired of talking and hearing about this.Moving forward, this is what I suggest we implement in place. You punch in and punch out on the fingerprint machine every day. Work a shift anytime between ""10:30 to 9,"" e.g., ""10:30 to 7:00"" or ""12:30 to 9.""

1dcng01,Need advice on making a job change at my current company ,"I'm currently in my 6th year of working at my company (corporate finance) year 2 of being in a data quality/project role. I've been in finance for 21 years now and feeling a little stagnant in this role. Some of this comes from being under a manager who really doesn't manage or provide any sort of guidance but was appointed more out of ""seniority"". She openly admits she's a terrible manager, but does nothing to improve. Anyways, I have 2 issues that I'm conflicted on. The leader of our team reached out to my about a new role, got my hopes up, and then said the opportunity will not happen soon due to ""politics"" but that it will happen eventually. I was very disappointed, but as luck would have it, someone I worked with on a huge companywide project last year, reached out to me and recommended I apply for a role in the regulatory compliance team. This is not entirely out of my wheelhouse , but would be a move to a different area of the company and a new experience. I spoke with the manager of the team, who i know, off the record, last week and we had a great conversation. This opportunity would give me really good exposure within the company and I would work with many senior level managers and our global partners. My question is, is it inappropriate to ask the hiring manager if I could speak with the employee currently in the role (he's staying with the company, just moving to a different role within the team). And if I decide I want to persue the role, how is the best way to bring this up with my manager and the team lead?

1dcnb0r,Am I getting shafted?,"I first started working for (big corporation) in August 2022 as a T1 in a help desk position. Most of my work involves taking employee tech support calls and handling tickets on the side. The job is fully remote and pays well, and in that time I've received numerous commendations from coworkers, superiors, and my supervisor for the good work I'm doing. By all metrics, I am the strongest performer among my peers.

Earlier this year while helping one of my intermediate supervisors setup our softphone backend, he said he would start the paperwork to get me bumped up to a T2 position. Several months go by without much word, I send an email to my intermediate supervisor requesting an update, and he says it's still in progress and currently awaiting approval from the VP. A couple weeks later he says it's been approved and is now waiting for HR to process it.

Last week I asked my supervisor another update on the progess of it since another tech that was hired shortly before I was got promoted to T2 while I was still waiting on mine. My supervisor, confused, asks me for the email which said I was getting promoted (uh oh), which I forward to him. After talking with my other intermediate supervisors, he said that they should have come to him before recommending a promotion for me. He also said that promotions are typically submitted at the end of the year and processed by HR for the next year and very rarely do so outside of this schedule, so that after everything is done I will most likely not receive my promotion until about a year from now. He still made it clear to me that I am a top performer.

None of this makes sense to me so I wouldn't imagine it makes sense to you either. I keep telling myself that since it's a big corporation things are just this slow to process, but I find it bullshit that the other guy who joined only two weeks before me is now getting paid more for the same job.

I didn't pay much attention to her since she wasn't the type of person I would typically want to hang out with. But work is work, and I had no problem keeping things professional.

Fast forward to the present, I finally got team members in my local office. They started hanging out with that person. As stated, I didn't like her, but work is work, and I never commented on anything.

This week, for the first time in a year, this person and I have a project together. During an internal meeting, my mentor could sense tension between us. We didn't act unprofessionally, but he could feel something was going on.

He called me later and tried to convince me/tell me to be happy and cheerful while working with people even if I don't like them. He said I shouldn't ignore people and that I should play corporate politics if I want to succeed. He also mentioned he spoke with the other girl and told her the same thing. He said I would be doing him a favor if I tried to get along with her because he likes working with both of us. I said I would think about it.

I just hate corporate politics, the fact that my team members gossip about me,  and even after all of this I have no problem keeping things professional and helping someone when asked. However, don't expect me to participate in activities like ass kissing, team dinners/ events. I do my work, and I go home and live my life.

1dcle2w,Should I ask for a remote option or fly back?,"Should I ask for a remote option or fly back?

TL;DR just received a job offer while on vacation. 

Ok as the title suggests I just received a job offer while on vacation from a well acclaimed company - just for some context I applied for the position in March. 

The position is in person in a capital city in Atlantic Canada. Im based in a neighbouring city of the province. And am currently visiting my family in MENA, my original plan was to stay with my family for four months since I couldn’t bag an internship. 

Now that I have a job offer - should I end my vacation early? Or request a remote option? 

Im an international student - with decent experience. Experience with this organization will help accelerate my growth immensely

1dclcag,What to do after gradauting?,"Hi,

I'm graduating from university this year and I'm completely lost about what to do next. My undergrad was in Biology, but I don't want to stay in this field. I'm not interested in working as a researcher or pursuing a PhD. I've always been indecisive about my career path, which is why I chose such a broad subject to study. I thought a STEM degree would give me a lot of options, which it does, but I think I still need a master's or something more specific to strengthen my qualifications.

I'm considering enrolling in a Data Science or Data Science and AI master's program because graduate schemes in these disciplines seem to offer better opportunities. On the other hand, I'm thinking about applying for dentistry, but I'm unsure since I'm now 22 and would be 27 by the time I graduate (not considering potential setbacks). However, the stability of a career in dentistry is very appealing.

A lot of people tell me to follow my interests, but I'm not passionate about any specific field. I just want a good career that offers progression and rewards for hard work, as I am a hard worker. I also considered a law conversion course, but living in the UK, it would be difficult to move to another country in the future since I would only know UK law. Additionally, I have friends who studied law and they talk about how competitive it is to even get an internship.

Even though I did better at university and am predicted to receive a first, I'm worried about my A-level results (BCC), which were affected by personal struggles. I'm unsure if these will impact my applications for graduate schemes. I'd like to apply for a tech job at one of the Big 4, but I'm concerned this might be too ambitious.

Any input or help from someone who has experienced this would be much appreciated! Any general advice is more than welcome too :)",Able_Sheepherder8597,1,1.0,1,1718025602,2024-06-10 13:20:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dclcag/what_to_do_after_gradauting/,6,2024

1dckiho,How to avoid ghost jobs online? ,"So, my current job is not really working out. The management has been going through a lot of turnover and there has been no stability there since December. They have recently decided to ignore my agreed upon hours, and now I am struggling to cover shifts I don't want. I am over it. I'm trying to find something online, but I am running into a TON of ghost jobs. 

They seem to be everywhere. Just off Google, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, and LinkedIn all seem to be just packed full of fake job listings. I have called 3 businesses just this week who have flat out told me that the positions are not actually open. Not that they have hired someone, but that they weren't hiring in the first place. I feel like this is just a method to get more resumes on file or maybe to manufacture growth?

1dcke71,"Preparing for a meeting with a new boss? advice, tips, etc!","Hi everyone! I work at a post secondary school within the Registrar’s Office. I am a “coordinator” but I’m basically one of the lowest positions in the office, I deal with student transcripts and withdrawals and a bunch of misc tasks, answer phones etc. 

My bosses boss has recently left and we’ve just gotten a new person in their role. He’s been here about two weeks, and last week he went to every person in the office asking what our workload was like and if we’d be able to find about 30 minutes to meet with him next week (now this week) but didn’t give any indication of what it’s pertaining to. 

My assumption (I know what they say about making assumptions 😅) is that it could be a general “get to know each other” in a professional sense, asking about workload, things that are going good and bad etc. He’s been pretty good so far about checking in with staff, asking if we’re managing okay or if we need support, etc. 

There’s a lot of tension from being understaffed and everyone is stressed, plus a lot of personality conflicts within my direct team. I don’t want to go into this meeting and just complain that we aren’t getting along (but it’s at the point of it effecting our work etc) so I’m just trying to prepare as best I can. 

My husband said he would sit down with me this week and we could talk and I can bounce ideas off of him. I also want to grow my career (I’m 25F, been in my role for 2.5 years, of which 1 year was maternity leave, and I make 44k CAD) and I want to express my desire to grow my career but don’t quite know how to do so. We are unionized so we can’t negotiate pay or tasks with management and it just gets negotiated every few years with the union contract.

1dcj6cu,First time in my career I feel totally demoralised,"I got a job a couple of years ago, and it was what I thought would be a dream job. It’s coming up to 20 months now, and it feels so far from it, it hurts.

I am head of social media for a large non-profit, and really feel like I am not only in the minority, but I actively feel as if I am dumb every day I go into work. I am a guy in his 40s who has done mostly well everywhere I have gone, I have been made redundant a couple of times, but that’s par for the course these days, and neither time was in any relation to my performance.

In this new job, I’m the head of social, and I manage a high performing team. I support them, offer leadership and guidance, and try to clear roadblocks with them. It’s a convoluted organisation with multiple programmes going on across multiple levels. We also have an editorial staff. It’s also a chaotic job where a lot of ‘clear your desk for the day, this is a priority’ work comes in, and then is forgotten tomorrow, and no quarter is given for the time it’s taken to do that thing, just ‘you’re behind on X project now - why?’

My boss who hired me, comes from a science background - their first instinct is to question and critique anything somebody does - she is a question asker and note taker - which is not in itself a bad thing, but she is very critical of my work, and always has receipts. I’m human, so I make minor slip-ups at times. they expect zero slip-ups and total robotic perfection. Whenever there is a minor issue within the team, she zeroes in on it, and keeps asking why until essentially she gets to the answer that I’m not good enough. But I am paying attention. I am trying my best. I take more notes than I ever have in my whole life, I engage more with meetings than I ever have in my whole life. I try really hard, and whenever I try to be positive, start the day with mindfulness, they’ll bring up something minor from 4 months ago, such as a login approval for somebody, which isn’t hugely important, and makes it a 4 paragraph epic about how somebody needs to take responsibility for this.

they also make really exaggerated faces in meetings when I am speaking. they do it to a lot of people, whenever they say something she thinks is dumb. I used to be a confident public speaker. Now I’ve lost confidence in my own voice. My wife has said the light has gone out in my eyes. 

I feel like a lonely, isolated person at work. They are well-liked, and gets achievement awards and recognition. I feel like people think I’m a thick.

We work remotely most of the time. When they come into the office, they ignore me for the most part, unless it’s work related. they to my team once a month, and whilst I ask my team how I can support them, they always come back with a way that I am failing as a manager.

I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2016, and have been managing it effectively. They have got occupational health in to support me at work, but I feel like the way my manager talks to me, being nice to me, and then making me feel like I’m not doing well enough, is starting to wreck my career confidence.

I am the main breadwinner. I can’t quit. We need to buy a house so I need to stick in this job. But I really do feel like I’m at the end of my rope from a mental health perspective. 

Just looking for some empathy and guidance. I know I sound like a dummy.

1dcj54b,Young and just trying to make the best of what I have,"I'm 21 and working full-time in the trades. I got into a union and everythings supposed to be great. However I have a 2-3 hour commute to and from my job and it's been sucking the life out of me since I got in and I've more or less been been trying to put off these feelings I've had for a long time so that I can ""get that bag"". The work-life culture is meh at best (typical of the construction scene) and the commute itself is costing me all the money I'm working for (I have to pay 400$/month for a train ticket and gas is usually between 50- 60$/week). However everyone in my life is telling me this is worth it and to stick through. I also have the issue of me and my partner coming from poor financial situations and sometimes I feel as though this our only shot out. I want to believe I can quit and try college and climb my way up the ranks of another field but I'm worried I've already sunk too much time into this. As a whole this whole situation is creating a lot of stress for me and my loved ones and all I know for sure is that I need to figure something out.

1dchvct,Trying to find a job after taking a 6 month break to take care of nicu twins,"I've recently been trying my best to find a job after 6 month of unemployment. I was let go last April due to a very difficult pregnancy which caused me to miss work. They brought me back in August as a contractor to help save a project but I already got a job with my older company as a temp until hire. So I decided to do both jobs I just asked to be remote due to my pregnancy. One was it and the other was project management. 
The stress from both caused me to go into early labor in September and babies were admitted to 2 seperate Nicus due to their issues. I tried to work both jobs while visiting both nicus and breastfeeding both. It was hard as he'll. They left the nicu in December one on oxygen and the other on a feeding tube. 
For six moths I've been weening the twins off of their dependencies, taking them to their surgeries and appointments, taking them to see doctors, specialists, and therapy. Now that everything has calmed down, I'm ready to work.

1dchuko,Extreme anxiety during internal meetings,"I’ve recently moved from a small start-up company to a medium sized corporate company. Within days of starting, I realised I’m very out of my depth but it’s been 3 months now and most days I feel I’m settling in quite well.

Unfortunately, I have sudden anxiety during internal meetings. I can’t pinpoint where this has come from, and I never had this issue in my previous job, most likely because we didn’t do group online meetings. In fact I was very confident in my last job and basically kept the ship sailing for the company. I excelled in client meetings and had no issue speaking with the board.

Now I’m not amazing in current client meetings, I’m confident and I think I do quite well for what I know, but it’s nothing like in my previous job. The real issue is with internal meetings, in particular group calls to discuss any updates. For some reason I just crumble… I get a dry throat, my hands are cold and sweaty, my heart is pounding. I tell myself I know these people now, I have normal conversations with them on a daily basis, but I can’t for the life of me stay calm during these calls. I feel like I do better in person, but over Teams/Zoom I feel a failure. It probably doesn’t help that my turn is last, and I have to wait until  everyone has spoke to say my piece.

I’m worried they begin realising I’m useless in these meetings and that they think this is going to affect my client meetings. Best thing for me to do is to record these meetings as proof that I’m not an anxious idiot.

I’m only 24 and I know I have years to learn and become confident, but everyone else seems to be find it easy. I literally write out what I want to say during meetings and read it out in a casual way, in order to avoid messing up. This morning I literally panicked and ended up forgetting what I was saying, whereas last week’s meeting started with terrible anxiety but I ended up doing okay.

What do I do?! If I struggle with every internal group meeting then I can’t see myself being able to continue working.

1dcht7x,Ghosted by employer ,"I have been working at a horse farm for a few months now. A few weeks ago the owner accused me of not coming into work for a day, in which I was in fact at work. They insist they “didn’t see me” but I was literally there. I sent them a screen recording of my life 360 location history for the day and they still didn’t seem to believe it. Now, I had to take 2 days off because my dad was in the hospital from heart complications scheduled in for open heart surgery. I texted my boss twice to let her know I had to take time off. No reply. I planned to go into work today as normal, but when I was telling my dad they ignored me he said it would be best I text them to confirm they want me back. I didn’t even think of reaching out again as in my eyes I still had my job? Anyways, I texted to let them know all is well and I’ll be back at work. No response. Come to find out she blocked me on Facebook and posted looking for help. I can attach screenshots for anyone needing receipts. But I find this situation extremely odd and don’t know what to do.

1dcgh6l,Someone in my team got fired. Wanting to take on his job for more compensation?,"Hi everyone - wondering if you could weigh in on if this is a good idea, and if so, how to word it please.

I'm in the marketing team. On Friday, about twenty minutes before I left, our manager posted this in the team Slack: ""Due to restructuring in the marketing and customer support teams, X is no longer with the business. The majority of his workload will revert back to Y's team, while any projects in marketing will be redistributed.""

I'm not surprised and pretty relieved to be honest, because X wasn't great at his job and there was some friction. The company is undergoing some shifts in how we do things, definitely for the better, but there's a lot of restructuring and rethinking going on.

I'm very experienced in my current role (8+ years) and frankly, can do it with my eyes closed. I'm very keen to move up the ladder and upskill for more pay. There's talk of implementing new tech soon that I'm dabbling in my spare time to become an SME - until then, I have this opportunity.

I want to take on X's responsibilities for a bump in pay and a new title (he had ""manager"" in his title, I don't, even though we're the same level. Simply because titles seem to have been arbitrarily handed out at the start - it's not great, another thing that needs to change).

Does this sound like something I could ask for, or when my manager says ""redistributed"" does this typically mean everyone picks up the slack until a new X is hired? I know no one here is a mind reader, but would appreciate if your team's gone through something similar.

Also, any advice on how to word such a request would be great: basically, I want to take on all of X's responsibilities across marketing and customer success and thus become a manager, and save the company money by them only paying me half his salary on top of my own existing (and negotiate down).

1dcf63k,Burnt out hard at a stressful startup and thinking of quitting without a plan - mistake or necessary move?,"I left a toxic job that I stayed at for 6 years (too long) under an abusive and wildly inappropriate manager. I eventually filed an HR report, requested to switch teams, and took a hit to my career trajectory to get out from under that piece of work.

I burnt out so hard at that job that I was ready to leave my industry entirely and figure out a different career. My mental and physical health took a massive hit, including a hospitalization for chest pain which was a big wake-up call.

So when this apparent unicorn of a startup contacted me, I leapt at the opportunity. It almost sounded too good to be true and an almost perfect fit for what I was looking for. And I was desperate to escape my last job after what happened with my previous manager.

Until almost immediately the breakneck pace and unrealistic expectations, completely insane amounts of meetings, overwhelming workload, frustratingly nonsensical direction/approach, and questionable new hires started occurring.

After only 3 months of this I can't do it anymore. I have very little remaining threshold for BS now.

What I was told in the interviews vs what my experience is feeling like does not line up either. I started hearing similar complaints from coworkers. I can't trust a word my boss says because he likes to assign teleporting goalposts, I question why I was even hired most days, and I'm no longer as excited or as invested. Honeymoon period over.

I feel like any honest feedback I have turns into me being made to feel like I'm incapable of handling difficult situations (like my boss switching up what he says constantly but never acknowledges it when called out), like I'm not a team player, and I should reframe my thinking because I'm not understanding the situation and everyone's pure intentions properly. 

After each of these mindfuck meetings that the CEO initated when they noticed me ""seeming down lately"", I feel like maybe I am the problem and spend days reeling and questioning my gut feelings all over again. The people do seem wonderful outside of my immediate team. For additional context, I am the only woman on my team, only person of my race at the company. The other teams are more balanced in that regard but mine is very isolating for me.

So the extreme burnout is settling in again and my health is starting to tank badly, and it was already on thin ice to begin with. I will be taking this next week off in a desperate attempt to recover and buy time. I'm barely getting anything done anyway and can't concentrate through the insane brain fog. I'm constantly rushing through everything and producing lackluster work. My confidence is completely deflated and I dread going back. I'm so tired of this.

I want to quit now. I have one lead that may or may not pan out for a different job, but I want to just quit without a plan and then when I can breathe again, figure out a different career path asap. I have a few ideas in mind, but nothing settled because I can barely think straight enough to figure this all out.

I have about 6mo worth of savings to live off of, 8 tops but that would mean burning through most of my money. I don't have a partner to support me or family to stay with. I'd be 100% on my own.

What would you do? Did quitting without a plan work out for you in the end or was it a huge mistake? I feel like I have to choose between risking homelessness or irreparable damage to my mental/physical health. I'm not sure if I'm seeing clearly here.

1dcegm1,Hate my temporary job. ,"Hi everyone! Basically, I’m on a cross country move with some friends and one of them wasn’t interested in immediately finding a lease (for a pretty valid reason that I won’t go into.) 

The only thing about this plan was that our other roommate and I didn’t really want to spend money on temporary housing. 
From now until early August, I’m staying with a friend who also gave me a job to keep my savings up between leases, which I’ll start by saying I’m very thankful for and don’t know what I would have done otherwise. 

The caveat is that I hate this job. I worked in restaurants for 6 years, which changed in late 2022 when I started a different career that I’ve enjoyed much more so far. Sadly, my friend is a kitchen manager, so I’m temporarily working for a restaurant. 

I didn’t realize how gnarly this work would really make me feel now that I haven’t done it in awhile, but now I do truly remember now how much I hated dealing with the BS that is always present in a kitchen and I’m finding myself dreading doing this. I’ve given it a pretty fair chance since I started at the beginning of this month, but I’m still pretty sour on it and not very happy. 

So my question is: since there’s not really a way for me to just leave so soon, how can I cope with the dread of showing up to a temporary job that I just simply don’t jive with? 
I’m not giving up on the thought that it’ll get better at some point, but I’m having a pretty hard time with this and would love to know how other people have survived crappy professional arrangements. I’ve been keeping my head down and just doing it, but I’d even be interested to know if there’s a way I can find some silver lining as I trudge through.

1dcecij,I need honest career advice PLEASE,"I’m in my last year of uni (btech cse).
Let me lay down everything for you guys. I don’t have any particular goals regarding a particular career in life, rather I have goals for the type of lifestyle I want to live. I am VERY creative and I’m excellent in communication. I can be a very good marketing person, I’m great at public speaking and also great at diplomacy and political affairs. I’m good at studies. I don’t have any particular subject I’m good at I’m just good at studying. So here is where my dilemma starts. 
1. My family wants me to move to the USA, the typical south Asian  in USA lifestyle, but the thing is my sister has a job in America and is not just working on projects. And she is excellent at what she does and she knows I’m good at studies so she has already started talking to her managers about me and “getting me employed” in her company. It is very tempting because I have a job waiting for me on a silver platter that I need not put as much efforts to get.(ofc I have to put in efforts to sustain it but ykwim). But the thing is I hate that life, I hate how South Asians are providing cheap white collar labour in America and I don’t see myself liking the typical “we’ll buy a house here our kids will grow up here” life style. It icks me it’s not for me. 
2. I want to pursue a fashion management degree from Europe or any other country. That lifestyle does draw me towards it. 
3. I also want to start my own business and have my startup, grow it into something big. 
4. I am also being attracted towards a degree in international politics. 

Another thing is, my bf who is done with his bachelors is insisting on appearing for civil services exams. I know it’s a long shot but I want to be supportive of it. I want us to go out for studying or working, and build a life from scratch. I want to travel the world and do something impactful. Also want to get married early, it all seems too chaotic right now so I desperately need some advice. It can be on anything. Any of my career options or just life advice.

1dcead9,A difficult boss and a difficult colleague: what would you do?,"I’m currently one of the two grads/juniors at my workplace, working under a partnership business in my profession. Boss 1 is absolutely incredible: friendly, respectable, a top notch mentor, very professional and business-minded. I couldn’t be more lucky to have such a great mentor. However, Boss 2 is the complete opposite… to the point he almost ran the business into the ground losing all his employees until Boss 1 entered the picture and saved it. 

Boss 2 is terrible and a slob. He deliberately avoids training me despite being very knowledgeable and me taking a very humble/proactive approach towards him. I think I make him insecure (he always takes jabs at my good grades and experience). I tried EVERYTHING to get him to sign off / check my completed work for him (reminders, emails, post it notes, booking a meeting, asking colleagues to remind him, chasing him down the corridor, etc), but once we reach the deadline and clients are angry he will BLAME ME. In performance reviews, he claims I never take initiative which is a complete lie and lack of accountability on his end.

Boss 2 also has clear favouritism for the other grad and their relationship is borderline unprofessional despite the 40 year age gap between them. This other grad has 0 boundaries with objectively lower skills than me, yet gets treated like a princess. She has steamrolled me by stealing work/clients assigned to me to take credit for it, acted unprofessionally to our clients, been completely insubordinate to Boss 1 and kisses Boss 2’s feet to compensate for her complete lack of skills/development. Boss 1 has called her up on it multiple times, but this is often vetoed by Boss 1 who ends up REWARDING her (she now earns more than me). 

Promotion time is in a month. 90% of the office thinks it would be crazy for them to promote the other grad over me. I’m confident too, except the other grad is fully convinced she’ll get it despite not having the skills and I’m worried she might have a chance given Boss 1 blindly favours her and clearly dislikes me. She is also older than me.

Boss 1 reassures me that I’m progressing really well. He repeatedly reminds me of how invaluable I am and insists there are long term plans for me. Boss 2 won’t be around forever, as he’s very old and sick (he had weekly hospital visits these days) meaning the business is undergoing a lot of change. 

But is that change going to come around soon? Are they just trying to dangle the carrot in front of me?

I’m wondering if it’s worth staying. The job market in my profession is woeful- they call it the hunger games these days and my cohort say I should be more grateful to have this job since majority of them are still unemployed post-graduation. 

What would you make of this situation?

Hi all, thanks for looking at this thread, really looking some help here. I’m an junior investment banking associate worked in the healthcare coverage group. My day to day including making financial models and drawing PPT and doing business analysis for healthcare companies to engage in merger acquisition and capital raising. 

Lately my physical condition is bad and I’m tired of the job security at private sector so really looking to break into the public sector as a stable career to feed my family. 

 But I don’t know with my skill set what are some good jobs that fit me. Ideally I hope to work at a position with good career advancement opportunity and something maybe a little bit interesting. I know the salary drop is going to be big, but maybe any position has relatively higher compensation? I don’t know maybe close to the financial market? I know nothing about the public sector, any recommendations any jobs referral would be extremely helpful. Thank you so much

1dccgob,I think I was quiet hired and/or dry promoted ,"I think I was quiet hired and quiet promoted. Help. 

I think I was quite hired and promoted…what leverage do I have?

About 3 months ago, I started a new job at a new company. I was at my prior company for almost 10 years, and leaving wasn’t a decision I took lightly.  

My new job has some perks namely being fully remote. I have to travel about 1x per month though so that’s tough. It was supposed to only be 1x per quarter at most. 

This was a promotion from my last job, but after the bonus at my new company not being a great program, I’ll probably break even in total comp between my new and old job. 

Within my first month at the company, I found out my boss was being demoted and they were hiring a new head of the area. This person hasn’t been hired yet. This was tough because I really liked my boss and of course I accepted a job where I liked the person I would be working for. I found out I would be reporting directly to the President of the company. The job increased in responsibility with this move. 

The company underwent a large compensation adjustment last week. I found out that my title will be changed from AVP to VP without a salary adjustment because with the salary I was offered and hired at I “should have been brought in at the VP level only”. The issue is when I was contemplating and negotiating salary and benefits it was for an AVP position.  Obviously I would have negotiated more for a VP level of responsibility. It just feels weird. 

Do I have any leverage? I feel like I haven’t been able to show my full value in just three months. What would you do? Please help. 

Here are my options, but I’m sure there’s more: 

1. try to get more money and lay out the increased responsibility argument. 

2. try to get a better bonus (allegedly I am supposed to be getting a better bonus program anyways because I started this year but have NO DETAILS….it’s frustrating)

3. Try to get more PTO or something???

4. Cut my losses and find a new job at a company that won’t do this. My current salary is well within the range for an AVP position in my career that is posted

1dcb9m6,"Great job offer, 40% salary increase - with some worrying negatives","So I have been in my current job for 6 months (with previous history of job hopping \~every 1.8 years). I am not happy at my current job and have found it hard to integrate. I am fully remote and most people at this job have been around for decades and have strong networks that I can't penetrate. So I have had some undesirable effects as a result (on the top of feeling isolated). I manage a team and my strongest team members are being poached by other teams. Replacements I get are far weaker. I don't have much say in these decisions, it happens behind the scenes. Whenever I have expressed interest in attending a conference for example, I have been told by my manager ""Sorry but James get the first choice, he has been here for 15 years and he never gets to do those things"". This rubs up the wrong way, as in, I will never get perks unless I have been in the company for at least a decade. Previous manager is still around, just managing another team and seems to have kept the perks of my role to himself (with approval of senior management) and handed over less desirable aspects to me. Perks include higher profile projects and international projects that come with first class international travel/flights. I have never even flown business class in my life, so I would have loved to do that. I have asked my manager if I can be involved in those projects and got a wishy-washy answer that never eventuated.

Despite this, I have decided to stick with my current job for a few years because I was a bit burnt out from all the job hopping. The job is secure and stable, even though salary is below the market. While there are negatives, nobody is actively stressing me out. Senior management is at least polite. I do feel increasing dullness and lack of motivation but maybe I just need to try harder. The setup also feels like any career progression will be difficult for me.

Out of the blue, a contact that I have vaguely known for the last few years contacted me and said that they have a role in their company where I would be the perfect fit. I didn't realize that he got promoted multiple times in that company and now has a lot of influence. The role is in the exact niche area that I wanted to work in for years and this is exciting. It has a vibrant office headquartered in my city and this is important to me. I live alone and hate WFH and find it depressing. So after a few interviews with the hiring manager that felt like fun chats, I was offered the position. When I gave them the salary range I was after, they actually offered me the top of my range, which is over 40% increase to what I am now making (not counting a bonus which I don't even get in my current company). Through this process, they have treated me so well, which to me at least points out to this role is important to the company.

This is all good right? But......both hiring manager and my contact briefly told me that there are some issues between the team and senior management, and there is this ""them against us"" attitude. By doing some Linkedin stalking, I have noticed that when the previous manager resigned, another team member also resigned. Yet another team member moved internally. Others have suspiciously updated their LinkedIn profiles. Resigned team members are definitely being replaced but it does point out to some undesirable politics. I spoke to the previous manager that left and he told me that he dislikes senior management, they have impossible/unrealistic expectations, the team is overworked and in general he found the role challenging. I would now have an additional challenge of leading a (mostly) new team because it seems like everyone else in that team is resigning or about to resign.

So now I don't know what to do. If I had a good situation in my current job, I would likely stay despite the low salary. There is no chance for a higher salary at my current company. When I started it was a big struggle to even get to the salary I am on. I also only have 6 months of mostly average performance so I have no leverage. The budget is also not looking favoravable. I would also prefer the type of work that the new company does. But all the negative politics seriously scare me. Maybe it's crazy to take this risk?

1dc9ct3,Resigning with less than two weeks notice,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently employed in the tech industry at a startup with around 50 employees. Recently, I was offered a position at a larger company, which I've accepted. However, this offer is contingent on a background check, which has been underway for about four weeks now. The company advised me to wait until I receive confirmation that the check is complete before informing my current employer.

The background check, conducted by a third-party company called Hire Right, was finished three weeks ago, but I'm still awaiting confirmation from the new employer. I've reached out for updates, but haven't received a definitive timeline.

My new start date is in two weeks, and I'm expected to finish with my current employer the Friday before. Being on a visa, it's crucial for me to avoid any gaps in employment. 

Traditionally, a two-week notice is given before leaving a job, which would start tomorrow. However, without confirmation of the background check, it feels risky to notify my current employer prematurely. I value my current workplace and want to leave on good terms.

I'm unsure about the best course of action. Should I inform my current employer tomorrow as planned, or wait until I receive confirmation of the background check?

1dc8oy1,Not sure what to do,"So to preface I’ve been looking into cosmetology school because it’s been a dream  and passion of mine to do hair and nails for my whole life. But of course there’s a lot of downsides to it and the industry in general. It’s a 20k school and a ton of work of course. That’s not the problem though, for me it’s the fact I probably won’t be able to have a job while in school. And after school I’ll probably have a no benefits, back breaking, internship position at a salon paying them half of what I’ll make for who knows how long until I build enough clientele to rent my own booth. So I’m like is that even worth it??? All my friends are like “believe in yourself!!” And think cosmo school and what I want to do is just some walk in the park. It’s really not and I know I could do it but the risk honestly outweighs the reward. I am scared it’ll ruin my passion and I will burn out within the 5 year mark that most do. So here I am 23 and wondering what I should do. Be broke and in school to hopefully have a good career some day and possibly not. Or work a job and have benefits, I’ve been thinking of bud tending since I have my permit for it and they make tips while not being around food which is perfect. But telling my friends that I’m not going to go to cosmo school is going to suck I just hope I’m not making the wrong decision and will regret this.

1dc8c3o,How do I get into healthcare business and walk away from patient care?,"Hi, I am a 24 year old graduating with a Health Science degree this fall. I was formerly in a nursing program before I took a two year gap.

I want to walk away from patient care in general because I don't think I'm going to be able to sustain myself right away when I graduate.

I initially wanted to go into PA, PT, or OT, but I will have to go back into school for certain pre-reqs. like Orgo and Biochem (not to mention shadowing requirements). Healthcare administration seems like the best bet for me, but I do not know anything about business related subjects like insurance, policy-making etc. Regardless, I think I would be more happy in a business related field than patient care.

Do you guys have any advice regarding anything? What jobs to look for during my final semester? The problem is, I don't even know what to ask, I just feel like I stuck out in healthcare because of sunk-time fallacy.",XxTripleGoldxX,3,1.0,4,1717978358,2024-06-10 00:12:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dc8c3o/how_do_i_get_into_healthcare_business_and_walk/,6,2024
1dc7gf2,Career Relocation Golden Handcuffs ,"I have an opportunity to relocate to Las Vegas for work from Arizona. I have been with the company for 17 years and plan to retire with a pension. My current situation seems like golden handcuffs. I have had initial conversations about salary, which would increase by 10%. There is a standard relocation package: two months of salary, moving costs, a house-finding trip, 30 days of hotel, moving all my stuff, etc.

My wife and I currently own a home that is like none other for the money. RV Garage with another two-car garage. Full A/C shop worth of tools and equipment to make anything. Beautiful 3K SF home, pool, infrared sauna, office, an oasis of a yard, etc. Of course, this has a low-interest rate and has more than tripled in price since we closed in 2017. Neighbors' homes are listing and selling above $1.5 million. 

I am having some serious issues knowing that I want to continue to grow in my role with my organization. However, the house is worth 10 times my salary, and I wonder if my new salary is even worth it. I know that I will be able to grow when I move to our corporate office, meaning more opportunity and money; I just can't seem to put the numbers together and convince my wife that this is possible. BTW, she has to relocate her business too, and the Vegas housing market is more expensive, and the rates are going to make buying more expensive. 

Do we just hang tight and live life here? I need some solid perspectives. 

TLDR; House is worth a lot and I want to move for the opportunity but the salary is meh and we are comfortable here but the opportunity is good..",Goingboldlyalone,1,1.0,8,1717975772,2024-06-09 23:29:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dc7gf2/career_relocation_golden_handcuffs/,6,2024
1dc6p53,Too many options and no clarity,"Hello, I will try to keep the point of this post simple. 

I work for a large international manufacturing company in the central US. I started as a factory worker with a HS diploma and worked my way to being an expert in the facility and a leader at multiple levels with excellent reviews. During my time at entry level, lower supervision, and operations superintendent, I worked on my associate's degree through the local community college paid for by my employer. During my Operations Superintendent role, my TMOD manager came to me with an opportunity for a new position in a training development/HR role. After mulling back and forth on the idea of moving to HR, which I never found appealing, he sold me on a few practical points. For me to continue my rise through the company, I needed to check some boxes.



Complete a bachelor's degree

10 plus years of company management experience. Checked

A cross-functional move or foreign assignment of two years.



I was next in line for multiple promotions that were on 2 years or less timelines and would be making 100k plus in a year from now. That quick path would have been my ceiling until I checked the previously mentioned boxes. This was nearly impossible with the workload and lack of opportunities for lateral moves at that level. So came his offer: take this position that the company desperately needs and that I am solely qualified for and, over the next 3-5 years, will check the remaining two boxes to raise my ceiling to the corporate/executive level. While in this cross-functional lateral role, I would see those I worked next to and mentored move into the roles I was groomed for. I jumped to this role regardless, and it has been a very rough journey with a lot of imposter syndrome on my side. My goals in this new assignment have not been clear or motivating. A bright side is my reputation in the company seems to be rock solid but different than I had perceived and I am still seen as a good leader with high potential. I have had many candid and honest conversations with my manager, but our styles of communication and leadership are vastly different. We only 5 years apart in age but he has his whole career in HR with a MBA as of last year.

  
I feel I have made a decision that has put my future career path in jeopardy and raised more questions about what I want and what the company plans for me. 

  
Currently the only development goal I have been given by my manager is the complete my bachelors and I just completed two community college associate's at the beginning of May. My other two work related goals seem like fodder to keep me busy with meaningless work. He just pulled me in to tell me if I don't meet them its no big deal or reflection on me.

I am currently enrolled in an online management degree program at a fairly respectable regional university, and my company is paying for it. They are also considering paying for my Masters depending on maintaining my high potential rating. 

My concerns are this. I feel I had carrots dangled to get me in my current position where I feel trapped.

I was promised development opportunities within the organization to develop leadership and he now has hired outside contractor to do this without giving me an opportunity. 

He promised training and access to computer systems that would develop my creative skills in program and training design, and this has been dangled in front of me while my peers actually receive it. Each time I ask I am gaslit with a different answer. 

I am currently performing functions of positions multiple salary grades higher than my own and functions that have never existed before that I created and developed successfully. 

I brought up my plans to major in management and I don't get a clear answer as to if that is a good path for me when before this role that was clear.

My performance reviews are all rated as exceptional, but my potential rating for promotions was knocked down, supposedly to protect me from internal poaching. This feels like gaslighting

I am not arguing that my salary is not generous as it has gone from $55,800 in 2019 to 90,000 with guaranteed bonus this year. 

I feel either I have a ego issue (which don't we all) and a horrible case of imposter syndrome or I am being secretly pigeon holed and career gas lit. 

Has anyone experienced this or do I just need to hear a suck it up buttercup and move on?

1dc63s0,Considering a Career Change,"Hey guys, this is my first ever post on Reddit because I could use some advice. I'm 23(f) and considering starting a new career. I have a bachelor's degree in Construction Management and Architecture (with a focus on architecture) and started my master's of architecture. I got one semester in before realizing my BS was.. well... BS and had nothing to do with my actual career. Most of the current and recently graduated students seemed unfulfilled in their careers and many of my old classmates have already switched fields. I realized architects are underpaid and overworked. I didn't want to spend my life looking at a computer all day with limited time off. The thought of working a typical 9-5 job depressed me. I started looking into other jobs and decided to become a flight attendant! I knew it didn't pay well starting out, but with time I'd be able to make more money. I like being able to travel for work and the flight benefits, plus getting a flexible schedule with several days off a month. Welp, I've been doing that for about a year now, and honestly? I'm exhausted. There are days when I love my job and days when I hate it. Dealing with delays, a 4:30 am showtime one day and a 5 pm showtime the next. Plus I have a long-distance boyfriend that I fly to see on my off days, so I'm basically living out of my suitcase 24/7. I dreaded the idea of a 9-5 but now I'm wanting to work someplace more consistent. 

  
I would love some ideas for a new career. I've considered becoming a real estate agent but I know its very competitive, a lot of fees starting out, and not very consistent. I've also considered being a dental assistant but I looked at a Reddit thread and a lot of the commenters said that they were unhappy in their field. I would love a career with benefits and decent pay that won't require more than a year or two of additional schooling because frankly, I'm burnt out. I also genuinely enjoy interacting with people and I don't want an office job where I'm staring at a computer or doing paperwork all day. I want to be able to go to work each day and know more or less what to expect, but not so repetitive that I grow bored. Honestly, I'm worried that I'm being too picky with what I'm looking for, but I want to be fulfilled in my career.

I’m ending my third year of teaching in a MCOL area at a T1 high school. I love the breaks and the flexibility that I get within the school I work at (principal was my teacher in high school) but my goal was always to go to law school. I only went into teaching because I was pregnant with my son and I wanted stability. Fast forward 3 years later and I honestly love it! I love to learn and I love to share that with the students. I’m even working with admin behind the scenes on different projects around the school.

I see my peers fulfilling their goals they set out and think back on my own life and think I’m selling myself short by not going to law school.

1dc4ti7,"Franchise to Corporate transition, and how to approach it?","Hey everyone, I've got a situation that I don't know how to handle, and would love some advice:

1. I work for a franchisee of a large, recognizable US brand (think McDonald's, or Subway, but not them).

2. The franchisee I work for is one of the top franchisees in this company, worldwide, with multiple locations and generally being viewed as one of the gold standards.

3. The store that I manage, specifically, is one of the highest performing stores in the entire company, largely because of the hard work me and my staff have put in over the last several years.

4. My store is consistently held up as an example of how to run a successful location; getting shout outs during company wide meetings and newsletters, etc.

5. One of the corporate VPs (there are several), approached me at our yearly conference last month, and basically said ""Just want to let you know that we recognize how good of a job you're doing, and we want to get you more involved.""

Recently, some circumstances have changed in my personal life, where family obligations, such as my aging parents and partner's career change, have made it almost 100% likely that we will need to move, and somewhat fast, like within the next few months. This means I will no longer be able to run my current store location, which actually breaks my heart because I really like my current employer, and really care about the team I have working under me.

The city I am planning to move to does have a store, but the franchisee there is notoriously bad (low wages, treats employees poorly), and I don't want to work for him. I have friends who work for him and they all hate him.

I would like to approach the corporate team about potential opportunities for remote or hybrid work. As far as I can tell, here are my options:

1. Contact the VP who spoke to me at the conference, and express my desire to work for the corporate side of the company. Could this backfire, by upsetting my current franchisee, once/if he finds out that I went ""over his head"" to talk to corporate?

2. Somehow (simultaneously?) put in my resignation with my current employer, while asking him to ""put in a good word for me"" with the corporate team. This option is scary for me, because I'd basically be saying ""I'm quitting, but can you also do me a favor and talk to the company about getting me a better/different job?"".

3. Look for a job with a different company all together. I'm pretty confident that my track record and transferable skills would land me a pretty good job with another company, but I honestly really like the company I currently work for. I'm open to this option, but it's not my first choice.

4. Work for the franchisee in the new city, who has a pretty crappy reputation. This would be my last choice, and as you can see, I'd rather work for a different company all together than work for that guy. Option #4 would provide some stability and consistency, as I would be in the same company ecosystem, and be able to bring my direct knowledge and experience to a new location, but again, the franchisee here really kind of sucks.

After typing this all out, I'm leaning toward option #2, but I don't really know how to approach my current employer with this information and request. Feels awkward to disappoint my current boss with my departure (we get along very well), while also asking him to go to bat for me with the corporate team.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks everyone!

1dc3d7r,How to transition from Automotive Engineering to Automotive Project Management?,"Hi there! I'm a recent graduate (22 M) with a BSc in Automotive Engineering, living in Europe. During my studies, I completed a couple of internships with OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers. My first internship involved business analytics, and during my second role, I managed a small team of junior developers delivering simple digitalization projects for internal departments. Currently, I'm developing my skills as a systems/requirements engineer for ECUs at a prestigious OEM. However, I would like to develop vertically rather than horizontally, with the goal of becoming a Project Manager, Functional Owner, or Team Leader. To that end, I have applied for a Master's program in Management, as I find I have strong soft skills and a less technical engineering mindset.

Do you have any recommendations on how to accelerate my career towards that goal? How to climb that corporate Automotive ladder in a most efficient way? What should I focus on understanding better? Product life cycle? The complete path from requirements elicitation to the final steps of software testing? ASPICE? ISO 26262? Should I obtain a PMP certification?

1dc2hou,Take the promotion or new job offer? ,"Take the promotion or the new job offer? 

Hi all, I (F26) would like to get your advice on my current job situation. My background in education is international law. 

I have been working in my company for 3.5 years, I got promoted two times. This is my first professional job in the legal field. The pros about the job: nice colleagues, love my clients, flexible both in terms of hrs you work and you can work from anywhere in the world. So I have been taking advantage of this and i sometimes go to other countries to work from their and combine it with a few days off (easy to travel within Europe). Also environment is rather more informal and we have great parties inside and outside the office.

Now the cons: we got acquired by another company and new management is changing company structure, are making terrible decisions and not taking our feedback into account. No transparency in a lot of things (like salary scales), the pay is also not very high, no real benefits , people are stressed from the workload and some people left in the past couple of months. 

I have also been demotivated in the past couple of months due to the way management has been treating us and I don’t really feel challenged anymore as I feel like I learned everything I could. 

I have had some interviews for a new job and just got an offer 3 days ago from a bank. This job would be in a new area (still in the legal field) that I am also interesting in learning more about. They do seem def more organized with a clear structure and the salary is a little bit higher than my current position (almost the same). But keep in mind this is a rather junior position as I will learn a new field. In this job, you work 4 days a week (2 days from the office) and they told me I can work from certain countries (EU countries) and also some others like US and Canada (this is a plus bcs my mom and brother live there) for a limited period of time , however it seems to be more monitored like getting a pre-approval from your manager.

At the same time, my current job wants to promote me to a more managerial position that would be less operational and more about helping and guiding people to do their best. So there are definitely new things I can learn from this position. But the new offer appeals to me a lot as well because I think it would be beneficial to gain experience in more areas I like in my 20s, a new environment could be great for me as the current company drained my energy a bit and I mean it on the non-transparency (they still have to let me know how much I could be making with the promotion- ikr lol). Sometimes I feel like we are an episode from the office. The only two downsides would be the managerial experience I can get from the promotion and less flexibility on remote work. 

I am happy to receive any advice or insights, thank you. :)",mimesis113,1,1.0,3,1717962747,2024-06-09 19:52:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dc2hou/take_the_promotion_or_new_job_offer/,6,2024

1dc1eqq,I have 3 years of experience as a financial analyst and want to shift to sales. Which sales jobs would be best for me?,"As the title currently says I have been working as a financial analyst for three years for a healthcare company in South Florida even though I had a tech degree (ironic right). I like what the job taught me such as working under stress (which I know sales will involve) and meeting deadlines as well as building relationships but I feel like I can use what I know to help me in a sales positions where I can make more money. Now I know sales is not an easy job but I feel like I can adjust to it since I was able to work in finance without a finance background and adjust to it and retail experience working at Asics in college where I was the top seller for many months and caused an increase of revenue.

My main interest are in financial, healthcare/medical, and tech sales but I am open to learning of more postitons that I can get into that doesnt neccessarily have to relate to my prior experience.

What sales jobs do you suggest?",Remarkable-Mess6902,1,1.0,1,1717959960,2024-06-09 19:06:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dc1eqq/i_have_3_years_of_experience_as_a_financial/,6,2024
1dc12g0,Should I pursue a master’s or another bachelor’s in a different field? (in Germany),"
I’m 25 and have a bachelor’s degree in CS. 

I never really liked the field but was encouraged to pursue it. It’s not something I hate but I can’t imagine working in it for the rest of my life. 

I spent a year after graduating (I graduated at 24) abroad working odd jobs/volunteering in fields that I like - related to literature/arts and nature - and I was able to save up some money. 

Now, I don’t have any real job experience after graduating in CS, so I have the option to pursue a master’s degree in CS (in Germany) and get student jobs in the field that can lead to potential permanent positions. 

In this scenario I would graduate from my master’s at around 27 and if everything goes well get a full time job right away. 

The money I have saved up (€12.7k) can last me about a year without having to work, but I would be working part time during my studies to support myself, so I wouldn’t have any money related issues during this period. 

My second option is pursuing another bachelor in the field that I actually like. I checked some programs and came down to 2 options - Bachelor of Environmental and Resource Management or Sustainable Engineering of Products and Processes - both lasting 3 years. 

I would really like to pursue literature, but I’ve been discouraged by many people. 

In the second scenario, I would probably have to work unrelated part time jobs at the beginning of my studies, and 12.7k/3 = around €350 a month. 

Let’s say I take 3 months to find a part time job, that would mean a monthly cap of about €900 a month until I graduate, taking into account a low-lower mid paying part time job (hopefully the worst case scenario). 

That’s an ok amount for 1 person if I’m smart with the way I spend my money. 

But is it really worth pursuing a bachelor in another field? Would I get jobs in the field after?

An important thing to notice is I’m not from the European Union, but I do speak German. 

The reason I’m not trying to pursue a master’s or another bachelor in my country is because I am a lesbian and it’s illegal here. 

I worry that if I pursue another bachelor I would be too old by the time I graduate and I don’t know if it’s a good field in terms of job opportunities. 

Graduating with a master’s at 27 is fine, and CS is a good field. But I don’t know if it’s smart to graduate with a bachelor’s at 28 in either Environmental and Resource Management or Sustainable Engineering of Products and Processes. 

Since I’d be coming from abroad, the job opportunities are probably the most important aspect…

What can I do? 

Edit: I have more money than that saved up, but I deducted all the potential expenses I’d have at the beginning ",Excellent-Raise-4986,1,1.0,0,1717959084,2024-06-09 18:51:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dc12g0/should_i_pursue_a_masters_or_another_bachelors_in/,6,2024

1dc0ty6,PTO nightmare,"Hi, I work at a small company that use to be a great place, healthy work environment,loved my coworkers and had amazing owners and a great HR. Although after a 2 yrs of working here things have extremely gone down hill.
Seeing as I am not in the financial situation to just leave I have done everything in my power to try to GET OUT.
But now Im coming to Reddit for answers on a BIG issue 
My old HR left due to the changes, leaving my bosses with no one to replace her.
They decided to put someone in charge who was completely new to doing anything along the lines of Payroll ECT. and who wasn't able to receive much training.
4 Mon ago I put in for a PTO request for a trip back home,I take this trip quiet often and did everything I usually do to get ready for this trip. I reached out to this employee made sure I was approved and that my request was put in correctly. I even gave 2 months prior to let my jobs  make sure everything was in the system and that coverage was found.
Last week I was approached, by my owners let me know that I was given too much PTO and that they would be garnishing my pay because of it. I had a meeting with them trying to explain and show proof that I did everything in my power to assure that I was approved. And even when I got sick a month after my trip I made sure to let this employee know that if I did not have PTO they were able to use my UTO. 
And not end of the day my pay was garnished, and employee got no repercussions or even put on information for the mistake. 
Now I feel very much taken advantage of, and seeing as I have nowhere to go until I find another job I am stuck at a standstill trying very hard to find anyway of getting things rectified in any way. This employee wound up making a mistake on three other people's PTO. But still no consequences. 
I was just wondering if anybody had any opinions on this. Should I just drop it count my losses and move on until I find another job or is there something I can actually do. 
I thank you for reading this long explanation and any advice I received in advance. ",InterestingTrash3275,1,1.0,0,1717958483,2024-06-09 18:41:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dc0ty6/pto_nightmare/,6,2024
1dc04z4,Please help: guidance on career trajectory ,"TLDR: I have a super specific liscence in a now dead end field, trying to finish degree, but blocked, heavy science background

Thank you for reading, first and foremost. In 2015  I had to drop out of my college program in physics, due to a suicide attempt in my family and my unraveled mental health. I got a job using my math skills as a clinical informaticist, then 2 years later, because of economic issues at the state level, I had to move to find work away from my college. 
I found work as a register behavior technician (specialized liswnce) in the same field I was a data analyst, from numbers on a screen to implementing therapy. It was a good stable job I was good at. 
Resumed school in 2019, 2020 online and out of state, for the courses I could, I had no loans left or grants, I only had a year left and my job agreed to pay my tuition.  Then the pandemic happened, and they couldn't. 
I did 30 hrs in a semester, since I was already enrolled, had flat rate tuition and now I'm only  6 hours short, but it involved me changing my degree slightly, but it fit for the field I was in. 
Then a parent complaint got me fired. I've had a hard time finding good stable work since. I've had stable hours with low pay, I've had good pay and inconsistent hours, but nothing that can help me pay the $23k I owe in tuition that my job couldn't pay. 
My liscence isn't transferrable to any other field, and the ABA field is in a bad spot currently economically. 
I tried getting into education, and they're also strapped for jobs without degrees. Thought I found a district that might let me teach, worked with a principal and teachers for rec letters, and learned about emergency permits, and I passed the state exams to teach general science and high school physics, but they ended up not taking me after all. 
Now I'm back to hodgepodging income, a lisenced I can't take anywhere or grow with. I'm good at science and math, but I just feel like a waste, and like I can't get anywhere. I've even faked resumes and can't get retail management jobs.
I've applied for loans, but been declined, no cosigner, not good enough credit for an unsecured 20-30k. 
I need a career change or idea or field, anything that is likely to let me grow and promote and earn enough to pay for my own bachelor's. I only need two classes. 
Any pointing to other subs is also greatly appreciated. 
I was gonna be a physicist, but I'm nothing now. I want to change that, I want to be something, willing to bleed for it, but just don't know what or how. 
Thank you, am depressed. ",Green_Active_6365,1,1.0,0,1717956706,2024-06-09 18:11:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dc04z4/please_help_guidance_on_career_trajectory/,6,2024

So some friends told me that I should become a creative writer. And Ngl I was thinking the same for a long time. But the Problem is I don't know how to Write dialogues and I doubt myself that whether I Could Come up with an original ideas of my own. So I narrated some story ideas I Came up with to my friends and they said that most of them where mediocre. So Again I was disappointed and Doubting myself.

I moved from Florida to Pennsylvania 2 years ago to give my kids a better education and lost my career and direction in life. I'm a single parent, 3 kids (ages 9 and under). Before moving I was in the fine art auction industry in one form or another for my entire life, both managing my family business (13 years) and selling antique jewelry online and it was very stressful but it was also my entire identity and source of self esteem. Now I've moved, and the antique and auction industry here is a flop. I work remotely for auction houses but the hours are irregular and insufficient. I can't find merchandise for resale, I've looked into auto and industrial auction businesses that -are- hiring, but they're offering $15 or so an hour. I don't have the network or reputation here to find consignors. Office management in other industries turn me down because I don't have a bachelors degree or experience with scheduling and accounting softwares like quickbooks, etc. They also don't pay a living wage for me ($20-$22 an hour is the standard here and I have to accommodate childcare in addition to living expenses). I've also been told multiple times at various interviews that I'm overqualified or they couldn't afford to compensate me adequately. I'm just not sure where to go next.

1dbtwce,"When is relevant job experience too old? Considering finishing my degree, but I’m already in a field I love.","I am currently 21-years-old and aiming for a career in natural resources/environmental policy - namely, working as a staff member at a conservation corps and/or as an advocate for green jobs programs in Government. At this moment in time, I have my Associates degree (although somewhat irrelevant - liberal arts) and I am working as a crew leader in a conservation corps. It's been wonderful, but I do have the plan to finish my degree on the horizon. My plan for the next few years is to spend next year working in a temporary administrative role, either within my current Corps, or on my friend's campaign for state representative back home (I have a background in organizing/politics) I figure both will teach me the program management/fundraising/administrative skills I'm looking to gain. Then I want to travel for a while in 2026 (my twin love with land conservation work, last year I took a semester off to travel around Europe and it was awesome) before re-starting school to finish my degree, which will be a Bachelor's in Environmental Studies/Policy. With transfer credits, it should (hopefully) only take me two years, and then I'll be graduated and ready to embark on my path at 25.

As much as I want the degree for financial/security reasons (I want more options and the possibility to make more money in the future) I'm realizing the potential consequences of being out of the workforce for 3 years as I'm traveling and finishing my degree. I worry that recruiters at Conservation Corps will see my last experience with a Corps was 3-4 years ago, and will pass over me for that reason.

1dbolfm,Are these red flags? Or am I just being overly sensitive? ,"What are signs management is just toxic and has no plans for your career in the company?

I recently asked my manager's boss (in the presence of my manager) where does my work fit into his goals for the year - they use this term called OKRs. He said my work (including my colleagues' projects) don't fulfill the OKRs. This was a red flag to me, because it becomes not transparent on what actually aligns with his goals, and this directly impacts performance review and ranking. Am I wrong?

Another incident was regarding a project I worked on early  half of this year. I remembered clearly communicating to my manager that I needed help with data preprocessing of files to proceed with modelling. I also asked about alternatives such as accessing to the database with the data already properly formatted for analytics or some API that abstracts writing ETL pipelines to process data from non relational database. He brushed me request aside and said there's no one who could help me, and it's either I settle it myself or the project stalls. I ended up handling the processing and ingestion myself. It was over a million files, and I could only process less than 100k due to time constraints. Fast forward to today, a few other colleagues also need the same set of data for their work. This time, my manager realised that getting the data processing and ingestion is such a hassle (and that the colleagues don't have the expertise to do so - data scientists weren't expected to have the skillset of data engineering and database design in my coy), that he found a stronger impetus to look into the API that I brought up months ago. I found it unfair that I was being held to different standards. Am I being an asshole?

Here’s what I’ve got so far:




Hello……..,

I hope this email finds you well. It’s Saturday evening and I have just finished a shift flying solo on a typically busy weekend day, handling it just fine. If it’s alright with you, may I propose an increase to my hourly wage? 

Our department was recently awarded Best in the Area, and we finally have a solid team formed of dedicated people. I am super grateful for my coworkers right now. It feels like we’re dialing it in after pandemic mayhem finally, with all of us making a real concerted team effort to get and stay organized. I hope it stays this way. 

Thank you very much for the raises I have already received without asking. In order to better serve our customer base, I’ve been studying and continue to study in my free time online, logging several hours on ExpertVoice while also attending numerous aisle and dinner trainings. My knowledge about the major brands we carry has expanded significantly in the eighteen months I’ve worked here. We have quite a curated list of brands! 

Also, I do feel I’m a very decent and occasionally super charming salesperson, if I do say so myself! A vast majority of my customer interactions feel very positive and effective. It’s nice to get to know people and learn about our products, then pass information along to really help our customers in the aisles. 

Would an extra $1.75/hr be doable? Please let me know.

Thank you for your consideration.

Warmly,

1dbkl3b,"I missed a scheduled online orientation for a job I applied to, and I didn't notice for several days. What do I even do in this situation?","So, I messed up pretty bad today. Here is my situation...

I (19F) am a sophomore college student. I was looking for work and I applied on Indeed for an entry level sales job at a solar company in my area. A few days after I applied I was sent an automated text that requested I schedule a short online orientation before the interview. The message explained that the orientation would consist of a hiring manager presenting information about the company and explaining the products they sell, some company history and also some expectations for the role. Then, if the hiring manager determined you were a good fit, they would schedule you for the first official interview. I had never heard of any company doing 'orientations' like this before, but I just went with it because I wanted the role.

I had originally scheduled the online orientation for Wednesday, June 5th. But after a family emergency came up, I decided to reschedule the date of my orientation on the company’s website. I had intended to reschedule the orientation for Thursday, June 13th. But I must have not been looking at the dates thoroughly enough, because I unintentionally rescheduled to Thursday, June 6th instead.

I found out about this mistake about an hour ago, when I was planning out the upcoming week on my digital planner as I usually do on Saturdays. I was verifying the details of the orientation so I could prepare some notes and do some more research on the company, and that's when I looked on my screen and saw that I had, in fact, missed my orientation date. I immediately panicked. I had not received any texts/emails after the missed orientation, so I had no idea this happened until literally an hour ago. I had an anxiety attack about thirty minutes ago because of this. I just feel so stupid. I thought I had effectively planned everything out, and that everything was under control, but I was mistaken.

Before you say anything super judgemental, I am fully aware that I have effectively ruined this company’s first impression of me and have most likely botched any chance of them considering me for an interview in the future. I’m super upset right now because I really wanted this role, and also because I unintentionally wasted some poor hiring manager’s time.

My question is, what would be the best course of action to take in this situation? Should I contact the company first thing in the morning, explain my situation, and ask about the possibility of rescheduling, or should I just accept defeat and move on? I do not have the hiring manager’s contact information, because all the messages that were sent to me were automated. The only option I can think of is to email/call the company itself, apologize and hope that they understand, but I don't think that it would affect anything as this orientation was almost three days ago and i'm starting to think that the opportunity for me to explain myself has passed now.

Any advice, thoughts or ideas are greatly appreciated.",More-Ebb-7051,3,1.0,1,1717904493,2024-06-09 03:41:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dbkl3b/i_missed_a_scheduled_online_orientation_for_a_job/,6,2024

The pay is not even that good, just enough to not let me starve. But with all these setbacks, I'm kinda scared to take a leap of faith. 

In my mind, the more reasonable take would be to wait at least one more year before quitting my job before I hop to a new one, but the work condition here is so detrimental. 

Also, in my country, I just can't just change schools (so easily) even if I want to, so that's out of my options.

1. Try finding a retail(something like teller) bank positions here in USA. Though pay is very less compared to others peaceful work-life balance.

2. Start preparing for GMAT/GRE and do MBA/MS in finance. I think people are struggling to get into entry level positions just with MBA

3. Start preparing for CPA and get into auditing/taxation domain

1dbg4q1,is criminology a good bachelors degree?,"I live in Spain and I need to pick a bachelors course for my uni in the next few weeks and im honestly not sure if i should pick criminology.

 my parents try to guide me towards studying something more general for my bachelors degree such as BAM (business administration and management) or international business (which both seem great too) and tell me that i could specialise in what i want later on.

Some extra info is that already know i'm not going to study a law/rights/economics degree because i find the thought of it really boring. Im not particularly good at maths.

1. I am wondering if criminology is a good degree to have if i could specialise in criminalistics or something more investigatory for my masters, or would it be pretty much useless if it's not a double degree with psychology or something?

2. what masters would be good to specialise in if i enjoy finding information, connecting the dots, i notice patterns and love solving mysteries and problems etc

3. Is it a good career path to follow if i want to leave Spain later on in life? Or would the skills not be as transferable to another country since the laws are different? (im thinking of moving to a more northern country in my mid twenties). Languages aren't too big of a problem, i am fluent in 4.

4. should i just pick BAM instead?

1dbegwe,M22 Career advice for a graduating engineering student,"I am about to be 23 years old this month. I will graduate with a degree in Metallurgical Engineering this upcoming Spring. In college, I have led a student organization as President and was successful. I have gained skills in people management, event organization and communication.

In the past and current summer, I have interned at a construction company working under QA/QC. Here I have studied ASME Code and Standards, as well as learning to weld and inspect welds. I am currently on a new project where I have learned to interpret engineering drawings and perform quality checks on construction progress.  However, I feel that I fell into this path and am not sure of it as a career. I don’t think I fit into the culture of the construction management/workers, and I don’t like that I would have to travel frequently for projects. As an intern I am earning \~$1700/week which is money I have never seen before. They have expressed interest in hiring me full time and my mentor has said that the pay would be good. However, I am unsure that I would enjoy it.

My goal is to secure a job that would pay well and allow me to begin saving and investing. Seems pretty simple. Realistically, \~$75k in the state of Alabama or the equivalent in any other state adjusted for cost of living. I am worried that metallurgy jobs will not pay very well.

I am good at creating and giving presentations and leading a team of people. I have the experience to show for it. I also have the ability to read and comprehend very quickly. I write well. My math skills are satisfactory, and I have taken and passed all college level math up to differential equations. I have basic experience using AI and use it often as a learning tool. My technical skills are average as I have experience working on vehicles, working in construction, and welding. I have worked various jobs in public service. I am listing my skills to give the reader context on what path I may be able to take with success.

I am hoping to find some advice on what career I might find success in that would allow me to start at a decently high salary for my age and begin to build my life. My degree will be in metallurgical engineering, but I am not satisfied with the entry level pay for a bachelor’s. I do not want to get a masters. I am hoping that the engineering degree and my skills and experience will qualify me for another career option in engineering or any other higher paying field.

I am a hard worker, but I am currently lacking direction to focus my energy. Based on what I have provided, would I be qualified to pivot into another high paying engineering career?

Also - we got called into a meeting on Thursday about us and my colleagues getting title changes, some priorities are being moved around, and we’ll be hiring someone to help us out more with our daily tasks.

I feel like I got pretty good news on Thursday and by Friday I already feel like I’m messing it up. At least the thing that I messed up will be shifted off my job description?

I would like to get advice mostly on how to pivot from my field to another field/speciality, so if there are folks here hwo have been through similar things, please share. Thanks in advance! :)

I've been working in the finance sector in EU. My background is a B.Eng. in Computer Science.

I have roughly 10 years of experience and have worked as a:  

- Project Manager on various projects, from small to big ones (e.g. data center redesign, some security projects, retail projects, large scale SW implementations). Had high autonomy on all of them, and can say that all were completed satisfactory. I know its a bit strange, but cant share more details. Waterfall in case you were wondering. 1st place as the job I enjoyed the most

- IT Architecture - involved in IT arch, mainly in shaping the architectural documents and connecting the dots between various systems based on my previous experiences. The role was highly administrative, and even though it maybe sounds cool, it wasnt. But I learned a great deal about the inner workings of a large system and got a good understanding how things work in IT in such a regulated industry within the EU

- Team lead - I am currently in charge of a team which focus is primarily on redesign of existing processes and enabling their digitalisation. This is quite interesting, but when you factor in the slowness of such a regulated industry and the levels needed to approve something...well it kills your enthusiasm. 2nd place as the job I enjoyed the most

Also, I'm working parallel as an advisor in an student incubator where I've been an advisor of many startups in the following areas: ideation, product discovery, operations development, communication (pitch) coach...Some of these startups have had good traction, and I've managed to shape a small number of students into young professionals. I've also co-organized several conferences and hackathons. Now for the fun part...I want to leave my jobin the financial sector and turn to new challenges. Since as you can see I'm a generalist (for the most part), I'm having trouble figuring out how to approach this change. The market is crazy (yes in the EU also), and for all my experience, I guess I haven't figured out where to turn next. I was thinking product management, or IT operations in a different company (what would IT operatios be? Any experience here?), or something completely different. But I can't seem to pinpoint it exactly. If there are folks who have worked in banking or consulting in IT sector, you know it encompasses so many things, that wherever you go you will be fine (I've seen this from many people who left) and will be able to manage the workload...

Are there folks here who have similar experiences? How did you go about these things? How did you learn to ""sell yourself"" to perspective employers? I value all the advice I can get.

1dbambt,"[Canada] I got a B.Eng in Electrical, but I want to pursue Software or Analyst in the industry with only 2 YOE. I have questions about doing Master's to help my career.","Hi All, 

**Academic Background**: I majored in Electrical engineering with a specialty in electronics. *My majoring institution was not a well-known university and I will ask about that in one of my questions*.  Not to bore you, but I fell out of love with electrical engineering (still graduated though), and decided to pursue software engineering as my career. I am what you can define as a jack of all trades, master of none. I did co-ops in various positions in various companies (2 of which are very notable in the industry), never gaining experience in 1 particular field in software. 

**Work Experience**: My first job out of college was in Data engineering - they provided all the training material and were patient, but got laid off due to lack of work. It took me 5 months of daily job applications - with the help of GPT4 and bard (back then) to do cover letters, write tailored resumes - and only got 1 interview which scored me my next job. My second job was at a very famous Canadian company working for their DevOps team. After a 6 month probation, I got terminated due to lack of skill. All amounts to 2 YOE, excluding Co-ops. 

**Why I think Masters:** I think Master's would be good because it would serve as an official solution to my experience-and-background gap. A 3-in-1; it would bridge the knowledge gap between EE and Software or Analyst, it would be higher than a bachelor so better job hunting, and it will specialize my skills in one particular field. I also believe (but cannot prove) that the influx of immigrants with a software background usually also take the graduate studies route and after just a year or 2 working in Canada, are eligible for 95% of Software jobs leaving the rest of us benched. I am also interested in asking about a Master's because unlike other traditional engineering routes, software is one that you can easily forgo doing a masters and take some coursers online from udemy or coursera and improve your job - so I need assurance that it is indeed a good choice to spend lots of money and time on. After all, I don't want to spend 5 months looking for work, or spend 6 months and get the boot. 

**My plan**: To go further into Software, specializing in Data Science or Software Engineering. Or get into a business analyst role.

1.  Coming with an academic background in Electronics, will a masters in comp sci or software or comp eng, help get me hired? 

2. As you may know, Engineering in Canada is accredited by the CEAB (ABET). Ontario colleges are not known to have CEAB accredited engineering degrees. However, Conestoga College in Kitchener does and I graduated with my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics Engineering from there. The program was accredited in 2014 and I think I was part of the 7th cohort. I have heard some success stories about people graduating and working at Silicon Valley. Would that be worrisome if I were to apply and they doubted that I actually have a Bachelor's in Engineering given that fact ? 

3. Same as above but for Business analyst ?

4. I don't want to get into research or PhD. Is project-based more suited to a better return to industry, compared to Thesis or coursework ? 

5. What if I can't make the minimum average cut-off, but I REALLY want to get into this program - what can be done ? 

6. Comp Sci is normally the most competitive and usually in their admission criteria, says that you need to have a background in it. If I can't meet that background because I am EE, would Comp Eng fulfill the necessities ? 

7. I have heard that Master of Computer Science is the one to get (in the U.S.) but it's a very rare title in Canada. Instead, it's MEng for project or course-based, Msc/MAsc for thesis or research (usually). I have heard from some of my friends in software that MEng has lower prestige than Msc/MAsc. Is there any truth to that? 

8. Finally, is Masters overkill for Data Analyst or Business Analyst and if I decide those paths, shall I go for some coursera certs instead ?

1dbaijm,Toxic Co-worker,"Hi all,

I'm looking for some advice.

I (M28) am having trouble with a (technically) ex-colleague (F40). Her attitude and superiority complex drove me to change departments, but we still work in the same building, and she is actively making my life difficult.

A bit of background: I started with the company around 16 months ago as one of four senior marketing managers overseeing 19 industry-leading brands. After working my way up for 10 years, this job should have been my dream.

When I joined, the marketing director encouraged competition rather than collaboration among the divisions, but she was supportive of her team. The problematic colleague was clearly the ""black sheep"" of the group, disliked by the director and other managers, though the director's deputy supported her. Initially, I found her friendly and helpful, and we became close, working together on projects. She seemed like a superstar, and together, we excelled.

At the start of this year, the company structure changed. The marketing director left, replaced by her deputy, and our divisions merged. My colleague's former director became the managing director for both divisions, and she began acting like my boss, dumping her workload on me and gaslighting me. Her brilliance turned out to be a façade, with falsified results and stolen ideas. 

My partner met her once and immediately warned me about her, but I ignored the advice. I confided in her about my frustrations and was manipulated in return. When I finally approached my divisional director, he offered me a job within his division, which I accepted. The new marketing director understood and supported my decision.

However, my colleague took it badly. She stopped talking to me, deleted me from social media, and spilled my confidential frustrations to my superiors, damaging my relationships. She turned the marketing department against me and even called to shout at me. Now, she is the marketing manager for my division, with an assistant handling the brands. She has claimed an office next to mine and makes our interactions uncomfortable. Her behaviour has raised my anxiety levels, and I'm noticing grey hairs.

Both the divisional and marketing directors are aware of her actions but dismiss them as ""just who she is."" Despite her numerous conflicts within the company, she continues to get away with it.

Ultimately, I need advice on how to navigate this situation. I doubt she'll be leaving anytime soon, and I don't want to quit my job because of one difficult person. However, I can't continue like this. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

1db9un1,"Didn't list all former titles on resume and other discrepancies, should I worry?","Hey all. I'm applying to different jobs after being laid off months ago, and there are some difference between my resume and what I think would come up in a background/reference check.

In my old workplace, I had four titles across two departments. All the roles were functionally related, but out of a desire to be brief and keep my resume strictly relevant to the roles I'm applying to, I only list the most recent two along with the full years I was at the company. If it matters, I know that HR (but possibly not the hiring manager?) looked at my linkedin, which has all my former titles listed. 

Will it be a concern if in reference or background checks, my former roles come up? I believe I mentioned offhand several times in my interviews that I had previous titles I didn't include, and that I was ""in charge of [thing related to a former title, but I didn't explain it was an entirely separate role, because at most companies it would have been combined with a role I did list], but I don't know how much the interviewer paid attention to that.

Another thing is, one of my roles apparently isn't listed in the company records, because I held it so briefly; I went from  associate level to manager level, and then a month later became a manager in a different department. When I asked for my salary history from HR previously, the month-long manager level wasn't listed. I don't know if that would show up any differently in a background check? 

I'd hate for the company to think I lied about anything. Thanks in advance for any advice!",wellel-,2,1.0,2,1717872584,2024-06-08 18:49:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1db9un1/didnt_list_all_former_titles_on_resume_and_other/,6,2024
1db9ihi,"I have a bad feeling about my new job, but I have no good reason to feel that way. Is this anxiety or intuition?","I started a new job months ago. When I quit my old job, I knew I was making the wrong move, even though the new company is great: lots of benefits, hybrid work, modern equipment, career opportunities. But I've been living with anxiety for three months now: it's hard to wake up, I don't do housework on weekends, and I've started to ignore my health.

What surprising things have I noticed at my new job:

- a director who calls me ""my dear"", tries to get into my heart and be nice (invites me to have a drink with him and other colleagues);
- a colleague who always talks about my incompetence and is always rude to me (but my team defends me);
- the company fires people easily; before I joined, 50% of the staff had been replaced in recent months;
- many employees who ask me how to do my job, even though I am new;
- I receive constant criticism for my work;
- one of the large-scale projects has recently been closed;
- the other project is a bit boring for me;
- the company will be reorganised in a month.

My colleagues from my previous job are working at my new job, and they like everything. So I shouldn't feel this way, but I can't help myself. It's a prestigious company and everyone dreams of working for it. As I said: health insurance, the ability to work remotely as long as you want, many gifts from the company, support from mentors, high salary. And to be honest, I miss my old job, but something is bothering me and I hardly see my future at new place.

1db94uj,Salary + bonus unpaid for 2 months. Should I quit without a job lined up?,"My company is going through some “cashflow issues”. 

For context, it’s not a small company. It has bases in UK, Brazil, Italy, India and USA. The industry it is in is going through some tough times and investors aren’t as excited about the company anymore. We were cited cashflow issues when our leadership let us know that we won’t be receiving salaries for the previous month (May) and this month (June) until the end of July wherein we will be receiving the salaries of both months together. 

A few points to note:

1. We were supposed to get our bonus payout in the month of May. There’s no mention of that at all. 

2. Appraisals were supposed to happen in May, but there’s no discussion around that either. 

3. Management is awfully vague about the date on which the salary will actually get credited in July. 

4. There is no incentive discussed for us to actually wait the storm out which makes me think they’re trying to get people to leave instead of laying them off. 

5. There was a townhall within which the CEO and Managing Director seemed pretty passive about this issue. 

6. Employees are being asked to come in to work and perform as though things are still BAU. 

7. There’s a lot more pressure on Sales and Marketing departments to generate more revenue with practically no budgets. 

All in all, it looks like a dumpster fire but a very quiet one. 

Is this time to jump ship? I’ve started looking for a new job but the constant pressure from work makes it difficult. Should I quit without having a job lined up first? I have a notice period of 3 months and my wife’s income and our savings can sustain us for a couple of months after that. 

Or, should I wait it out? ",ghoshstories1512,2,1.0,2,1717870602,2024-06-08 18:16:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1db94uj/salary_bonus_unpaid_for_2_months_should_i_quit/,6,2024
1db8lfo,Seeking advise for pay raise,"I am working remotely for a year now with a seed funded tech start up on track to raise series A. The team is small (12 employees) and I work in biz ops at an associate level. Being a start up there is no formal policy in place for raise (how much, when it is likely to happen). I did not had this discussion during joining and I was offered about 7% less than my expected salary that I shared during the interview. However, at that time I was in a situation where I needed a job anyhow, so I was okay with getting the opportunity and the offer was still more than what I was getting at my previous job. FYI, we don't have any additional employee perks. One year in, I want to bring increment discussion to my line manager. 

1. What would be the reasonable % of increase? If I calculate the absolute value of my expected salary the % increase I am looking for is 25%, is that outrageous?
2. Is this a right time to ask? I guess if you don't ask you'll never get one.
3. How should I bring up this discussion and what points should I put forward to rationalise it?

1db89ys,Considering a career switch from finance to a Fortune 500 Business Analyst role - Is stability the best choice? Has anyone had a similar experience?,"TL;DR: Currently in public finance but not happy due to mismatched expectations and job responsibilities. Got an offer for a business analyst role at a Fortune 500 company, which isn't my ideal career path but offers stability and better culture. Unsure whether to accept or hold out for a better fit. Seeking advice on what to do next!

***

Feeling conflicted - I've been working as an analyst in a sell-side firm focused on public finance for a year and don't intend to stay in this space. I was part of an analyst program and didn't get to choose my placement, which I think has led to a disconnect in what I expected and what is expected of me. My job is technical, mostly fixing models with deals here or there. I don't mind excel or modeling, but I thought I would be working more with fundamental analysis, which my bad, should have done my due diligence. So now I'm in a job that is not a great fit and it's affecting my work relationships.

I've been casually hunting and got my first offer for a business analyst role with a Fortune 500 company in their finance unit. I'm unsure about it. It's not exactly what I had in mind for my career trajectory. I enjoy working with markets, but this position would definitely be stable, has really good benefits, and the team seems fine, with the exception of the manager of the sister team, who acted kind of condescending during our interview.

I'm planning to leave my job anyway because it's been a very frustrating experience and I always feel like I'm on thin ice (high turnover, small overstretched teams wearing many hats, an intense boss who says things I find problematic, and lack of structure or expectations until something is wrong). This space is very niche within finance and offers fewer transferable skills to other areas, and I'm honestly not doing my role justice even though I'm trying. I'm worried that if I take this new job, I'll have a difficult time getting anything other than corporate finance roles in the future and that every job/company in finance is like my current one, and I know that's not true because I've had a previous internship at a trust which had amazing culture and leadership and all my friends who work in finance have basically told me that the culture in my firm sucks and I should move to buy-side, but it's something that's been in the back of my mind.  

But now that I have an offer, I'm hesitating. Would it be stupid to turn this down in hopes of finding something else? The compensation is around the same as what I make now, but the company culture seems better at this new spot.",flyingchunkymunky7,3,1.0,3,1717868279,2024-06-08 17:37:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1db89ys/considering_a_career_switch_from_finance_to_a/,6,2024

1db6lkq,What would be the best career pathway for me?,"Im bilingual (English (with an accent) and Spanish (native) and speak a little bit of portuguese). I've mostly done customer service and now I work in a career center. Pretty much I assist people with their unemployment applications and after interviewing them I refer them to our services (career planning, professional networking, etc.).

I took a course of Data Analytics, but I don't see myself being a data analyst. I guess the good part is I gained some other skills. I'm learning Google ads to get in Digital Marketing since that's what catches more my attention. Im not too fan of Social Media Marketing bc that relies heavily on the assets of the customer, so I don't think you bring a real value by learning it. I'm not fan of SEO, I think is only beneficial for small businesses. And I'm not fan of email marketing either since learning it doesn't bring real value to the customer bc its pretty much good only for engagement and give special offers or incentives. So if I get in Digital Marketing my focus would be on Google Ads.

On Friday, they announced layoffs unexpectedly for financial reasons (which I don’t doubt are real, although everyone they laid off just happened to be the most outspoken about managerial mistakes and/or poor working conditions…) I was only made aware the afternoon before, and I wasn’t told how many roles or who would be affected, just that it would be a “heavy day” with layoffs. (I am a manager level but not part of exec leadership.)

The roles they are eliminating will result in a massive restructure, with a lot of “all hands on deck” talk and rearranging people’s tasks, etc. My immediate thought was that I should just put in my 4 weeks notice on Monday (they request 4 weeks notice in the employee handbook.) I feel like if I’m planning on leaving as soon as possible anyway, I should just let them know now while everything’s being rearranged anyway, rather than let them believe I’m taking on x,y,z. 

I don’t have a new job yet but I do have solid contacts and references at a temp agency that’s put me in good, decently paid placements before in the direction I’m hoping to go and I think it would be a matter of weeks before I got into a temp role.

Am I missing any big reason to not do this? I’m one of those people who, to my own detriment, usually takes a while to think through big decisions like this, so this feels a little scary but also like the simplest way to get out of a situation I don’t want to be in anymore.

1db277e,Need help with my life career ,"Hello everyone,



I am a 22-year-old living in Spain with a higher degree in Network Systems Administration (FP superior). Thanks to this qualification, I managed to get an internship at a multinational consulting firm, but I didn't have a great experience. During the internship, I didn't apply any of the knowledge I had acquired and felt mentally exploited. My IT team colleagues took advantage of me, something I now understand better in hindsight. During the first three months of the internship, I had no complaints, but then I continued for another six months as an intern without a contract and no prospects of being offered one. I wasn't learning new things or applying my knowledge, so I decided to leave the internship.



I then decided to study Computer Engineering remotely, as I didn't have any other job offers at that time. I enrolled in a distance university right after the first three months of the internship. However, studying remotely is challenging for me because I don't have close colleagues or professors, and the lack of interaction is demotivating. I can't transfer to a traditional university until I pass a minimum number of courses at the distance university.



Now I face a dilemma: what should I do with my life? On one hand, I think it would be great to complete my Computer Engineering degree because I am young, and if I have to do it, now is the time. But on the other hand, my personal and family situation is complex, and sometimes I think about starting to work as soon as possible. I've also considered doing a master's in cybersecurity (1 year) and obtaining some useful certifications.



Here are my two options:



1. \*\*Continue studying:\*\* Initially, I have to study remotely because I have no other option, but I could potentially transfer to a traditional university if I pass certain required courses in the distance university. Then, I can decide whether to work or pursue a master's before starting to work. The downside is that I might start working when I'm around 26 to 28 years old, depending on whether I do the master's.



2. \*\*Leave university:\*\* Do a master's in cybersecurity (1 year) and start working. The advantages are clear: when I am 26-28 years old, I will have 4-6 years of work experience, savings, and more job experience. However, I am unsure if the lack of a Computer Engineering degree will affect my future potential in the field.



After leaving the internship at the multinational firm, I received about 8 job offers on LinkedIn, but I didn't respond because I was focused on my studies and didn't consider working at that time.



Has anyone been in a similar situation or has any advice on which path might be better for me? Any help or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.

Even worse, the way things are right now, Wage increases, employers being more knit picky, positions being frozen or eliminated, I feel like I don’t have any options. But if I had to choose, I wouldn’t mind a budget cut for slightly less responsibility.

Maybe I’m overthinking things 

Any advice?

I have a career-related issue and would like some advice.

I am currently struggling to choose between a Solutions Architect position at AWS Korea and a Software Engineer position at another major Korean company.

I am leaning towards AWS, but I have heard that starting a career as a Solutions Architect can make it difficult to return to a developer role later (especially if you start as a junior, it can be an uncertain career path). This is causing me some concern.

What would you recommend?

Additionally, I am considering escaping from this country, so the relocation opportunities with AWS are very appealing to me.

1daxom9,Should I no-call no show?,"I've been working at a nursing home for two months now as a part-time dietary service aide and it's been pretty terrible honestly. I feel like management is terrible and the administrators just want to work me like a dog. A lot of the supervisors are pretty understanding at the very least, but they can't do much in regard to being understaff.

I was trained in a particular area of the place where there is 40 residents. My friend promised me it was a chill job, but after being deemed ""competent"" they just left me in that unit to basically work alone with either temps or new hires after a month in.

To keep it short and sweet, I asked for hours, but also days off in return. I specifically said, I do not mind working 3 12-hour shifts a week, 4 if needed, but I want it connected and 2-3 days off for the week. Instead, they make me work 4 12-hour shifts at a time and sometimes 2 days off. Honestly, because our schedule sheet is on paper, the manager would forget about the preceding schedule entirely. There was one time where I was scheduled to work 8 days in a row because he didn't realize that I didn't get the two days off (I was scheduled for 4 days at the end of the old schedule and 4 days at the start of the new schedule).

I just finished a 48-hour stretch. I finally get a day off tomorrow (Saturday) to finish off this current two-week schedule. The new schedule comes out and guess what? Lo and behold, I have 5 double shifts in a row. Should I just call out Sunday? I'm done venting to my friends/coworkers about this.

1davwlg,Job search advice,"I was recently laid off and it has been only a week since my last day of work and I feel like I’m going insane. I want to be able to enjoy this time that I have off since it is summer time. However, I feel immense pressure to find a new job as quickly as possible. I was at my last position for almost a year before getting laid off. I have limited experience since I struggled to find a job right out of college. I feel as if I don’t keep pushing myself to find a new position quickly the gap in my employment will make me look like a less desirable candidate. I currently work in the HR space but I’m feeling lost on how to move forward. 

I landed an interview yesterday and I was so nervous that I couldn’t even properly answer the questions. I felt like I needed to better utilize the STAR method but even when I prepare beforehand I draw a blank when I’m sitting in an interview. Even before the start of the interview the vibes felt off with the hiring team. I don’t know if it was my anxiety speaking or if it was the truth. I keep telling myself that it was fine and it’s normal to be nervous. But I couldn’t stop myself from feeling immediate dread after the interview. I know that I can do the job and I believe I would be a great addition to the team, but I’m not sure if that was shown through during the interview. I thought of so many ways to answer the interview questions afterwards. Job searching is a job within itself and I’m feeling lost. There seems to not be enough open positions near where I live or in a different state that I am interested in moving to. Every entry level job seems to be asking for non entry level of experience. I’m not sure that I want to stay within HR, but I don’t know what career I would want to pivot into. I do enjoy HR work and being able to build teams and support staff members but I really just do not know. Does anyone have any advice on landing interviews or networking when you have limited experience but have been out of college for more than two years?? Do you have any advice on gaining more work experience besides the obvious of landing a new position. I was thinking maybe temp jobs would be a good opportunity to gain more experience but is it possible to land a temp jobs when I’m having a difficult time landing interviews for full time positions. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. ",Nanabearr_,1,1.0,1,1717825871,2024-06-08 05:51:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1davwlg/job_search_advice/,6,2024
1davlmy,Company I freelance for has money issues. How do I find work as a mid-career journalist? ,"Hello everyone,

I am feeling a bit lost and would really appreciate your help, dear strangers of the internet. I am a journalist in the late 30s and I am currently forced to find a new job but struggle to do so. After journalism school, I did work as an intern/staff writer mostly at a media outlet which shut down due to money issues. For the past few years, I worked as a freelance foreign correspondent for a media outlet in my home country Netherlands while being based in the birth country of my mother. Yet now that outlet has also been less willing to pay for stories due to money issues. So while I feel like my career has been progressing over the years, I feel like its tumbling now and I dont fully know how to get ahead anymore.

So, I currently see two options:

1.     Find more clients to work for from my current country. I tried reaching out to some newsrooms in the Netherlands but they mostly already got their contributors/staff correspondents or are at best interested in very few stories. I have also written to some English language media but the situation was similar.

2.     Find a fulltime or a parttime job back in the Netherlands. Possibly freelance on the side I have tried applying to few advertised positions (so far unsuccessfully) and tried to talk to my quite limited network of journalist contacts asking for a job which may not be advertised. They were nice but that also led to nothing.

So I wonder if you have some advise for me:  
-Do you have any tips on how to better find jobs via a network and how to extend a network? (unfortunately, due to being abroad I didnt have many contacts at home)

-How do I apply more successfully for advertised jobs?

-What kind of upskilling training do you suggest?

-Any other tips?

I really wanna stay in journalism and not leave this super competitive and struggling industry I am so deeply in love with.",OutsideBetter4386,2,1.0,4,1717824673,2024-06-08 05:31:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1davlmy/company_i_freelance_for_has_money_issues_how_do_i/,6,2024

1datvxe,"Company might declare bankruptcy, would I be protected as an employee?","Not looking for legal advice, just wondering what people think about this situation.  
  
I work for a small US based company, fewer than 10 employees excluding the founder (non-US foreign national), and it's suddenly come to my attention that we might have only a couple months of cash to continue running operations. 

When I was offered the position at the beginning of the year I insisted that the length of the employment contract be at least 1 year and include PTO + a 24 week severance package to ensure I could relocate and gain stability in a HCOL area, and I committed to a very expensive (for me)  1-year lease that wouldn't make it easy to simply pick up and leave. 

There remain 6 months on the contract but I'm concerned that the company is just going to straight up declare bankruptcy before the contract is up, and the founder might simply hide away in his native country making it impossible to sue for violating contract agreements and us employees just getting stiffed. I'm pretty certain if this is the plan he will try to dodge the PTO payout and severance package for me.

1dasp1n,Am I Overreacting Here?,"I've been with my current company for a year and a half now.  I'm a member of our sales team and been really performing will for this company, have become well-liked by my peers, and have demonstrated excellent leadership and significant sales growth in my role.  Our VP of Sales, also very well-liked and friends with the company owners long before he came to work here, recently decided to take a job with another company.  I am very clearly the most capable and likely candidate to transition into his VP of Sales role that is now vacant and have experience in senior management roles with multiple other previous companies.  This week while the existing VP of Sales was transitioning out of the company, two of the company owners came to me and told me that they want me to transition into this role.  I told them that I welcome the opportunity to increase my leadership with this company and it was decided that we'll talk more about what this would look like next week.

This afternoon, one of our remote senior managers called to check in with me and told me that he was looking forward to me taking on an increased leadership role in the company.  He then says ""I talked to (outgoing VP of Sales) and told him that he's leaving on good terms and knowing this company if his new opportunity doesn't work out I'm sure this company would welcome you back"" (we've had a few employees leave for other companies only to come back to work for this company).  Weird, I know.

I was very concerned hearing this and his comments have curbed my enthusiasm for moving into this role.  The last thing I want to do is be a placeholder only to have this outgoing employee decide he doesn't like his new gig and ask to return to our company, only to have me bumped back to my previous role.  I'm currently planning to share this comment that was made to me today with the senior managers that I will be talking to next week and telling them that I only want to be considered if I have their full commitment, otherwise I would prefer to table this transition and see if it makes sense sometime down the road.

This is bothering me the more I think about it, and I just can't imagine why anyone would make a comment like that to someone that would be coming into a new role like this.

One even went as far as putting in the word to keep me there. Even told me that I’m better than the current guy because I stay on top of my work. Another told me to not expect to stay in the vehicle for much longer. That they’d definitely want me in the office. And that this company will make a position for me just to keep me. That’s a lot of compliments I didn’t expect.

-Year two, I got promoted to a supervisor, at which I received a 9% increase. (Which was not enough, and I am now aware of this)

1dap9dl,"How long can you stay in an irrelevant, dead-end job without it hurting your chances of going back?","Hello! In essence, I want to know for how long is it safe to spend working a job you know won't contribute to career progress or isn't exactly in your field without it having a negative effect on job prospects after?

Specifically, I'm a student working towards my BS in environmental science. I have a great opportunity for a job after I graduate that has nothing to do with the field. It would incorporate a lot of skills that come naturally to me and would be tons of fun (the main attraction here, really), but has nothing to do with conservation or environmental science. Additionally, it has no opportunity for advancement and the salary is really low.

Given these things, should I take the job and how long could I stay without it hurting my chances of doing something more technical or science related afterwards? My fear is that when I leave I would be too behind or would be considered less hireable because I'm further away from the skills learned in my degree, or because I ""waste of timed."" Would it be a better idea to do something more career related after I graduate, hold that for a few years, then come back to this idea? My college journey has been exhuasting and I want to do something fun, fulfulling, and low stress before I start to look into 'serious jobs' but I'm scared of missing a critical time to get my foot in the door or establish necessary skills. 

My guess is that if there was ever a time to do it, right after graduating would be best, but when the culture around university and jobs is so competitive, I can't help but feel like it would put me at a disadvantage. What is the sweet spot between wasting too much time doing something irrelevant, and staying for long enough to pick up marketable/transferrable skills, enjoy my time, and show I can be committed to an employer before moving on? Ultimately, I'm just wondering where it would put me in terms of the ""ideal path"" after graduation, so thoughts and input from any fields are welcome. Thanks!

1dap1ot,Not Considered for Managerial Position,"I work as a software developer for a large-sized company. Been there for 2.5 years. I have about 8 YoE.

Recently, I applied for a managerial position at this company with another team. I’ve worked with this team before, and know pretty intimately what they do. Their recent manager left and I saw the position posted so I applied. It’s a small team of 3 junior engineers. The reason I applied is because one of the main products they deliver is a data analytics/visualization platform to the greater team. I developed one internally too, by myself. And mine’s notably more popular, but has, up until lately, had little official backing by management.

The hiring manager looked over my application  (and cover letter) after I emailed them. They said I didn’t qualify because it required managerial experience. Although that wasn’t explicitly listed in the job description.

 I thought, fine, whatever. Fast forward three weeks and 2 of the 3 members I would hypothetically lead are asking for my peer feedback for their annual performance review. 
I gave them good feedback, as I’ve periodically met with them and given them guidance/inputs in the past on their feature rollouts and what I think the greater team really needs. 

Today, after our latest meeting reviewing some of their work, the hiring manager pulled me aside on a telecall and asked me to work closely with this team and guide them to integrate our two data platforms together. I told them I would look into the details, but that I have other commitments in my current position. 

I felt upset. If they want me to guide the team and work closely with them, I think they should give me the job, or, minimally, have the courtesy to formally interview me. I don’t otherwise have a mandated responsibility to help (though I want to, I’m passionate about this work), as my reporting chain doesn’t go through the hiring manager. I’m thinking of bringing up my application again, politely, in an email. Is this outwardly confrontational? What’s the best course of action here?

1dao16k,need help! possibly getting fired. ," I started a new job at a daycare on April 8th. Last week at work I noticed I became very dizzy and confused towards the middle of the day. I finished out the day but called in sick for the next two days. It was truly a very scary experience for me, and I didn’t feel like I could work while feeling this way. I went to urgent care the day I called out and got a doctors note. So, I called out thursday and friday and when I came into work on Monday I was still feeling terrible but I decided to go anyways because I didn’t want to get fired and I know this looks terrible as new employee. On Monday when I walked in, I asked to speak to the assistant director and gave her my doctors note. While I was talking to her I began having a panic attack because I was still feeling super dizzy and confused. The nurse at my job told me she recommended that I go home and rest, so I did. I could tell the assistant director was very annoyed but i truly couldn’t help it. Anyways, i’m finally feeling better and I finished out the rest of the week as normal. However, to my luck, last night I came down with food poisoning. When the morning came around and it was time for me to go to work, I was still throwing up. I of course had to call in because i physically could not make it to work. I called the director and apologized and said i know this looks terrible on me since i just called in last week, but i’ve come down with food poisoning and won’t be able to make it to work. Per her words she said “Okay well i hope you get to feeling better. When you come in next week it’s time for us to have a serious conversation. Get better maam.” Like?? Does this sound like i’m getting fired? I’m terrified. I really like my job and it truly is not like me to call out this often but I couldn’t help it. What are my rights here? What should i do?

I had a rocky start at the company being referred by the manager I worked with at my previous job but little did I know how much she actually grew to hate it. Despite asking me to come work with her multiple times especially because the money was great at the time. However, upon getting hired that week the company decided to cut everyone’s pay, so half the team quit that week I started so I knew what it was about to be like but I did not feel like having to worry about finding a job and being unemployed so I stuck to it and did my best every day. Then my manager quits 2 weeks later and doesn’t even say anything to me or like at least let me known what was going on?? So I had to deal with an understaffed (but amazing team) for awhile until we got a new manager and more associates. My team saw that I was great at doing a lot of the tasks in the store and I asked the district manager if I could be promoted and she was totally fine with it and everyone else was but she didn’t want to promote me until our new manager started which was fine I knew what my talents were and I applied. The new manager contacts me asking when I can do an interview and I mentioned to her I already was working at the store it was all out of wanting a promotion and she was fine with it and said we could meet with the district manager and go through the interview process. But once she started and as the days went by of her training , she does a group hiring event and hires someone else in the position I applied for, who just had only worked at the same store but just was at a different location. That same day my application said “not selected”. When all the new associates started they began to cut the previous workers hours and gave more out to the new hires and mine just got less and less.

In my first and a half years was an indie developer on Play Store, but as the policies got tighter in Google Play, my account got banned. I tried again and was banned again. Then there were around 6 months of contract work for a company. After that, I worked as a freelancer for around a year. Later I got hired in a company as a full-time developer. In this company, I worked for around two and a half years. Then I quit the position. It was a startup with no vision, not moving towards any goal, and there were continuous layoffs. So I quit before being laid off.

1dafnrl,Should I resign from my state job due to being denied time off? ,"So, I'm in a predicament. I just graduated from a master's program in May and took a salaried job with the state where I live. After a lengthy and involved interview process, in which I was very clear about needing a short amount of time off this summer for my wedding, I got the job and started about a month ago. 

The time has come to start coordinating with my boss regarding how I can accomplish this time off. They're being wishy-washy with me, mainly citing that I have only earned about ten hours off, which I understand. Still, this is a wedding I have been planning for over a year, and they were well aware of for months before hiring me. 

Some compounding things are that I am looking at taking a federal contracting job that will ""hopefully"" start in late July or August, but I have only received a conditional job offer and not a start date. Quitting my current job is a big gamble, and I do not want to accrue a big negative leave balance that I will have to pay back at the end of my time here. 

  
I'm thinking of asking for permission to telework as that's a capability we have, or at least unpaid leave (which I am completely fine with) and, barring that, or with the insistence of taking on a big leave deficit, tendering my resignation. 

My question is, am I way off base on this? 

  
Also, before I get asked, I took the job initially, intending to hold it for longer. Still, I had recruiters from my desired career field reach out to me as soon as I started, and these jobs paid nearly 40% more than my current salary and were located in a city a thousand miles closer to family.

I deal with work of entries and quotation. 

Now it's been 3 days since I started working there , I am the youngest there rest all are 21+.

So they all think of me as a fool and give me looks I don't like.

Since it's been just three days , I am still learning how to deal with insurance portals there are 19 portals . I am still new to entries at CRM and quotations.

I have to get each and everything checked by the seniors and as they all are busy . So by the time they come to check the portal it gets crashed and I had to re enter everything .

Another thing is there are 2 other fresher who joined but it's been 13 days since they joined . For the first 10 days all they did was entries on portals . It was the first day of mine and tenth day of them when sir taught us about quotations . As he didn't want to waste his time explaining again and again.

They both have better understanding than me , and are ofc way faster than me  . But boss doesn't seem to get this. He thinks I am insufficient and is nkt concentrating enough . 

He often tells the ma'am who sits beside me to not trust my entries and check again n again very minutely. 

The manager today scolded me on askimg a ques about how the insurance field works . He stated ofc in a strict rude tone that he learnt the work in a week , he said we are dumb we dont read carefully and should stay away from distractions and many more things .

From past two days I remained silent in the company,  it was the first time I tried to initiate with the seniors around me as I finished the quotations given to me . But:(

Nobody seems to like my presence.

I need to excel this job,  I have got this after immense hardships . I need this to support my family.

1dae8z9,Manager wouldn't provide bad news in the moment and I'm unsure of next steps,"I work in a mid-level supply chain position for a retail company. There has been very relevant changes/decisions made in the company that impact me and my responsibilities specifically and will make my job more challenging (way moreso than most on the team). I was not told about these changes ahead of time and received details about the changes from talking to a coworker. A week or so later the specifics were provided by my manager.

In many ways, I can understand why my manager wouldn't tell me ahead of time. She doesn't want to be the bearer of bad news, especially when the news is the result of a company decision, this position does not have much autonomy, and my position specifically has had several months in the past where things have been very challenging. In addition, I haven't handled bad news very well in the past (not getting angry, just expressing frustration and disappointment on more than one occasion, even over the same thing), and I didn't enjoy the very challenging periods in the past.

However, this makes me very worried that my manager really doesn't like me very much, or at the very least believes that it's better to withhold information from me because of my reactions in the past (completely justified). When we meet once a week it's always all smiles though and she does ""show empathy"" over the fact that things will be difficult for the foreseeable future. 

In addition, I received positive marks one year ago on my annual review and got a 3% raise (less than inflation and WAY less than the increase in prices our company put in place), and a month ago I received very positive marks and a 4% raise. However,  I did the math recently and I'm getting paid basically the same as my initial 2019 salary after adjusting for inflation, and the company has raised prices ~30+% in that time. I feel like with the increased responsibilities I should be getting paid 5-10% more than what I was getting paid in 2019, but I'm not really due for a promotion or title change based on where I'm at in my career. 

I really want to be on good footing with the company and my manager going forward, and I feel like I need to have a ""heart to heart"" of some kind with my manager. I feel I have 3 options.

1. Do/say nothing, have a positive attitude and wait one year for the next annual review and at that time request a 10+% raise, citing the extra work done and positive ""team player"" attitude. One downside, besides the wait, is rather the year performance-wise will not look that great compared to this last year because I already know I'm not going to hit my goals because I did quite well last year. Another downside is this is a large increase to ask for, and if it's denied I'm back at square one but it's a year later.

2. Request a 5+% raise now, citing recent past performance and a commitment to having a positive, team player attitude going forward, even with the upcoming challenges. Not sure whether to mention the fact that my salary is basically the same as 2019 and the substantial price increases over that time.

3. Talk very directly about my worry about the fact that I wasn't given negative news that would affect my job ahead of time/when it happened, and directly address/ask why she would feel uncomfortable giving me that news. Ask how I can develop professionally/personally to change my reputation/approachability.  Do not ask for a raise. This opens the door for a better relationship and better communication going forward, but I have no doubt that 1-2 years from now my salary will still basically be the same inflation-adjusted, and at the end of the day I'm basically directly questioning her management style.",Illustrious-Dish7248,1,1.0,1,1717775820,2024-06-07 15:57:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dae8z9/manager_wouldnt_provide_bad_news_in_the_moment/,6,2024
1dadivn,Am I screwed for taking a job outside my field of interest?,"So for some background, I graduated with an MS in physics. I was ""theory"" focused which translated mostly to data analysis and data science in Python (including some mild database stuff) the point is it was mostly technical/coding. I got a taste for it and decided when I graduated I wanted to try to work in DS/data engineering, as this was something other grads had done and I find it interesting.

When I actually graduated I had trouble finding any relevant jobs, and I'm not in a financial position to sit and wait for the perfect opportunity so I just had to take any job that would hire me, this ended up being in a commercial chemistry lab, which as I've found out has absolutely zero relevance to any work I've done previously or any of my professional or academic interests. If it weren't for practicing coding/math in my free time all my skills I've acquired would have completely deteriorated. 

It's not been almost a year since Ive been hired and I've had no luck in my job search. Honestly, at this point I don't even need to get hired in my chosen career path, I just want to get out of this field but the longer I'm here the more impossible that seems, and I can't imagine how to justify all this time at an irrelevant job to a recruiter/interviewer.

I apologize for the long winded post, but does anyone have any advice on how to proceed? Like how to sell this experience in a resume/LinkedIn? Should I just omit it from job applications? Should I give up entirely?

1dadir7,Job titles during interview process are different,"I’m currently in process of a job interview and the role I thought I applied for was director, as well as when I applied on their website, however when I also submitted the application on LinkedIn (initial application), it said manager. The job responsibilities are a lot and I know I bring value due to my previous experiences and companies I’ve worked at. The hiring manager was very impressed during our initial call and kept referring to one of my previous roles that was at a very reputable company in the industry. When I mentioned the confusion in job titles, he said he was only aware it’s a manager role but that he might be able to push for director with his boss. 

I looked at his LinkedIn and saw he posted two posts 2-3 weeks ago, one for the manager and one for the director. The director role being the most recently posted. There is no manager role on the company website either, and when he sent me the job description pdf, the title up top says manager but throughout the description it keeps referring to title as a director. I’m supposed to do a final panel interview coming up but am unsure of how to address this should they want to continue with me. I’d really be interested only if it was a director role as I’ve already done the same manager role previously, and this company is very small and relatively unknown. They didn’t have too many applicants and from the sound of it he made it sound like I was one of few applicants for the job.

1dadapu,High pay careers that are disability friendly?,"I'm exhausted and thinking about my future. I trying to figure out a career path with fairly high pay (so that I can afford to work part-time). Due to invisible disability that gives me fatigue, pain and sometimes brain fog I feel like it's easy to be negative about many paths. It sucks since **I'm actually quite smart and have a good memory**, generally speaking. On my good days I can do about anything I put my mind to. However, on my bad days, I get tired too easily, maybe I am in so much pain that a simple task like sitting in a chair is exhausting. When it's really bad I also get confused and might forget details. I take pain killers as needed.   
  
The things I like to do on my good days do not correlate with my bad days. I love being social, talking, presenting things and just doing about anything. But when a bad day hits I'm just not the same person. Having to do multiple things and being social too is just too demanding energy wise.

I need something that I can do well even on bad days or at least have the liberty to take a day (or a week) off when I feel too bad. Yes, I'm aware of disability benefits but I'd also like to know of other options. I like to have my independence and wealthfare is in decline where I live. I've considered IT but I'm worried the competition would be too demanding of my energy levels. I've previously considered health care, teaching, leadership roles, HR and consultancy. I'm also an environmentalist and contributing too much to climate change would mess with my soul in the long run.

1dacf4d,Should I take a good career opportunity in another state or wait for something better?,"I'm struggling with deciding whether to take a job in a nearby state that my SO and I have no desire to relocate to. However, the job is a good opportunity to advance my career in a management role for a small specialized industry and would likely open doors to more roles that are beyond my current experience and qualifications. The following points are the biggest considerations:

 **Living Arrangements:** I have a relative that I would be able to live with temporarily before fully committing to the job and a move. My SO would stay behind for the time being because she has a very good job that is not remote, and neither of us want her to give that up. This would mean living apart until I get a feel for the job and whether or not it will be enough of a fit to commit to staying in the state.

 **Financial Considerations:** My significant other earns $150K annually in a HCOL area and has offered to support us financially until I find another job that doesn’t require a move to that state.  However, I prefer not to be financially dependent on her, and the uncertainty of how long it might take to find another job in my niche industry concerns me. Job postings are very rare but I'm always considered since my resume is tailored to that specific field. I've been actively searching since August of last year and have gotten three interviews. Two of them I was edged out by other applicants and the third is this one.

The job is offering $80K annually in a MCOL state with no state income tax. I was recently laid off and am currently working an easy entry-level remote job that pays more than unemployment. Advancement through this company is not a viable option and I would continue my daily job search.

 **Career Development:** The main benefit of this job is the potential career development in my specialized field. It could provide valuable learning opportunities and allow me to transition into more advanced roles in the future. I've worked my way up in this field without a degree, and pivoting to another field would likely require going back to school and starting at entry level, meaning continued financial support from my partner.

 **Trial Period:** We considered treating the job as a trial period to see how things play out, but this increases expenses. I would be paying rent to my relative and continuing to contribute to our expenses at home. Another added expense would be flights to/from home to see each other.

 After weighing the pros and cons, the main benefit is the opportunity for career advancement without having to start over. The issues include financial strain, relationship strain, and logistical challenges.

 What should I do?",No_Statement7179,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1717771259,2024-06-07 14:40:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1dacf4d/should_i_take_a_good_career_opportunity_in/,6,2024

1daa2ij,If I had to go back to my freshman year to study automation and control theory.,"Returning to Freshman Year, the first priority is to make a good plan. Automation&controls has diverse directions, mainly including electronic courses, control courses, mathematical courses, computer courses, and a small portion of signal courses.

Freshmen often lack a clear vision and planning ability for the future because they are unsure about the applications, job prospects, and industry market conditions of these courses.

Let's explore the various career paths within these major categories for planning purposes.

First, focusing on electronics, which includes analog and digital electronics, semiconductor devices, signal processing, electromagnetic field theory, high-frequency electronic circuits, and other related courses.

Employment directions: Hardware Engineer, FPGA Engineer, Embedded Engineer (Hardware & Software), Baseband Engineer, PCB Engineer, RF Engineer. These professions involve designing the internal circuitry of devices like smartphones or any product that requires networking and electricity.

This direction is suitable for students interested in circuit design and hardware-related development.

Second, focusing on control, which covers courses like Principles of Automatic Control, Modern Control Systems, Nonlinear Control Systems, and advanced control methods like fuzzy control, neural network control, and genetic algorithm optimization. System Identification also falls under this category.

It's important to note that control courses have high mathematical requirements, and it may be difficult to find employment directly after undergraduate studies. An example of control application is flight control, where drones need to maintain stability and correct their position in response to wind gusts.

Control engineers can find employment in automation equipment design, control system development, and debugging in manufacturing companies. They can also work in energy, power, transportation, oil and chemicals, aerospace, and medical equipment and bioengineering industries.

Third, focusing on mathematics, automation students can pursue further studies in master's or doctoral programs, take an academic route, and become university professors specializing in cutting-edge control theory research.

Fourth, focusing on computers, automation courses cover C language, data structures and algorithms, computer networks, operating systems, and embedded systems. For this direction, students can choose a specific field in computer science, such as front-end development, back-end development, C++, computer vision, machine learning, or natural language processing. This path is suitable for those who enjoy programming and can lead to web development, server development, client development, game development, and emerging fields like artificial intelligence and autonomous driving.

Lastly, focusing on signals, which in the undergraduate stage, mainly involves the course ""Signals and Systems."" This direction requires self-study in communication principles, electromagnetic waves, and other communication-related courses. It's suitable for those interested in wireless communication and electromagnetic waves and can lead to employment in telecommunication operators or equipment manufacturers.

Market and industry analysis:

The electronics market is closely related to the semiconductor market, which is experiencing robust growth. The chip industry is receiving national support. Salary ranges from 4k to 30k, depending on skills and experience. Employment in this field is expected to remain strong.

The control engineering market may be challenging for those without advanced degrees, as it often involves non-standardized, customized solutions for the manufacturing industry, which has relatively low profit margins. Entry-level salaries range from 4k to 8k. However, the long-term prospects are positive.

Mathematics-focused careers can lead to high-paying jobs in quantitative trading, financial analysis, control theory research, and university teaching. Salary ranges vary significantly.

The computer industry is undergoing a transition from high to normal salaries. Entry-level salaries range from 6k to 20k, depending on qualifications and skills.

The signal processing field has a stable employment market without oversupply. It requires a strong interest in signals and mathematics to succeed.

Please note that this is an introductory overview and may contain inaccuracies. Interested individuals should seek more professional information on their chosen field.",Luckshire,0,0.5,0,1717765249,2024-06-07 13:00:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1daa2ij/if_i_had_to_go_back_to_my_freshman_year_to_study/,6,2024

I wanted to share my journey and how **Zero to Mastery (ZTM)** **Academy** has been a game-changer for me in getting back into the tech world, specifically in UX Design and Database Management.

A bit about my background: I have a versatile tech background with experience in information technology, health and safety, user service librarian, and sales. I hold certifications including a Master's in Digital Design and Innovation, a BSc. in Library and Information Science, Google UX Design Specialist, IBM Enterprise Design Thinking Practitioner, and Microsoft Technology Specialist (MCTS for SQL Server). Despite my qualifications, I found myself struggling with impostor syndrome and lacked confidence in my skills.

The **Zero to Mastery (ZTM)** **Academy** is instrumental in overcoming my challenges. The courses are meticulously designed and cover a wide range of topics. The instructors are incredibly experienced, committed, and passionate about teaching. Their real-world insights and clear explanations helped me grasp complex concepts with ease.

The UX Design course, in particular, was a revelation. It equipped me with the skills to create interactive wireframes and prototypes. A major part of the course was a project on building an eCommerce app from the ground up, focusing on interactive design using Figma tools. This hands-on project significantly enhanced my practical skills and understanding of user-centered design principles, and such a project can be a standout piece in your portfolio!

ZTM's Database Management course was another milestone. It refreshed my SQL skills and introduced me to advanced database management techniques, reinforcing my confidence in handling data-driven projects.

The ZTM Discord community deserves a special mention. The support from fellow learners, the collaborative projects, and the shared resources were invaluable. The management and moderators are always ready to help, making the learning environment encouraging and inclusive.

Thanks to ZTM, I regained my confidence, polished my skills, and overcame impostor syndrome. I highly recommend ZTM to anyone looking to break into tech or upskill. It's not just about learning; it's about becoming part of a community that genuinely cares about your growth.

If you're on the fence about joining ZTM, take the leap. It's been one of the best decisions I've made for my career.

1da993v,Cloud Software Architect vs Staff Software Engineer career advice,"which one of the 2 roles would you say is more prestigious and is a bigger opportunity for Sr. Software Engineer? The 2 specific roles are:

A. Cloud Software Architect - architect new features/applications, communicate with clients, plan and deliver while leading small team.

B. Staff Software Engineer - engineer new/improve features, oncall escalations, lead small team while coordinating with and contributing occasionally to other teams. Seems more Lead than Staff.

I am leaning towards architect as higher level responsibility role, but staff/principal engineers are seemed to be paid much more? How career path of Architect (senior/principal) is different from Engineer (staff/principal)?

1da6zmz,Seeking Career Guidance: Transitioning to Testing or Data Analyst Roles,"Hello everyone,

I am seeking some guidance on my career path and would appreciate your insights. Here's a bit about my background and current dilemma:

**Background:**

County : India

I worked as a developer at Cognizant for around 1 year and 3 months. Despite my efforts, I struggled with coding and asked management to transfer me to another role or project. Unfortunately, I was benched and eventually let go. 

Following that, I joined Amazon's seller support team in a non-technical role. This job had a high workload and stringent targets, akin to a sales position. After about 11 months, I decided to resign due to the workload and low salary.

**Current Dilemma:**

I am now at a crossroads and unsure of which career path to pursue. I am not interested in returning to non-technical roles or the BPO industry due to the high workload and low compensation.

I am considering two options:

1. **Testing**
2. **Data Analyst**

I prefer these options as they generally require minimal coding. However, I have concerns:
- I've heard that AI is increasingly taking over testing jobs.
- The data analyst market appears saturated with many aspiring to enter this field.

Despite this, I am leaning towards a career as a data analyst because of the potential for growth into roles like data engineer or business analyst after gaining some experience.

**Questions:**

1. Given my situation, which career path would you recommend?
2. What kind of CTC can I expect after acquiring the necessary skills in these fields?
3. Is it possible to frame my previous experience to be relevant for a data analyst role? If so, how should I do this?
4. For those in testing or data analyst roles, could you recommend some resources to master the required skills?
5. Any additional advice or suggestions are welcome.

Thank you in advance for your help!",Excellent_Beach_9179,1,1.0,0,1717754573,2024-06-07 10:02:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1da6zmz/seeking_career_guidance_transitioning_to_testing/,6,2024
1da6qgg,21 M in law school thinking of ending it,"currently starting my 4th year of law school. the first year in law school I was very excited because I thought my classmates are smart and the profs are smart it didn't take long for me figure out that's not the case. some obviously are smart but nothing to make me feel excited.

In the last 3 years I have done internships In litigation and corporate law out of these 6 internship I only liked 1 in arbitration everything else was hell. Right now I am at the internship.

I don't feel that excited when I'm in office nor do I find the conversations interesting nor do I look at the partners/associates and be like I want to be like them.

IF I could rate my interest in law it 4/10, sometimes its interesting but most of the time its not, the pain of it heavily outweighs my motivation and the fun, the work does not seem challenging, I don't feel like there's any value to what I do, there is no risk, I do not like feeling useless using ms word all day.

I have seen people who actually like this field, I am not one of those, I have seen myself excel in thing that I am interested in, Law des not seem like it at this point.

My question is, have I given this field enough time to leave it or should I be exploring more areas in it, read more into laws on my own which I accept I don't because I expect the environment and the things in college/internship to motivate me but it doesn't.

should I be trying more or should I give up and try to do something else? i freelanced for a year in media and I loved it worked 12 hours a day, best days, I think I am better suited for either creative or entrepreneurship because I like the central freedom and risk

1da4m7y,I messed up with my mentor and now she’s cold with me,"I’m using a throwaway acc just in case. 

Context:
I’m 21F and my mentor is im guessing 60F. I have been working at this job for 4 months now, but my mentor does not like me. I assume she doesn’t like me because she talks to everyone in a different manner compared to me. 

When i was hired, they understood I had no prior experience in the field. I was always open to learning new skills the job had to offer. They also liked that I mentioned that I ask a lot of questions. However, the trainings were not what i was used to. It was very spread out and done once a week. I prefer to have it almost every single day until I finished all of the training and I am trusted to start doing things on my own. I am also a doer, so notes are great but I learn best when I do things to gain muscle memory. I trusted my mentor’s process regardless. 
My mentor stopped trainings after awhile, I’m guessing a month or a few weeks after the start of training? I forgot why, but that’s when things went down hill. I was still lost on what to do and I just assumed it’s bc I’ve only be around for a month or a few weeks. 
I started on some projects and while I was trained on them, I like to have verbal confirmation on what I’m doing. When I sat down next to my mentor to complete the project, she became impatient with me. I didn’t think much of it at the time because I understand that mentoring can be frustrating and I have a different learning style, but a few days after that I was called to have a meeting on how I haven’t been progressing at a rate they want. It was only 2 months and a few weeks when I had that meeting. 
She said she noticed that I don’t take notes.  I did take notes, I just prefer to physically do it and have confirmation on what I’m doing. 
She was also frustrated because she had to repeat herself on things she has told me before. 
And she compared me to my coworker who is 10 years older than me and has had a longer work background than I have. She also has a different learning style. She is also, in fact, a whole different person from myself. 
I had these weekly meetings/trainings for a couple weeks. They have ended recently. 
I felt like absolute shit. My mentor used to be sweet to me up until I started doing projects. And her critiques were valid. I could’ve been better at taking notes. I should’ve told her I wanted to change the frequency of the trainings. I should’ve been better at referring back to my notes before asking questions. I should’ve known WHAT questions to ask. I shouldn’t ask for handholding. 
Now she is cold to me. She talks to everyone else differently compared to me. 
Today, she was extra irritated with me when I asked her a question on a new process that I am not familiar with. The entire room could hear. I teared up at my desk. 
I’ve made a lot of mistakes in the beginning, but I just want to at least be on good terms with her. I don’t know what to do. I know I am not a superstar employee. I just want a decent connection with my mentor. Any advice or critiques are welcome, I want to do better.

1da4bkl,Changing jobs for the same salary? (Content Writer with 2.5 yrs of experience),"Hi, I am assuming this is a pretty common question that might have been asked before in this sub, so thank you if you take the time to read this.

I have been working with my current company (say company A) for 2 years now. It's a basic B2C mid-level fashion brand. Right now, I do feel like there is nothing new to learn here. The promotional campaigns based on the festivals (Christmas, Valentine's Day etc.) are repeating now and the content I write is almost the same. 

The new company (say company B, fashion industry itself) is much bigger in size and much older. I will join them as a content writer specifically for fashion stores they will open overseas. This is a new vertical which they have started, so the team in this vertical is small, but we will get a lot of guidance from established store-teams in my native country. 

**The catch:**

* Salary is same (fixed is same as in company A + there is 10% variable component added by company B, based on performance)
* The office location of company B is farther than A (no WFH in both companies). 
* The above reason may lead to me spending more in commute with B

Here are my potential (really clueless) action plans:

* Keep looking for further jobs (not in fashion industry) with a better salary, and then pitch this for B
* Accept the job offer by B since it is interesting and related my field of fashion studies.

Growing up i was a bad kid, in elementary school i was always really slow, im not dumb but it just always took me time to catch onto things, i never really not the resources i needed and for as long as i can remember i've always been a F-D average student. I've never won a award i've never done anything special.

In high school i was really bad, i smoked a lot of weed, drank too much, and got kicked out of two high schools. i just bareelllyyyy graduated, i had no cords or anything but i graduated and i think that's the only accomplishment i've ever achieved throughout my school years.

Idk why i decided to go to college but i just wanted so badly to be educated. I didn't even know what i was going to college for and no one in my family has ever been to college so i have no support. the first year i just signed up for random classes that now have no benefits towards me. Every semester i've also failed at least one or two classes. My gpa rn is is at a 1.08, embarrassing right.

I made a appointment with a counselor cause i know ineed help and extra resources but he explained to me that i will get a email saying i will get withdrawn from the college in fall for 6 months if i don't submit a appeal, so i can still submit my appeal and be safe. But then we talked about how to get myse, graduate and get back on track and it's looking like i'll be here for another two years. So in total four years at a community college and then i'll have to do two years at a state college. So 6 years total for a job that averages 60k a year. Now i'm so stuck on what to do. I don't want to be a loser and live with my parent forever, i also don't wanna disappoint them by dropping out but i know they will be even more disappointed to hear i'll be at this college for another two years when they think i'll graduating sometime next year.

I've been working since i was 13, i bought a 15k car in full at the age of 17, i'm the hardest worker i know, i'm just not book smart and never have been. I want something stable but i also don't wanna feel like i'm just letting go on my dreams. idk i'm so stuck, any advice? u can be brutally honest. what would u do in my situation?",Additional-Win7502,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1717742138,2024-06-07 06:35:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1da45z6/thinking_of_dropping_out_any_advice/,6,2024

I had a breakdown after two and a half years working there and HAD to quit. Fast forward to now, a year and a half later and I’m DEFEATED. I feel like a failure bc I can’t find another job despite having worked with these big names… so I’ve been working retail so far but that’s not enough money rn or sustainable OR fulfilling.

Well no one wanted to hire me after a year of apps and redoing my portfolio and resume over and over and over to the point of
Exhaustion.

 I recently decided since that wasn’t working, I’m going to pivot slightly and stay in fashion but go into buying or visual merchandising.. I’m just stressed all the time and the thought of applying to MORE AND MORE AND MORE stuff just kills me. I feel like I’m drowning and I think ab this al the time.. and about money and about purpose and about how I’m being PERCIEVED.
I need advice on how to get over this overwhelming fear and dread I get EVERYTIME I look at postings. I need to know that I’ll get out of this.


I did very very well in school. I think the pandemic really fucked up my brain and my career and my life. I double majored and graduated w a minor from one of the top fashion schools in the world. I was really busy in school doing tons of extracurricular and getting great internships and opportunities and I felt so driven. I had recognition from massive names in the industry. I felt great. Then I graduated in the pandemic in 2020 and took the first job offered (the terrible job that led to my breakdown last year) and I feel like a failure. Like that set me back. I see all of my friends moving “on” and getting great jobs and moving forward and getting married and having kids and I’m just… not anywhere near them or my own personal goal which is to just be financially INDEPENDENT. I want to be creative in my career, but I need money really badly first and foremost.

How do I get over this terrible fear??????????? Even applying to part time or internships or retail… no one is hiring or I don’t hit the requirements. Plus I’ve been working retail so throughout school, my entire life. I’m tired of it. But I’ll do anything, really. I’m getting scared. Is there any kind of career advice.. please.

1da27ra,I went to HR to discuss the current workload in my role and now my boss want's a one week work diary. Should I be worried?,"For a while now my role has felt ambiguous. After bringing up my concerns numerous times without any direction I decided to go straight to HR, not even an hour later I got a call from my boss asking if I was free for a few minutes. During our phone conversation, we talked about my feeling uncomfortable with the lack of defined expectations in my current role due to the fact I am now being asked to take on extra tasks that are not what I was hired for.   
  
I have no problems taking on the extra work, it means there's an opportunity for me to grow but the tasks are not at the level of a co-ordinator but that of a manager. My boss has now asked me to pull together a work diary for next week and then we can have a super-informed discussion to facilitate role clarity. 

Should I be worried? I did call them out and ask if they were trying to performance manage me to which they denied it and said if they wanted me out of the company I wouldn't be there.   
  
But I still feel unsure and to be honest worried I've kicked a hornet's nest and might be out on my ass by the end of the month. I'm on a salaried position and well past my probation period so they can't just fire me without good reason, but I'm still worried. 

Any advice would be welcome. ",Glum_Mix_6562,0,0.5,15,1717734790,2024-06-07 04:33:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1da27ra/i_went_to_hr_to_discuss_the_current_workload_in/,6,2024
1da268w,Not sure if I should push my luck.,"I recently signed an offer letter for a higher position. My boss that I would be working under just got bumped up a rank and so there's a void in the hierarchy. There is a 6 month lockout on starting a new position.

I want to put in for the position that he is leaving so it would end up being a double promotion for me. I haven't even actually started the rank down position yet, so I think technically I'm eligible. 

I work in a niche industry that requires a license that is not common. Odds are pretty good I would be literally the only person qualified and wanting the position.  This company has a track record of burning people down with time requirements. 

But it's my first management role in the company and don't want to rock the boat too much because it is a good old boys club at that level and I'm younger for the industry. 

If I get the position I will embrace the suck for a few years and use the title attached to my name to get in elsewhere that has a better work life balance. 

I feel like the worst they can say is no...

In the past year I have discovered that I really enjoy physical work and although I love the idea of being a sport teacher, I 100% would have taken a trade straight out of high school if I could go back in time.

I want to make good money as I want to be able to financially support a family in my future, with my wife not having to worry about working while raising children. 

It's very tempting to switch to a trade after I finish my degree however I would then be in debt AND on an apprenticeship wage. I'm thinking of ways I can work teaching AND labour such as early morning labour followed by relief teaching.

1da1n54,How do I Negotiate in My Part-Time Job? Looking for a Bonus + Salary Increase and/or Become an Employee,"I am a college student who is doing part-time work of tutoring on the side. I am making 40/hr for tutoring and 25/hr for other work like admin + social media, and I thought I was making pretty good money given I only work a few hours a week. I ended up making \~1600 last year, and I asked my boss if he could help me learn to do taxes as I asked in my interview if he could and he said yes at that time. But then he told me I didn't need to file taxes as long as I made under 13k, and I double confirmed by asking if self-employment also falls under that because he technically said I was an independent contractor. My boss said yes again and that he was really sure, and I'm sure he had no ill intentions (he is a family friend to my best friend who's known him since high school) as this is his first business. It was def my fault to just rely on my boss for correct information; I did talk to my family about this but they thought the same as my boss.

The tax filing deadline has passed, and I will be using a CPA to file taxes ASAP aka tomorrow. He told me that it would be $600 overall for taxes and around $60 for late penalty directly to the IRS. Because this is expedited too, it'll cost me $350 to pay the CPA. **Overall, my costs are -$600 tax for +$1600 income or -$1010 including the late penalty and expedited CPA filing.**

I am meeting my boss next week Monday for a lunch, and I hope to negotiate better terms for my continuing employment. I hope that he can pay me a **bonus of $360** at least for the late penalty + not paying half of the tax as an employer. **I also want to increase my rate** so I can certainly make more than minimum wage after taxes **and/or become an employee so I don't pay half the taxes**. For reference, the minimum wage for tutoring is $40/hr at my company and you can make up to $90/hr (*they do $10 salary increments*, but I never negotiated). Do note that I can also set my hours right now, so I would want a flexible schedule if I were to become an actual employee. I'm not sure how to negotiate the right way, but I see myself as a pretty valuable employee given I'm one of the earliest ones and I also help him in many different areas in the company.

**TLDR: My boss got confused that I, a college student doing part-time work, didn't need to pay taxes on my 1099, and I want to negotiate for a bonus to reimburse my costs + salary increase and/or become an employee. I have a lunch with him on Monday, how do I negotiate?**",IglooWater,1,1.0,0,1717732801,2024-06-07 04:00:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1da1n54/how_do_i_negotiate_in_my_parttime_job_looking_for/,6,2024

I was given an offer and i see a few red flags, a few of my friends are saying otherwise. I would like to know outside opinions.

I am a teacher with over 3 years of experience, i applied to a private school that listed 62k-72k as the salary. 

I interview with them, during my interview they tell me they typically hold multiple interviews and to expect to hear back from them soon. A week later i get an email directly emailing me an offer. They tell me that the offer is 60k and i have 48hrs to reply. So, an exploding offer. I email them back stating that i was expecting something in the middle of the 62-72 range they had advertised. They tell me it’s non negotiable stating no reason why. 

This job would involve relocating so the fact that they are only giving me 2 days to decide is a bit inconsiderate in my opinion, but my friends say “thats just business”.

1d9yn4k,I have no idea what my current career has become anymore and I don't know where to go from here,"So I may be quitting my job soon. There is a lot of mess that my boss caused, and even if they fix it, everything is ruined. I had a sweet deal, a job where I could kinda sorta waste my time but look busy and get paid a good amount.

My overarching goal is to be an author and screenwriter. I know that's not the most realistic goal, but it's what I love to do. So, I've been working to pay the bills and then focusing on writing when I get home. I broke away from food service and retail by getting into the film industry, but I hated it. Production involves a *minimum* 12-hour day and an extremely toxic work environment on pretty much every production I've been on. After the strikes, the film industry died, and it seems to still be quite dead. Plus, I live in Texas, where there isn't much of a film industry to begin with.

Currently, I work at a law firm as a demand writer. I write extremely long demand letters to send to opposing counsel to begin the mediation process. My boss does demand letters weird; we write 15-60 page documents covering all aspects of liability and medical damages, as well as emotional impact statements from client interviews. We then compile this big brochure document thing of all the evidence and everything we've collected from the case. This is followed by a very detailed PowerPoint to prep the attorney. It often feels like the demand writers are the ones making the entire argument and doing all the research.

Due to my skills with PowerPoint, I now make all the presentations for every case that goes to mediation, on top of managing my own list of demand letters and brochures. My boss pays very well, and either I lack confidence and don't realize how hard my job is, or they have no idea how easy my job actually is because I literally am on my phone all day. I get my work done on time, but I'm constantly paranoid someone is going to catch me.  There's also insane drama at work and people are leaving in droves. The drama doesn't involve me yet, but it will very soon if things go the way I know they're going to go.

I've updated my resume, but I don't know what to apply for. None of the jobs I see appeal to me. I feel like the last two years have been almost pointless beyond paying my bills and self care.  My boss might be psycho, but they are extremely generous with overtime and bonuses. But I don't even know what my title is anymore. I'm still a ""demand writer,"" but I do PowerPoints more than demands, and I handle a lot more than any other demand writers.

I don't want to work at all, but I will because I've almost been homeless in the past and it dealt a major blow to my mental health. I will work my butt off, I will put up with a lot if it means rent and the electric bill is paid and groceries are bought as a bare minimum.

Writing books and screenplays is an uphill battle, but I'm making slow progress. However, I need something to support myself, ideally something that can lead to a bigger paycheck. I recently got a raise to 55k, but I'd like something that pays more. My priority is a job that pays my bills and gives me time to work on my passions or just have more time at home.

I'm describing my current job as a ""media specialist"" because I edit videos ranging from depositions to client interviews that supplement the PowerPoints and demand letters. I don't know where I can go from here, what I qualify for, or what would be interesting to me. I don't even want to stay in San Antonio, though finding something here would mean I wouldn't have to move. But I just need the next *thing.* 

TLDR; My goal is to be an author and screenwriter, but I need a job to pay the bills. I currently work at a law firm writing lengthy demand letters and creating PowerPoint presentations. Despite good pay, my job has become increasingly stressful due to workplace drama, and I'm unsure what my actual job title is anymore. I don't know what to apply for next or how to use my current skills in a different role.

1d9y2v7,"Currently a Security Guard with a Poly Sci master's degree, unsure of what to do","Since I got my master's in January 2023, I've been trying to get a career going and utterly failing.  I ended up getting a job last August as a security guard working in an office building in Chicago, but i'm so burnt out.  

A little backstory, I have a poly sci bachelor's, and I did my master's in Russian and Eastern European politics and ended up doing it in Lithuania.  I moved back to the US hoping to get a job in a think tank, NGO or Non Profit, but getting any type of career going has been impossible.  I spent most of my time in college studying abroad and traveling.  While it was fun at the time, and I've been to probably 40+ countries, even places like Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, I realized I screwed myself by not doing any internships or getting work experience.  I figured the poly sci field was oversaturated by undergrad poly sci students, getting a masters would be enough to land something.  Boy was I wrong, but hey, at the time I didn't know, I was an idiot.  I did one internship that lasted a month my sophomore year of college and that was it and worked at a grocery store to save up money for studying abroad.  Luckily I have 0 student debt so I could be in a worse position than I am.  

On top of that, I don't know anyone in the US anymore because I was abroad so long.  All my friends live in different countries, and the people I knew from my undergrad days have moved off and I lost contact, so I have 0 network.  I don't have citizenship anywhere else so it's not like I can just move back to somewhere in Europe and apply for jobs over there, where I might have some people to network with.  

I've applied to over 500+ jobs over the past year, and the only thing I managed to get was this security job through a major security company that'll basically hire anyone, no education or any experience required.  I've even branched out from poly sci at this point, and I'll take anything that looks like it could be a career, but I can't even land an interview except for scam MLMs and things like that.  I even paid a guy to redo my resume and clean it up, but even that didn't do anything at all.  

I honestly have no idea what to do, I feel totally stuck.  I'm too late to do internships which might lead somewhere, but don't have experience for even entry level jobs, and the more time goes on, the less I can be considered a recent graduate.  I've thought about doing a PhD just to be able to call myself a ""student"" and hopefully qualify for internships, but that sounds overkill and poly sci looks like a waste at this point.  

At this point, I'm debating either joining the military, becoming a cop, or seeing about joining the border patrol or airport customs.  I do speak Russian and Italian at a somewhat basic conversational level so maybe that would give me a slight edge if I did join one of those, but none of them are really appealing to me, but I don't know what else.  

If anyone has any advice, I would love to hear it.

1d9xz46,I feel so lost in life,"I, 22F, imagined that by 23 I would be married, have a bachelors degree, my own house, and a great career. As I approach my 23rd birthday it seems that definitely won’t be my reality. 

I dropped out of university 3 months in back when I was 18, went through several jobs during the pandemic, and then took a medical laboratory assistant course a year ago and have just recently graduated. I got a job at one of the biggest laboratory companies in my country, I do mostly phlebotomy which I love, but it isn’t nearly enough to cover the bills as I’m only given 15-25 hours a week if I’m lucky. I make around $1500 a month, $730 goes to my car payments and insurance (which is extremely high in my city). I need my car as it is a job requirement. The rest I use to try and cover my overdue phone bill, gas, food, credit card, student loans, and maybe some new work clothes if I have anything left over. 

This is not the life I want to live. 

I’m thinking about going back to school for a bachelors, but I have no idea what degree to pursue and what degree would even be worth while. My brain is a total mess, I can hardly think straight, I want to move out of this country but have no idea how. Especially not having any money. 

I’m big into travel, culture, history, so I thought about a hospitality and tourism degree. 
I thought about a marketing degree as it seems like the more creative alternative to business or finance degrees.

Each project has different budgets, but even if I was liberal with my time I’d go over my budget hours or even worse commit time card fraud. 

When speaking to management, their advice has always been “reach out to other project leaders to ask for opportunities”.

1d9xwma,Should I reach back out to a company that I previously cancelled on last minute?,"In February, I had a phone interview for an internship position with this company. The interviewer no-showed the phone call, but he was very apologetic and polite about it so we rescheduled for the next morning. Phone interview went great and they invited me into the office. The night before I was supposed to go into the office to meet everyone in person, I found out my boyfriend had relapsed on opioids. I was supposed to be staying with him for 7 months for this internship and I almost broke up with him right there. I was so stressed and overwhelmed and didn't know what to do so I immediately emailed the company saying that it wouldn't work out. 

Fast forward and I'm still with my boyfriend after the relapse (he's not abusive, just broken but doing much better now) and he's been pushing me to reach back out to this company. The job listing is still up on their website and they had previously said that I was the only person who reached out about the job. It was a great opportunity, but I feel so embarrassed at the thought of reaching back out. I know there's really nothing to lose, but I didn't make a great first impression by cancelling the night prior. On the other hand they didn't make the best first impression either. I think I'm overthinking.

1d9vpi4,Seeking advice on job offer ,"Hello! 

Seeking a bit of advice on a job offer I received this morning cause I’m feeling a bit off. 

Some background: I just graduated college so this would be my first big person job and therefore not sure about things.  I currently work as a temp assistant for the place I have been working throughout college, I make a solid hourly pay but since I’m a temp no benefits. I love the team I work with and that is definitely the best part of my job. 

The offer: I got an offer for a substantially higher paying salaried position with benefits at a place that is much more aligned with my career goals. 

Why I’m dubious: 
- the interview process was quick and a bit odd, I had an initial phone interview followed by an interview in person. Both interviews were kind of weird because they didn’t ask me many questions about myself, my qualifications, etc. like they did ask some but not nearly as many as I’ve had in the past/would’ve expected. I kind of chalked this up to inexperienced hiring managers but still off putting 
- when I asked for additional time to review the offer they came back and said that I have until EOD tomorrow. I understand that this is a small company and they sincerely need to fill the position but it feels unfair that I have a little over 24 hours when they took almost two full weeks to get back to me. 

Let me know if you have any thoughts, I really appreciate any opinions as I am quite new to this career thing lol.

1d9vk0u,How can I use my Office Manager role to get back into Project Management?,"A few months ago, I interviewed for a Project Manager position and was really excited when I got the offer. But just a few weeks before I was supposed to start, they told me the job they were actually hiring for was Office Manager, not Project Manager. I was caught off guard, but the pay rate was still around the same range (which is pretty good for an Office Manager tbh). Considering I have some big expenses coming up, I decided to take the job.

I've been wanting to get back into Project Management since I have about three years of experience in that field. I had to leave my last PM job because I got laid off. I found a decent-paying data entry job and have been there for about two years. That’s why I was so happy when I thought I got offered the PM role—it felt like I still got it.

I've been in the Office Manager role for a few months. It's not my dream job but the income is pretty good. I plan to stick with it for at least a year, but I'm really aiming to move back into Project Management eventually.

So I'm looking for advice on how to make the most of my current position and pad my resume to even be considered for a PM role after this. Right now, my job mostly involves admin tasks and clerical support for the whole office. How can I use this experience to get into PM again? What skills should I improve on or maybe try to obtain while I'm here? Do I just read up on Project Management case studies? Maybe get a Master's in PM?",ElegantStrawberry277,2,1.0,1,1717714201,2024-06-06 22:50:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d9vk0u/how_can_i_use_my_office_manager_role_to_get_back/,6,2024

Long story short he got me an application after asking if they were hiring, and I’m just trying to weigh the pros/cons of this offer. After a year of unemployment, should I suck it up and take this job?

This could be a career advice question but yes, I know I should be making decisions for myself but some second opinions would really help me a lot.


	•Job Opportunity: Finally have a job after a year of searching.

	•Experience: Gain some experience in the electrician trade.

	•Training: On-the-job learning and hopefully some future opportunities.

Cons:

	•Work environment: My friend has told me countless stories of the bad workplace environment and when asked, he said they can be an 8 out of 10 when it comes to getting roasted. He said I would need “thick skin”, which I’m gonna be honest here, I don’t really have that.

	•Low Pay: I would start at $15/hour which apparently is lower than average (I guess)

	•Personal Conflicts: My friend has told me they go to twin peaks for lunch every Friday…. And my girlfriend would not like that very much lol. Plus I wouldn’t be driving the work truck so I’m kind of screwed there.

	•Working with my old friend : I would be working closely with a former toxic friend, which I had issues with, and my girlfriend really dislikes him. He’s not a good person but he’s friends with my other friends…

1d9u5to,How can I approach mentoring a difficult personality?,"TL;DR: I need to mentor someone with a strong personality and don’t want to make them feel worse. Unsure on approach.

I was asked by a senior person in my company to formally mentor a new employee in his org. This is a mutually beneficial relationship, since it provides me with an opportunity to demonstrate and further develop my leadership abilities as well.

We had a brief conversation today to set a lunch meeting for next week to officially discuss goals, etc. of the mentorship, and she divulged extreme difficulty in her past roles due to her personality and how she is perceived, and begged me to help her because she wants to give up in her career. 

In all honesty, she does come on very strong and seems to overshare and also maybe over-explain or try to prove she belongs. I feel for her, but I have a very different personality, and professional relationships come easily to me. How can I mentor someone’s personality without degrading who they are as a person? From discussions I’ve had with her manager, she is very knowledgeable in her field, but needs to be able to work well with and be received well by others. 

Another aspect that makes it slightly awkward is I am probably 10 years younger than this person, although our positions are relatively equal, just in different areas of the company.

I work with a wide range of personality types very easily, but I’ve never worked to evolve a person in this way.

* 2021-2023 Business Strategist for a Real-estate company 
* 2023-present Self-employed working on an eBay store I've been building since I was in middle school 

I'm really looking to work at another company and actually have a team again to work with. I've worked in isolation on my own business for nearly 18 months and, though I've had some good success, it is not fulfilling or worthwhile to keep it as a full-time gig.

1d9t00s,Possible promotion? What would I ask for?,"I apologies for the long read but my mind is racing..

So I work for a construction company. I work as a trucker making $29 hourly. I believe last year I made up to $50k or $45k. And last year was slower. I am comfortable where I am at because I get loads of hours in the summer and a break in the winter. I get to travel and go places in the winter. 

Well, my boss wanted to go on vacation so I was trained up to do his jobs and after 2 weeks I am running the show. I am doing much better than I thought but I can’t wait to go back to driving. 

Multiple people in the office said they think I should be at the office full time. They have even gone as far as complimenting me to my boss’s boss. Issue is it’s a salary position so my pay would be the same regardless of work.

My stress levels started so high by the beginning of of my 3rd week which was my first week alone. I had never felt the overwhelming stress I felt those days. I was starting at 6am and ending at 8pm. Normally as a trucker it’s no more than 10-12 hours daily 60 per week max (law). I been doing 12-14.5 hours days. 60 hours is $2k before tax.

I’m not sure what the company’s intentions are at all. If I stay in my truck so be it I’m completely fine with that. But if they offer me money, I want to make good money for this amount of work. I feel overwhelmed but I’m powering through this shit. The craziest part: the season is only getting started.

I’m projected to make about $3200 before taxes and $2000k after taxes this week. If the math is right, that’s $150k salary equivalent. That’s a really good week as a trucker. If I take this job, I don’t think I want to take anything less than $1700 after taxes a week on salary and I MIGHT consider $1500. 

I don’t know if that’s unreasonable but would $100k to $130k yearly make sense?

1d9szun,Masters in MIS or CIS?,"Hello, everyone, first reddit post so you know i'm genuinely thinking about this.
I have a bachelors in Management Information Systems (MIS), which I recently completed this spring at just 19 years old. I started MIS because I liked the flexibility and aspect of both business and technology. However nearing the end of my MIS program, the last 3 semesters were full of coding classes. I ended up learning around 6 coding languages (MIS is very programming based at my school). I ended up really liking to code and now thats what I want to do for a career. I want to do web development, programming or even software engineering.

The thing is, I want to do my Masters in CIS (Computer information systems), but that may require that I take multiple required courses that I did not take during my undergrad for MIS. Now these courses may have pre-requisites themselves and I may not be able to take them straight up.
Ultimately adding 1 or 2 maybe even 3 semesters before I can qualify for the Master's.

On the other hand, I have already been accepted to graduate school for MIS, as I met all the required courses during my bachelors. Looking over the classes a lot of them are Advanced versions of the coding classes that I took during my undergrad.

I did graduate with a 3.6 GPA, and meet some requirements for CIS, just not the classes.

1d9scbp,Need advice - do I quit before it gets worse? ,"I just come back from a few days off to find an email in my inbox to say that I have a performance review/investigation meeting regarding my performance at work. It said it was to be regarding  my failure to complete tasks, speaking to someone in a harsh tone when challenged and not completing a handover before going away. Now I think back on it, I do remember being told about it but I do have a memory like a sieve so it’s so hard to remember so much.  

When I saw the email, I walked out and broke down in the toilets. I was aware of my declining performance but didn’t know how to speak up about the issues I was facing. I couldn’t cope so I excused myself. I should have been aware that there was concern but if no one speaks up and tells me, how am I to know more than I already know.

Over the last few weeks (maybe months, I’m not sure) I feel like I have been losing my passion for my job and the urge to complete my apprenticeship. I can only describe it as I’ve lost my spark. There is so much to the work and as an 18 year old in my first office job I feel so overwhelmed and terrified, I’m so scared. The job is so structured, mundane and mentally challenging that I’ve growing bored and find it so hard to focus. I find myself waking up at night panicking about things I forgot to do. Every morning, I feel like I could have a panic attack to any moment because of the work. When I started at the company I was nervous but happy. I tried and tried to get used to it and work hard but 8 months in I’m really struggling.

Now that I really think about it, there is some very big cracks in the company. Sometimes when someone leaves the room, so if my colleagues start discussing them and their performance, I find this rather bitchy. It makes me question what gets said about me. I find it so hard to speak up about the issue.

I’m not a a rude person in anyway. I can be abruptly, not on purpose, and am never rude or aggressive. I feel hurt by these comments and always try to civil and polite.

1d9s9kg,How to shake up my comfortable situation?,"HI, 

M28 I work at a well-known national IT company and I deal with IoT. 

Currently my annual salary is 40K gross or  28K net.  

 I also receive an annual bonus of around 1800 euros gross (5% tax) and TKT restaurant of around 1700 euros net per year.

In addition to the net salary in Italy you are paid the so-called ""TFR"" pay which can be translated as severance pay in English. 
This corresponds to around 3K gross per year (taxed at 20%) which ends up in a second pension fund (in addition to the public one) to which is added around 500 euros per year put in voluntarily by my employer. 

Summing up, every year I receive after taxes: 

 28K salary
 1710 prize 
 1700 TKT restaurant 
 2800 second pension 

 = 34K net


I work remotely and live in southern Italy where life is much much less expensive than the north in a very beautiful and tourist area and despite this I found a nice house for €350 a month.
 (I would probably pay for a similar house in Milan 1500) 

 My girlfriend also works from home.


 All the money we don't spend we invest in ETFs or in education. 

 I'm in IT training (Cisco, etc.) while she's more in finance.

 I could probably stay here all my life, but I want to grow up and change cities, for example trying to live abroad.
 I have lived in my city since I was born. 

 Yet I always feel like I can't do it.
 Even though I am committed to studying and training, I always feel less than others.

1d9rkhd,Struggling in my internship,"I am a college student on my summer holidays. I have done two years in my four year degree. College is fine and I do very well in my exams. I have started an internship in a public accounting firm. It is not going well and I am struggling.

I have been there for two days. First, I had to input receipts and payments from bank statements into Surf and then do bank reconciliations. We never used Surf in college. The woman training me only showed me a few examples of inputting the receipts and payments before I had to do it myself. I was doing work on my own within 20 minutes of getting in the door. I was going very slow and struggling especially with which nominal codes to use.   
Then today, I had to reconcile the creditors control account and I found this even more difficult. I did get slightly more instruction with this task. The woman has barely spent any time training me or asking me how I’m doing. It doesn’t even look like she’s super busy. She’s on her phone a lot (not judging btw). I’ve asked her a lot of questions but I only get that specific question answered, not the whole process shown to me, basically getting dripfed information.

It is awful not understanding something. It is so disheartening knowing that I may not be good at accounting in general.

I’m not sure if it’s because I haven’t been trained enough or if I’m just stupid and lazy.

1d9qvik,Is this acceptable in an internship? I dont know if they are playing with me but I need advice,"Hi! I am an international relations major, and I found my first internship ever. I do not have any kind of experience related to my major, but I applied to this internship, and I was accepted. This is a very famous, I would say, top-tier humanitarian organization that works with refugees and is present in so many countries. I was very excited to start because such a name would look very good on my resume. It is unpaid and remote, which is convenient for me right now for several reasons, and I am also getting college credit for it. I decided I would be working 20 hours a week with them, which I know is a lot for an unpaid intern, but I was committed to taking the most out of it. **Here is a timeline:**

**First**, my onboarding process was so bumpy. My official start date was May 6th. On April 26, they sent me instructions for the onboarding process. I was supposed to receive two emails with login credentials and system access. I think the IT department was in charge of this. I was supposed to get one email within 24 hours, and I got it on May 17, which was 21 days later. The second email I was supposed to get within a week, and I got it after 19 days. I received them after reminding my supervisor several times about it and sending complaints to the IT department.

**Second**, the people who interviewed me were not very specific in what I was supposed to do and what my responsibilities were *(I never applied for this position specifically on their website; I applied for other positions and was rejected, but they offered me this one that recently opened at the time and contacted me through email, so I never had the chance to look at the internship details*). Even when filling out agreements and approval documents with my university, my supervisor left the Intern Responsibilities space blank. I did not think much about it, but looking back, it is weird.

**Third**, I completed my online training courses (*those courses that companies make their employees complete about company policies and stuff*). I emailed my supervisor on May 17, letting her know that I was ALL SET and READY TO START. It wasn't until May 23 that she sent me a link for a Teams meeting on May 24. In this meeting, she just told me to organize a shared folder by moving some scanned documents and renaming them, which is something that anyone could do, so it wasn't like I was learning something. She also told me to look out for a Teams meeting scheduled for May 29 so she can teach me how to do my actual job *(she never sent me the link until June 5)*. I did not have access to the folder until June 3, when she finally gave me access. I finished this super quickly and told her.

**Lastly**, today, June 6, I was supposed to have a second meeting with her (*the one that she was initially going to schedule for May 29 but completely ghosted me*). Meeting was at 10 a.m. I entered the meeting at 9:57 a.m. I waited for her for 20 minutes and she never showed up. I never got an email during those 20 minutes, which would have been more acceptable. 3 minutes after I left the meeting, she sent a chat inside the meeting, telling me that she was late because she was speaking with a client. If she had told me this at 10:10 or 10:15, I would have waited. Of course I wasn't going to wait for her the whole day, so I sent her an email telling her, ""*I just saw your message on the chat; I understand things can go unexpectedly, just let me know when you want to reschedule.*"" That was this morning. It is currently 3:30 p.m., and I have not heard from her.

As you can see, she is not the most efficient supervisor. I do not know what to do. Should I complain about this with her boss, who is the same person who interviewed me? Should I wait until she reschedules and see if she actually gives me real and valuable work to do? She can take up to 3 days to respond to a simple email from me, so I am not expecting a lot of communication from her. I am just an intern, and I do not want to demand anything because I am not in position, but I was cleared to start on May 17. It has been almost 3 weeks, and I have done nothing, learned nothing, and I feel like they are playing with me and my time. I am very disappointed because this is supposed to be a very respectable organization, so I never expected this. And also, I am spending money on this, because I have to pay for the college credits I am receiving, because my university takes it as a normal class in my coursework, which is really expensive. Any advice is welcome.

1d9q4i9,How do you deal with supervisor and HR person always talking trash about colleagues?,"A little back story, the company I work for is split between 3 different offices for different departments. The office I work in is accompanied by my superior, a company VP, and HR, while I am a midlevel employee.

I basically spend all day listening to the 3 of them bad mouth everything on the other 2 departments all day, and really don’t enjoy participating in those discussions. I feel like if you have an issue with the way someone works, you should address it with them directly.

I have been working here for a year now and at first I thought it was just venting, but it’s daily, and like SEVERAL times a day, to the point that I feel uncomfortable sitting there hearing it, but also these are my superiors so if I have any hopes of getting to the next chapter of my career, I need them to like me.

In a normal situation, I would complain to HR, but the head of HR is part of the problem! To the point that, I’ve seen my coworkers come into her office and shut the door to make a complaint about something and once they leave, the head of HR comes and tells us what was said to make fun of it. It’s so cringy because I have to act like I don’t know anything around my coworkers because if they word got out, it would be pretty obvious it came from me.

1d9pwg4,Started a new job and need some views,"Hello everyone,

so last month i started a new job and i feel a little bit underwhelmed. The last 7 years i've worked as a software engineer in different industries. HR, fashion, fin-tech. Mainly working with a certain ""stack"" or programming language and i came across this new opportunity via a recruiter through LinkedIn.

I quit my last job, because the company was slowly shutting down their branch in my country and also my boss at that time was already gone (i really admired him). Therefore i started applying for new jobs using same tools and languages. It's a completely new industry, currently learning 2 new programming languages and frameworks in parallel. Already build one of their new products within those couple weeks, but i don't know if it's a good progress or not. I don't really get feedback on that. In general the project planning is going really weird imho. I'm working with 2 managers and my team of course and i hear a lot of opinions but no one is telling clear facts. To me a lot of things are unclear and the more i spend in meetings with other teams and asking about their experience i feel more and more concerns coming up with it. And my manager is not really aware of that. Or aware of the actual effort it is to do.

Taking this new job meant declining two other very good offers, with more benefits and more money and tools i'm very confident in. The reason i took it were the hopes i had with the new team. A team speaking my native language, learning new tech and new challenges.

My first weeks here were a little cold. When i started i was expecting to be a little bit more involved into the ""life"" of the company. Being asked if i wanted to join lunch and meet new colleagues. But non of that happened. I'm not a very extroverted guy myself so i find it hard to approach people i don't know. The company exists around 30 years and i would say, that most of my colleagues are 40+ / 50+. I'm lucky that my team is quite young. I think i'm somewhere in the middle.

I'm having a hard time communicating with my new team. When i'm trying to explain things, they often tend to go into a different direction or misinterpret what i was saying. I know this can happen of course, since we're all human but compared to my other teams it's happening very often which i'm starting to find annoying. It makes me feel stupid. But i have to say, that the communication in general is very respectful.

Those things they make me think a lot about my decision and i'm not sure if it was the right one.

Struggling with new tech and industry makes me feel a little insecure. Also communication with my colleagues... it feels weird. I'm used to other ""standards"". No one really sees his responsibility for me to talk to or get me involved.

Would be glad to hear a couple opinions on it. ",I2olanD,1,1.0,0,1717700123,2024-06-06 18:55:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d9pwg4/started_a_new_job_and_need_some_views/,6,2024
1d9psp6,Navigating Nepotism,"I like the company I work for, there are serious problems, but over all it’s been a good fit for me. 

Boss just hired his daughter to run social channels under my supervision and I’m trying to make it a good thing for me- experience having a report, change my title to manager, being able to work up strategy instead of just trying to keep up among doing three other types of work. 

The daughter isn’t actually doing any work, and there’s not a lot I can do about it, since she’s super rich and lives out of state and the position is really just an excuse to give her money through payroll for some indecipherable tax reason. 

The problem is I  having like a weekly meeting- that I don’t have time for, about why she isn’t working, and the answer can’t be - because you are going to pay her either way and she doesn’t have to listen to me. 

 I’m also not being compensated for this huge pain in my ass that is also just not critical to our branding anyway. 

There is already one nepo hire who gets paid to warm a chair and I’ve accepted that as the price of entry, but in my experience two nepotism hires is when you update the resume, theee is when you jump ship and another empty resume friend of the family is “interviewing” right now, so I know it’s time to leave, but I want to be paid and still learning while I look for the next opportunity.

Since Monday, I have been scheduled for a stand down day on Friday. On the schedule it literally says 'day off'. Now, I have made lots of plans, including non-refundable deposits for a haircut. 

Today at 5pm, he informed me that I will have to come in tomorrow for a job 1 hour away and he will not be reimbursing my deposit. Apparently Stand down really means on 'reserve' and I can expect to be deployed at any time. I was not aware of this and have not been told this.

1d9o5tv,Decent Pay - But unfilling and easy job,"Dear Reddit Community, 



I am reaching out for career advice and I am interested to hear everyone’s thoughts…. 



I am a mid-twenties male working for a large real estate developer. I develop market-rate apartment communities across the Southwest. This was my first ""real job"" out of college, and I have been with my current employer for about five years. I currently earn a base salary in the low $70,000 range and receive quarterly bonuses averaging approximately $8,000 (which can be $0 or $15,000+ depending on production, revenue, etc.), with no caps. Additionally, I receive a minimum annual base salary raise of $9,000 (which can be higher based on performance) in perpetuity, with no maximum.

I have had a front-row seat to several hundred million dollars' worth of real estate development, and the people I work with are some of, if not the smartest, in the industry. The company has given me a few promotions in my short tenure, and I am in line to soon be the leader of my region. 

The problem is that I only have ""real work"" for maybe 1-2 hours a day, on average. My only responsibility is to produce projects for the company. Simply put, I work with brokers, cities, landowners, etc., to bring development sites/opportunities to the company. I have full autonomy to select and acquire effectively any site I desire with no oversight (no approval committees, etc.). Once I acquire or put a site under contract, I pass it on to my team, and I am out of the picture. 

99% of the time, my team is maxed out and can't handle any more deals. When this happens, I have no work to do. (I will still work with brokers, cities, etc., but only to ""plant seeds""; I can't acquire or entitle a site, etc.). On average, I spend 1-2 hours a day on the phone, emailing and making sure my team and third-party contractors, architects, consultants, etc. are on track. Otherwise, I have no work, and spend my day reading business journals, browsing Redditt, reading CNBC, etc leading to an extremely unfulfilling and numbing day-to-day existence.

While I am grateful for the opportunities afforded to me and recognize that my situation is favorable compared to many others, I can't help but feel immensely unfulfilled and numb on a day-to-day basis. The lack of growth and the sense of being trapped have left me considering other opportunities.

I acknowledge that my situation is better than that of 99% of other corporate professionals, and I do not want it to seem like I am in any way, shape, or form complaining or suggesting that I have it hard. I recognize that many people wish they had these ""problems.""

Put simply, the lack of fulfillment, extreme numbness, absence of personal growth, and the lack of meaningful day-to-day work have prompted me to seek advice from the community.

FWIW - I already anticipate receiving comments suggesting I am ""entitled"" or ""crazy for complaining,"" or stating that people would love to have my job. I understand where you're coming from. I am not asking for more money, as I recognize that money is not everything and certainly does not equal happiness. Fulfilling work is an essential part of life. Anyone who claims they wish to sit on their butt every day and earn millions is missing the point, and if given the opportunity, would find themselves mistaken. Life is not solely about money; it is about love, connections, and growth.

TL;DR - I'm a mid-twenties male earning around $105,000 a year, but I only work 1-2 hours a day. Despite the decent pay, the minimal workload leaves me feeling extremely unfulfilled and numb during my 9-5.",Fleecy_Stamp,2,0.75,9,1717695775,2024-06-06 17:42:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d9o5tv/decent_pay_but_unfilling_and_easy_job/,6,2024

1d9ndcq,Salary Negotiation for Internal Offer?,"
I got a degree in Computer Engineering and took a job out of college in an Engineering rotational program, which lasted 2 years where I learned the company/processes and did systems, software, and test engineering, and program management.

Now that the program is ending I need to transfer to a permanent role. I decided on test engineering as it was my favorite one. This includes validating and verifying that our products meet their requirements. My main responsibilities would be to write/modify test procedures based on requirements, automate test procedures using Teststand/labview, sw component testing, regression analysis, etc.

Today the Local HR manager gave me numbers verbally saying this is what she got approved and it was even more than she was expecting. She said she is sending it to comp & benefits for them to generate the offer. I didn’t know what to do when she told me that so I figured I would try to negotiate when I get the offer instead.

This position is one of the rotations I did for 6 months. am now being given a 4% merit increase for the year (guaranteed), then offered a 5% increase on top of that for the new position I will be going into. Currently the offer is at ~90k usd and I am in a medium cost of living area with lots of defense contractors around (my current company is not defense). I interned for 2 years at one of the defense companies in the area.

I am curious on how to negotiate this higher as I was expecting a few more thousand. I understand I only have 6 months of experience in the role but how could I negotiate without trying to get a offer from defense company and waving it at them since it would be difficult given the time constraints.",nixcydr,2,1.0,3,1717693779,2024-06-06 17:09:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d9ndcq/salary_negotiation_for_internal_offer/,6,2024

1d9loc3,"Too many job interviews/offers, what to do?","Not flexing or anything. I’m a CS graduate and I’ve applied for a bunch of roles. Just yesterday I accepted a job as a sales coordinator (27k hybrid, 37.5 hours) as I needed a job, and it seems like a really cool place and I’d like the job, fleet sales for motorbikes, but seems very admin. 

Today I got two calls about an SQL dev role (2-3days a week, 28k, so much better rate for less hours) and an IT support role (35k full time). 

I’ve already submitted my info for a dbs and all that with the sales role, but can’t lie I did CS and I want to use it. They want me to start in about two weeks. 

I’d ideally like the SQL role as being a dev would get me onto higher paying dev roles, SQL was one of the easier modules at uni, and it’s the direct experience I want. It’s arm hour drive but it’s 3 days a week, meaning relevant experience + more time to put into my instruments. I would also like the IT support role as it’s high pay (I’m unfamiliar with the stack but I’ll learn) and it’s literally 10 minutes away. 

I am gonna fun for these roles, and it’s competitive, apparently one applicant to the SQL got a 1st from Durham and 2 A*s at A level. I got 2 As and a 2:1 from Kent, but I’ve got some charm to me so let’s hope they’re a super nerd. 

So, how do I handle this situation? Do I say nothing to the role I’ve just accepted and interview for the others next week, and see what I can get? I could get rejected anyways. Also, should I not stop applying for jobs? Can’t lie I didn’t grow up and say I wanna be a sales coordinator, as cool as the job would be. 

New to this job market stuff so any advice is appreciated form those more experienced. I don’t wanna set a bad reputation for dipping on jobs and leaving them hanging.

It’s a small but quickly growing company, and I’ve had several roles in various departments, including sales, operations, and marketing.

1d9kcue,What careers can I transition into as a construction project manager that offer more fulfillment/excitement/more money?,"This may come off more as a rant than a question but the main topic I have in mind is how I might advance my career as a construction project manager. 

Im 25 years old and currently work in a project manager role for a production Homebuilder. I’m coming up on 3 years with the company. I run the day to day operations for each house as far as quality checks, customer meetings, punch-out tasks, etc. my job is to ensure each house comes in under budget, on time, and on par with our quality standards. The builder I work for is national corp and I must say the work is pretty unfulfilling considering the lack of diverse projects (I build the same houses over and over). The job can be stressful but I perform very well and am one of the top performers in my division even as the youngest in the division. 

I’ve worked in construction since college as a laborer on a crew and after graduating with a business degree I found a good opportunity to relocate to North Carolina (where I knew I wanted to move) and train for a year learning the products and honing in on project management skills before being promoted to PM. Like I said, I haven’t found the job fulfilling and I’ve thought a lot about transitioning to commercial work or even sales work in building materials/roofing/or something alike. I know there’s more money to be made in commercial projects but it’s been very difficult yo find any opportunities that don’t require many years of experience. Sales sounds inviting to me because I’ve always seen myself in a sales role hustling for commissions but I am now to get married very soon and we are expecting our first child in 6 months, so it just doesn’t seem logical to start relying on commissions at this point. 

I have to stress how important it is to me to find something that I can feel passionate about. I’m constantly looking for excitement in life and hate mundane day to day schedules like I’m working now.  Like anyone my age, I’m constantly daydreaming and thinking up ideas on how I can start my own business or make more money on the side because having autonomy and working on my own hustle is very important and inviting. But having important work to do is also a dream of mine—I heavily debated paths in military special forces, PeaceCorps work, or volunteer work—something I could do to work toward making a difference. But of course those routes always fell to the wayside because it seemed stupid to give up a solid PM opportunity where I can make around 6 figures—especially considering I have family to consider now. I just always felt I could be using my energy to do something bigger and better as most others in my position are well into their 30s or 40s and seem to be more okay with doing the same thing every day. 

Back to the question(sorry for the ranting),
What positions can residential construction project managers transition into? My field seems to be looked at as very niche because the only projects we work on are houses that don’t vary much. I’d love to work on large commercial projects and earn more money but I don’t think many companies are willing to take a chance on someone in my role unless it means taking huge pay cut to be in an assistant/training position. Are there any sales positions in related industries that construction knowledge could be a asset without having formal sales experience?

I’m open to pretty much anything even if it means getting out of the construction industry entirely but it just doesn’t seem realistic to find a salary that can support a wife and child without sticking to what I’ve worked in in the last few years (my to-be wife works remote and makes a pretty good salary so I’m not the sole provider) And I have to stress how BORING I find my current position. Building these same houses over and over with low-level contractors just adds stress to my life in a job I find no passion in. 

Thanks for reading my essay (I’ve had  a shitty day at work if you can’t tell).

1d9k78u,Career dilema and family considerations.,"Hello,

I am a first generation Hispanic immigrant to the us. I came here a few years ago to do an MBA and I currently 1 year and 8 months into a fast track program in operations for Amazon.  I am an L6 and I am doing reasonably well so I could get a promo in the next year or so.

I am married and have two kids (1 and 3yo). My wife just started to do a nursing program to be an RN, she has 2.5-3 years ahead to finish the program. My two kids go to daycare right now (total 2.5k a month on average)

I live in a MCOL city in the west and I got a good deal on my rent (2.2k on a 3br furnished house with a big back yard).

My main issue is that I don’t really like my job, I am would like to move to something more technical in Amazon corporate, like AWS for example.

On the other hand, my program was supposed to be 5 years long, and end at L8 level. They just changed that a few weeks ago and now the program ends at L7. This also implies that after the promo to L7 I would get a very limited pay bump (if a pay bump at all).

So I am thinking what to do. On one hand I am told that if I wait to be an L7 it will be more difficult to make such a move. On the other hand most of Amazon corporate jobs are in places with higher cost of living (Seattle, DC area, Austin), which would imply having the kids at home and my wife stopping her studies. She has a hard time staying full time at home with the kids mental health wise.


I have been think about this for weeks , talked to friends in operations and in corporate but I am still undecided. Seems like seeking a change now will bring a lot of complications into my life, but I don’t want to regret not moving now a few years down the line.

I think just writing this out just helped me vent, but I would appreciate some advices if you have been in a similar situation.

1d9ig28,Supervisor ignores me. New hire ,"I’ve recently started a new job in social work. I’m required to take hours and hours of training courses and attend a facility that’s 2hrs away from me. 

I’m new to this field and this is my first job ever. I kept my talking very professional and my temporary supervisor was like “lighten up”. 

Sometime down the line, she stopped responding to me. I guessed that she was extremely busy helping out her actual subordinates. She’d read my messages asking about company things. Such as expense reports, referrals and basic company policy. She read but didn’t reply. 

When we meet in person or talk on the phone, she’s very nice and friendly. 

I was switched over to my real supervisor last week and she sent an email out increasing our in office days from 2 to 3. And said feel free to reach out. 

I responded to the email. I messaged her on teams asking about how she wanted me to do overtime (some supervisors let you stay clocked in after hours to finish training, some want you to ask permission first). 

She read the message but didn’t reply. What am I doing wrong here? I started wondering if I’m doing something offensive or bad. Maybe asking too many questions? 

My old supervisor praised me alot and was saying how I was a great trainee and how passionate I am. But she was also not replying either. 

So I’m confused. I have questions about so many things but nobody to ask them. The directors and even trainers always say “get with your supervisor about that”. But my supervisor is not responding. 

I was excited about this job but now I feel like either switching programs or getting some talkative supervisor. But I know it’ll be rude if I ask to switch units or programs.

1d9if3l,How do you deal with the politic game at work? ,"I’m in my first office job and the politic game is killing me. 

I’ve been made to supervise, re-do, and take over responsibilities because other people weren’t competent or didn’t care to do their job. So there is this “lesson” I’m learning of not working too hard and being too dependable or you’ll just be rewarded with more work. But this is balanced by the fact if you are more dependable and do good work, you might be off the list when lay offs come. 

There is this other thing where you’re always given more problems than any human can reasonably do, and you are told everything is urgent. The lesson is that don’t stress about getting everything done because you can’t. But then how do I calibrate myself? Get 50% done? Go crazy hard to get 75% done? What is reasonable? 

There is more, my manager doesn’t ever have time to discuss, do one on ones, or keep connected in any type of way. He doesn’t see the problems that come about when trying to fix something or work on a project, he has no idea what the path looks like. He hasn’t the slightest clue if something isn’t done because I’m not working or because the problem is deeper and harder to solve than he imagined. It is almost like he is guessing on my performance. I discussed this once with him when he had the rare moment to speak and he said, “I just ask people around to see if they think it looks like you’re working”….. Well if you don’t know the reality, what makes you think others do…. So my performance is based on if I pick up a brisk walk and strain on my face when I see others around? What if I’m typically a cool calm individual? So it’s like, how do I win this “game”? 

So, how the hell do you guys survive in this type of environment? It is like utter chaos in my mind at work. I feel like I’m in the ocean and I can’t find something to stand on. 

I feel like I don’t know the “rules”, I can’t calibrate myself to “win”. 

My previous job as a cashier or university student was so easy. You know exactly what you have to do to “win”. Study the material, and politely serve any customer who comes to your till. Boom, easy.

I answer queries and do basic admin tasks like booking hires, driver clearance, taxing vehicles and sorting PCNs. He said he doesn't see me in HR so.. (I get why lol)

I don't want to or see myself becoming a manager of any kind, and l'd like to stay in the same business I am currently in (housing association and care provider) there are many office based options available within this organisation but I don't know what l'd want to do

He's asked me three times so far and my tutor has asked me as well so I really need an answer.. I have never known what l've wanted to do and just kind of go with whatever options are available..

Any advice on how to give an answer to this question when I have no idea would be great thanks!",umm-nobody,1,1.0,6,1717669976,2024-06-06 10:32:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d9f0nt/what_should_i_do_for_a_career_when_i_have_no_idea/,6,2024
1d9ezli,Is it possible to feel burnout from not doing much at work?,"I might be experiencing a burnt out but I could be wrong. I've been doing the same thing over and over for 5 years now in a hospital; issue purchase orders, wait for authorization and send them to our suppliers/vendors. I have other responsibilities like provide feedbacks and ideas on how to improve internal system in our department and work flow with other departments but my manager didn't trust my ideas or didn't like them.

At the start of my 4th year, I suddenly gave up and just show up and leave on time, at the same time, I also stopped working out and lost interest in my hobby. I come home, play mindless games and/or watch movies. I asked 2 of my colleagues on how do they stay here for more than 10 years, they said they're staying for the money but I didn't mention anything about resigning. I can see myself turning like them and am afraid to leave now because of financial security.

An interview should just be a conversation between 2 people. It should be more natural and just be asking about your experience and who you are. None of this ""what motivates you?"" and ""tell me a time you went out of your way?"" and ""what are you weaknesses?"" BULLSHIT. It's literally all bullshit so what's the point?

1d98yiy,Advice on Fall Semester Internship Opportunity? (Physics/Engineering/CS),"Hi everyone, I’m coming to Reddit for some extra advice that I can possibly get from any of you who may have had experience in a Fall internship (during college) or have been in my position.

Here’s what’s going on: I recently received an opportunity to join a SULI Fall 2024 project as an intern at one of the DOE Laboratories in the US. The opportunity would last 15 weeks (the entire 2024 fall semester) and I would gain a considerable amount of research experience as a result of taking the opportunity. 
With that said, I am thinking about the potential ramifications of missing my second-to-last semester of school. A few of these potential ramifications would include missing time with my close friends that I’ve made at school, missing out on classes (only offered this fall) that I want to take and are of importance to complete my B.S. in physics and still graduate on time in the spring of 2025, and losing communication with some of most of my people back at my university. 

Do you have any advice for me in whether or not I should take this job? I will of course build the strongest connection I can with the potential advisor of this project so as not to let the opportunity completely go to waste if I decide to not take it.

1d98561,Seeking New Perspectives,"(Note: this will be a lengthy post and not all of it is tied specifically to career advice but I hope there might be some people here with good input)

Hi, I am a 19-year-old international student from Sweden, currently studying in California. I am working on my associate’s degree and I started studying here with a rather simple goal in mind–to transfer to a four-year university, get my bachelor’s degree, and then go back home to get work experience. However, over the past year, a lot of things have happened. 

After about 5 months, I realized that the UCs I wanted to transfer to would be too expensive for me, simple as that. I also read that UCs do not provide any financial aid to international students so I concluded that transferring to a UC won’t work.

My background is this, I only have a degree in music at my high school in Sweden and am currently studying computer science in the US. Also, an associate degree doesn’t correspond to anything in Sweden, so if my only option after getting my associates is to go back to Sweden, I’ll have two options: 1) to take any low-paying job I can get since I barely have any education, or 2) to start all over again with my education in Sweden and start studying from a much lower level. This will force me to study concepts I already learned for about 2 years before I start learning from where I left off. 

I made a plan and came up with what I now think are all the possible paths I can take in my life. I’ll now continue on with explaining these paths starting from what I personally want the most to the one I do not want to go. Note that I don’t want to exclude any path just because they seem unlikely.

1. **Try to go for a private top university that can, in special cases, provide international students with financial aid if admitted:** This would of course be my number one path. I read that certain universities like Stanford and MIT can give financial aid to international students in some scenarios. These schools are very prestigious of course but I have good grades, I love studying, and I have done a lot of extracurricular activities already. I will also take a summer course at Stanford this year so while my chances are low here, I still think this could be a path I can try to go for. Do you think this is a viable option for me? Is it worth my time spending money and time doing the applications even though I feel like my chances are below half a percentage?
2. **Transfer to a cheaper university in the US:** This is if I can’t get any financial aid from any university in the US. I have read that all state universities in California are much cheaper than the UCs, so I guess this path could be an option. However, I also saw a lot of people saying that the difference between quality in CSUs and UCs is so great that I am concerned that I won’t like it at a state university? People seem pretty negative toward the CSUs so if this is the case, maybe this option won’t be a good one? 
3. **Transfer to a cheaper university somewhere else in the world:** This is if I can’t transfer to any university within the US. I thought about transferring to another country like England where I can use my associate's degree from the US (unlike in Sweden) to transfer to continue working toward a bachelor's degree. I have no clue how to even approach this so I guess the tradeoff is that while it could be a much cheaper option and one that I am willing to commit to, there is a lot of research and work to pull this off. Will it be worth it? I don’t know.
4. **Try to get an internship (CPT) here in the US or an OPT job:** This is if I can’t transfer anywhere after my associate’s degree. I thought that if I could get any type of real-world job in the US in any tech industry related to computer science, it could potentially make it much easier for me to later find a good tech job in my home country, Sweden, when I move back after my associate’s degree. Then some hirers might be able to look past my bad education in Sweden since I already have work experience in the industry? However, I have realized that internships and all forms of hands-on experience opportunities are extremely competitive and hard to get. Although I am constantly trying to find these opportunities and land an internship, it is a rather risky path to solely focus on.
5. **Go home after getting an associate’s degree:** This is where I don't want to end up. In this case, I guess I would go home and either start over with my education and then I would feel like I would have wasted 2 years of time, money, and a lot of effort that ultimately led up to nothing. Or I could just get any job which I don’t want. 

If you read through all of this, thank you and I truly appreciate your time. I am not seeking any answers to “What should I do?”. I would simply appreciate your thoughts and opinions about this situation. I am seeking other perspectives so that maybe new paths can become visible to me.

Thank you.

1d96zf6,"niche job + hesitant to leave, but more money elsewhere","Hi all, 

Thanks in advance for any advice you may be willing to give. 

I work in the indie music industry handling media relations. I am lucky to have been able to work with some of my favorite artists and some of the biggest artists in this realm of music.

To be frank, I'm worried this may be a dying industry. At the end of the day, I do love my job and the ""perks"" (in quotations because free concerts don't equal fair pay), but don't know if I'll have transferable skills to land me a job in the future. The forced socializing and networking of this job can be really taxing (on both my mental health and my liver). I also never truly get a day off without having to respond to a few emails or make sure there's nothing on fire. 

  
I'm hesitant to leave because I feel like a lot of my clients depend on me. And of course, there's always the potential regret that comes with it, in an industry that's pretty hard to get a job in anyway. 

I made 25k around 7 years ago when I first started at this company, and now I make 55k. I have an initial interview with a place tomorrow that is not anywhere close to music and would pay me at least 20k more than I'm making now, likely more. Hoping I'm not jinxing anything by saying that, haha. 

Is a 20k pay raise worth not working in a job you like in a ""cool"" industry? 

Will take any advice. Thank you.

1d96tc8,Le risque de burn-out dans les grandes entreprises : une réalité préoccupante,"Bonjour 😁
Aujourd'hui, je souhaiterais aborder un sujet qui concerne de nombreux travailleurs : le risque de burn-out dans les grandes entreprises. 

Le burn-out est un état d'épuisement physique, émotionnel et mental causé par un stress chronique au travail. Malheureusement, il est devenu de plus en plus fréquent dans notre société moderne, en particulier au sein des grandes entreprises où la pression et les exigences sont souvent élevées.

De nombreux facteurs contribuent à ce phénomène, tels que des charges de travail excessives, des délais serrés, des attentes irréalistes, un manque de soutien ou de reconnaissance, et une culture du travail axée sur la performance à tout prix.

Le risque de burn-out a des conséquences néfastes non seulement pour les individus qui en sont victimes, mais aussi pour les entreprises elles-mêmes. En effet, un employé épuisé et démotivé est moins productif, moins créatif et plus susceptible de commettre des erreurs.

Il est donc primordial que les entreprises prennent des mesures pour prévenir le burn-out et favoriser un environnement de travail sain. Cela peut inclure la mise en place de politiques de gestion du stress, la promotion d'une culture du bien-être, l'encouragement du travail d'équipe et de la collaboration, ainsi que la reconnaissance et la valorisation des employés.

En conclusion, le risque de burn-out dans les grandes entreprises est une réalité préoccupante qui nécessite une attention et des actions de la part des employeurs. En travaillant ensemble, nous pouvons créer des environnements de travail plus équilibrés et favorables à la santé et au bien-être de tous.

Partagez vos expériences, vos conseils ou vos questions dans les commentaires ci-dessous. Ensemble, faisons en sorte que le burn-out ne soit plus une norme, mais une exception.

Prenez soin de vous. 🫶🏾",Chimermann,3,1.0,1,1717638239,2024-06-06 01:43:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d96tc8/le_risque_de_burnout_dans_les_grandes_entreprises/,6,2024
1d96lvh,"The future of thePeopleCode programmer job? How is it?
","Hi,

I started a job that pays low and doesn't cover any insurances and retirement plans 5 weeks ago since I didn't wanna stay unemployed for too long. As I was continuing to apply for jobs that actually offer decent compensations, I received an interview offer from a community college today for an ERP programmer/analyst position. Based on the description, you'd have to work with SQRs, PeopleCode, Application Engine, File Parser, and SQL database daily.

As someone who only has about 2 years of .NET web development, I would love to hear your advice on a position like this although I know it's too soon to talk about this. How is the job market for PeopleCode jobs and what's the future like? And the remote job opportunities?

It's a low-paying job since it's from college, and I am aware there are and always will be plenty of .NET jobs out there, but It's very important to me to get a job that actually offers insurance and retirement as my wife will be a busy full-time college student until the end of the year.

1d95yvs,How about both…?,So I have just finished my junior year in high school and now I realize that I need to start thinking about college and careers. I’ve thought about it before and I know that I can always change my mind later but I would like to have an idea of my options. So far I have chosen to double major in web design and music with a minor in drama. While these are very different career paths it’s just what I like. I like preforming arts but I also like coding but I don’t really know of a career that lets me do both. I know that people have done both in the past (shout out to Hedy Lamarr) but I don’t know a career that lets me do that. I like the idea of having a tech start up and I’m not afraid of putting in the work to have a start up while also working in preforming arts(singing and theatre) but I do wonder if there is a career that has both.

1d94zzp,What should I do?,"Hi, I’m really struggling to figure out what I want to do but I know it’s normal, I just can’t seem to get the idea. So about a year ago I graduated high school and attended engineering school for the sake of my parents, lasted about a semester just because I hated physics (mechanics) even though I am average at it. So after the first semester, I just needed to take a break to figure myself out. Now it’s spring and I have joined B.comm degree. It’s been a year of fighting and trying to figure out my situation, everybody says it’s a useless degree. I am taking classes right now, they seem so easy, I get so much time to myself and I just sit at home. This corporate stuff I learn in class is just common sense and I hate it, it’s not learning anything. I really wanted to do an aviation program but it’s outside of my home town, I don’t want to live alone. So the only choice is either community college, give engineering technology a try or do something else in university. I don’t want to spend hours doing something useless but I do like finance math and stuff. I have no idea what to do, this past year my mental health has been destroyed, everyday I think about it, it feels like my brain is eating it self, I have been eating a lot, and don’t go outside unless it’s school.

1d945f2,Advice on how to move further with figuring what to do as a career?,"I’ve turned to this as my last resort because I don’t know who to talk to anymore for advice on how to find my path. I was all set and almost got the courage to drop out of my university (I was an art major). For 1-2 years I had been contemplating not continuing to pursue a career in art because I don’t see myself doing something with art as a career. So I talked with my mother and she suggested that I try to study something else if I’m leaving art behind. I felt hope when I had decided I would dropout of my 4 year and go back to community college to become a certified MA. But I feel deep down this feel like a replacement career I’m not fully interested in. I want to be fully invested in something I like even if Its hard sometimes. I haven’t technically dropped out but I didn’t sign up for fall semester and even if I did, I have no idea what to pursue. I’ve been racking my head for so long trying to figure it out but I feel like I’m at a dead end. I could try to make a living without going back to school but I don’t feel like I would have the stability  I would want without some sort of degree (this is what I’ve convinced myself into thinking). I feel so lost and I don’t know how to figure it out or what actions to take next? I should probably mention the only thing that I’ve been interested in for a while now  is music (I play guitar (4+ years) try to teach myself to sing/write songs for about 2years). I posted covers online up until April when I was talking to my friends about what pursuing a career in music really means and I concluded on my own that I felt discouraged by my realistic views and I haven’t posted since. (I know it would be very hard to be discovered, this was me just trying to put myself out there (barely) . I actually don’t know why I try to write songs or sing because I don’t have natural talent to sing (I’m not trying to act humble, I know at this point that my singing is less than average). So music is out of the question even though I cant seem to stop trying to write and sing.The only thing I’ve been “good at” and recognized for is art and I truly don’t like creating art anymore.

1d9437m,"Accelerate my degree or continue the ""nice and slow"" path?","I am currently a junior engineer, taking classes after work to earn my Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I graduated in 2021 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. By the end of summer, I'll be one-fifth done with my non-thesis program. I'm torn between finishing my degree next year through an acceleration program or transitioning to a rotational job role I've wanted since last year.

Currently, I work as a process engineer in the semiconductor industry, focusing on electronics packaging. I want to shift from mechanical engineering and manufacturing to computer engineering, a long-time passion of mine. Although I am unsure of my exact career path, I know I don't want to stay in manufacturing. My job switch aimed for better prospects, but the work is still quite similar to my previous role. I have a timeline cap at the end of 2028 to complete my degree or else I'll have to start all over for this specific program.

Despite struggling in school and barely maintaining a 3.0 GPA, my performance reviews at work have been positive. I excel in soft skills and have a good high-level understanding of technical work. I aspire to roles like team lead, manager, or CTO, rather than a ""principal engineer."" Earning this degree could open more doors and help me find work I enjoy. However, I originally planned to pursue an MBA or a similar qualification, not an engineering master's degree.

Anyways, I'll begin to elaborate below:

Path 1 - Acceleration Program:

After a year with the company, my job will allow me to go part time (19-20 hours) and still pay my full time salary given that I take a minimum of 2 classes per semester for a total of four semesters (if you need it). I would still be in my same job learning more thing, but it's more of something I know I don't want a career in.

Pros

1. Same pay and still eligible for promotions
2. I would graduate in December 2025 rather than May 2027
3. Dedicate this next year just grinding trying to finish up my program
4. Would be able to take a background/support role for my team which is softly equivalent to less stress at work (even though there's not too much right now)
5. Pay back time would be concluded sooner (1 year after last class)
6. Can still join other rotational programs, but they are aligned in different areas. Could potentially still lead to where I want, but may not have the same flexibility.
7. After work hours and weekends would be gained back to allow for more business and leisure travel opportunities

Cons

1. Potential for stress to be at an all-time high for a year straight \*\* biggest concern
2. I would miss out on the opportunity to join the rotational program I've already talked to my management and mentors about for the past year, which allows me to be in a job role to pursue the work that I'm basically studying for.
3. Potentially lose out on the huge value from networking within the rotational program (still attainable, just requires more effort)
4. Very nervous since I get distracted very easily and even if I had more time to dedicate to school work, it may not be used effectively

Path 2 - Transition into Rotational Program:

This is a 3-year program, with a requirement to take 4 graduate level classes (or equivalent) to ""graduate"" from the program. I would transition into a ""design role,"" and would be given the opportunity to explore the many different fields of computer engineering. This may include cyber security, software engineering, hardware engineering, etc. Anything that's dealing with hardware and software systems, I have the say on my path. I am the captain of my direction.

Pros

1. Immensely less stress overall from work + school
2. The rotational program offers time away from work which would be nice, especially while only taking one class
3. Ability to learn the skills that I want on the job while also making the connection to my classes
4. Opportunity to rotate to different states/countries short term which is awesome to me
5. Would able to join internal-program ""councils"" to further hone my leadership skills
6. Post-graduation from this program, I'd have a broad list of projects, skills, and achievements while also finishing up school
7. Rotational program members from my perspective get good support from senior members within the company
8. Would be achieving my last scheduled promotion by graduation as well preparing me for more senior roles

Cons

1. Would graduate later if I were to continue taking 1 class per semester, 3 classes per year (May 2027, latest Dec 2029 with a change to 2 classes per year)
2. Would continue living life for the next 3-4 years with weekends going towards school, but maybe not if I have the additional time for the first 4 classes? \*\* biggest concern on this path

Comparing these lists, it looks like Path 2 would be better, but there could be unknowns I'm not thinking about.

Hey everyone,

I’m a CS major who got frustrated after applying to 200+ jobs/internships, only to get ghosted, rejected, or repeatedly asked to complete hirevues. After experiencing a particularly tough process (5 interviews + a take-home case study) and then hearing nothing, I started developing a tool that can **automatically track** applications, match users with positions where they’re **more likely to hear back and succeed,** and even **predict** when a company has **ghosted** them (something I encountered often).

While this project is still in development, it has already been helpful to a few friends, so I’m now seeking feedback from other job or internship seekers to improve it. If you're currently looking for jobs or internships and would be willing to test the platform or provide feedback, please PM me and I’ll share the link.

1d8zxfy,Colleague left then asked to come back,"We just got a new colleague a few weeks ago. People asked a few times how it was going, all was well according to him. 

Then within the trial period (Europe) he quit without any real explanation. During the exit interview a few possible solutions to potential problems were voiced, but according to him there was no real problem, he just wanted out. This was last friday. 

Then on Monday he requested to come back. According to him it was a mistake, he shouldn't have quit like that, family issues, spur of the moment decision, it will never happen again blablabla. 

The boss now wants opinions on what to do. We can really use someone with his skills, but at the same time he clearly isn't a good communicator which is quite important in a small team.

1d8zwcy,"Should I decline the job offer because the new boss is friends with my ex-boss, who fired me?","Hello, this is in Germany. 

I finished my studies and searched for a longterm job. I applied and got invited into a job interview which will take place in a few days. I started to research more about the new job and found out that the boss there is friends with my ex-boss, who fired me last year.  (I saw on LinkedIn that they are friends.)

My ex-boss fired me in the trial month during my 6 months mandatory education internship. Why? Because I asked too much and wasn't obedient enough, according to him. Also things happened there and I think it was really unfair to me because the other employees instructed me wrongly. They kept quiet when the boss scolded me for their wrong instructions and the responsible employees acted like nothing happened. We were a very small team (2-4 people, honestly not enough people for a pharmacy next to a hospital) and I didn't want to stir up trouble among the team during my first weeks. So I said nothing really and took the blame, multiple times. The boss let me repeat monotonous organisation things and I couldn't see how it would help me learn my education properly. They were barely motivated. They let me clean and tidy up many things. 

Luckily I found another workplace for my internship and I could finish it there. AND I really learned the things I was supposed to for my last education exam and according to my education contract, like for example, how to use the cash register program and provide professional advice to costumers during conversations. 

The job, which I found, is a special one this time and also new to me, because the job takes place in a official part of the hospital and has different work tasks. I don't think the bosses both work together, but I realized the entrance to my specific work place is directly next to the shop of my ex-boss, it's even connected with a door to their shop. I would like to have the job, but I am scared that the ex-boss will talk bad about me to my new boss when he finds out that I work there. Also I dislike the former colleagues strongly there because they did inappropriate things during my stay. 

I am a person who avoid conflicts. I learnt that I should stand up for myself now, still I don't want to meet them ever really again. 

Should I decline the offer because I am scared that the past will affect my job negatively and alternatively find smth else, or should I accept and see how the things will evolve?",IAmOutOfGoodNames,1,1.0,3,1717619070,2024-06-05 20:24:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d8zwcy/should_i_decline_the_job_offer_because_the_new/,6,2024

I'm the time of person who is always poking around to try to find things to fix, always improving processes where I can. 

Most recently I implemented something in the system that required a report from a different system. So basically I generate data, someone else in another team generates a report. And the report is absolutely awesome - it has everything every manager wants to see. 

BUT both my manager and her boss think no one is clicking the link to check the report. So they came up with the greatest idea: why not put this burned out system admin to manually type an email and send to all managers every month, because they are too lazy to click an url? 

I didn't say no to them directly, but I got the report person to create a dashboard I could just forward it over. Boss's boss tells me he wants it manually typed.

1d8ynla,MMA fighter to IB/PE? Seeking career advice,"Recent graduate of top public university with degree in Business Economics (3.7 GPA), ideal goal is to end up sports/media focused IB shop (Raine, LionTree, or in BB/EB with sports/media & entertainment group) or consultancy (Activate, MBB) with a pathway into sports PE/investing (Arctos Partners, Sixth Street, RSE Ventures etc.)

Didn't recruit for IB out of undergrad, I wasn't sure about what I wanted to do, was pre-med for a semester - ultimately tried for management consulting, made small mistakes on all my final round cases with MBB/T2, didn't get an offer

Have internship experience in LMM IB, F500, strategic advisory, etc.

Current career choices 

1) Admitted into an MSF program from a semi-target with good undergraduate placement into IB -- however, it is too late to recruit for summer 2025 positions - if I go this route am unsure about how to best position myself for FT recruiting. Also, I feel like I have not gained any of the requisite skills to be a good entry-level employee of any top company and I would improve my financial modeling skills.

2) Currently in the final stages of an interview process with a small software VC shop based in West Coast about to launch its second fund (5 investments a year)  - a FT role as an analyst right out of undergrad is nice, concerned about exits and how relevant this is to what I want to do

3) Do a gap year before applying to graduate school again (more school options, improve GMAT, maybe the LSAT) - I also do amateur MMA (1-0), considering focusing on this for a year, seeing how far I can go - if I do well maybe turn this into a career, retire before I lose too many brain cells, get an MBA and get a good job

I'm at a serious crossroads right now and I don't know really know what to do. If I land the full-time job then I will probably just take that and go for an MBA a few years down the line but given how my job hunting has gone so far I am not getting my hopes up -- if I do land the role, is recruiting directly for IB out of VC even a possibility - maybe as an AN2 or associate level? I know PE firms want pre-MBA modeling experience

If I chose to fully commit to the MMA route, is there some way I could craft that into a unique story for business school and job recruiting? I am only 22, still relatively healthy, and it has always been a dream of mine to compete in MMA and be a professional athlete but ultimately I know that to make a legitimate career out of this is extremely unlikely - would schools and companies view this unfavorably or would it be an advantage?

Based on the current situation, I will probably just stick to the MSF as it is the safest option and gives me more time to ride out this hiring economy but I am willing to bet on myself and take the road less travelled. The dream outcome would be to end up at Raine - just wondering which route would best position me to end up there or in a comparable role/industry

Please be as brutally honest as you feel is required - some professional/life advice from you guys would be greatly appreciated 

TL;DR:  Recent college grad either deciding between an MSF, a VC analyst role, or take a few years off to do MMA before business school -- goal is to end up at sports/M&E focused investment bank/consulting firm ",Free_Information1235,1,1.0,1,1717615991,2024-06-05 19:33:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d8ynla/mma_fighter_to_ibpe_seeking_career_advice/,6,2024

1d8y97p,Feeling Lost as a Senior CS Student with No Real Experience or Motivation – Need Advice,"Hey everyone,



I'm going into my senior year of college, majoring in computer science, but I have no experience or personal projects. I'm reaching out because I really need some guidance.



Background: Before starting college, I experienced some significant life events that led to a clinical diagnosis of depression, which I'm still dealing with. While I don't want to use this as an excuse, it has definitely affected me. I chose Computer Science because I googled ""best majors 2021,"" and it seemed like a good idea at the time.



About Me: It's not that I don't want to be successful; it's just that I have no motivation, drive, or willingness to do much of anything. Everything feels mundane and doesn't bring me any happiness or sense of accomplishment. Whenever I've tried to apply myself, it hasn't worked out. In my free time, I don't have any hobbies or interests; I just stay home and watch TV all day.



College Experience: I'm entering my senior year without a single personal project, internship, or any relevant experience. I've cheated on every assignment to get by and always bomb the exams because I haven't learned the material. This has left me barely passing my classes with grades ranging from D to C.



Work Experience: Job-wise, I've only worked in retail sales jobs. In high school, I was motivated and did well, even making a good wage from commissions selling computer parts ($40/hr). But over time, that drive and motivation vanished. Now, I just go through the motions to get paid, doing the bare minimum.



Programming Experience: My only programming experience consists of basic HTML/CSS websites from freeCodeCamp.



Looking Ahead: I'm scared about graduation and have no idea what to do next. I don't have any family support and feel completely lost. Has anyone been in a similar situation or can offer any advice? I could really use some guidance on how to move forward.

I’m eager to gain some professional experience in the US, but I’m currently facing a few challenges.

1. **Work Authorization:** I do not have US work authorization, which I know can be a significant hurdle.
2. **Previous Experience:** I studied one exchange semester in the USA, which was an amazing experience and has fueled my desire to return for an internship.
3. **Current Experience:** I recently completed an internship at a wealth manager/private bank and was offered a part-time job to continue working alongside my studies. This experience has solidified my interest in finance and international business.

I’m looking for any advice on how to navigate these challenges, especially the work authorization part. Are there particular types of internships or companies that are more open to hiring international students? Any specific programs or resources that could help me with this process?

I would also appreciate any general tips on finding internships in the US, like good websites to search, networking strategies, or any personal experiences you’ve had that could guide me.

1d8xwui,Marketing Career Advice (career going backwards),"Career Advice

I’m a 20 year marketer, starting as a copywriter to leading marketing and comms teams, however my career has gone backwards in recent years.

For a few reasons, one I’m not a native in the country I work (Germany) so I generally lose HoM roles to locals. Secondly, I’ve kinda lost confidence in myself. Thirdly, because I have so much experience in content (but hate it) and I’m usually the only (or one of the only) English natives in the company, I get saddled witht these tasks.

Currently, all I’m doing for the company I work for is churning out articles and posting on LinkedIn. The CMO actually does very little and I’m holding the department together. But that’s another story.

Part of me is happy to just have a job in a tough climate, but I’m also really wasting my years and I can do so much more. I’m also earning 10k less a year than my previous job, but it’s not all about money.

I know the solution probably sounds easy, but I’m not doing very good. Feel trapped and steadily getting more and more depressed.

I have been applying for a few months and finally got an offer, unfortunately I got two options at the same time. I'm very unsure of which option to go for. 

My background is a cs degree 2016-2019 and data analytics master 2020-2023 (stupid choice I know).

Ultimately I wanna get into software development, but I'm not sure which job to take.

Option 1. 

Data Analyst Function. 
43k/year. 4 days remote, one day in office (1.5 hour commute).  Relaxed large team consisting of data analysts and data engineers, not too much pressure. Mostly working with SQL queries and reporting. Very large financial corporation working with lots of banks/insurance providers, very stable, many meetings and kinda boring work. Decent benefits.

Option 2.

Fullstack Software Developer 
39k/year + Lease car. 5 days in office (1hour commute)
Non existent team, there are only a few interns, no seniors. I would be the main developer on the team. The codebase is mostly JavaScript,
NodeJS, SQL and PHP. The codebase is very messy and basically started up by some parttime students. Work does seem interesting but more stressful. Also the benefits/contract isn't nearly as good.

I'm not sure if I should just take the data analyst position and keep looking for software gigs while having good work-life balance.

I’m essentially managing the entire queue alone, except for new equipment requests, which he handles. He’s delaying hiring a new employee because he’s looking for someone willing to work for minimum wage, which he hasn’t found yet.

1d8vegp,Why is toxicity so normalised in workplaces? ,"Hey everyone,

I think I just want your guidance on how to deal with managers and seniors who just want to exploit their employees. But there might be some venting as this is my first job. 

I have been working very hard, and I genuinely thought I would be involved in projects once I met the requirements. But when I asked the manager directly, it felt like he doesn't want me to take the cut so he's going to do it by himself without even letting me know if our proposal got accepted or not. 

I'm a recent graduate. It's been a year actually, but it just messes with my mind so much that there's so much exploitation going on everywhere and even when we try to speak up, nothing changes. My expertise and the work I do are like South and North poles, why? :') 

My company makes me do every single task from marketing to report writing but I'm not involved in projects. The only projects that I am involved in are those where the money goes to the manager and I can't even say that I'm even involved in them as that guy is not supposed to involve anyone in that work at all. It goes against the policy of those projects. I'm being discreet as I don't want anyone to find out who I am. 

My salary is very bad. I deserve better but due to some family issues I couldn't quit sooner. I'm planning to quit this month, but goddamn it hurts so bad. I stayed up until 5 AM on so many nights to finish my work as an intern and got this job after all that hard work. There's no work life balance at all. The fact that there is so much work load and yet the company is still trying to grow by stepping on its own employee's faces is mind boggling to me.

1d8uzet,"24M, Ex-Military, Hating the 9-to-5 Grind. How to Find a Fulfilling Career Path?","I'm a 24-year-old male who recently separated from the Air Force after 4 years in cybersecurity. While I have some college under my belt, I don't have a degree yet.

Here's the thing: I absolutely dreaded working service industry jobs as a teenager, and my time in the Air Force, while valuable, made me realize I really dislike the traditional 9-to-5 structure. I was heavily drinking back then to cope with it, and I'm determined to find something that doesn't make me feel that way.

Now that I'm back home, my parents are understandably pushing me to get any kind of job – retail, service, whatever. But I'm hesitant to just take something to appease them. I'm worried I'll end up hating it and feeling stuck again.

My experience in cybersecurity was interesting at times, but I'm not sure it's the perfect fit either. I'm open to exploring other options, but I'm feeling pretty lost right now.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you figure out your next steps? Any advice on finding a career path that's fulfilling and doesn't feel like just going through the motions?",NoFarmer1952,1,0.9900000095367432,2,1717606925,2024-06-05 17:02:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d8uzet/24m_exmilitary_hating_the_9to5_grind_how_to_find/,6,2024

But the ppl that work there are not to my standards, theyre disrespectful and the work culture doesnt align with my values. I cant tolerate them anymore. Plus, in my interview, i was told to work 8:30am-5pm and the bloody hr officer who is clueless and is unable to manage his team, did not proof read my contract and set it as 9am-5pm and sent it to the finance team. This whole time ive been working 8:30am-5pm whilst getting paid incorrectly. My manager spoke to the hr officer and after that he received news from the finance team that they rejected the new contract. Idk why. I have worked so hard, i have even volunteered to work weekends for this company previously but im tired now.

I'm currently at university studying music production and I’m starting to explore different potential career paths. I’m looking at going into the employed world as opposed to freelance because I don't like the instability of it, although I still plan to do freelance work as a side hustle.

I’m trying to keep my options open, so any advice on any potential careers, even if it's a weak link, would be greatly appreciated. Some careers that I have looked at are working in a university as a lecturer in audio/music production or something like working as a sound designer/audio designer for a games company like EA.

Has anyone here followed a similar path or have insights into these careers? Any advice on other potential careers I could consider with my degree would also be greatly appreciated. Additionally, tips on how to break into these fields you can share would be incredibly helpful.

1d8tshn,Recent college graduate and trying to navigate the professional world.,"I graduated with a finance degree about a year ago and have had great difficulty finding a job in my field. I lack experience and finding something in general has been hard, and even more so, finding something that pays me enough to survive. I had been doing some odd jobs (hourly) until about two months ago when I came across a position with a non-profit. I has heavily involved with this non-profit as a kid and was excited to jump back in (paid a salary this time). It is a great job to network and get practice when dealing with a wide range of people. I absolutely love my job and the people I meet everyday. I was hoping to chalk some of my work as experience but I'm unsure on if that is really going to be a possibility. My friend started working for a company in the same city as me and mentioned they are hiring more in his position. The company is publicly traded so better pay and benefits come naturally. While that is great, my greater interest is in the potential of finance experience. The position above his is also available, the job description mentions a finance degree and various types of analysis. I doubt I would be able to get this position because of my lack of experience. My friends position does not require a degree but he does a lot of work in Excel. I am currently trying to find out what he exactly does in Excel, but I'm speculating that this position would be beneficial to me trying to break into finance. I would hate to leave a job so early into my career after working at it for a short time, how important is longevity at a position rather than experience in a field? I would hate for leaving a job after working for two months to be detrimental to my career in the future, but I feel that I need experience more. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I will be happy to answer any questions barring any personal information.

I've always possessed an aptitude to effectively get technology to do what I wanted in addition to being able to pick it up quickly with little to no effort. 

With that being said, I foresaw what I thought would be a great career that would pay off.

Hopes and dreams quickly shattered when reality made itself apparent.  Regardless of certifications and education, the role that I foresaw myself in was never clearly defined by either institution or employer.  Instead, I have been condemned to a hell that defeats and and all known words that has no end in sight.  Monotonous, tedious, idiotic level work to enable the most hostile, predatory, and beligerant of persons is more and more likely to invoke the worst cardiac episode that I thought was ever possible.

While I *want* to believe that some employers and *some* job-seekers  will experience a better job and company experience, I am simply too far done being in a field that will disallow me from putting anything great on my resume.

I've been offered a new job. Same salary. Longer commute but more flexibility to work from home, apparently. It's for a HUGE company and would look great on the CV! Sounds exciting too. 

The maternity package at my current place is incredible though but the package at the new company is so bad. I've done the maths and It's the difference of £10,000!

Should I worry about this, even though we're not thinking about having children for a couple years anyway.

There have been several meetings about ""resourcing"" that I am not part of despite being a senior leadership member. I wrote a project charter for one of the projects that is remaining and was told to ""trim it down, it's too much"".  

My work has dwindled to almost nothing. I might have a total of 2 hours of work a day. I attend meetings and that's about it. I had my annual performance review today, it was 8 minutes long. My boss basically doesn't care.

But recently because of my hard work, and someone transferring, they gave me an opportunity to train in the purchasing department. I’m doing good so far despite not having the experience. But down the line there is a potentially opportunity to be an estimator for the company. They don’t have an opening yet, but I have good relations with the estimator and the manager. Not sure the pay scale/difference within the company. I’m a bit lower than I’d like to be atm. Which of the two would have more transferable skills despite not having a college degree?

I have been a litigation paralegal for 11 years — I have a bachelor’s degree and paralegal certification from an accredited program, but most importantly, I am excellent at my job. 

To the point, I started working at a new law firm in a niche field in 2022. It’s a small firm albeit we have offices in three states. When I interviewed at the end of 2021, I was told I would handle about eight cases at a time. Last summer, I reached 20. It was at this point that I finally agreed with the senior paralegal that we needed help. In September 2023, a paralegal with 4 years experience was hired and as the senior paralegal is in a different state, I handled her training. Of course she made mistakes in the beginning, but I brushed it off to her being young and inexperienced. I soon learned that it was actually a result of her apathy toward working and that she was spending her days watching tv/movies on her phone in her office. By February, I was at my wit’s end and decided to talk to her about her progress one-on-one. She cried and accused me of being like her mother and that “she would never be good enough for me.” Of course I saw how unprofessional that was, but it made me feel a bit of pity for her and I gave her more chances. In March, after correcting more of her work, she accused me of micromanaging and blamed me for her lack of success. It was then that I finally made formal complaints to HR. In April, she was given a 60-day period to improve or face consequences. At 30 days, I made more formal complaints to HR, and she coincidentally quit the next day. 

I’m not going to hide it, I was elated by her resignation, but then I discovered HR gave me access to her inbox WITHOUT deleting any e-mails that may have been confidential, such as her offer letter. That is when I learned my salary was only $5,000 more than hers annually. 

Throughout my career, I have asked for raises and have felt perfectly adequate in doing so. However, now, I’m wondering if it’s to my benefit to use this information as leverage to negotiate higher, or if that would be a mistake. Does anyone have any experience in this situation, or any advice? I truly appreciate anyone who reads this and am thankful for any input.

1d8pnnn,Starting Out,"I'm a 19 year old college sophomore and I had some questions about entering the workforce. I feel like I'm behind my peers on much of this stuff, mainly because I don't really have the faintest clue where to start. My parents aren't really helpful with stuff like this. I wanted to know how you first get into the industry you'd like to be in. Whether that be a job or, more likely in my case, an internship. I have very good grades, skills, and other extraprofessional qualifications that I think would be attractive to an employer. The big thing I don't have is a strong network. How are you supposed to start out? Make a profile on a bunch of job sites like LinkedIn and Indeed? Try and sollicit people you know for opportunities? Just kinda wait? And if you are supposed to use the people you know how do you go about asking for that? Just any advice from people on how to get into an industry would be really appreciated.

1d8pm50,"What should I do with my life, because this currently isn't it. ","I'm 23 years old, with some limited work experience in leadership and warehousing (3+ years). Several years of customer service/retail/food experience (5+ years). And experience in mentoring (2+ years). 

I'm very good with Microsoft and have several certifications for it along with being a certified CPHT. 

I have three degrees:
- Associates Degree
- Bachelor's Degree (Political Science) 
- MBA (Pending completion this Fall) 

I started working at my current company in 2020, and at the time applied for an entry level position. Instead, they offered me a ""lead"" position on their operations team. Within a year I was promoted to a Supervisor, but recently I was ""volun-told"" that I had to move to another department as the assistant manager. I absolutely despise it. 

Despite the title, I spend hours of my day doing manual labor. Moving pallets, unloading and loading the dock, dumping product from Gaylord's, cleaning, etc. My team is short staffed with no ability to get more people, and they have a piecemeal incentive that essentially dissolves any ability to delegate I might otherwise have. 

At the same time I'm expected to write SOPs and OWIs, develop warehouse operating systems using excel and other Microsoft tools, and provide data analytics for upper management, and have daily client facing interactions.

I am the only person leading a team of 30+ people, and I have no one that can provide coverage for me if I wanted to take a vacation or was out sick. 

We recently moved locations in the warehouse and the upper level of the mesanine (where my team is at) does not have electricity so I have to walk across the warehouse to visit my team. I don't even have a cubicle or office to conduct coachings with my team just a table as a desk out on the operations floor.

My director acted like I was going to get a lead - or in the very least a runner but those reqs have since been rejected or disolved. 

I'm not sure if I'm being entitled in saying this , but with my degrees should I really have to be doing this for my career? I have applied to other jobs such as business analyst or a call center manager etc. (going on 50 applications) and I haven't had a single callback. 

I'm not even making enough to move out of my parents house (60k). I'm just super frustrated and want to find a career path that isn't beating me up physically and draining me mentally. I'm totally burnt out and the idea of coming to work everyday just makes me want to cry.

1d8ow94,I (26M) don't know what career I should get into,"# Hi, hello. I made this account just to ask this question but I've stalked around Reddit before, posted one thing in the past.

**ANYWAYS**, I need some kind of advice in what to do for a career.

  
**Some quick backstory**: I have an Associate's in Audio/Video Production and 2 years experience as a videographer/editor, but not many places around me hire for that type of job field. The place I live is more of a warehouse/factory place. My apartment is also expensive as hell for a 1 bedroom, and I don't have a lot of money. I don't know if this part matters but I have seen a psychologist for two years or so, but had to stop because I lost my health insurance. She diagnosed me with ADHD, depression, ptsd, and general anxiety. (yay!)

I currently work as a Forklift Operator in a probationary period for a job I just got about a month ago. They have this quota of picking so many cases within an hour to get hired on after the probationary period, so that's a bit worrying because I feel like I won't be able to hit that quota and will have to start looking for another dead-end job that'll pay little.

  
So, my brain is in a small panic 24/7 about what I should do with my life or for a career. I basically just work, do chores, edit my own gaming videos, and talk to my GF.

I'm interested in creative jobs and things that can impact people in an inspirational and good way. I like animals (dogs especially), art, games, D&D, medieval stuff, etc etc. (Tbh, it's kinda hard to think of things I like anymore).

I feel like I'm stuck around having to have a high-paying job for my high rent, not having a Bachelor's which is what most jobs look for in this field, and being generally disinterested in almost everything that has to do with jobs/careers. I don't know what career to even pick from because you either need a degree or they don't seem interesting. What could I do to help me find a career to get into, and actually be interested into it?

  
TLDR: Rent expensive, need job for now, everything bland, constant stress and idk what career to pick grrr

1d8ofyw,What field should I study?,"I am having a really hard time figuring out what field I am going to study. I enjoy studying and I am motivated for a master, and also a phd. I think I would like to work in the university, and become a lecturer. I really enjoy explaining things that I know well to other people, so I think its a fitting job for me. I would also love to be a researcher/scientist. And this is also possible trough university of course. Anything related to engineering, and becoming an engineer is also interesting to me. 

The problem is that I don’t know which field I want to study. I really enjoy maths and physics, but I think I want some natural sciences as well. This is why geology (and also maybe biology) has been high on my list. I would love to be able to travel and do some field work outside. I have been dreaming about becoming a researcher on Antarctica or some other obscure location. So a field that gives me the opportunity to do something like that would be cool. But I don’t want to be stuck traveling for the rest of my life. I want to be able to settle down as well.

On the other side I am considering fields leaning more towards engineering and physics. Like electrical engineering or just maths and physics in general. What I don’t like about these are that I don’t think I will get as many opportunities to travel or work outside. What I like is being able to design and create useful and cool things. And I like to create things in my spare time as well, so this knowledge and skills would be useful to me. I also think an education in engineering will give me better career options if I want to work outside the university as well.

1d8ofr3,I (29M) am unsure whether to take a possible paycut in the hope of career progression. What should I do?,"Hello, I (29M) have been working for the same local authority for 2 years having previously worked at a few others.  I like where I work generally, I like my colleagues, it's in a good location with flexible working that is easy to get to.

However, I have been passed up for promotion 3 times at the interview stage and it's starting to get me down.  There isn't a lot of staff turnover compared with other councils I have worked at.  I am stuck in a bit of a bottleneck with other people at my level and there are limited opportunities to progress and move upwards at the moment.  It also just feels embarrassing going for the same job again and again, getting rejected time after time.  It's affecting my confidence and I see myself falling behind other people and getting frustrated at a lack of progression.

I have 3 options going forward:

1. Stay where I am and be happy with my current position:

Where I am currently pays quite well compared to other local authorities.  While there is sometimes too much work at the level I am currently at, it isn't that stressful and there isn't too much pressure on individuals.  I have a healthy work/life balance.

There should be a 12 month secondment opportunity coming up in the next 3 months.
There *may* be other opportunities in a department that is aligned with mine.  However, this is unlikely to come to pass for another year at least.

2. Look elsewhere at other local authorities:

I am thinking of applying for the role above at other local authorities.  This would allow me to progress with more responsibility (and more work) at another council.  However, I will not receive a pay increase for this as my local authority pays higher than neighbouring authorities.  I will likely be taking on additional work for little gain in the short term.

3. Do agency work:

Doing agency work will have less job security, no pension but does pay substantially more.  It could mean working remotely for authorities much further away, comitting to doing a long drive once a week.  I have no mortgage but I would like one in the next 2 years.  I do have concerns this may impact my ability to buy a house but I'm unsure how much impact that will make.

What should I do?  Has anyone been faced with a similar situation?

Tl;dr - I'm unsure whether to leave my work for career progression and risk getting paid less for a more difficult job.",Wah-Wah43,2,1.0,3,1717589707,2024-06-05 12:15:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d8ofr3/i_29m_am_unsure_whether_to_take_a_possible_paycut/,6,2024

- Graduation : BCom (Hons) DU. (Again one of the best college in the South of DU)

- MBA : a decent one. Not any of the IIMs but a tier 3 college.

1d8n0rp,Need Advice: Should I Leave My Current Job for a New HR Admin Role?,"
Hi everyone,

I could really use some advice on my current job situation. Here's a bit of background:

- I started a master's in HR this year. 

- For the past 3 years, I've been working as an assistant manager at a retail wholefood store.

- I wanted to gain some admin experience, so I spent 4 months searching for an entry-level HR job. I applied to over 100 positions, had 4 interviews, but didn't land a job because they chose candidates with more admin experience.

- A month ago, I finally got a job at a small distribution company doing admin work, replacing a long-term employee who had been there for 15 years.

- The company is small with no room for advancement, and I'm not sure if I fit in with the culture and attitudes of my colleagues/boss.

While working there, I continued job hunting and just landed a new HR admin job closer to home this week. Now, I’m facing a dilemma on how to tell my current employer.

For context:

- I’m working on a casual basis.

- One of my (the only other main admin staff) colleagues is about to go on holiday for 2 weeks.

I'm really torn because I don't want to leave my current employer in a bind, but this new job seems like a much better fit for my career goals. How should I approach this situation? Any advice on how to handle the conversation with my current employer would be greatly appreciated.

1d8m6w5,"Asking for pay rise, got ignored until I put in my notice.","Hi there,
Just trying to get your opinion on this apologies for the novel. 
I work in the trades and contract out and am on salary some times. So I have worked for an employer (twice) left first time for a higher paying job (no bad blood etc) then was asked to return a couple of years later for a little bit more money (5k more)as the employer was short on people and there was ‘no pressure to return’ but the door was open sort of thing.

I returned and tried to give it another go- things weren’t so bad maybe it will be different sort of thing and was knowingly earning about (about $6-$8 less per hour), however always was going to ask for a raise after 6 months after settling back in.
I also found out that know one working there received a pay rise over the last couple of years and the morale was quite low. 
Meanwhile, I got asked to do another role earning a lot more money about $500 more per week after about 9 months of being back and asked my boss politely if I could get a raise, but didn’t tell him I got the other offer. They said they couldn’t afford it, and compared my wage to others which I thought was pretty unprofessional.

It was then ignored for about two weeks along with passive aggressiveness etc  until I asked my employer if they have had a think about it? They said they could only give $5k more (knowing they are just seeing
What sticks) and that’s it and there were other people to take the role if I didn’t want it. 

I basically said I have another offer and put in my resignation, then they left it for two days and came back with a counter offer that basically matched my new offer above market rate) 
Anyway, really annoyed that employers cry poor until you put in notice.

I’m in two minds and am still thinking of leaving as my gut says this will just keep happening and have just been taken advantage of again andwill be on the hit list?

1d8jqwm,List multiple pivots on resume separately or collectively?,"At what level of expertise would you list something as a 'skill' in a resume, and would it be better to break the work experience part of the resume based on the four ideas, or to just lump it as a whole as experiences under the proprietorship?

In the past 4 years, I have worked on around 4 ideas. For each idea, I performed robust and extensive market research, requirement gathering, software product design and planning for software architecture and data structures. I pivoted each time before any major development on a minimum viable product started, due to it being potentially an un-investable business, or the segment having too much competition. I incorporated the business as a sole proprietorship and worked on these 4 ideas in the context of the proprietorship.

I also picked up some courses and skills in Python, Javascript and SQL, and have looked through a decent amount of technical documentation. I have used them a bit and wrote simple programs or commands, but is not good enough as a standalone employable skill.

Breaking the resume based on the four ideas is unconventional, but I can expand on my work during each period. I wonder what's the better apporach.

1d8hwn8,Where did I go wrong? ,"I am 8 years into my career and haven’t even broke $70k. I went to a smaller school which was mostly covered by scholarships. I wouldn’t have been able to afford a more prestigious school based on the cost of larger schools and the scholarships that I did earn. There were minimal internship opportunities at my school and I was off to the work force after graduating with a B.S. in economics with an emphasis in finance (no straight finance degree from my school) in 3 years. 

I started in life insurance sales but was miserable and bad at selling insurance. Transitioned to retail banking, then to corporate lending, and now I am a pricing analyst in the electrical industry. 

I went into finance expecting to make a lot of money and feel that I made a mistake. Outside of the short lived life insurance sales job I have been a top performer at every position. I am a fast learner and adapt to new roles quickly and effortlessly. I am very analytical and have great attention to detail. I also am patient and have a calm demeanor which is partly the reason I work with tougher accounts or people with what we will call “strong” personalities. 

Where did I screw up? Why can’t I make more money? Does anyone have any advice? 

TLDR: I went to a small school to avoid massive amounts of debt and I feel that my career is suffering because of it. ",throwaway169272,0,0.5,3,1717563768,2024-06-05 05:02:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d8hwn8/where_did_i_go_wrong/,6,2024

I am looking for a software product management role. How should I write this business experience?

If I write myself as a founder with no significant achievements, it seems to be over-inflating my self worth and value.

If I write myself as a business owner, it would avoid some negative connotations of startup founders especially in tech, and appear more down to earth.

If I write myself as a product manager, it would also be dishonest because I did not manage anyone.

If I write myself as being a product manger (individual contributor), it would be better but my actual scope is broader but less specific.

I could also consider myself as a market researcher, designer and solutions architect, but the previous point still applies.

Each carries its own assumptions. I would like to continue being in tech, and I'm fine wearing multiple hats. My end goal is probably to lead product teams.

1d8fjai,Private MBBS or Business Management ,"Hi, I'm Rudra. I'm a NEET dropper and scored 246 marks, so getting a government MBBS seat is not possible. My family can afford private MBBS fees (1.3-1.5 crores). As a backup, I've also taken the MHT BBA CET, which could get me into top Mumbai colleges like Jai Hind, HR, or KC through management quota (fees around 20 lakhs).

My family is well-off; my dad works in the private sector. He said he can pay the 1.5 crores for MBBS, but what about after that? For NEET PG, private college fees are 3-4 crores, and we don't have a setup like a big hospital or land, so that would need more money. After doing MBBS from a private college, I don't want to work under someone; I want to open my own hospital. But my dad said we can't predict our financial situation in 5 years.

If I do BBA/BMS, the fees are much less compared to MBBS, and I'd be happy to work for someone else and get a good return on investment. Or I could start my own business.

I'm currently working as a Product Manager at a startup in Ottawa, but I'm considering an opportunity to move back to Toronto for a Senior Product Manager role at a large grocery chain. I could use some advice on which might be the better choice.

**Current Role: Startup (Ottawa)**

* **Position**: Product Manager
* **Salary**: $110K
* **Location**: Ottawa (onsite, 5 days a week)
* **Pros**:
   * Working in an area I enjoy
   * High level of responsibility and autonomy in product strategy
   * Significant resume-building experience
   * I'm pretty much the head of product
* **Cons**:
   * Less responsive development team
   * More sales-focused than product-led organization
   * No flexibility with onsite work, which is challenging after working remotely for 5 years

**Potential Role: Large Grocery Chain (Toronto)**

* **Position**: Senior Product Manager
* **Salary**: $140K
* **Location**: Toronto (hybrid work)
* **Contract**: 12 months (with potential for full-time conversion)
* **Pros**:
   * Higher salary
   * More structure and stability within a large organization
   * I live in Toronto, so I'd be close to family and friends
* **Cons**:
   * Contract role, so less job security
   * Higher cost of living in Toronto

**Context**:  
I took the Ottawa role because I didn't have other offers at the time. Now, I'm torn between staying in Ottawa, where I have the opportunity to gain valuable experience in a field I enjoy, despite the rigid office culture and challenges with team responsiveness, or moving back to Toronto for a higher-paying, hybrid role in a more structured environment. The Toronto role also has the potential to convert to a full-time position, which could provide more long-term stability.

I'd appreciate any advice on which option might be better in the long run, considering factors like job stability, career growth, and work-life balance.

Thank you!

I was in the process of finding something with better pay than I previously made and a place that would value me more than I felt I was valued here. I also wanted more pay than what we agreed to. Just under 40k/yr, which I think is pretty average pay for a recent graduate from what I've seen and it's around what my non-grad friends make, but I wanted better for myself. Maybe I am just trying to justify being short-changed?



I was advised to negotiate for more, but because I'm in a crazy situation that needs a solution like yesterday, I feel like beggars can't be choosers, so I should take what I can get. I gave a range and was given just under what I asked for. Besides, I am extremely grateful for how supportive my job has been to help quickly turn things around for me. But I'm also wondering about my other options or if I sold myself short.



I'm thinking of either going part-time or completely leaving this place after 6 months to a year. I just don't want to seem like I'm using them I guess? I've been told not to feel this way, but I can't help but feel bad when I think about leaving so soon after this. How would you all navigate this sort of situation and should I even feel bad about wanting something better already?",idontknowwwahahahaha,0,0.5,1,1717546207,2024-06-05 00:10:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d8cez4/bad_sitaution_in_personal_life_led_to_better_pay/,6,2024

1d8c2su,Unexpected Promotion Without Pay Adjustment – Need Advice,"Hi r/careeradvice,

I’m a senior product analyst and my company recently reorganized to centralize the analytics team. As part of this, I’ve essentially become an analytics lead, managing one L3 analyst and soon a junior L2 analyst.

I never explicitly agreed to this role change, and it’s reduced my time for individual contributor work, which tbh I prefer. Additionally, my salary hasn’t been adjusted, and there’s no clear indication if or when it will be.

I signed a contract confirming my switch to the new org, but it states that nothing will change, whereas it clearly has.

Has anyone dealt with something similar? How should I approach my manager or HR about a salary review and backpay? Any advice would be appreciated.

I'm just not sure on which path might be best. I'm mostly deciding between doing inside wirework or linework. I was planning to try and move to Washington state, probably somewhere like Seattle or something, for it since I figure there's way more money up there, and besides I really wanna get out of Texas for various political reasons.

I've heard that linework makes a lot of money, which sounds nice, but I've also heard a lot of stories of people dying on the job and that *really* scares me. I'd hate to move to a new state away from my family only to just up and die.

So now I'm thinking maybe inside wirework might be better since I imagine it's far less risky, but I've heard the money is not as good and that people can go unemployed for a long time.

1d887dq,Need Advice on Signing a New Contract as an Independent Contractor: How Should I Proceed?,"Not sure if this is the place to post this, if there's a more appropriate subreddit to post to please let me know!

I've been working at a music school for several years and recently, the entire staff was presented with a new contract via email and was told to sign and send it back the next day. The owner stated that these are new policies. There are several points that concern me, especially considering my status as an independent contractor. The contract appears hastily drafted and not professionally prepared. I'm hoping to get some advice on whether I should sign it, and if I do, what aspects I can negotiate without jeopardizing my job.

It's worth mentioning that when I was initially hired, I never signed nor was presented with a contract. Admittedly, at the time, I didn't fully understand the implications of being an independent contractor, so I didn't question it. It's possible they overlooked providing me with the contract, or perhaps they assumed our longstanding relationship negated the need for formal documentation. Regardless, this is their standard procedure for hiring teachers, is hiring them on as 1099 workers. **Here are some concerning points:**

1. **Mandatory Unpaid Meetings**: The contract requires attendance at a yearly mandatory meeting without compensation.
2. **Non-Compete Clause**: Prohibits working for competitors while contracted with the academy.
3. **Confidentiality of Salary Information**: Prohibits discussing salaries with other employees.
4. **Penalties for Late Timesheets**: Imposes a $25 penalty for each day a timesheet is late.
5. **Notice Period for Leaving**: Requires a two-month notice period before leaving.

**Example of the Contract Language:**

Here's how some of the contract reads:

2. Teachers will agree with management on salary. Yearly evaluations will be implemented to determine salary rate and potential salary increases. Teachers should NOT discuss salaries with other employees. **(side note: we are not on salary)** 

3. If applicable, teachers will teach all family members of students enrolled. No family members will be taught outside of the studio on the teacher’s own schedule. Failure to comply with this rule is grounds for dismissal and legal action.

6. Any teachers that are terminated will not deserve the right to continue any working relationships with clients previously contracted with the school.

7. Teachers will agree to give the school TWO MONTHS notice if leaving the school. (Private lessons)

10. Private Teachers will arrive 15 minutes prior to the first lesson of the day to prepare for lessons. **(side note: those 15 minutes are unpaid)**

11. All staff members will agree to resign if three strikes are administered for not adhering to the above or additional policies provided by the owner.

12. Contract teachers will NOT create any type of 501-C or foundation with association with any families enrolled with the school.

13. Teachers will not work for any competitors while 1099 contractors with the Academy, unless discussed and approved with the owner.

21. Yearly Mandatory Meeting: Teachers will be asked to attend a one-day meeting yearly. (No pay is required by the studio to attend this meeting, as it will be part of your staff duty)

23. All teachers will be considered 1099 workers 

**Recent Mandatory Meeting Incident:**

Recently, we had a mandatory meeting at a sophisticated venue that spanned 5 hours, including my travel time (I live an hour away). I included my hours in the monthly timesheet we send, but the owner stated they do not pay ""employees"" for mandatory staff meetings and planned to deduct that pay. I emailed back, basically explaining that this is considered paid work time. They responded that they would pay me this one last time, but only myself and another person who was typing the ""meeting minutes"" would be compensated.

Following this, the owner sent an email to all staff stating they will not be paying for mandatory meetings because they spent thousands on the venue, and we should be grateful for this ""treat."" They emphasized the necessity of the meeting. There were over 30 workers at this meeting. It seems like the owners want to treat us as employees, even though we are 1099 workers.

**My Questions:**

1. **What aspects should I prioritize for negotiation to make the contract more fair?**
2. **How can I negotiate these terms without risking my job?**
3. **Has anyone dealt with a similar situation, and what was your experience?**
4. **What are my rights in this situation as an independent contractor?**

Given my long history with the school and my multiple roles, I'm hoping for advice on how to approach this situation delicately. I want to maintain a good relationship with the owner while ensuring the terms are reasonable and reflective of my status as an independent contractor.

Thanks in advance for your help!

1d86g9w,"Like my job, but need more money. Have to look for something new.","Hey Reddit, looking for a new path.  This is a throwaway alt.

tl;dr need more money but love my job, not ready to leave unless I find something that pays more AND won't make me miserable

I did my absolute dream job (camera assistant in the film industry) for about 12 years.  I made a ton of money, was challenged everyday, got to see and do amazing things, and I loved it.  I lived in a major production center that was an awesome city to live in.

Due to circumstances beyond my control, we have had to move to a new city and leave the film industry behind.  I now live in the greater St. Louis, MO area.  This move forced me to accept I was likely going to have to get a ""normal job"" and hate my life they way it seems most people do.

Unexpectedly, I found a new job I love and found it quickly.  Shortly after moving here almost a year ago, I became a flight coordinator for an air ambulance service, dispatching medical transport helicopters.  It's exciting, reasonably challenging and engaging, and I get to feel like I still have a ""cool job"".

However:  it doesn't pay enough.  $22/hour with very little chance for meaningful raises, and little room to ""grow"" in the company.  I love the job, but while it has served well as an interim position to get us set up in the new city, we cannot keep up with the mortgage payments forever this way, not to mention all of our ever increasing costs for childcare and groceries.  At least it isn't possible to do so comfortably.  

My wife and I are looking for a new direction for me.  This isn't crazy urgent as I have a solid job currently, and I won't a job I enjoy for a job I dislike that pays barely more.

Not able to relocate.  Able to work on-site, remote, or hybrid.  I'm a very capable, personable employee.  I interview well and I can learn new tasks very quickly.  It doesn't take long to train me in anything.  Lots of leadership experience as a department head in film.  I am willing to do school or a training program if it leads to something both exciting and lucrative in a long term way.  Willing to do physical jobs in the elements at weird hours, or regular 9-5 desk job, as long as the content of the job is engaging and pays well.  Lots of experience with extreme hours, and okay with doing it again, but cannot take a job that will take me away from home for days/weeks at a time.  has to be local.  I'm very technically minded, but also do well with customer-facing work.  I have a Bachelor of Science, but it's in film so it isn't relevant to anything except to check the box.

I have considered the trades, but I have enough parallel experience from my film job and from my own home repairs to know I wouldn't be happy.

I thought for a while about air traffic control, but apparently I'm too old (35) to start the training, and also I'm sure I'd have to work at airports far from home while paying dues, and that doesn't work for the wife with the young children.

Every time I stumble on something that sounds interesting and accessible, it turns out to pay as little as what I do now.

I know how priviledged this all sounds, by the way.  Still.  I'm looking for outside the box ideas that are interesting, reliable, and lucrative.  The job does not need to be easy, I'm a very hard worker who holds himself to a high standard.  Open to ideas also for jobs that maybe don't quite check the boxes, but have a ladder to one that does.

Following college I worked in public accounting for 5 years at a big four public accounting firm. I started feeling burnt out in my last busy season and decided that I wanted to find a new job. I applied to a company that was in the same industry as one of my manufacturing clients. From the time I submitted my application to signing my acceptance was one week. I’ve now been at the company for 3 months and am regretting making a such a drastic decision. The role that I took is no where near the scope of the role that I previously had. The company is a smaller company and their performance over the past few years has also not been the best (not operating at a profit). Additionally the commute had been a lot worse as well. I have been looking at other opportunities and ultimately wish I would have stayed searching for a while instead of accepting the first opportunity that popped up. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do when it comes to other opportunities? Should I stick it out for a year? Should I look into the other opportunities that are available?

I don't know how much more energy I can put into this. On one hand I like what I do, and it's all l've really done as an adult. Before this I worked in a dental office while I was in college. Took me 10 years to graduate with an econ degree I never ended up using in a practical sense. On the other hand I dread working for someone else.

1d85gqy,Worried about the recruiter getting upset about declining a job offer?,"Hi, I'm writing this because I'm very conflicted. I've been working with a recruiter and received a job offer today. On paper, the job seems better than my current job. Better title, about 10k more a year for similar work to what I'm doing now, but farther commute and worse location. However, I'm starting to have doubts about leaving my current job (which does have its issues, but overall I like and I love the people I work with). When I received the offer directly from the company, I asked if they could share their benefits for me to review. They sent over just their medical benefits, which would cost me about $230 more a month. They didn't share anything about vacation time, if the cost of parking is covered (which can run about $200/month in LA), 401k, etc. Is it normal for them not to share these things before accepting an offer? I think l'd also feel more comfortable asking the recruiter about these things, but I'm worried he'll get mad if he starts to catch on that I'm becoming hesitant about accepting, especially because so far l've presented as very confident about taking the opportunity. I've heard they can kind of blacklist you and l'd hate for that to happen. I'm still pretty early on in my career so I'm pretty sure I'm just overthinking all of this, but any guidance would be appreciated!",Such-Wrangler-790,2,1.0,4,1717528504,2024-06-04 19:15:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d85gqy/worried_about_the_recruiter_getting_upset_about/,6,2024

I joined a semiconductor company in a sustaining-engineering role less than two years ago, shortly after completing my bachelor's degree. I have continued my education (paid by the company) and am projected to finish my Master's degree by the end of this year.

Recently, my manager mentioned that I might be becoming overqualified for my current role and informed that a new position, believed to be more suitable for me, will soon be available in our area. I aim to leverage my current experience, newly developed in-demand skills, and well-recognized work ethic to maximize potential income should an offer be extended.

1d84lz4,"I only do about 5 hrs of work a week at a Fortune 100 company, and have nothing to do. I’m constantly anxious about getting fired. What do I do? ","Throwaway account for obvious reasons, but here’s my situation: 

     My first job out of college, I worked about 50+ hours a week. I needed to work past regular hours to fully complete my tasks and help my clients. I also enjoyed the work since I was fresh out of college, so naturally I worked harder. I ended up getting promoted twice with a year and worked up to a mid-level position. However, I didn’t see a real future in my specific department, and that company wanted to keep me in that department for multiple years. At that point at had built up an impressive resume, so I started looking for jobs. 

     Eventually, I decided to take a job at my current company. It’s in a big department, but my team is small and specialized. I replaced a women who was in this role for 2.5 years before me, who left to pursue something else. 
    I am now a year into this job and I shit you not.. I have maybe done an average of 5 hours of work a week. My company has tuition reimbursement so I’ve been going to grad school my entire tenure. Still though, I cannot find ways to look busy at work and am just on my phone after finishing school work and personal projects. 

I have asked and suggested ways for me to take on more work but there just simply isn’t much for me to do. My manager does the majority of the work and handles meetings. She is very knowledgeable in this niche area so I can understand it. 

Therefore, I feel constant anxiety around my job security. I feel like people think I’m lazy, cut corners, etc. When I had my annual review, I had nothing to argue for a salary increase. I just said “I think it’s fair to receive a salary increase that’s aligned with inflation.” I feel so invaluable and feel like I’m wasting my early learning years. On the other hand, I’m getting my masters paid for but that would require me to stay another two years. 

What do I do? Has anyone else been in this position? I want to be valuable, respected, and continue learning.

1d841zx,"33 years old, 3 years unemployed. Don't know where to start.","TLDR; Graduated college late => landed a random job unrelated to degree => mental and physical health collapsed => unemployed for 3 years => looking to get back into the job market but i’m clueless

I graduated college with a BA in economics/statistics in 2017. After aimlessly looking for a job I luckily landed one doing governmental accounting work (I had no accounting experience or education at the time). I somehow managed to teach myself everything I needed and stayed there for around 3 years despite hating the work but unfortunately my health began gradually worsening and I was on the verge of a complete breakdown. As a result I reluctantly left my job but it was not on the best of terms as I wrestled with management about my situation. Looking back now I should have handled the situation more professionally and I am regretful as now I am unsure of how I will get references for my next job.  
  


Now, I don’t have any specific skills or knowledge sets that I believe will help me land a job (maybe I’m wrong about that though). The governmental accounting I did was very niche so I’m not sure what kind of positions I qualify for currently. I’m currently willing to do ANYTHING at this point, I’m 3 years unemployed and though that has been rough thankfully I have savings, a good chunk of which is still left over. Also, my health is a lot better now and I feel as if I’m fit to go back to work soon.

So I wanted to ask you all for some advice. What kinds of jobs/work can/should I be applying to? Should I go back to school perhaps? Any good resources or guides you could recommend me? I have no idea which direction I should go in or even where to start.

I have done 3 years of marketing from christ bangalore & 1 year of diploma from xaviers.

I’m very confused about these three things:
1. If i should go abroad for my higher studies because i want to scale up my career via studying strategic communication. In my opinion, if you want to reach a global level in terms of the pay and the recognition, you need to study abroad. I really want to crack BEST colleges for which i will require a loan.

I’m also confused about this because i’ll be going on a student loan and will i get a good roi. Is it worth leaving my parents behind in India? I want to work for them as well. I’m scared what if i don’t figure out my stuff there and then my parents will have to suffer.

2. If i should go abroad to study in 2025 fall or 2026 fall because I WANT TO CRACK THE BEST IVY COLLEGES FOR MY MASTERS IN STRATEGY. If i go in 2026, i might get more time to work on my profile.

1d83o2p,How to answer any job interview question,"My friend just published his book today! [I Hate Job Interviews](https://www.amazon.com/Hate-Job-Interviews-Stressing-Performing-ebook/dp/B0CLKY9SLW). I'm super proud of him and wanted to share.

His book teaches how to answer any type of job interview question: introductory, behavioral, hypothetical, opinion, personal, think-on-your-feet, salary, and self-awareness questions.

It focuses just on the interview itself—not applying for jobs, resumes, etc—and because it's so narrowly focused, he gets really nitty-gritty and shares actually useful content, not just the usual surface-level suggestions.

He got an endorsement from Stephen M. R. Covey—""For anyone wanting to elevate their interview skills, this superb book does the job!""—and FOX Business [covered it](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/hate-job-interviews-book-promises-lighter-brighter-career-process-best-stuff) last week.

(further in the post)","pls don't comment solely based on title, i have never been open to anyone about everything my whole life which i am gonna do now to receive some good advice.

i m rivaan, i will be 19 next month, so my dad is a drunkard and doesn't care much he gives me money whenever he feels like it. If not he wouldn't give it even in emergencies. Financial condition at my home isn't that great, can buy materialistic things for more comfort ? NO ! having issues living or normal expenses ? nahh we good basically even if i don't go out and don't earn we r fine, but are living conditions will only improve if i earn.

I am skinny and atheletic so i need money for weight gain and stuff ( pls don't comment eat what u get at home, it doesn't work i don't get so great food at home. i saw changes before i got injured ). it is really necessary for me it affects my confidence alot fr. i have seen the diff in treatment by ppl in summer and winters, i can cover my weak body in winters and only show my face unlike summers. i have average or above average face, with average height and so.

i am doing my degree from a shit college, no placements, environment, sports facilities etc. NO attendance problem. i earn some money from a helping a guy with his business ( i am into digital marketing field for now atleast ), it's not a proper job as i have to work few hours or not even go there or work, boss is pretty chill and supportive.

I am confused about **what should i do i have many options as i have received many advices** from my mentors but never told them full situation , i will enlist those options and why i think i should consider them :

**option 1** : Go to the college normally, try to adjust in and attend classes normally untill 3rd year atleast ( i will be a second year after 3 months).

Reason : some say i am just 18 and too young. i should probably live normally experience life and youth and do things like job or anything else when i am proper age. that's why i think i should get a gf or try to make some good freinds in college,

drawbacks : i will only be wasting time in the name of fun instead of growing my skillset, money earned would be from that part time, money problem would will still be there after college.

**option 2 :** Get a proper job that pays around 30k INR and move out, work on my body, work on my manners, my skill set and gradually build a business ( an marketing agency ) ( i have the skillset to do it ). i wouldn't have to worry abt money.

Reason : its kinda hard at my own home cuz of distractions and helping in the house, and i think i will miss out on things and hanging out with freinds ( i have very good freinds from childhood and school who lives nearby). and biggest reason **i will lose my freedom at young age and can't do what i wan**t

**Option 3:** stop whining and try to find some clients, i am confident with service delivery, forget abt moving out and use that money to build up my body but still there are distractions ( i will tell ahead abt biggest one)

**option 4 :** just go with the flow as things are going on, with the part time i'll definitely grow but at a really slow pace, but i will enjoy and go to college and enjoy with my freinds. workout process going smoothly.

**Option 5 :** After bachelors i don't think my parents can give money for masters ( MBA ), i would have to probably take a loan or get a job based on my bacehlors and do mba later or maybe executive mba later.

these options other than moving out has a obstacle and that is my dad, he comes back once an year and messes up everything untill he stays (3 months ). he came back messed up with my working schedule, workout and diet too, which caused me stress as well as led to me being sick for 3 weeks later resulting in shoulder injury unable to workout for 2 months it's still not healed tbh.

he would be back around jan next yr too, college doesn't have placements so i m thinking off getting a job outside by telling up some lies abt experience and showing results with the business i m working with.

I am so girls oriented that i don't like it, whenever i see a girl in cllge or somewhere else my mind says i might have a chance with her, get gf and get some experience but i don't do shit, idk why mind became like this. it doesn't happen when i m busy with stuff .

1d82xa7,Which career path should I choose?,"Hey guys!  
I am currently in 8th grade, and I am wondering which career path I should choose in the future.

I have a few in mind, but I‘d like to hear your opinion and if you think these jobs are suitable for me. For context: I am 14F and live in Austria. My report card consists of A‘s only, and I am planning to attend a high school of general education next year. My interests are cooking, baking, doing sports (like archery, swimming, running, and rock climbing), fixing cars, or just everything mechanical in general.  
Here‘s the list of jobs I already have in mind:

•Diplomat. I‘d like to help make the world a better place. I am interested in politics, and it would be interesting for me to take part in international affairs. I know that I‘ll have to move like every 3–4 years, but I think that’s kind of cool. I am also good with languages (I can speak German, English, and a bit of Italian), so it wouldn’t be a big problem for me to learn new languages.

•Caterer. As I already mentioned, I like cooking and baking. I am also good at organizing, so I think that it would be a good job for me. I have also cooked and baked for school events before, and the people there really liked my food.

•Product Designer. I like art and crafts, but I am not especially good at them. I still like thinking up new designs for Packagin products. I‘m also good at doing PowerPoints, and I think that would be helpful as a product designer because I tend to get really creative when doing a PowerPoint.

Firefighter. I am quite brave, and I‘d like to help people in need. I am also able to stay calm during stressful situations. I am okay with 24h/48h shifts, and I am not afraid of heights. By the way, I‘d like to be a firefighter in the US.

Let me know your opinion and what you think is most suitable for me. Also, excuse my mistakes, as English is not my first language. :)

To give a little bit of details I’m an electrical designer, and a talent agency was able to help me land this position, so I’m not employed by the “Company A” but more of a contractor. I do get all the benefits and time off, just get paid through the talent agency. 

During the time I was applying, there was another big company I applied for let’s call them “Company B”  Who is equally or slightly bigger than “Company A” where I’m a contractor. At “Company A” the pay is way more, about 25% more what I’m currently making, i would be a full time employee and also it’s a huge step into my career cause i get to explore 3D work. 

I really wanna go for the second job it feels like the right fit for me at the moment. I’m just embarrassed because I have just finished my two weeks with the “Company A” and I don’t wanna burn any bridges since they are a big company in my field. 

How do I write an email for this ? And am I an asshole to leave after 2 weeks ?

1d82r9d,Will it ever get better for us? (24f),"Hi guys, i (24f) am having one of those days where it literally feels like putting any more effort into this world feels absolutely pointless. Any advice, useful info or shared experiences are much appreciated. 

Long story short: I grew up in a financially comfortable home with everything that I needed. I did well in school, was a good kid and really did everything that i was always told was the key to seeing some type of success, and that all of my hard work would pay off. Coming to the hard truth that basically everything was a lie is so devastating on a daily basis. 

I not only had my college years horribly impacted by COVID, which on top of all of the general negative impacts related to that time, resulted in finishing my education having to take bullshit courses online and graduating with an INSANE amount of student debt despite not even getting what I had paid for. I got an internship while i was still in school, and then was hired full-time when i graduated in 2022 making the average (a joke) salary for being a recent grad. All of the money that I earned at that job has just gone to paying off these fckin loans, which don’t even seem to ever go down. I have had no ability to develop any sort of savings, and the cherry on top of the cake is that I was laid off from that job in March of this year. 

Since being laid off I have applied to HUNDREDS of jobs, done intense networking, invested in all of the recommended job search tools/tips, etc. and still NOTHING. How am I ever supposed to get ahead? 

Yes, I cut costs by living at home, not spending my money on bullshit things, search for side gigs AND now having a part-time job bartending while still endlessly searching for a full-time job. 

I try my best to keep a positive mind set but sometimes it just feels so fucking hopeless. 

Thanks for reading, would love to hear anything from anyone honestly. ❤️‍🩹🥺

1d82ezp,Internship while working part time after grad ?,"Hello all. This past may, I graduated with a BS in data analytics.

Currently, I am working part time at a company I interned at last summer. I received a verbal return offer from this company in August, but I didn't actually get to return until late February.

Since I wasn't sure the return offer was ever going to come to fruition, I applied to a bunch of spring and summer internships and jobs. Yesterday, I received an offer for a summer internship for 30 hours a week at a pay rate of $17.50 (50 cents more than the minimum wage here) for an operations role within a school system.

Although the work I currently do is not directly what I studied, it is easygoing, and I like the people I get to work with. I have familiarized myself with the internal systems and used PowerBI and apps, along with Sharepoint, to complete projects.

I've done some software implementation and led a couple projects, but it hasn't been anything too complex. I would have loved to have interned or worked this winter in a role more focused on utilizing the skills I've developed in my academic career, but finding something was really tough, and I had no luck. I am making more than what I was as an intern at $22/hr vs. $19/hr, but I really want something more.

I'm only working 20 hours a week, and the outlook of being converted to full-time isn't looking too good. The budget is already set for this year, and my contract expires on September 30th, but there is a possibility of extension, but still at the same pay rate with the same hours. I would like the opportunity to work for both companies, as it'd look great on my resume, but I don't want to lose the position I currently hold, as it pays more than the internship and is more accessible.

I just really need advice on what to do. I would be able to work two 10-hour days at my current job and dedicate the three other days to the internship. I would of course always be applying for full-time positions and be on the hunt, but the market is rough now and the extra money wouldn't hurt. Any advice and input is appreciated!

TLDR: Should I take an internship offer that would be three days a week (9–5) while also working two ten-hour work days at my current company?",Deep-Cardiologist622,1,1.0,0,1717520981,2024-06-04 17:09:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d82ezp/internship_while_working_part_time_after_grad/,6,2024
1d82c6l,33 and I feel it's too late for everything,"(I should premise this by saying **I don't live in the US** so any US centered advice would not work)

I am 32 going on 33. And I just feel it's too late.

I was a star performer in high school and everyone thought I'd go places. I graduated with hons and then...I didn't know what to do because the job market in my country (Italy) sucked and also because I didn't really know what I wanted. Spent three years unemployed and depressed, then I picked up my pieces and moved to Germany to pursue a second more technical MSc. Then Covid came, so I once again found myself unemployed after graduation. My mental health spiraled.

After brief stints and a horrible low paid job I unexpectedly received an offer for a paid internship at a UN agency in NYC. I went without hesitation, and I found out I loved what I was doing - basically I was working on emergency preparation and vulnerability analysis for developing countries. I would write reports, do research, and create visualizations and maps to target operations and fundraising. After so many years (I was 31 at that point) everything seemed to fall into place. For the first time in my life I felt like I was *going* somewhere. I was in the right place and the right time. I learned Spanish and French in my spare time and networked like crazy. My boss gave me rave reviews so I thought an official job contract was around the corner...but I underestimated just how competitive that environment is. They had another more qualified applicants, and I got left behind.

I had to move back home. My savings had all but evaporated, and I had no job. I quickly fell into depression once again. I kept applying left and right, but no one would hire me, not even for the most entry level jobs. After one year (!) of unemployment I managed to find my current job, which is horrible, but gives me some money, and is remote. 

Still, I hate it. Having been in NYC and working on something I was passionate about seems a very distant dream now. Currently I am but a shell of that. I spend my days either fiddling my thumbs (because no one can bother looking after me and giving me tasks) or being suddenly dumped with work I don't know how to do. Even the tiniest bit of confidence I had left is gone. All of my peers are moving ahead, getting PhDs, building a proper career, finding their niche...and here I am nearly 33 stuck in a low paid job that I hate and I will probably be fired from because I just can't keep up. I have no future, no hope, and no ideas.

I don't even know how to get better at this point, because I can't just go back to school forever, and I can't ""start from somewhere"" because the places I could ""start from"" won't hire me. I'm wh*ring myself out on LinkedIn, reaching out to everyone and their mother, taking part in meetings and trying to get myself known to people on a daily basis (which frankly gets embarrassing and tiresome but that's another story), but to no use. Everyone sees my CV and says wow impressive I'm sure you'll find something!, but then here I am. Most I got was getting shortlisted for a job at the european commission, only for them to wait three months to tell me I had not been selected. 

I wish I never graduated. I wish I never had all these experiences. I'd rather stay in my own little stupid bubble than try and get out of my comfort zone. If I did I'd never have known what my true passion was and I'd never have known that I *evidently* am not good enough to actually go after it. In my language we say ""far from the eyes, far from the heart"", i.e., out of sight, out of mind - I'd rather not have tried than trying and failing.

I'm 33 but I already feel dead and I don't care about anything any longer. I'll never be happy or even moderately satisfied. People say ""find a hobby"" like it solves things. Yeah going for a run in the morning or buying a dog will magically change the fact that I'm poor and will have to work my entire life in jobs I hate.

1d8288o,"Please help, I really need advice. ","I currently work as a caregiver. I have been at my job for 3 years now and all of my clients have loved me. Several of my clients will only work with me. I love my job and my clients, but I am underpaid. I know of several other agencies that are paying 30% -40% more. I have received 1 raise and that was after 6 months. It's been almost 2 &1/2 years since my last raise. 2 years a go I found out that my boss was paying new caregivers 2.00 more per hour than me. I didn't say anything because at  the time my boss had given me a few extra side jobs to supplement my income. I no longer have those side jobs. I commute 2  hours per day and I do not get paid for the commute. I was never even asked if I wanted to commute. The cost of living in my city has gone up significantly the last 2 years. I am currently working 80-90 hours per week and I am not paid overtime. I had 1 extra side job where I was paid per visit instead of per hour. This was great when the visit only took 1 hour. Now, that visit takes me 2 & 1/2 - 3 hours, so I don't get paid extra. My boss told me in November that we could ask for more money for this visit since it's taking 2-3× as long. Well, it never happened and it's not going to happen.
The people I work for are wealthy. 2 months a go my boss told me one of my clients asked for a discount. I told my boss that I was about to ask for a raise because i was not making enough money and there was an uncomfortable silence. Neither one of us brought it up again.
I have had to max out my credit cards and I have had to sell some of my belongings to get by.
I can't ask my apartment for a discount. I can't ask the IRS for a discount on my taxes etc...
So I feel it's wrong for my millionaire client to ask for a discount because they are having cash flow issues. They literally have millions of dollars in art and furnishings in the house. My clients daughter has told me this and it's also obvious. If I have to sell my belongings, and I didn't have much, I feel they should have to do the same. Am I wrong?
I feel like my boss will not want to give me a raise because he has given my wealthy client a discount.
I pride myself on not being entitled. I work my ass off 7 days a week and 6 nights. My client has sundown syndrome which is a type of dementia, so she is oftentimes up all night. This client is the only client of my bosses that has this syndrome.. The other night caregivers get to chill, relax and even sleep when their clients are asleep.
I, however rarely get any sleep during a 12 hour shift. I then have to drive 1 hour back home. I get to rest at home for maybe 3 hours and then it's time to work my day shifts 
I am so beyond burnt out. The sleep deprivation alone has been extremely difficult.
I feel like I should be paid more than the caregivers that get to just relax and sleep through their 12 hour night shift because I am up almost the entire shift 
I need to ask my boss for a raise, but because of my anxiety, I have not been able to.
I know my boss is most likely going to get angry because he gave my millionaire clients a discount, so giving me a raise is going to be less money for him. However my boss does absolutely nothing for his cut. He has never even been to my clients house. Most likely because it's an hour away. When I need time off or anything, I have to work it out with my client.
I do like my boss. I help him with scheduling, so we work closely. My pay for helping with scheduling were the side jobs he gave me. He didn't take a cut from those small jobs and that's how he paid me. However, like I said I do not have most of  those jobs anymore and the 1 side job I have, I'm putting in the hours, so I'm not being paid to help with scheduling. 
I have had a really difficult 5 years and during this time I became a people pleaser. I have a very difficult time asking for anything and I have a hard time saying no. I I have been wanting to ask for a raise for over a year. I'm afraid my boss will offer me a 2.00 raise which is what new caregivers were being paid 2 & 1/2 years a go. I am sure those caregivers have gotten raises since then, so I don't think a 2. 00 raise would be fair. Like I  said a couple of the other agencies are paying 30%-40% more, so I would like to ask for what those companies are paying their caregivers.
I know I could most likely get a job at one of these other agencies, but I also know I would really be pissing off my boss if I did that as he would probably lose the clients I work for. I don't want to be on bad terms with my boss because he is well known in my city and this business. I want a good reference from him if I should ever leave his agency. I also really like my boss.
Also, I truly love my clients. They are like family and I would feel so bad leaving them.
2 years a go one of my clients offered me a fee guesthouse and more money per hour to leave my agency and work privately for them. I said no, even though it was an amazing offer. I stayed loyal to my boss.
I just can't survive on what I'm being paid and i can't possibly work more hours as there aren't enough hours in the day.
I'm so lost. I don't know what to do and I would be so grateful for any advice. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

1d824jq,How to handle giving my two weeks notice when I have a vacation planned,"I’ve been in my current position for 3 years. Yesterday, I was offered and accepted a new position with a different company. I was planning to hold off giving my 2 week notice until everything clears for the new job like my background check etc. The new job wants me to start in 3 weeks so Monday June 24th.

The problem is, I have a planned vacation in 2 weeks that would require me to be gone for Thursday the 20th and Friday the 21st of that week. If everything clears this week and I give my notice on Monday, my two vacation days would cut into the two weeks, so it’d be like a week and 3 days notice. 

Is this bad?? Will I get pushback? I would like if my new job pushes my start date back by two weeks but I don’t know if that’s acceptable to even ask for. I would hate to screw over my current employer but I feel like the timing is awkward and I don’t know what the best move would be.

1d821mf,"Significant Pay cut w/ promotion - Take it and find a new job, or decline it and find a new job?","I am sure this has been mentioned before and I've read many responses but just need to get some specific feedback. 

I've been offered a promotion to a lower level ""Director"" role and 5% raise from my current base pay. OT eligibility was not discussed but when I do the math I projected that this will end up in a pay cut of between 7 and 10 percent due to not being OT eligible. I just did my yearly review and this offer came after my asking for a 15% raise. They offered 5% and a ""promotion.""

I have a new director that I am not crazy about and I am fairly sure he realizes that this would be a pay cut. He's been complaining about department finances leading up to my review even though they over hired and I have personally brought in extra revenue which I felt was to set me up for a lower raise than I had been getting in previous years. This director is not very knowledgeable about our products and is getting heat from senior management because the department has been floundering.

They've been talking about ""working me into leadership"" at the company and he's implied there may be a bump with some other improvement to happen in the future and that I am ""working towards"" the raise I asked for. 

Anyway TLDR I am not exactly sure what to do. I think even if I got the raise I'd be looking for other jobs anyway because I'm not fully utilizing my degrees and skillset at this company. I have a geology degree and do building inspections but there are companies that do both which is what I'd like to target. Im upset though because it feels like I am being given a pay cut for being a high performer. 

TLDR 2 I feel like saying no or complaining about the pay cut due to no OT could hurt my chances of getting a better role elsewhere but I also don't really want to be underpaid while job searching.

Wwyd? Is it a good move to turn down a ""promotion"" because it's a pay cut or will that hurt my future career prospects not having ""Director"" on my resume.

My issue is that whilst I’m interested in law, I don’t find it fulfilling. I love travel, so I have also looked into becoming a travel agent, but my real dream is to own a small farm.

I do not come from a farming family, but I live in a pretty rural area and have spent time on farms giving a helping hand and learning about different breeds, the best types of soil for planting, etc. Whilst I know that it is tiresome work, and you can quite literally never have a day off in farming, even mundane (and sometimes gross tasks) like cleaning chicken coops can be quite fun when I get into the groove. I’ve owned my own chickens, worked at a stables, and helped on cattle farms, as well as spending a day on a farm that still used draft horses to farm the land. I know I’d have a lot to learn, but I really wouldn’t mind, my main issue with getting into this field is the money it would take to buy land and start up a small farm. 

Though, as I’ve said I do find law really interesting and I have poured so much energy in the last few years into gaining experience at law firms, as well as founding the law society at my school, and going to university summer schools - I feel like it would be a waste if I didn’t go into the field. I’ve researched cases and given in depth explanations to other students who were also interested, as well as having local law firms come in to give talks about different areas of law and their experiences in the field. Almost all of my recent extracurriculars have focussed around law - debate club, law society, and mentorship programmes that matched me with law students so I could ask about their experiences. I do really like law, and it could eventually fund the dream of farm ownership, but I worry that I won’t be able to physically manage a farm at an older age with no real experience.

At the same time, I am very lucky to have been able to sightsee with my family, and I enjoy not only travelling but helping people to find holidays that would suit them as I’ve leant a hand to friends who weren’t sure on what would fit their budget or what travel insurance would be best for them. My mum has a friend who is a travel agent, and she absolutely adores it. 

I was wondering if anyone who works in these industries could tell me what it’s like, as I fear that I might be wearing rose tinted glasses simply because I’m getting cold feet in the run up to university.  Any advice, stories, or suggestions would be highly appreciated!

1d7zccq,Looking to change careers with limited work experience,"I need some advice from people who've completely changed careers or pivoted from what they were doing to something completely different. Not to be too long winded, but some background: I graduated high school in 2005, and went to college. I had no idea what I wanted to do, and I got pushed and pulled in many directions. It ended up taking me 10 years to finish, and I graduated with a degree in economics. for 9 of those 10 years I worked at a dental office owned by my uncle. The only job I had before that was at a sandwich shop during high school, and some odd jobs here and there. During college I got really into the gym. I'd already been lifting in some capacity since childhood, but after HS I really fell in love with it. So during the latter years of college I started thinking I would start personal training, and pour my energy into a coaching business. So that's what I did. I got a cert, and got a job at a local fitness center. I worked there for 2 years, and then went independent. It was scary, but it worked out at first. I was growing every month, and by 2016, after 3 years I was doing pretty well in my area. I was busy, and felt like a success. Fast forward to today, and the opposite is true. I'm not busy at all. The phone isn't ringing, and I'm finding myself not only needing, but wanting a change. My passion for this stuff just isn't there. So to my question for you guys is what do you recommend I do with such limited work experience? I've had only 3 ""real jobs"" my whole life, and for the last 9 years, I've worked for myself. I'm dreading working for someone else, but at this point I feel like my back is against the wall so something has to be done. I'm happy to answer any questions related to the post if you need any more information. Any help is appreciated. Thanks guys.

1d7z1dj,Should I resign from Microsoft or not?,"Hello. 31m, level 60 (junior) at MS I work for 1 year and 3 months~. I have couple of years of experience. I felt from the beggining I got a lowball offer at Microsoft although I positively impact other people and also I'm very good at my job. I feel like the manager is the only one who doesn't see it. I really expected a promotion by June. I had this huge project I was leading for a couple of months and delivered it on time. Unfortunately this didn't get me the promotion apparently. Lately I snapped, I cannot sleep and I realised I'm truly miserable. I realised I don't have the motivation to work anymore. So I spoke with my manager earlier today and told that I'm unhappy with my current base salary and that I expected a promotion by now. He said he needs a couple of days to figure it out, that it doesn't work like that with promotions, it will take a few weeks/months and so on

I still have a positive feeling about just quitting. I'm also curious whether I will get what I want. I will have around 2 months and a half to look for a new job but even if I don't find one I will still have money to survive for a couple of months

I asked for 40% more base and promotion

Question for me to you. Should I quit?
I have only positive feedback from my colleagues (which is public, hr can look over) and I delivered quite a lot of work

1d7yk8u,Not Sure What Path To Take,"Hi everyone! I am looking for some advice on which course I should take, either through CareerStep or AAPC. I currently work for a tissue bank for non transplantable anatomical material. Physically, and mentally, this will not be a job that I can retire from. So, I'm going to get the ball rolling and start an online course to start working towards something else. I'm just not sure where/what is the best option. 

Through CareerStep, they offer 2 courses that I am interested in. One program, Medical Records Specialist, will end in a CEHRS certification. The other is their Medical Billing and Coding, which end in a CPC and/or CBCS certification. AAPC offers a CPC/CPB certification. Both are relatively the same price, especially with AAPC running a sale at the moment. I'm not sure which certification would be 1, the easiest to get into the workforce, and 2, which would grant me more flexibility in job decision. 

\*\*\*I know some of you might say to go for a RHIT program somewhere, but I am not looking to start a 2 year program at the moment, which ultimately would be the best decision, but I figured, to get my foot in the door now, and I can always go back to school for other certifications.

They ran that way for over a year, and when they started hiring back it wasn’t at the same rates as before. This is how it was almost everywhere, and the job market right now for this industry is terrible. I picked this career path purely out of passion and nothing else, stupid me at 22.

Now I feel like it’s too late to switch, and I have no idea what career path is best to choose at this point in my life. The idea of starting from scratch is terrifying but I know it’s necessary.

1d7xgyn,Switching jobs internally?,"I currently work in a Business Development / Sales role and although I enjoy a lot of what I do (building pitch decks, researching companies / target clients) I do not like the sales aspect of it (pitching, cold emailing, etc.). My manager is really chill and supportive and pretty open minded to ideas that I throw at him but there’s a role that recently opened up as of yesterday that is more product focused. I’ve been at my company for about 6 months now and the role that just opened up was actually the role I had applied for, however, when I spoke with HR they said that it was sorta up in the air and that my current role would probably be of interest. I told her I leaned more creative and didn’t really prefer sales but she said it wasn’t that sales focused… except it is- I see the growth trajectory of this role becoming increasingly sales. So the product role that had opened up was because the person who was hired a few months back ended up taking a higher role at her previous company. When HR came to tell us that the person left, one of my coworkers said aloud that I had been interested in switching over. At first I was shocked she said that but HR was pretty receptive and was like “let’s talk!”. So I scheduled a meeting with HR. I’ve never switched internally before and I’m wondering what I should know going into this? It’s a family business so my manager is part of the family and his family members are also on our team and I’d be reporting into his other family member. They are all so nice so I’m not that worried but I just feel bad because my boss and I have a good relationship and before I joined, he was a team of one. The other role is slow right now because we just signed on new clients so there’s no product to review right now so I am thinking of suggesting to help my manager with his work until I fully transition over (if I end up getting considered for the role). I work really well with the entire team already and I have product experience from my last job too so it wouldn’t be that new to me.",interestingsonnet,1,1.0,2,1717508532,2024-06-04 13:42:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d7xgyn/switching_jobs_internally/,6,2024

1d7x98j,"I’m currently a custodian, and I do enjoy it, but I worry about a stable future salary.  Unsure if I want to switch to IT. ","Title given.  I’m 31 years old in the U.S.   I’m a custodian working 2nd shift in a wealthy school district.  I currently make $19.75 with yearly raises.   The only way up in this position is becoming a head custodian once someone retires.  Then the pay is $23+ and it maxes out at $32 or so.  And that’s after years of being in the system.  It’s not bad pay per se, but right now I sort of live check to check.  

I do feel fulfilled and appreciated with this job.  Within 2 years of being here, I’ve already won an award for being recognized for my hard work and I’m the only custodian in my building who’s won it since the school opened in 2011.  I just wonder if long term that I’ll be financially stable enough doing this, when I know I can potentially be making more doing IT.  I’m getting ready to start a Google IT course through a company.  

It doesn’t help that I get pressured by family to find a new “career” just because I asked for money one time to help with bills.  There was a commenter yesterday on Reddit who mentioned that it might not be a good idea to move to IT with money being my only motivation.  But I’m just unsure of what the right move is for me.

I’m comfortable where I’m at, it’s just that  financially I struggle a little, but it won’t be like that forever.  I still have a lot to learn with budgeting and really managing my money better, so perhaps taking on those smart financial habits would be more beneficial in the long run?

What if I get into IT and end up just hating it all? But what if I continue being a custodian, but end up regretting not pursuing more money?  It’s a tough choice.  Any advice is appreciated here please.

i like architectural technology but the only problem i have with it is that i don’t have any creative control at all. i can’t discuss with clients the layouts and so on. however i feel as if it will be easier to find a job.

on the other hand i absolutely love interior design. it just seems like such an interesting career in which i can be creative and help people develop their dreams. the problems i have with this degree is it doesn’t pay as well. i also have the probability that i will never build a successful career and name for myself and just have a degree for nothing.

I don’t think you can make rational decisions at 18 and therefore I went to do a music degree. 

I don’t regret it necessarily, I did quite well as an artist but I’m turning 27 this year and over the last 2/3 years I’ve had a big career and mindset change. 

For approximately 1+ year I have been studying investing, finance and trading. This became my passion and I realised that I want to continue in this niche.

Due to changes in my views about being an artist, I wanted to potentially start a new degree in finance (to further benefit my career in finance, investing and trading). Im second guessing myself because of the timelines. If I went to study now that means I’d finish my degree at 32.

1d7shrj,VP silently blocking me from relocating. What to do?,"I’ve been following this sub and I always see amazing advice.

I’m having an issue with my leadership. I am a manager in a Top 10 employer. The company is great, people are so kind, respectful and there is interesting work most times. I am a marketing manager and work with a lot of international markets.

I’ve been in the business for 5 years now.

After starting this new position 1 year and 3 months ago, I told my VP that I want to relocate in the next few months and if there is a possibility to do it. They told me to focus on my job and deliver so I did. Year end came by and I received a below average rating even though I delivered a lot and all of the other VPs backed me, including their direct reports. My 360 feedback was 10/10, but yet I received a below average rating.

After year-end, my VP told me that relocating will not work because of external circumstances with the job market - too difficult, a lot of competition etc.

So I never asked again. Fast forward to May 2024, I spoke to them again and said I am now looking to do it in my next role because evidently it will not work out in my current team.

My VP after leading me on for 1 year promising me that it may work out, then giving me below average rating and telling me “no”, now advised me to wait until 2025 to get a good rating and then start networking and apply for positions. I no longer believe a work they are saying as their main interest is to keep me in the team as much as possible as I am an SME on a very important pillar in the business currently generating half the revenue. I know it end-to-end.

I am being blocked by my VP to develop and relocate to the US from the UK, they never tried presenting a case to the Senior VP before, several people in my team approached me to say that there is no development in this team, nobody had conversations with them about career plans and I feel like they are not showing the values of the company.

It’s accepted that once you start looking for new roles you need to tell your leadership, but telling them will make them upset and I feel they will try to sabotage me at this point. Changing employers is not an option for me as I want to relocate to the US now. They are asking me to wait another 9 months but I don’t have the time to wait - it needs to happen in 3/4 months. I also don’t want to put an ultimatum because I am not that type of person, I wanted everything to be positive and get support from them.

I scheduled a meeting with the new SVP who I know closely now - thankfully and will talk to them in the next few weeks.

I wanted to ask you what should I do in this situation that my direct VP and Director don’t care about development and also don’t want to lose me, but are not doing anything to keep me. That is the only thing I want in my career - salary doesn’t matter, relocation package doesn’t matter.",EbbAvailable4338,1,1.0,3,1717491031,2024-06-04 08:50:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d7shrj/vp_silently_blocking_me_from_relocating_what_to_do/,6,2024

I'm currently 25, and have been in healthcare since I was 17. I started off as a CNA, and have now been an LVN (licensed vocational nurse) since 2021. I've gone back & forth on if I should continue my education to become an RN, but i don't know if I truly want that. I'm in CA and make enough $$ to get by on day to day life. Getting my RN would only be for the higher wage and not much else. I'm enrolled at my local CC and starting classes this summer to finish off some pre reqs for the RN program, but I don't want to do it. I feel like the only reason I'm even considering being an RN is because as an LVN all we hear is, ""when are you gonna be an RN""?. But why can't I just stay an LVN forever? I currently work bedside & to be quite honest, I'm tired. I'm ready to give it a few years before I start looking into something non bedside related. The thought of being back in a classroom, and enrolled in an even more stressful nursing program sounds awful lol. Should I still do my classes because people are putting pressure on me, or just accept that I'm okay being an LVN?

1d7pn11,20M in Debt and Seeking Career in Tech: How Can I Balance Education and Financial Challenges?,"Hello Reddit,

I’m a 20-year-old male from Delhi, India. I passed my 12th grade (Science PCM) in 2021 during the pandemic from CBSE. I took the JEE exams in 2021-2022 but didn’t score well enough to mention. I love coding and programming so much that I can sit all day doing it. However, in 2024, I find myself in debt of ₹2 lakhs due to my personal past mistakes and some bad influences. These debts are entirely my fault. Now, I want to pursue a career in the tech field, which is a fixed goal for me, but the issue is that I don’t have the money to do so, like getting admission in BTech or BCA for a degree. I’m not eligible for an education loan, and I've tried for the last 4 months. If I somehow arrange the money to pay for my education, I won’t be able to afford to pay it off because I can’t continue my job.

My plan is to pursue B.Com from DU SOL, then get a high-paying job in a BPO as a backend developer, which can pay around ₹25,000-₹30,000. After that, I can pursue my career in tech, and until then, I will keep practicing and working hard on projects to show that I didn’t waste my time.

Currently, I’m earning ₹13,000 per month.

**Debt Breakdown in EMIs:**
- Personal Loan: ₹2,045/month
- Laptop: ₹3,000/month
- Personal Loan from family: ₹7,000/month

Left: ₹955 only.

Please help me and guide me in the right direction. I’m ready to work hard (no limits).",_asius,1,1.0,0,1717479116,2024-06-04 05:31:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d7pn11/20m_in_debt_and_seeking_career_in_tech_how_can_i/,6,2024

1d7oq71,At what point do you admit that you're a bad middle manager?,"Hello!

I've been a middle manager for about 2.5 years. My agency has more than doubled in size in the last three years, now employing over 400 people, and I'm just a middle manager in a small department in an even smaller program. In my program there are positions for 6 middle managers (two were added in the last one year). Since I started at the company 3.5 years ago, we have had 5 managers either leave or be termed. I am the second longest standing middle manager - at just two years; the other has nearly 30+ years experience.

  
We got a new batch of management one year ago, who all have intentions on staying after this year - *and they are killing it!* They are organized, dedicated, and striving to have their teams exceed expectations through and through! In fact, my peer now has the highest performing team in the department! I'm so proud of her!

  
Whereas my team... In the last year I have had 5 team members - of 11 - go on FMLA for mental or physical health. I have one position that has not been able to stay filled for more than 6 months at a time. The other four teams are collected of three or fewer different kinds of positions (job duties, etc) whereas mine has 6. My staff barely seem to hit 80% of their productivity metrics before they're crashing and burning and saying that they're unable to keep going. I do have some of the longest standing employees at the agency on my team - from before the growth or from the worst time of the growth - but I feel like that's all excuses.

On the flipside, people have stayed at the company because of my support. I have been connected to growing standards and expectations. I have been listed as a major support for people, but I'm also worried it's because I'm *too* touchy-feely and not quite hardcore enough at holding people to their professional standards. 

At what point should I just admit that I suck at this job? (Am I burnt out? Am I fostering a toxic environment?? Do I need to quit and become a recluse???)

  
I want to do a good job. I want my team to be an example of smooth sailing. I have no idea how to inspire my employees to do the same and that scares me, because I am being held responsible for their performance. Ugh.

1d7nyzs,What do I choose?,"Basically what the title says, going into college this fall and still don’t know what I want to do.

I have so far come to 3 careers that have sparked my interest only because how well they are paid and the lifestyle I can achieve with them, accounting, mechanical engineering, and computer science.

Accounting mostly checks off all my boxes granted I complete the cpa exam, it’s just that almost everyone says it’s boring and unfulfilling and I would regret not going for something more challenging.

Mech Engineering is a very good path, but the thing is I hate math, barely passed pre calc in highschool and that was with cheating and I hear engineering students in general hate their college experience because they rarely had any time to party and socialize.

Computer science is very competitive but also very rewarding once you get through entry level but the competition with entry level jobs only seems to be getting worse. People can go months/years without finding a job straight out of college.

I get it, you come to college to earn an education not to have fun but you only have this experience once where you are around people your age with freedom to do whatever.

1d7ngnx,How do I handle a people pleasing/inadequate boss without burning out?,"Hi friends, I’m in need of some stellar objective advice.

I’ve had many days where I have the overwhelming urge to quit. My current boss doesn’t bring any strategy or much value to the director role she has. It’s her and then it’s me and my project manager reported directly to her.

She constantly forgets who’s doing what and when. I’ll ask her updates on things and she won’t know and jokes about it. Things that impact my job and our goals. 

She pretty much regurgitates every strategy or idea I give her to the rest of the company and leaves me out of conversations that impact my job all the time. 

She says yes without thinking about implementation, and I constantly have to suggest meetings with relevant people, constantly am thinking about next steps that she just doesn’t inherently think of. 

She and I will meet before meetings to discuss our plan of action and she will completely go left field on calls with other teams leaving me high and dry.

I get glimpses of strategy and backbone and then before you know it, she does something to completely break my trust and faith.

I’m so tired of up managing, so tired of doing so much work for her to then go and present it as her own thoughts to stakeholders and execs. 

I’ve been asking to be promoted since she started a year ago, I do well beyond my role. She will allude to things like holding a carrot in front of my face but nothings happened. I honestly think I’d be better at her damn job at times and I question whether she feels threatened by me.

1d7mhjz,Can I ask my boss to be harder on me?,"This is probably a super weird question to most, but I'll try to provide the appropriate context.

  
For years I worked in a high-pressure blue collar environment where doing things incorrectly was sometimes a matter of life and death for me, my coworkers, and our customers. I got used to a very high level of stress and urgency there. As a result, I can have someone screaming in my face, 'we need to get this impossible thing done in the next 20 minutes, or we're all f\*\*\*ed!!!' and be able to channel that into a fairly efficient combination of calm and focus that will help me deliver at a high level. I also have pretty terrible ADHD, and that sense of urgency was extremely helpful for me to get things done.

  
Now I work in an office, and everything is much slower and more monotonous. People are also way more polite than I'm used to. I guess that's great for most people, but I've relied on brutal honesty and the frequency of people losing their cool to gauge how well I'm doing at my job in the past. Now I'm kind of adrift. Nothing I do ever seems to be 'bad', but I'm definitely not getting the same praise as other people I work with. Usually the notes I get on my work will be something like, 'if we don't take a look at this soon, it could be hard to explain later'. I have no idea how to interpret these vague statements.

  
Someone I work with just shared with me (off the record) that my boss is concerned about some things related to my performance. Can I tell my boss I need him to let me know when he's concerned/disappointed/upset in a 'less varnished' way because it will help me understand the magnitude of the issues and make it easier for me to correctly prioritize what to get done? It definitely doesn't seem professional to ask this, but if anyone has any advice, it would be much appreciated.

1d7m1ra,Manager becoming super militant,"My manager has been pretty cool in the past but for some reason become super militant about time. I think every day I’ll get a message with him grilling me about my timesheet. I put in the wrong charge code for one meeting by accident but corrected it as soon as he told me. Other than that I literally spend all day on my computer doing work. I put in a telework request through my doctor that was approved by hr and he tried to block it. (A big no no and as soon as I brought up that hr was involved he backed down)

Obviously it didn’t work but I’m still annoyed that he tried. Everyone else has four day work weeks and he says that I can’t because of my accomodations? (It’s not like telework is anything new. Everyone else on the team is doing it 2 days a week too.) I could also bring this up to hr but that would certainly cause more problems with him.

I’m literally developing back problems and eye strain because I’m so dedicated working from home so it upsets me that he is because so militant with me. I took maybe one minute to message him (because honestly he freaks me out sometimes and I don’t work directly with him so I try to pick and choose what I say) and he insinuated I must be offline.

 My company is known for really good HR and Work culture so I could talk to them but he’s got 4 kids and worked at the company for so long that I feel uncomfortable doing so to put his job in jeopardy. He’s already gotten one HR complaint from another member of the team so I think it would be it for him. I’m a young female so I feel like he’s maybe giving me grief because I’m an easier target.

-started working at an adult store at 18, got promoted to assistant manager after 6 months. about a year in, i cut my hours to go to cosmetology school, dropped out almost immediately due to “school” screwing me over. 
left company after 2 years total

-started new job as assistant manager of a high volume toy store (weird shift, i know, but it’s fitting if you know me irl). served as interim manager my first two weeks (we had no store manager) and 6 months in (new manager quit). i asked to be promoted to permanent store manager, but regional manager said i was too young/didn’t have enough tenure. rm then proceeded to break the news to me that my position (assistant manager) was being eliminated company wide (due to poor financial/operational decisions) and that unless i agreed to relocate to a smaller store out of state, i would be laid off or demoted.

present: I’ve spent the last two months job hunting, looking for companies that i can grow with and that pay a livable wage. nobody’s hiring, and the ones that are either pay terribly, have a ridiculously high turnover, or have ghosted me desire multiple applications and calls. i’ve been ghosted by a toy store ASSOCIATE position that i applied to out of desperation.

1d7k6yy,Should I leave an IT job where I’m the lead in everything for a job that potentially pays 54k more?,"I currently work at a place where I was one of the first people hired when the IT department was created. During my time here I have developed multiple processes, have intimate knowledge of all the systems and functions. I have a good portion of the things i’ve worked on documented, but the tech debt is pretty high. I was randomly offered an interview at a place that pays 110k base with a potential of up to 40% bonus paid out quarterly. At the place i’m currently at the pay is around 95k with a yearly bonus of 10% depending on the pay from last year. 

The potential new job seems to be associated with the financial sector handling IT day to day life and pretty much an MSP. I’ve heard of stories how work life balance is kind of wack, yet the location I currently work at, I have a good relationship with management up to the C-Suites and i’m allowed to honestly do as I feel.

1d7jdxn,Wondering when I should throw in the towel,"For some context, I am 27 years old and graduated with a bachelors of science in marketing, comm, and psych in May of 2023. Since then, I have been working sales jobs and have not been able to find any sort of success. I am just wondering when you all would make the decision to move into another industry, because I am starting to feel like that is the only way I will find success.

Before graduating, I worked at MASSIVE NATIONAL USED CAR DEALER doing sales. I did poorly at regular auto sales, but really only gave it a few months because I was moved to a different position. In this new position, I was still sales (technically), but rather than selling cars, I was convincing others to sell their cars to us for a dollar amount we offered. I found a ton of success in this role due to the crazy car prices during COVID as well as my huge knowledge/passion for cars.

I quit when the market turned and went back to college to finish my degree.

My first job out of school was selling memberships for AUTOMOTIVE MEMBERSHIP BASED CLUB to businesses as a sort of benefits package for employers. Crashed and burned with that job, was unable to get the numbers needed in order to get out of training, so I resigned a few days before the final day. The job was all outbound calls with leads that had already been called several times, and I decided that was not the kind of job that I would be able to perform well at.

My next job was in insurance, specifically selling auto policies in an inbound sales setting (read: call center). This job was very metric-heavy, and I ended up getting put onto a PIP a couple of months out of training as my numbers were inconsistent and I was having trouble keeping up with time targets.

My current job is in insurance as well, very similar to the last role but for a better company and selling more lines (home and specialty as well now). Metrics are wayyy less strict which is definitely an improvement. However, I am also getting absolutely destroyed at this job. Literally all of my quotes today except for one got completely declined and I am struggling to find a way to even get a rate. Meanwhile, my peers are all seemingly excelling at this job right out of the gate, some of whom have never even worked in sales prior to this. I have gone over some best practices with some of the veteran salespeople at this company and I have been doing everything they tell me, it really just feels like luck-of-the-draw.

If it adds any context, both of these insurance roles are bonus-structured rather than commission-structured, which I feel could be contributing to my feeling defeated since it's more of an all-or-nothing type of deal.

So now, here I am, a year after getting my degree, struggling harder than I ever did when I didn't even have the degree. It's getting to the point now that I am really struggling financially and do not have much longer that I can go without a consistent income.

When would you all say I should throw in the towel? I know for a fact I am really good at the people-skills required for this job, I CRUSH my peers in those metrics but it seems like there is a disconnect on the sales skills for me and it makes me wonder if this is something I can learn or if I should just give up.",Metal_Matt,1,1.0,0,1717458914,2024-06-03 23:55:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d7jdxn/wondering_when_i_should_throw_in_the_towel/,6,2024

1)I am international student so I need sponsorship.

2)Also tho I have 2 related experience but they are all part time not internship.

I'm currently working as a Junior Mechanical Design Engineer at a small scale M&E consulting firm since 2 years. I joined here after completing my Masters in Mechanical Engineering. I'm currently earning 30000£ annually. We're only a team of 3 people. The director (mechanical biased), a senior electrical engineer and me. I'm still in the learning phase and I think my career is progressing slowly than it should be, as ai dont have anyone similar to my level here.  
I want to switch and get into a bigger consultancy, but I'm not sure what experience level roles to apply to because I've 2 years of experience now.
To be specific, currently I'm involved in a project where we're designing HVAC, heating, and Above Ground Drainage on a Leisure centre and we're taking it to stage 4a. Mostly the director attends all the meetings and does the proposal. I've done heating & cooling calcs, pipe sizing, duct sizing. Ive also done equipment sizing and got quotation from different manufacturers as per my sizing. I've also modeled these services in Revit and drawn schematics, created equipment schedules. I'm also doing all the fiiling of documents

1d7hcv9,I'm applying for a new job but should I list all of my old jobs on my resume?,"Please don't laugh at my situation as I already feel bad enough!

I'm applying for a dream role. I've applied to this company before and got all the way to round 5/5 before I was rejected, but kept in touch with the people that interviewed me because we had a great rapport. Shortly after getting rejected by this company I ended up getting a job with a different company. Well in March I was let go due to a combination of health issues and poor work performance because of said health issues (gallbladder failure that I ignored for a year and severe tonsillitis kept me out of work for over a month). I was there for about 6 months.

Now the company is hiring again for the same role! I think I could be a shoe in. Currently I'm at a new job that's really great but I've been looking for new work lately because the pay is awful. The biggest issue is a few months ago I was giving life updates to one of the previous interviewers and they know about the job that I was previously at that let me go so now I feel like I have to put it on my resume otherwise I risk being potentially interviewed by them and questioned about it.

**QUESTIONS:**

What should I do if and when I'm asked about my previous job? Should I tell the truth and risk them thinking I can't handle it? Should I lie? Should I risk not including the job on my resume and show a gap or risk getting interviewed by that person who knows? Right now my resume reads in the order below:

**Current job (has nothing to do with the industry I'm applying to)**

**Job that let me go (same industry as job I'm applying to)**

**Impressive job (same industry as job I'm applying to, I quit because I no longer liked it there)**.

 I'm curious if any of you have stories on the office ""mama bear""? I'll go first: 

I was pretty young and green on the corporate job (I was also cute, single, and fashionable) and I had a woman manager who was obese, balding, loud, frequently telling super-cringe stories to emasculate her husband. One time we had a potluck and I brought a homemade quiche, and after the potluck, I saw her at her desk with my pie pan eating the remainder of the quiche straight out of the pie pan while working.... 

There was a weird man in the office who would IM me late in the night saying innocuous but weird stuff to me. (Mainly it was weird that he was IM'ing me late at night on a work platform about nothing work-related.) Many women in the office had this kind of ""borderline"" interaction with him where it felt weird but nothing to the point of reporting, and then apparently he crossed the line with a particular woman who did finally report him. 

In the midst of this HR investigation, I had worked late one evening, and as I was leaving, my manager saw me, pulled me aside, and asked me if I was friends with said man. Basically I said I really don't know him....  She proceeded to explain to me that he's really having a tough time and could use a ""friend"" like me right now. WTF.

1d7f38t,Career Advice on Two Opportunities,"Hi y'all! Looking for some advice. I'm currently contracting for an organization. I get paid for every hour I work and I left a horrible situation to come to this job and for the most part it has been such a reprieve. The only struggle has been post their layoffs its kind of awkward because almost half of my team is basically gone now due to the layoff and people leaving on their own after.  Financially I make roughly $140K ($73 per hour) per year which is incredible, but with not so great benefits. I don't get really good healthcare, dental, etc. Additionally I don't get 401K, I don't have any PTO because i'm hourly, there are no equity opportunities, etc. I'm very grateful to have a job for sure especially in this economy. With this role I don't know what the future could hold given that I am only contract so if they don't renew or do another round of layoffs. I don't get anything so no severance, healthcare, etc if they do layoffs again or just decide that my role isn't useful. That makes me kind of nervous. In addition I don't really get any development. My new manager is nice and I have great flexibility like being fully remote, traveling occasionally, but if I want to advance in my career this doesn't feel like the place to do it. My manager did recently mention they are trying to convert me, but there is no guarantee and that could take months. 

However, I was recently offered another opportunity, but its about 18% less than what I make today. My salary would go from $140K to $114K. Still a great salary and better benefits in terms of insurance, equity, PTO, etc. However, I've never taken such a drastic pay cut and especially given rent, bills, etc. that does make me nervous to have such a drastic salary change for what is essentially the same role and having to potentially be in the office 1 -2 times a week. Additionally mid-way through the interview the hiring manager was let go because they felt that his role was duplicative. I know who my new manager would be and they are really nice, but I have some concerns about the future of the role and growth opportunities given that the person who would've been my manager was let go. I'm just struggling to really decide between what feels like the devil I know vs. the devil I don't. I think neither option is really horrible, but would just love different perspectives. Should I wait for a better opportunity with similar pay to what I make now even if it is slightly below expectations or should I take this new opportunity which could potentially open up more doors in the future?

I am currently on a gap year after completing my bachelors degree in Psychology last year. After finishing the degree I have not been able to get a job despite various interviews.

However, I do have a lot of volunteer experience with wildlife trusts and my dissertation project focused on a conservation issue.

1d7eunl,Best way to state your dates of employment on a resume for someone who hasn't worked in a long time?,"This is sort of a very specific situation to me, but wondering if anyone has any insight on the situation. Basically I worked in the film industry for years, but after the SAG-AFTRA/Writers Guild strikes of last year, all my work opportunities were cut short and I haven't been able to get another job in the film industry since then because there's currently such little work and high levels of competition. 

I've been able to stay afloat working quick temporary odd-jobs here and there since then, but my last full time position in an actual career worth including on a resume was over a year ago. I'm currently looking to transition into a field outside of the film industry, but because of the huge gap in time i'm not really sure how to approach adding my dates of employment on my resume. It's obviously a red flag to see the last time I 'worked' was so long ago if I do include the dates, but I also feel like it's equally as much of a red flag leaving the dates off entirely because it comes off across like i'm trying to hide something. 

I always see people suggest only placing the years of employment on a resume instead of the specific dates to broaden the spectrum more, but unfortunately because most of my professional experience is in the film industry, each position on a new project only lasts a few months until filming is over, so if I were to do that it would literally just read as 2023-2023 for example which obviously looks weird. To top it all off, I can't really lie about the dates either because these have been positions on big theatrical studio movies that could easily be researched into when they started and ended based on when they were released. In the film industry huge gaps of time in your employment typically aren't a huge deal, but now that i'm trying to transition elsewhere I feel as though in any other industry it's very frowned upon. 

If anyone has any advice on what they'd do in this situation or has seen something similar, anything is appreciated!

1d7eao6,Introvert Employee - Overworked and Underappreciated ,"Hi people,

I am wracking my brain on what I need to do to make some progress at work. I work in a mostly male dominated job within an agency catering to a very cut throat FMCG. I basically quit my job for another workplace and that was even worse, so my old team hired me back at a senior position knowing I was a valuable addition to them. But what sucks is that they have always failed to give me my due credit or let me grow within the job. Ever since I've joined my boss has told me he'll take care of all the meetings, and I can work at the backend even though that's not was aligned. So whenever someone is referring to work I'm independently working on, they go to my boss and he either redirects or takes credit and talks about it himself like he is getting the work done, and when it's higher management - even if I speak up they sometimes don't even look at me and ignore my input. I agree, I'm a quiet and shy resource and I don't talk much due to my introverted personality. (I really don't know what to say in a room full of grown men who have nothing in common with me, and they're all yapping and putting each other down very politically to fight for the most amount of credit, it's like working with sharks and I genuinely get scared of becoming one of the victims of this politics). But this leaves me in the shadows when it comes to appreciation or recognition from higher management or the client, and it sucks! The problem is that I really really want to do better professionally but I've kind of become one of those employees everyone knows is working very hard and overlooked, and they're all just okay with it like a bunch of jerks. How do I change my image and what do I to get some due credit while my boss just boasts and says he did everything like any average credit hogger would. Whatever task he gets he literally just assigns 90% of it to me, which is all fair because I'm his resource but then there is no acknowledgement of how hard I work!

1d7duv9,Parents pressuring me to get a master’s degree and I don’t know if I should do it,"For some background, I graduated from university a few years ago with a degree in political science. I struggled to find work and eventually had to settle for a job that is unrelated to my education and pays a few dollars above minimum wage.

I know I can't do this long term, so I was weighing up some options. I thought of doing a master's degree in a STEM field I was interested in, but that will require me to take a year and a half's worth of prerequisites, which means taking out even more student loans. And my job only does tuition reimbursement if you plan on staying for 2 years AFTER you graduate from whatever degree you're trying to get, and I don't want to stay at this job for more than 2 years (I've been here for 9 months so far).

I've also been thinking of getting a post-degree certificate in data analytics from my local community college which would take a year to complete, and to leverage my degree and the certificate to get a better job. Also, it's worth noting that I've already started taking classes for this and I'm paying out of pocket for it since I'm still not 100% sure if I will continue with it or not.

After recently discussing my options with my parents (who I still live with), they happened to bring it up in a conversation with one of my older overseas relatives. My relative convinced them to tell me to enroll in a university back in our home country where we are orignally from and to get a master's degree in something that would be a straight continuation of my bachelor's degree. And they keep saying that a student from America will be highly coveted and that the university is entirely in English and that I'll get a job there in 2 seconds after graduating, etc., etc.

The problem is that I've had trouble finding jobs related to my degree and I don't think getting a master's in the same thing as my undergraduate education would help me. Without proper experience, wouldn't I be ignored for entry level work because I would be considered overqualified? And I don't want to quit my job now since it took me forever to get it, even if it is unrelated and doesn't pay well. But my parents are now beating the drum of ""not wasting your education"".

Also, if I'm being truly honest with myself, I'm not sure I want to go into careers related to my degree anymore. I've kind of become jaded and disillusioned with it. I'm still passionate about it and enjoyed my undergraduate education a lot, but I'm not sure I would like a career with it unless it involves working with data and stats which there are jobs for but I'm unqualified to do them.

So, as you can see, I'm feeling really lost and directionless at the moment and would appreciate any advice or help. I wish I had a clearer goal of what I wanted to do when I was younger. I just chose this degree naively thinking I would easily get a job after graduating. And I know comparing yourselves with others is the one thing you should not do, but I can't help seeing other people progressing with their lives while I'm stuck here feeling like a failure :(",EnvironmentalBite741,2,1.0,1,1717444632,2024-06-03 19:57:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d7duv9/parents_pressuring_me_to_get_a_masters_degree_and/,6,2024

I've experience in entertainment where I was a stagehand for 3 years but I'm transitioning from an indoor theatrical setting to a full-time outdoor stage tech.

1d7cu90,"Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering, should I negotiate my first salary?","I received a job offer at one of the companies I interviewed with a couple weeks ago, an aerospace company. I live in the Boston, MA area and they offered me 74,000$ with a potential for overtime and full paid medical coverage. I shot for the range of 80-85,000$ when I spoke to the hiring manager. I delayed taking the offer for a while so I could gauge my other options but I'll be making a decision next week so I want to get some outside opinion.  
I could easily live off of 74,000$ a year, however, a little more money wouldn't hurt to pay off some major debt I have. If I do decide to negotiate would it be best for me to call or email? I was thinking about asking them for a slight bump up to 79,000$ but my concern is burning a bridge, I also do not know much about the local salary ranges for a new Mechanical Engineering graduate so I have no basis to steer my counter offer on.

1d7c3h7,Feeling Unmotivated ,"I am 33F, I have a degree in environmental engineering and I work at a small (<10 employees) engineering firm.  We handle environmental remediation projects and support our clients with their environmental permitting needs.  My day to day is different all the time with one day working on an air permit, the next I'm in the field collecting soil samples, and then next I'm writing a proposal for a client.  When I first started here about 10.5 years ago, I loved having variety in my work tasks and that I got to travel places for work outside an office.  I was highly motivated and was quickly promoted within the company.  Unfortunately we have had a hard time retaining employees, due to one reason or another so there has been a lot of turnover.  Now I am a Sr. Manager at the company and the owner tells me I am his right hand.  I just had my yearly review and he just asked me how much I want to make and he said he would take care of it and that's what happened.  So I'm making the money I want to make and I feel like I should be happy with my career, but I get to the office and I just lose all motivation to work.  This has lead me to browse the web during work hours and generally just waste time.  But due to my position I can't afford to slack off, so I inevitably have to come in on the weekends to make up my work to make deliverables on time.  My boyfriend just proposed to me, we have a stable house we bought together and his son lives with us and he is a joy.

1d7c1eb,Need Advice. Please Help. ,"I work in tech. I filed an EEOC against my manager. I went through hell with my current manager for discrimination, lying, degrading, gaslighting and HR was useless and everything I said was denied. I had piles of proof. Since then I have applied for over 100 positions and in the last two weeks, two separate companies, the first round was exceptionally great, and I got stellar feedback. The recruiter asked for availability for the next round and ghosted. My manager implied that I wouldn't ever work in the same industry if I filed a complaint. 

Is there a way that my current employer is jeopardizing my future employment? Am I blacklisted? I have worked hard for my career and do not want to go down the drain.

1d7b3oc,Feeling very lost in career at 27,"Been feeling very stuck in my career growth and what i want to do with my life. 

Some background, I just turned 27 and I have a degree in interior design. I graduated in 2021. I had a commercial interior design job for 3 months before I got let go because I just wasn’t as fit for the job at the time and I also really hated working there and majority of the women were absolute bullies and never helped an incoming designer fresh out of college. After that, I worked for a residential firm for 2 ½ years before being let go because I saw an office admin falsifying hours. I also wanted to leave because it became a very toxic work environment so it had to happen at some point, but I did learn a LOT of things and felt I was very successful in the job and it showed in my work and the awards we won based on projects that I had full control over. Now, I work for 2 and sometimes 3 individual residential designers where I am contract only, no benefits, no PTO, no anything a human needs to get by and I started in February. The hours are shit and I am never guaranteed full time. I think since I started, I only had one full week of 40 hours and that was it.  I have applied for other jobs since then, but I had 2 interviews recently and didn’t get the job for either, even though my past residential experience really elevated me in my career and knowledge. I am a people person, I just don’t know why I am not seen fit anywhere but where I am now. 

I’ve been feeling stuck because any residential job I apply for, the pay is decent, but not for my level, at this point I would be considered almost senior. Along with being a contract employee so no W2 or benefits, which I desperately need. I am just at a loss with my career choice and think I really screwed myself for doing residential so long that I can’t get back into the game of a larger firm. I do have a passion for clothing and I have dreams and goals of just being my own boss, but do not have the money to even start somewhere like that. I’d also open my own clothing store either in person or online, but once again, don’t have the resources I need to do so. 

I just really don’t know what to do or where to go. Everyone I know has successful, stable, and great jobs and then there is me who just feels so lost and confused. I am not trying to compare my growth to the ones I know around me, but I am super supportive and happy for them all, honestly. I don’t know if I am even worthy of being a designer anymore. I guess at the end of all this, I don’t know what I really want to do with my life and career anymore. My partner and others keep telling me “you’ll find something somewhere you love and has everything you want and need” . Well, I’ve been trying to do that for the last 4 years now. I don’t see any success or growth because nobody is giving me a chance. 

It would just be helpful and appreciated if anyone had any good, solid feedback since I can’t afford a therapist lmao but anyway.. 

TLDR; I am struggling with my career path and don’t know what to do anymore. Feel stuck and it’s the worst feeling.

1d7atxe,I Have to Make a Decision by 5PM EST Today,"**Current Situation:** A month ago, I got a call from a previous manager I interned for my junior year of college. He offered me a junior data analyst role at a steel manufacturing organization that he also recently joined. I entertained the idea and interviewed with the organization. Fast forward to today and after salary negotiations I have an offer for $67k. Initially, I was told I would have a lease buyout coupled with up to $10k in bonuses. I do not fault them because I was told that by the consultant, when ultimately it is HRs decision on what they can pay me.

**Junior Data Analyst Role:** It honestly seems like a good fit. I would work directly under my previous manager on the continuous improvement team. I would touch virtually every department from operations to HR. They have never hired this sort of position before, so there is a lot of opportunity to have a real impact. The job is back in my hometown, and I could move back in with family while I pay off some credit card debt ($6k, yes ik it's bad). The job would be much more stressful but rewarding. Career progression is not super clear... senior data analyst? VP of finance? Controller? CFO?

**BDR Role:** I am currently a BDR for a VAR selling ERPs. I've been here 6 months. I make roughly 80 calls a day (not all cold). My work life balance is great. I work probably 4-5hrs a day max. My base salary is 45k with capped commission at $70k. I am on target to do anywhere between $57k-$65k. This job isn't great, but I am enjoying the challenge. The career progression here is clear: BDR -> AM -> AE, with the possibility of exploring SE. However, the organization I work at now does not have a promising track record from internal hiring and after 1.5-2 years I would need to seek a new role elsewhere. (This feels risky)

  
**The Dilemma:** My aspirations are relatively unclear. I initially wanted to be a data analyst when I graduated college back in 2023, but things are much more clouded now. While I don't see a potential future with the current organization I am with, software sales is very lucrative and a simple jump to a different organization could provide an insane pay jump coupled with an amazing work life balance. Long term goals, I would love to work in FinTech, CFO, or hold a well-paying job in software sales. I feel both roles could provide invaluable learning experience, but I am worried that if I take the analyst role, I will be closing the door to software sales all together. The analyst role feels safe, while the BDR role seems risky. I haven't been able to sleep or eat. What should I do?

1d79zsn,Are 270$/month for a software developer part-time job legit? ,"Hi everyone,

hope this post doesn't break any rule (I'm new here). An acquaintance of mine located in South-Eastern Asia, working as a freelancer, offered me to join his little team of Node.js and React.js developers after I told him I was quitting my last job. He told me he makes on average ca. 550$/month per project, so that he actually works on at least 3 projects per month. Considering that I'm applying for a part-time position (I'll start with only one project per month) and we'll equally share the amount of work per project, my monthly salary should result in ca. 270$ per month. My question is: according to your experience, are these numbers realistic at all? Or is he trying to scam me? I ask this since I don't understand anything about how to price software developments (I'm a junior developer and didn't even study this subject at college).

1d79rlz,Red Flags at New Job. Want to Leave After 2 Months? How Do I Explain This to Recruiters?,"I’m 35 with a PhD in Engineering. I was laid off this past fall after 2+ years at a company that I joined after a cross-country move for my wife to go to grad school. This was a blessing in disguise as I was given ~6mo severance and used the time to get sober and healthy. I haven’t felt this good since my early 20’s.

I’ve been at my new job for 2 months and the work itself is mostly ok. The people are nice enough, the pay is solid, some of the work is interesting, no one takes work home. It isn’t amazing, but a job is a job, and it gives me time and resources to pursue my interests outside of work. That said, there are a few major red flags that have me wondering if/when to jump ship:

1)      Reneging on hybrid work: Frankly the commute sucks, >1hr each day in brutal traffic. With that in mind, I asked the recruiter about hybrid work. They told me “after a year”, and I thought “ok, I can survive a year” and accepted the offer. Now that I’m here, my boss has made multiple comments about how his boss and management in general are “old school” and want everyone here 5 days/week. This feels like a weaselly way to prime me for rejection when I bring it up next Spring.
2)      Non-transparency about company relocation: When I received the offer, I was told “just so you know we plan on moving to [town name] within the next 2 years”. [Town name] is a household name in the US and borders our current town. It turns out they meant a much smaller [town name] the next state over. This will easily add 20-30 minutes to my commute. This move alone has me considering a change, but I feel like I was misled, and this was a blatant omission to get me in the door given recent employee turnover.
3)      Potential Layoffs: This company has undergone big layoffs and consolidations before. While I don’t take rumors to heart, I do know (confirmed from management) that the building we’re moving to doesn’t have enough office space for everyone. Our CEO has repeatedly told us there won’t be layoffs, but if they insist on keeping everyone in the office, I don’t see how that’s possible. From what I understand, since they’ve announced the move, a ton of people have quit, and I assume he’s just saying this to slow the bleeding. I’m waiting for them to drop the hammer.

I really don’t want to job-hop, I want something long-term and stable, but I see the writing on the wall, and I know I’ll have to leave at some point in the next 2 years. How can I sell such a short employment period to employers? The job market is pretty good in my area right now, and who knows what it will be like next Spring.

1d79o33,In a weird predicament - Data Visualization Specialist,"So I am in a weird situation. I am currently 24 years old and I am a data visualization specialist. I graduated back in 2022 and while I have only been out of college two years, I have much more experience than that as I had 3 internships in college that really were just contracts and worked a part-time research data analyst job throughout my tenure at school. I got hired by a big consulting firm fresh out of college and was laid off after working there for a year and a half. I was laid off in November and was applying daily and did not have any luck until march. I acquired a 1 year contract with possible conversion to hire. I started April 9th and worked for a month. The environment was absolutely toxic and my managers treated me poorly on the daily, constantly calling me stupid without directly saying, getting mad when they only gave me two sentences of context without information, stern voices that were borderline yelling, it was bad and in all honesty a traumatizing experience. Keep in mind I am leaving out many details. Also many other life factors as well as a 2 hour commute in each direction due to bad luck had made everything worse. These managers just wanted a glorified assistant that just did some data work and wanted the person to have an output and just roll over. They obviously did not like me and I believe it had something to do with my age and the fact that they knew nothing about what they hired me to do. These managers were a late 50s and early 60s year old women. One of them did not even know what Microsoft Paint was. I got fired on May 9th via phone call from my recruiter. The managers said "" ' My Name' was such a pleasure to work with and was very easy going, but we needed more support in powerpoint."" This was a bs response as one task they gave me was a 43 slide powerpoint with 12 hours to redesign the whole thing. I did it in 10. This was among many other ridiculous requests such as turning a non-uniform invoice that was 239 pages long into a dataset in 2.5 days. I am one person......

  
Career wise I don't know what to do. I don't think it is worth putting on the resume as it was 1 month and all I did was make a few dashboards, two PowerPoints, and two datasets in the span of a month. This is nothing in my profession in terms of experience. However that also means now it is June and I would look as though I have been unemployed for 7 months, 8 months at the end of June.

1d79esw,Red Flags at New Job. Want to Leave After 2 Months? How Do I Explain This to Recruiters?,"I’m 35 with a PhD in Engineering. I was laid off this past fall after 2+ years at a company that I joined after a cross-country move for my wife to go to grad school. This was a blessing in disguise as I was given ~6mo severance and used the time to get sober and healthy. I haven’t felt this good since my early 20’s.

I’ve been at my new job for 2 months and the work itself is mostly ok. The people are nice enough, the pay is solid, some of the work is interesting, no one takes work home. It isn’t amazing, but a job is a job, and it gives me time and resources to pursue my interests outside of work. That said, there are a few major red flags that have me wondering if/when to jump ship:

1)      Reneging on hybrid work: Frankly the commute sucks, >1hr each day in brutal traffic. With that in mind, I asked the recruiter about hybrid work. They told me “after a year”, and I thought “ok, I can survive a year” and accepted the offer. Now that I’m here, my boss has made multiple comments about how his boss and management in general are “old school” and want everyone here 5 days/week. This feels like a weaselly way to prime me for rejection when I bring it up next Spring.
2)      Non-transparency about company relocation: When I received the offer, I was told “just so you know we plan on moving to [town name] within the next 2 years”. [Town name] is a household name in the US and borders our current town. It turns out they meant a much smaller [town name] the next state over. This will easily add 20-30 minutes to my commute. This move alone has me considering a change, but I feel like I was misled, and this was a blatant omission to get me in the door given recent employee turnover.
3)      Potential Layoffs: This company has undergone big layoffs and consolidations before. While I don’t take rumors to heart, I do know (confirmed from management) that the building we’re moving to doesn’t have enough office space for everyone. Our CEO has repeatedly told us there won’t be layoffs, but if they insist on keeping everyone in the office, I don’t see how that’s possible. From what I understand, since they’ve announced the move, a ton of people have quit, and I assume he’s just saying this to slow the bleeding. I’m waiting for them to drop the hammer.

1d78e1m,“Partner” drives employees away (or ends up wanting to fire them),"Hi, I joined a startup company 5 years ago as a “partner” (profit sharing only) along with one other profit sharing partner (co-founder and day-to-day manager of the firm) and two equity partners. The two equity partners operate a larger affiliate (physically next door in our building).

The non-equity partner who co-founded and leads business has a history of being tough to work with (not just here, but at previous stops too). They’re also a brilliant person—super intelligent. Sometimes they are moody and can be incredibly short or have anger with people. They are also pretty rigid in their opinions—it’s usually her way or the highway.

All that to say, in our 6 years of existence we’ve turned over the entire staff multiple times now. I’m the one holdover who’s still here, and I’m even unsure I want to stay (which would mean I’d give up any “equity” if we were to sell).

Lately it’s been hard to get excited to work here, and I feel a lot in my stomach when coming to work. I’m a co-leader, in a sense, but not really. I don’t have any control over the business direction, hiring, etc. I’m just the lawyer here who handles strategy and the like. And meanwhile, my old law firm would love to have me back and I miss that great group of colleagues. I guess I’m looking for some guidance. I’m not sure if it makes sense to put more of my sweat into this place when we’re constantly looking for talent and pushing the talent we have out the door.

1d78bkq,Confused on if I should quit or let myself get fired? ,"Hello everybody!

So here’s the situation. I’ve been having an awful time after getting a new supervisor in my current role.  She’s had it out for me ever since I joined her team, and I think she’s on the verge of getting me fired. That’s neither here nor there, I have another job lined up.

 The thing that I’m concerned about is that for this new job, I’m still in the process of proving criminal record, and past employment, as in, I’m still in the process of hireright approving all of my documentation. There won’t be any issue with that, it’s just the fact that it’s taking a bit of time.

I wanted to hear your guys opinions on what to do for the specific scenario. It should only take maybe a week tops, but during that time, if my current employer attempts to fire me, should I let them fire me or should I say that I quit? 

I’m worried that me being fired would look bad if my new company goes back and checks again.

So i'm (M 23) currently works at a firm. I joined this firm right after i graduated. I am just your average joe, just doing my job while trying to establish connection with my coworkers and bosses for the future.

And 3 months ago, one of my friend from my uni joined the firm on the same team as i do. This person is not so close to me, but close enough for me to consider him a friend. It was all fine few weeks after he joined the firm, but then it started going bad for me. He started calling me by a ""name"" which all my close friends at uni know. This ""name"" is not exactly my real name, its just a joke name my friend called me at my uni.

So after he started calling me by that ""name"" at work, almost everybody started to call me by that ""name"" too in my firm. At first i don't really mind it, since i think it was harmless and only my peers used the ""name"" to call me. But then, it got to the point where my superiors (even my manager) started to call me by that ""name"" to address me, and don't really remember who my name was aside from the ""name"" that was supposed to be a joke.

What im afraid is, in the future people will simply forget my real name and only remember the ""joke"" name. Will this be bad for me in the future if i were to leave the firm?

1d75esw,Internship while working part time after grad ?,"Hello all. This past may, I graduated with a BS in data analytics.

Currently, I am working part time at a company I interned at last summer. I received a verbal return offer from this company in August, but I didn't actually get to return until late February.

Since I wasn't sure the return offer was ever going to come to fruition, I applied to a bunch of spring and summer internships and jobs. Yesterday, I received an offer for a summer internship for 30 hours a week at a pay rate of $17.50 (50 cents more than the minimum wage here) for an operations role within a school system.

Although the work I currently do is not directly what I studied, it is easygoing, and I like the people I get to work with. I have familiarized myself with the internal systems and used PowerBI and apps, along with Sharepoint, to complete projects.

I've done some software implementation and led a couple projects, but it hasn't been anything too complex. I would have loved to have interned or worked this winter in a role more focused on utilizing the skills I've developed in my academic career, but finding something was really tough, and I had no luck. I am making more than what I was as an intern at $22/hr vs. $19/hr, but I really want something more.

I'm only working 20 hours a week, and the outlook of being converted to full-time isn't looking too good. The budget is already set for this year, and my contract expires on September 30th, but there is a possibility of extension, but still at the same pay rate with the same hours. I would like the opportunity to work for both companies, as it'd look great on my resume, but I don't want to lose the position I currently hold, as it pays more than the internship and is more accessible.

I just really need advice on what to do. I would be able to work two 10-hour days at my current job and dedicate the three other days to the internship. I would of course always be applying for full-time positions and be on the hunt, but the market is rough now and the extra money wouldn't hurt. Any advice and input is appreciated!

1d75dv5,Thinking of quitting a month away from a big project,"TLDR; thinking of handing in my 2 weeks notice a month and a half away from a big project that I am the only person qualified to undertake.

So I started with this company about 2 years ago. I pivoted my career into a completely different sector to take this job, and at first I was just grateful to be given the opportunity. But now I realize I am ready to move on and get away from a very toxic work environment. The job is also extremely physically and mentally draining, and they overwork us. 

The big issue, that is making me want to leave asap, is that I am the only employee who is fluent in French and when I was first hired they asked if I could instruct courses in French (this company offers safety certification training). I am confident speaking in French and said yes. Boy did I come to regret that. 

The French presentations were essentially just the English slides put through google translate, so they don’t make any sense and some even have inappropriate language due to google not recognizing context between languages. 

They expect me to “fix” all these presentations, even though I’m not a translator, and also they want me translate a bunch of other documents. This is like months and months of work for an experienced translator, I have no experience. On top of all that I am so busy with the other courses I instruct that they never give me time to work on any of this.

We are now a month and a half away from the launch of this course, I’m expected to teach 21 days straight - because they have a contract stating they will do 4 courses back to back. They told me they would hire another French instructor so we could switch off but they never did, so now it is just me instructing for 3 weeks straight. 

I’m just so done with all of this and I wish I had pitched a fit sooner. Now I am thinking I should just take the first job offer I get and jump ship. But I’m worried they can strong arm me into staying because I am the only one who can instruct it.

Hopefully I gave enough context for this to make sense but I can respond to questions in the comments. Looking for advice.

I have a four year B.Sci in Biology (with minors in Economics and Psychology, for whatever that’s worth) from a decent Canadian school. 

I have work experience in soft-skills industries - I joke that I’m a career personality hire. I’ve worked as a project coordinator in marketing, as a customer success rep in call centres, and as a student recruiter/event planner for a law firm. That said, my real love is for travel. I also made the mistake of falling in love with an American, so that complicates things (I’m working on the ring thing, but that’s 2-3 years out at least) 


Looking for a job that (from most to least important):

- can be done remotely (at least within Can/US, but further afield is great!)

- pays even marginally okay (I’m really good at reducing my costs, currently spending about $750 CAD a month to live, all-in)

- is either flexible enough OR “gentle” enough to leave me mental energy to pursue independent projects (trying to avoid another 24-hour on-call job if possible!)

- requires minor to moderate upskilling (I have about $6000 Canadian set aside for education)

I’m entrepreneurial and affable by nature, so I’m not scared of sales, just haven’t done it before. I’m also open to tech fields but my few swings at coding haven’t been intuitive for me, so being a full-stack dev might not be in the cards! I love working with people, love education and kids, and really love travel! 

I have enough saved to live for 18 months in the way that I do now, but ideally don’t want to burn all of that. My current plan is:

- get a TEFL certification and teach English online (crap wages but I only need about $1000 a month to stop the cash bleed)

- pursue a couple of business ideas 

- upskill part time 

- apply on UpWork and Flexjobs for anything that looks good

1d73n0w,I'm currently working two half time jobs; seeing red flags in the one I agreed to go full time in. What would you do?,"In summary: I currently work half time for a fairly chill, dull, and secure Job A. The other half time I work for job B - a high-paced, impactful, and stressful startup. I accepted an offer letter with B several months ago where I went from hourly contract to ‘part time employee' at the startup, and the same offer includes provisions that I'll go full time in August. However, I'm seeing red flags with the startup (including their unwillingness to disclose my equity package and NDA provisions), and am increasingly nervous about leaving the known, dull benefits of job A. Job B has no HR staff, so I want to ask you. What should I do?   
  
**First, here's what's good about the startup, job B, relative to job A:**   
1. Career growth - I'm really building out my resume in a meaningful exciting field compared to alternative option.  
2. I enjoy much of the startup work itself. It pushes me in a generally good way but is far busier and more stressful.  
3. Full time money + bonus is \~30% above gov job (per hour.)   
4. My colleagues are brilliant and experts at their craft.   
  
**Here are the red flags / reasons I'm reconsidering going full-time with the startup (Job B):**    
1. Communication with supervisors is extremely challenging because they are so busy. Supervisors typically bail on meetings that I set and 4 of 5 times they don’t acknowledge or respond to my communication. The result is consistent scrambles to explain last week's / last month's work immediately before urgent stakeholder deadlines.   
2. The only way I can communicate with supervisors is to be available when they randomly call me. The bad communication is firmly established and seems unlikely to change.   
3. I don’t feel respected or valued (despite being given high-value assignments). I’m regularly called for urgent tasks outside of the hours I agreed to be available.   
4. Details of my employment offer are consistently neglected/late. Such as tax forms, equity provisions verbally promised with full time offer, and NDA provisions for full-time. I've asked four times and still haven't been able to get clarity for equity offering in the company or NDA provisions. (I should have held out for these before signing the part time offer, but I was pressured to just sign.)  
5. Items 1 and 4 lead me to being stressed and angry and also make me worry about the legitimacy of the company.  
6. I think I could continue doing part-time work with job B (and/or elsewhere) even if I changed my mind on full-time offer.   
7. My particular area of expertise only takes \~50% of my time with Job B. Outside of that they want me to something that seems important but is stressful and not within my current area of expertise.   
  
**Job A (which I agreed to leave) also has great benefits, despite the dullness:**   
1. The half time salary is about enough for me to live on, and I get cheapish health insurance and a pre-tax retirement investing vehicle through job A.   
2. My free time is the most valuable thing I have; the half time job opens up a ton of valuable time for personal passions and side hustles as needed.   
3. The half time gov job is VERY flexible and is work from home. Most days require maybe half a day of work, so the effective hourly pay is actually higher.   
4. I work with nice people who respect my time and treat me well... especially in comparison to job B.   
  
**SO - given all that, what approach would you recommend I take from here?**  
1. Status quo - leave job A in August to go full time with job B, and take what they give me.  
2a. Revoke my acceptance of full time employment and offer to revert to contract hourly work in August. (“Job A is just too good of a deal to walk away from.”)z    
2b. Remind Startup that I'm still awaiting information on equity, benefits, and their NDA, and that I will decline full-time employment if I don't receive these things by July 1.   
3. Something else?

I have a bachelor's in biotech and I want to change careers, I currently work in regulartory and I want to get out of it.

I'm currently 23 and I can't tolerate the work that I'm doing or the people that I'm working with. My idea was that since the job market is absolutely trash, I can enroll in an online master's program from Europe that could possibly change my career to something I love.

Hi!
Like the many many redditors here I'm a young adult still confused about what I might want to study. I'm planning to go to uni but still unsure at what I would like to study. I'm a science and tech oriented person so I was thinking, maybe I could be some type of engineer?

I'm a really hands on person, I like building and creating things (I've worked with wood, I've learned how to sew and knit, etc...), and I live to learn new skills.
I consider myself a creative person and I'm interested on how things around me work. 
I like moving around, so a job that mostly has me on the move would be a plus.
I find myself slightly I interested in physics and maths, although I don't love these subjects I'm still curious about them.
I'm aware that I like working out things with logic instead of memorizing tasks.
I'm alright with teamwork but prefer to work individually.

I know that in life we cannot have all we want, but I'm hoping I might get some guidance or any tips at all?

1d725uq,Career/Marriage Crisis,"I am 28 yo female and have been at my company for 6 years- I make $200k/year, it was my first job right out of college. I ended up meeting my husband there and of course we got married. We both hold very high and well paid positions. Our company was sold 3 years ago and we both have 5 year contracts where we get a large sum of money at year 3 and year 5. I should be receiving $150k in December. 

The relationship has become extremely toxic and unhealthy and I would like to divorce- he has an extreme gambling addiction so he has bled our accounts dry and left me with nothing. I have three options- but the third option is where I need the most advice. 

1) Ride it out until December- take the money from the first payment and run. 

2) Divorce now and try to work together but I know it would be difficult to continue working together as he can be very vindictive. 

3) I’ve always been fearful about getting a new job because the job I have now is really amazing- I am VP of operations but after looking all over I seem to be really under qualified at all other companies because of my limited experience. 
I recently heard of a role at a company I have great connections with and am confident if I apply I have a good shot. This of course means I will lose my $150k bonus in December which I really needed to start over. HOWEVER, the twist is my CEO knows their CEO very well. So if I apply, he will know. I am also extremely close with my CEO - he really took me under his wing and truly cares about me in a way idk if many people experience in their lifetime. He wanted to groom me to take over our company when he left. I don’t want to speak to him about the role in this other company unless I’m sure I have it, but I can’t do that unless I interview. And if I interview, he will find out. How do I handle this??

1d6zmjl,"Is what I currently do for ""work"" bullshit?","I'd like to not get into too much detail. Basically, I'm a recent engineering grad. I have no internships. Never been employed before. Only ""work"" experience I have is side hustle stuff like food delivery apps and my current gig. I do ""work"" for DataAnnotation Tech in that I'm one of their approved workers to do tasks related to AI model training for various companies. Its just interacting with various AI models and rating potential responses from the models to help build their data set to train them.

I was approved for coding tasks in particular so I make slightly more than others doing it (40/hr usually depending on the task). So I'm not in any particular rush to find something else to do for money since this is sufficient for my purposes right now. I set my own hours (shoot for full time), ""work"" from home, report to no one. It's kind of like ""the dream"" to a fresh grad but obviously, we all know there's no free lunch. I'm worried I'm hurting myself in the long run continuing to do this as ""work.""

When I tell people outside of the loop about what I do, they act impressed considering I'm a fresh grad with this kind of ""position."" They think it's in-line with what I'm studying (which isn't even computer science btw) just because ""it's AI"" and there's coding involved (surface-level stuff, imagine talking to GPT to help you with a coding assignment, that's the full depth of what I do, I'm not a dev or anything). They think it's more technical than it really is and that it's at least not some ""bullshit job"" you'd do while earning your degree like fast food or retail. But I'm worried about what employers down the line would think seeing a resume with just these side gigs on it as ""work experience.""

I mean, they'd have to know better, right? Seeing me trying to spin this as some kind of legitimate job as a junior dev somewhere to convince them I at least did SOMETHING with my life, when I'm basically just doing surveys at home all day.

1d6zlp2,Rant + Looking for advice,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to provide some context first before getting into my rant. 



Context: 2 year degree in international hospitality management.

now doing an internship in the commercial department, mainly E-commerce department internship : (5 months)



people I would mainly talk about:



(Y is another intern who have already worked here for 5 months in the same position as me but did not have system access and we go to the same university, but he is in year 3)

M: My Manager



My working hours are also different, To have my weekend off, I decided to work form 8:30 to 5:00 p.m but I have to make arrangement for my transportation in the afternoon.( unlike Y, which has to take the company transportation, which is from 7:30 to 4:00.)





I was able to land an internship in this department after much hardships, Right before the start of the internship, I had a meeting with the manager, where we made our first contact. The best way to put it is he made the internship with this department sound amazing, such as that  I would be  put into meetings and projects so that to make my internship meaningful, but I was cautious (aas an intern, you never know  what is really true).

 

On the first day, I was given a more in detailed briefing on what  I would be doing. I would be working with the manager in the E-Commerce department but also helping the reservation department for bookings, which was not discussed beforehand. I mention my concern that this is not what I apply for. But then I got the information that was being used as a test drive for getting interns more access to the system ( which is needed for the booking aspect) At first, I could not say anything, but, as it was said to be a small part (II would be a helping hand as the reservation department is lacking manpower), I did my  best for both department to show what I can do and overall got positive feedback from both.



After 3 weeks of working, I learned that Y would be returning to the department for a 1 - month internship. Hence, my workload will change from doing the less annoying stuff to more in - depth things in accordance with my management, Y started and we were given a briefing where again my workload changed from working 50 50 (so 50 e-commerce  and 50 reservation ) to fully reservation because again they lack manpower and the fact that a women left on holiday for a month does not help making  me frustrated, hence this [rant.As](http://rant.As) this is not what I applied for and wanted to learn, I am stuck with reservation  for 1 full month. Part of me is telling me to tank this for a month and show my performance,  but another part is simply annoyed and frustrated and the reservation work is simply not interesting at all. I feel like I was simply put aside or discarded to fill in for the lady who would not be here.I am also scared that if my performance is good, I will be stuck in this position until the end of my internship? So things end up clouding my head, making me feel uneasy. 



Part of this is a rant but also a call for advice. What do you think I should do? How should tackle this situation?

1d6z2dj,Am I a problematic employee? Or do I have shitty luck with jobs?,"I (m31) am a professional digital marketer, currently working as a Digital Marketing Manager in Bangladesh. I have a cumulative experience of almost 5 years in the field. But I haven’t been able to be in a job for more than 1.5 years. My current one is the longest but I am contemplating quitting

Each of the jobs have specific stories or circumstances that lead me to quitting. It is also related to my mental health and most recently physical health.

Job 1: 
After graduating I joined as a content writer in a digital marketing agency of sorts. It was a small team with 5 employees including me. I used to write SEO optimized articles. The person had agreed to pay me 10000 in my currency ($100/month) after my probation and during probation I was given 6000. But after probation they started to pay me 8000/month. I still stuck around. But work pressurr really was intense and sometimes required me to write even after my office hours late into the night. And requirements changed frequently. But I still persisted. In the covid season, we stayed home while work instructions were scheduled. I missed the deadlines of some writeups, and we went into Eid (Religious festival) holidays. During which my internet connection was lost. Because it was covid and Eid holidays it took two days to get my connection right. But when i logged into my job accounts and resources I had lost access. Without any prior communication regarding why. I was let go without being informed. Although one of my other colleague tried to urge me to comeback but I didn’t. They did not pay me the due months salary Either


Job#2

I was jobless for the next 3 months, then I got a job as a content executive at an SEO agency. There were erratic decision making and office politics. One of the employees was threatened with physical violence even though it was not warranted. I was scared for my own safety as I usually speak my mind. Eventually I got a job at a huge e-commerce Multinational company. So I left the job.

Job#3 

Here there was initially no onboarding process. I had to learn, figure out, and do things instinctively without any proper directions. Then I was transferred to another team where I enjoyed my time as well as learned a lot of stuff. But that Department was closed down. But because of my performance and ""potential"" (their words not mine) I was moved to the main venture team. There I received a managerial position even though I thought I was not ready for it. There I wasn’t briefed on what my actual job was. I tried to figure out on my own. The person I was replacing in the team promised to help me get onboarded during his notice period. But during that time he spent home enjoying his unpaid leaves. While my line manager abused me and my teammate and told me 
""It's been two days but I don't see any productive results from you""
Then we left for Eid Holidays, after we returned my then line manager said he quit and similar to the previous person he also vanished during his notice period.Sow without any proper directions me and my teammate worked. I asked for directions to my teammate but he refused to help. 

In the mean time the guy I was meant to replace became my new boss as he was rehired. But my new line manager had a bad temper. He didn’t onboard me properly either. So without any proper directions I relied on my experience to take decisions. In one such instance, I messed up a campaign. In confronting me, my new line manager grabbed me by the collar. That traumatised me and made me feel the smallest I have felt in all my life. I resigned without telling anyone about the incident. I gave a fake family reason to do so. 

Job#4 (current)

In my current job I tried to be proactive and adapted a leadership mentality. I would not wait around and would  plan stuff on my own to make sure this company grows. Although I was a digital marketing manager, I worked to make a product strategy about which products would ensure sales of a high margin. I made data products to help with decision making. I lead the whole team and helped the company get a sales boost of 150% on a year to year basis. 

But the owner always looked for mistakes. He did not look at the growth, but just has a tendency to make people look bad. He had erratic mood changes. He changed deadlines on a whim, he increased targets without consulting data, and constantly made employees feel bad about themselves without ever praising them. I answered back from time to time defending my team and myself. I also started pointing out logical issues with his decisions. He did not provide any strategy or any directions properly. He also has a habit of talking about employees behind their back. 

In my case he also lied about salary promises. When he interviewed me he asked that I be paid the same amount at my previous job. In turn he would increase my salary after my probation period. But after my probation period no such increment happened. He did not tell our  Hr about Such increase. 

He also is stingy about leaves. If someone takes a sick leave he says ""how can someone be sick for one day?"" and he instructs HR to deduct salaries at any minor issues. 

In one such incedent i had asked for three days leave. But as those three days coincided with the weekend, he told the HR to deduct 5 days worth of salaries. When I asked for reasoning he said ""other employees are taking leaves like this"" I said ""I am entitled to THIS kind of leave as I applied for it, and I Have no control over what other employees leaves are needed"" with the HR and the owner. Eventually the deduction was not envoked.

When my yearly increment time came around I asked HR and told him about how my previous  promised increment never came. He asked the owner but the owner flat out refused to provide an increment even though I played a leading role in the growth of the company.

The  responsibilities only grew yet no benefits Were given. My HR argued with the owner and got me a 2% increase which was something better than nothing. The same cycle has continued 

In this time I am having panic attacks, anxiety  depression, and recently I was diagnosed with hypertension where my blood pressure would rise to 170/120 and continuous sickness would persist.

Context is that there's a recent new hire with a language barrier (from Europe) and in my opinion he doesn't respect me or follow my guidance because of my age (I'm 23 and he's in his early 40's and from a ""traditional"" country in Europe). I'm a janitor and started in August 2023 and he started a couple weeks ago. Every shift he checks my work, dismisses my guidance/advice, and 10/10 times when I am placed with him I'm having a OT shift. I start every shift giving him three chances where I maintain professionalism and hold my emotions back but I had enough last Monday I believe (can't remember the dates off the top) and he was ignoring me all night and checking my work. 15 minutes before we had to be at our main building (15minute drive) to clock out I find out he hasn't completed any of his work. I tell him politely ""hey we gotta hurry and go"". He dismisses me so I yelled ""fuck you I'm leaving"" and shut the lights off and waited outside. This is the best paying job as a 23year old M with only a high school diploma can get in my area. I'm concerned about getting terminated. They even had me drop my work keys off to a officer. I feel like not even hearing my opinion or context is crazy considering it was only us two in the building. I haven't slept in two days straight now, stressing over this. I know I should've behaved better but I had enough. I tried so hard to keep it together. I need this job for the money. Without this job I'm going to be evicted next month when I can't pay the rent.

1d6xtys,What should I do about forced OSHA violation?,"Let me start by saying I'm still furious at the situation.

This last Friday my department (with our supervisor) were all called into a meeting with our production manager and another manager (no connection to my department). This meeting was regarding our departments cleanliness. Let me add this is a small manufacturing setting and it is a very messy process. 

Since this is such a messy environment we do use compressed air for all of our processes and we do clean ourselves with it (we have a dispersed head). Nearing the end of the meeting the production manager says that "" you need to be blowing yourself off every time you leave the department"". My coworker politely says, ""we do, but we really aren't allowed to"". The response, ""You have to"" I chim in with ""we do, but we really aren't allowed to"". The other manager then proceeds to say, ""either you do it or we will have to get coats for covering your clothing that will make the already hot room much worse"".  At this we Let it go.

Finally at the end of the meeting, the Production manager ends the meeting with, "" these are our expectations they are non-negotiable. Please take the weekend to think about them and if we don't see you Monday thst means you don't agree."" . I immediately ask, "" does that mean if we don't agree/are not here Monday we are fired?"" His reply ""yes"". 

I know this was a long one, but here are my thoughts.
1) verbal forced violation of Osha & our own safety guidelines 
2) threat of if else action if we do not comply
3) threat of termination if we do not comply.

At this point I'm looking for new employment but I don't know what to do. Please help and tell me if I'm over reacting.",shankems,1,1.0,3,1717395717,2024-06-03 06:21:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d6xtys/what_should_i_do_about_forced_osha_violation/,6,2024
1d6xeus,Help - Temporary Position Available at Company I Work For.,"I've been working at a company for 3 years now and I've been in the same role for 3 years as well. I have been offered a few times in the past opportunities to change roles, move up and things like that but always declined it as I wanted to master the role I was in.

For the past 5 months I'd say, my role has become routine - I know everything I need to do inside and out, there's no real challenge. Don't get me wrong, I love my job but some days I feel it's a bit slow.

This is where it gets a little complicated. There's a job posting currently posted internally that interests me but it's only to replace someone who is on leave for about a year.

Wondering if I should talk to my manager about it? Has anyone ever been in a situation where they've taken a temporary position and we're able to return to there old role once the person came back from leave?

The last thing I want to do is take on a role just to be out of a job a year later. I love the company I'm with, I just feel this role would be beneficial for me in terms of growth and education. But don't want to jeopardize loosing my current role.

I've submitted my resignation at my current company, they countered with a request for me to stay on as a contractor for an additional 6 months to cover prescheduled on-call shifts (once monthly, \~4hrs total). There was no implied obligation, just an offer. They offered this to another employee previously and she said it went smoothly. I need to set my own rate and draft an agreement. I would still take my new job in addition to this.

What would an appropriate hourly rate be? Any red flags to look out for with an offer like this? The field is biotech and the shifts are very straightforward.

It's insanely boring, there's no real movement up unless I wanted to transition into management, and honestly, I never want to ever do any management. I absolutely hate managing people. So with that out of the way, here's where I'm currently at as far as potential paths

&#x200B;

* Firefighting: I'm partway through the process of getting on at my local fire department. Passed the CPAT, passed the written and oral exam, just have to get through the background check and I should be good. So sounds great, right? But honestly, as I get close to the field, I'm suddenly a thousand times less sure of it. I'm not sure I won't just panic and freeze in an emergency situation, I'm not sure I'd be able to rush into a life threatening situation, and I am pretty badly acrophobic. So honestly, not sure I'll even take the job yet if it's offered to me
* Going to WGU to finish a degree - I've tried my local state school, I just... don't do well in traditional classes. School and I have just never really gotten along, and it's just something I've struggled with my whole life; but tests, I do fantastic on (see my 1.2 high school GPA and my 35 ACT for reference). And working full time makes traditional school difficult, so I was looking into going to WGU instead. And these were the fields there I was looking into, and my thoughts on them: 
* Accounting - always the safe backup plan, I'd probably do this. Honestly, you can never go wrong with an accounting degree, but it also seems blearily dreadful tbh. 
* Computer Science - A lot more interesting to work with for sure, but also a lot less stable as well. 10 years ago, I'd have loved it, I loved tech and learning all I could about it at the time. Nowadays? My interest in tech has dwindled significantly, and I find myself a lot more analog than I used to be. 
* Also thought about going into the trades; not really picky on which one, just whichever I could break into first. Wouldn't really mind the trades at all honestly, I like working with my hands, and I tend to be pretty physically adept. 

As far as my goals for a job, I'm honestly not super ambitious career wise. I have zero desires to be rich and make a ton of money, don't want to own a giant house or live in the middle of an expensive yet awesome city; mostly just want to make a decent income to get a house in a quiet area with my fianceé, with enough time and energy to invest in my hobbies that I actually care about. 

&#x200B;

As far as my own personal skills go, I'm extremely physically capable between competing in strongman and powerlifting, and regularly running 10+ mpw, I have okay computer skills (I had an A+ cert 8 years ago, no clue if it's still active or not) and am typically able to troubleshoot essentially any problem on a personal computer level... and honestly that's about it. I've improved my social skills tremendously, but as an autistic person I doubt I'd ever get to the level of being a good salesman (and again, that would require a drive and ambition I don't really have tbh). 

&#x200B;

Open to hearing basically any thoughts on the different routes I have thought up, or open to hearing about anything else I haven't considered as well. Thanks!

My specific team decided to have all of us pick our specific 3 days we wanted to be in the office when the mandate went live.  I chose Monday-Wednesday in-office and stuck to that for almost a year.  However I started noticing that the guidelines started to be more relaxed.  Coworkers were coming in on a different 3 days than their initially chosen ones, some coworkers were coming in only 2 days a week and on.  I decided to start doing the same, and switching up my days in office thinking it was fine and no one cared.

Around 3 months ago my manager met with me and told me that they noticed my inconsistency in attendance and were concerned.  He stated the manager team/VPs agreed that I should come in all 5 days a week for a period of time to prove that I can be consistent with my in-office attendance, all while stating that they are happy with my actual work performance and it was just a matter of in-office consistency on and on.  He said to stick it out for a month and everything will be back to normal after, provided there are no issues.

I took my lumps and came in every day, worked extra hard, fully expecting to be back to hybrid after a month.  However after a month went by, my manager and I met again and he said, ""unfortunately while the team is pleased with your commitment to being in office they feel a month isn't long enough, and we will have to see you do this for at least three months now."" Again I bit the bullet and told him while I'm frustrated that what I was originally told was no longer being honored, it was never officially documented so I understood and would keep coming in 5x a week.  He assured me to just stick with it for another 2 months and everything will be fine afterwards.

Now it is about to be 3 full months of me coming in 5x a week so we met again, and he told me the managerial team/VPs won't make any promises but by the end of month 3, they can hopefully consider giving me 1 day wfh for an indefinite period of time to ""test the waters"" before fully giving me the same privileges as everyone else.  I told him that I appreciated him sticking his neck out for me within the managers, but I felt very disrespected and felt it was unprofessional that no guidelines were clearly stated at the start of this, and the goal posts have kept moving on me.  He told me he completely understands how I feel - he is personally a strong advocate for WFH himself and believes it helps employee morale.  He told me it's a ""collective decision"" and it's not only up to him.  So far I've only aired my grievances on this with him, and he asked me not to go around the team talking about it and to keep discussions on this between me and him which I've honored.

At this point I don't even know if the other managers are as aware of this and actually do feel this strongly about keeping me in office 5x/week or if they're just standing aside because it does not negatively affect them if I'm in all 5 days a week anyways. On top of this, we lost a team member a month ago and she has not been replaced.  We just lost two more this past week so their workload has been dispersed to the rest of us for the time being including myself.  My manager said he knows how important I am especially in this time of turnover and they definitely do not want to lose me, but I haven't figured out how to leverage this into getting my privileges back.

Extra points:
1.  My role is definitely replaceable.  The turnover rate on my team is not extreme, but it's definitely a stepping stone role before moving onto better things.  I know generally speaking I'm not indispensable but I do feel extra indispensable now when we are short 3 employees with no new hires on the horizon.

2. I know people generally are biased towards themselves and people have to take reddit posts with a grain of salt (Dunning-Kruger effect and all).  I'm trying not to.  I'm by no means the best best employee on the team but I'm also far from the laziest.

3.  This is not a PIP.  There was no official written statement or document outlining anything - just an email from my manager saying I will start 5x a week on the following Monday (back in March).  There is no paper trail otherwise.

4. I already know the best answer to all this is to look for a new job and move on.  I am planning to for sure.  Just looking for advice on if this situation is amenable in the meantime - and if it makes sense to bring it up to the other managers or VPs (we all work together during the actual workday - the direct manager really just deals with approving vacation days, and things like this to be honest).  I'm only hearing what my direct manager relays to me as of now and I don't know how much he truly has my back even if he says he does.",oyeme,1,1.0,1,1717377283,2024-06-03 01:14:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d6slf6/team_mandated_me_to_work_inoffice_5xweek_with_no/,6,2024

Recently, I shut down during an interaction with someone of higher rank who was explaining tasks for me to do. The person was saying it differently than others I work with, who explain things like “here’s a goal, here are ways to achieve it, or “will you please etc” and this person was barking orders. It’s mostly this person’s personality, and I don’t think they intended to make me feel terrible, small and incompetent. Because of it, I was shut off in the convo. I didn’t say much, I had closed in body language, didn’t make much eye contact, and I was walking back with them in silence and got “out of their way” when they were walking behind me because they were walking faster, and they said “oh no you’re fine” and I was just quiet. I could’ve handled it better by asking them to slow down, taking a break, or just processing it afterward. I like this person, despite some small interactions that weren’t great (like constantly slamming their door right next to me, standing in a doorway not making space for me to pass, etc) but I figure it’s just their habits, and I’ve looked past it. I’m concerned this person walked away from the situation thinking that I didn’t want to do the tasks, because I mentioned in the convo how much I appreciated delegating the tasks in the past. I also said it allowed me to focus on tasks that develop my career. I only brought that up because the person came across controlling/domineering and I didn’t feel like I’d have the option anymore. After this, I saw the person with a higher up that they are best friends with and tell everything to. I feel like I need to clear the air but it means bringing up why I responded the way I did.

1d6pftv,Is someone with my character and inclinations even employable?,"tldr; Thought I'm technically inclined, but CS isn't for me. What to pivot into?

Here's who I am (sorry it's so long):

Graduating in a month from a CS undergrad. I went into it for the wrong reasons, knowing it was just not me. My \*thing\* was business and finance, but due to a mix of pressures from family, influence from exceptionally successful software engineering friends (who didn't go to college), and a need to just earn enough money to move out of my home and pursue music, I chose CS at college.

I performed very well, but that's just because I hate not being good at something. I did just enough (even academically questionable things) to get a 4.0 GPA in my years up to Junior. Took last year off to work an internship in AI & (attempt to) do music, came back with a renewed interest in CS (AI) and performed very well this year. Expected 4.0 still, but it really took so much hard work from me; it almost feels as though most students around me don't have to sacrifice as much as I did to get the same grade.

My goal, after this renewed interest, was to build my skills in AI, mainly agentic AI and Reinforcement Learning (which I self taught a lot of) and then start up my own company. However, over time it has worn off, and now I'm back at the realisation I really don't enjoy this that much beyond mild interest (the kind where I'd read a Medium article on a new LLM, but that's it), and I don't see myself continuing down this path.

What I'm naturally like:

Before CS turned me into an anti-social shell of my former self, I was very confident, enjoyed leading, presentations, learning a little bit about a lot (generalist) very quickly (as in, any more than 5 minute-conversation-level and I'll lose motivation). I enjoyed (and still do enjoy) trading, learning about finance, marketing, and the idea of corporate strategy sounds cool, though admittedly I couldn't tell you what it is beyond what it sounds like to me.

I am a very ambitious person with very high aspirations, so obviously high pay is one of the things I want from my role. I also want the role to be less abstract, more focused on the ""real world"" (as opposed to AI research where 90% of it mostly doesn't work). Finally, I want to be surrounded by very intelligent and very ambitious people.

Considering all this, what sounds like it might be a good fit, and how could I pivot?

1d6lrbx,Could my salary get reduced? ,"Had a meeting with our director and they had laid out how much manager overhead could be billed to a clients account on a weekly basis. Unfortunately that is not how much time we typically spend on a client, it usually goes over because the projects are sold in a way that doesn’t match up and manager time is heavily involved on any given project  mostly because my direct reports keep changing the goals. 

I am full time salary employee. I work 40 hours a week. My company is 100% remote.  I am now being told that with all my clients’s project combined, I should be billing no more than 24-30 hours a week. I have not asked what am I supposed to be doing the other 10-16 hours a week. But I am going to ask during my next training session. 

I am thinking that my salary, along with all the other managers, could be getting reduced because for the past 6 months a good majority of clients have been over served and budget ballooned by up to 50%. I am new and was still in training for 3 months and then this last month I did fully take over a client I was able to get the budget back on track.

1d6l60x,Am i stupid for wanting to return to retail from corporate?,"Am I stupid for wanting to return to retail from corporate?

Hi! I (24F) need some advice or a second view on this. I worked for 3,5 years in a big retail company while studying at Uni. I started as a regular sales advisor and quickly moved up to multiple management roles and ended up working as a Visual Merchandiser there which I loved. I mostly styled the store’s windows, mannequins, planned the store’s layout and created outfits for displays. I’ve always loved fashion and styling at the job was a nice combination of creativity, planning and analytical thinking + i got to move around a lot. After getting a BA, I started working at a PR agency where I stayed for 2,5 years but the company took a hit and there were several layoffs. Now I work at a company as a content writer, I mostly just write articles on a daily basis and it’s so dull. I consider myself to be a good writer and i used to enjoy writing, but I have realised that I despise writing on command and about topics that don’t interest me. The company itself is very chaotic and i despise going to work every day, the company is just not a fit for me. I’ve been browsing new jobs in my field but i just feel so sick of everthing and want to do something totally different. I despise sitting behind a computer the entire day, however i do enjoy the opportunity of doing remote work when needed. The job market is horrible right now and none of the openings in my field interest me, a part of me feels like i chose the wrong career path. Then again at times I feel like I might enjoy my field if i find a company and a team that fits me. Anyways, the retail firm is looking for a Visual Merchandiser again (usually there are no openings as the people stay there for years) and I decided to apply. I feel like I need to take a step back for a while and try to figure out what I want to do with my career. But a part of me feels stupid or like I failed if I throw away my degree and a flexible job that pays a lot better than retail. I haven’t heard back from the company yet and they might not even call me for an interview but i find myself dreaming of working there for a change, even if it is just temporary. 

TL;DR: Got a degree, I’m sick of my job and want to return to retail to find myself again. Am I stupid?",Livid-Sheepherder521,1,1.0,1,1717356411,2024-06-02 19:26:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d6l60x/am_i_stupid_for_wanting_to_return_to_retail_from/,6,2024

1d6k4ff,How to move to Switzerland to earn more?,"Hello everyone, I'd like your tips and advice on moving to Switzerland (im from Paris btw)

I'm 21 and about to start my Master 1 in September.

Since the start of my career, i.e. when I was 18. I've always done work-study: sales, marketing assistant, data project manager, key account manager + small projects here and there.

Except that I find that salaries in France are too low, and even more so after graduating...

I've had to take on adult responsibilities since I left high school without any help from anyone, and I can't hide the fact that I'm a bit fed up with having to count my budget all the time, which has already caused me problems I wouldn't like to see in the future.

So I'm a bit afraid of not earning enough...

My primary motivation for studying for a long time, without any taboos, was the salary.

Otherwise, I wouldn't do it...

I'd like to move there after my Master 2 so that I don't have to wait 3/4 years of state-imposed experience in France to earn a ""decent"" salary.

I currently have a partner who's also interested in the idea, so who knows, maybe we'll do it together.

I'm really interested in your tips, advice and anything else that could help me, especially when it comes to finding accommodation, rent, a job etc...

(If you have any cities to recommend, I'd love to hear from you). 

Oh yes, and I'm in the supply chain/purchasing/commerce field.

-I need to choose a field which has a good job market, good average pay, and most importantly which doesn't require a PhD (I can start the work soon after completing my masters.)

1d6h85r,Should I accept my company's offer and go back to school?,"A little contextual background: I have a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's in Computer Science. I am a recent graduate and got hired for a company working as an Embedded Systems Engineer. My employer has approached me about going back to school, free-of-charge, for a Master's in Electrical Engineering. I would be a part time student and a part time employee, so I can continue to gain industry experience while furthering my education. While I love the sound of gaining the opportunity to work with hardware aspects more without losing the ability to continue working with software, I am hesitant to take the offer for a few reasons.  
  
When my first semester rolls around and I have formal contracts to sign with my company about this offer, what should I do if there is some kind of time-related binding agreement? I am just starting my career, and this company pays rather poorly (excluding this educational offer). The schooling itself would take 3 years, and if the contract requires me to continue working for the company something like an additional 3 years after I graduate, I don't know if it would be worth it for me.  
  
I am also unsure as to whether or not this EE degree will help me in my career. I have asked industry friends and they simultaneously say ""You should never turn down free education"" and ""A third degree is not going to do anything for you"". Would this degree help further accredit me and make me a valuable target for future recruiters? I would really like to end up somewhere is aerospace engineering. Additionally, I would like to significantly increase my income within the next five years so that I can start a family. If the Master's in EE in conjunction with my background will actually be that beneficial, I'll do whatever it takes to continue down this path.",SantiagoOrDunbar,1,1.0,0,1717345986,2024-06-02 16:33:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d6h85r/should_i_accept_my_companys_offer_and_go_back_to/,6,2024

1d6gpur,I don’t really know what to do for a living ,"I’m a 34 year old man, and I still don’t have a career. I barely have a job, really. I work part-time in a grocery store in an extremely dead-end company. All my jobs have been basically like that. A sub shop here, a burger joint there, a small coffee shop. My whole life, I’ve been financially STRUGGLING, and I live in a house that family owns so my rent is cheap, and I’ve kept my bills small because I’ve had to but.. still, I’m always in dire straits. 

Now I’m in my mid-30s, I have a girlfriend I’m crazy about, she’s crazy about me, we’re very happy together and it’s been great. And all of a sudden I’ve gone from this complacent sort of loser content to sit on his ass going on Reddit and Instagram all day, to wanting a comfortable - hell, if I’m being honest even somewhat luxurious - life with this girl. I want to have and raise a family with her, I want our family to have a good life, I want to have it financially handled if someone gets sick, I want us to be able to travel to all the exciting places we want to see and make memories there together, I want us to achieve our beach house dream. Like I *reeally* want that. 

So.. minimum wage 25 hours a week at the food store that never promotes anyone ever and doesn’t offer any raises isn’t going to cut it. I don’t really have ANY skills that would reliably bring me a good income. The way things are with inflation in America right now aren’t exactly helping - especially in this state, and moving out is not an option. But short of becoming Tony Montana or the next Lil Wayne, I can’t begin to imagine how to make the kind of money I need to make to get to my vision. 

I’m kidding, I wouldn’t become Tony Montana because well, ya know I won’t spoil the movie or anything, and I think we have enough SoundCloud rappers who need to grow up and get a real job at this point (I was kinda one of them in my 20s lol). But I have nooooo idea where to begin. 

So far, I’ve looked into the healthcare industry just a bit. Phlebotomy and radiology, mostly. I figure wherever I land, people are going to need healthcare there, so I should always have work and it probably pays pretty well and doesn’t take a whole lot of school (at 34 with a BUNCH of other personal responsibilities I won’t get into here, I think going back to school for 8 years is not very realistic, especially considering I’d probably just accumulate $100 grand of debt it’s impossible to pay off and I need to start making money quick - so maybe a year certification course type of thing is probably more the way to go for me). I’ve also looked at plumbing. The thing with all those jobs I just mentioned is, I’m kind of a germophobe and have a lot of anxiety around health and if I had my hands down people’s toilets and worked with their probably infected blood all day, I’d probably be a complete nervous wreck regardless of PPE. That’s a whole separate life problem I’m working on in therapy, but believe me when I say I’ve tried everything you can think of and it seems it’s just who I am. I’ve also looked at being an  electrician, but again, I have some anxiety about, ya know, *b’zzz’ttt*! So idk if I can realistically handle those jobs. But maybe I need to man up and face my anxiety and just do it. But then which one? 

Another major factor I’m looking at for career options is work/life balance. Hell, maybe I’m asking for too much in America in 2024 in my position. But I don’t want to ever become the absent husband/father type, always working, with no time to have a fulfilling life and enjoy my time here on this earth. Because what’s the point of that? I also highly value my quality time I spend with my girlfriend and want plenty of it, so it’s important to me to keep the workload typically around 40 hours a week. I also need to work out to keep some health conditions I struggle with in check, so I need time and energy leftover for that, too. Otherwise there aren’t many jobs I would be able to do anyways. But again, maybe I’m being unrealistic. Maybe I need to work 65+ hours a week and the beach house will still be out of reach. 

In any event, I’m open to basically an endless amount of career options to consider, as long as they get me closer to the kind of life and future I want to build. Basically, I hope something that pays very well and offers a great work-life balance isn’t too much to ask for, and if I’m getting really crazy here, preferably something that isn’t going to overload my anxiety crazily all the time. I can handle high-stress environments pretty well, big time rushes in food service and screaming customers in retail and even poverty never really shook me up lol. But ‘dirty’ jobs where infections and/or death and injury become increasingly a problem might not suffice quite as much as something that achieves my goals without that being such an issue. I’m open to options and advice, though, and I’m done with the pipe dreams of being a rapper or moving to Hollywood to pursue being an actor or becoming an influencer on social media (my 20s were a pretty wild, lost time for career ideas lol). I’m also just getting to a point in treating my mental health that I think I could start really getting out there and pursuing better career goals and holding consistently with them, and my relationship is giving me all of the motivation and confidence I need to do that. I’m just overwhelmed about what in the hell I actually should pursue. There’s so many things. I’d really appreciate some advice and guidance and recommendations based on everything I’ve said. Thank you for reading it. Help me out, point me in a direction that might be helpful to me please!

1d6fijz,"Moving back home, no job awaiting, might be career suicide","TLDR: Been having massive separation anxiety after moving away from home, and fear packing up with no leads, and telling my boss I'm working from there now will kill my career. 


I moved about a year and a half ago from a decent hub to a large east coast hub, and I've been regretting it ever since. I had a bad layoff, couldn't find a postion at home, and found a great position that pays well and paid the move. The company is global, and has an office near home, but my team has nobody there. My boss is located elsewhere, and so is most of the people I talk to during the day. I've been doing very well, and my boss speaks highly of my work.

My company is very flex 3 days and I fly back often to see my friends, family, and more importantly my partner. I was hoping my partner would join, but they're struggling to find something in their field. Problem is I miss them all dearly, and the friends I've found here aren't as loyal. On top of it, the separation anxiety has been at an all time high and feel my mental health depleting(I've seeked help).

I brought it up with my boss and they brushed it off and said, ""we'll see with HR and see if other positions are available there."" I've contemplated just packing up at the end of my lease and just going back. I'll go to my boss and say I had to go back for personal matters, and would be happy to go into office by my home, or on my own dime once a month or so.

Job hunt has been miserable, and no leads for past 6 months after many applications. I'm afraid they fire me for cause and then my career takes a massive blow. I have a vast network I haven't fully tapped, but I don't want to utilize until final hours. After being in the industry for about 8 years, I understand I'll probably have to take a massive pay cut and seek entry level.

Sorry for the long post, just wanted to present angles. What's the likelihood of current company understanding? How would recruiters at future places understand the gap if fired?

1d6etny,Keep the job i love or take a new position at higher pay? (communications job),"(41yo) Currently, I really enjoy waking up and going to work. I enjoy my job as much as I enjoy sitting at home :/ . It pays $28/.55hr and I have been promoted to the max. No more promotions but only annual pay increases at 5% + $0.75/yearly for taking education courses. I work 42 hours average with very little option for overtime.

I have been asked if I would like to switch departments. It will come with an instant 10% pay increase. I can also receive up to three 10% hourly promotions over the next 5 years. Also, I can still do the $0.75 educational courses yearly and will still get the 5% annual increase. I've calculated that I can make around $50/hr after 5 years. This dept require 24/7 on-call work frequently. 

I did work this dept previously and didn't like the on-call work. However there was not the financial incentive previously. But, considering the fact that I'm behind on my retirement, this would speed up my 401k funding. I'm getting old and this job won't get easier over time.

3-International Business Bachelor

1d69lm5,Hired as a test engineer and have taken mutiple roles but still no promotion or pay raise even after a year,"I was hired as a manual tester 3 years ago when I was on a temporary visa, where I tested mobile apps, web apps, and hardware devices, including firmware testing. I then moved towards automation by integrating an automation framework on my own. During my testing, I uncovered several serious vulnerabilities and security threats, and my lead engineer encouraged me to start coding. Most of our development was contracted to another company, and the quality of their work was poor.

I volunteered to take on some of the development work by fixing bugs, cleaning up their code, and updating the libraries that hadn’t been updated for over 3 years. Since then, I have cleaned up the repository, improved performance, and re-written most of the logic. Nearly 8 months ago, my company decided to cancel the contract with the external company because I took responsibility for the development work while still holding the position of software test engineer. I was essentially working as both a software developer and a tester. I was also doing some administrative work related to mobile device and application management, such as handling the app deployment process and preparing test environments for other testers. As a result of my work, several clients have appreciated the improvement in performance and user experience.

I decided to request a position change because I enjoyed coding more than testing, and it was becoming harder for me to manage both roles at the same time. My manager and lead engineer told me they would promote me once I got my Permanent Residency and provide me with a new offer letter, but in the meantime, I was asked to continue what I was doing. I also asked them to hire another tester as I did not want to test my own code, but they rejected this, stating I was doing a good job with testing.

Six months ago, I finally got my Permanent Residency and brought up the possibility of getting a promotion as I had not received any salary increment since my joining. During this time, due to internal drama at my organization, my manager was made redundant and my lead engineer resigned as he did not want to work under a new boss who is passive-aggressive and hard to work with. All of this happened in the middle of a major software release, and my new boss realized that he had made a huge mistake—Technical architect, lead engineer, senior systems engineer, and senior software engineer all left. I am the only one who knows the overall system, and I am the only one who can take care of production issues, software releases, and provide answers to end users.

After my lead engineer left, he started to give me KT (knowledge transfer), but I was already quite familiar with most of his work. Now, everyone is treating me as his replacement. The people who used to contact my lead engineer have started contacting me—from marketing, clients, and supply chain. Some of my tasks include:

1. Software development
2. Mobile device management and app management
3. Software release - I am the one who deploys software and app updates to other testers and production users
4. Designing and developing test protocols, providing test plans - I do the testing myself once the development is complete
5. Investigating production issues
6. On-site client visits to meet our clients, and I’m also involved with a lot of paperwork, reviewing documents
7. Communicating with our partners to handle OS updates and kernel updates

I am overworking, and now that I have my Permanent Residency, I asked my boss to change my position to Software Engineer and adjust my salary because my contract needs to be changed. They sent me a new contract offering me a permanent role, but when I looked at the contract, it still listed me as Software Test Engineer, and the pay was the same. He told me to just sign this for now, and he would change my position later, but he did not mention anything about a salary increment (I am being underpaid by more than $60k). They also don’t have plans to hire another lead engineer because I am taking care of his work.

I refused to sign the contract and have set up a one-on-one with my manager to discuss this. I don’t feel motivated to work anymore. I don’t know how much longer I can continue doing this even though the product I work on is good and I have been learning a lot. I have documented everything that I have done—I write down the tasks that I do on a daily basis, have emails documenting my work, and more importantly, the commits I have made to the repo over the last year.

1d67g4x, Company I freelance for has money issues. How do I find work as a mid-career journalist? ,"I am a journalist in the late 30s and I am currently forced to find a new job but struggle to do so. So after journalism school, I did work as an intern/staff writer mostly at a media outlet which shut down due to money issues. For the past few years, I worked as a freelance foreign correspondent for a media outlet in my home country Netherlands while being based in the birth country of my mother. Yet now that outlet has also been less willing to pay for stories due to money issues. So while I feel like my career has been progressing over the years, I feel like its tumbling now and I dont fully know how to get ahead anymore.

So, I currently see two options:

1. Find more clients to work for from my current country. I tried reaching out to some newsrooms in the Netherlands but they mostly already got their contributors/staff correspondents or are at best interested in very few stories. I have also written to some English language media but the situation was similar.
2. Find a fulltime or a parttime job back in the Netherlands. Possibly freelance on the side I have tried applying to few advertised positions (so far unsuccessfully) and tried to talk to my quite limited network of journalist contacts asking for a job which may not be advertised. They were nice but that also led to nothing.

So I wonder if you have some advise for me:  
-Do you have any tips on how to better find jobs via a network and how to extend a network? (unfortunately, due to being abroad I didnt have many contacts at home)

-How do I apply more successfully for advertised jobs?

1d662gz,I was fired “for cause”. How do I best move forward?,"Basically, I was in a non-clinical role (chef) at a mental health/rehab company.

During orientation, they went over code of conduct and mentioned that staff cannot communicate with patients outside of work, but the phrasing (to me) implied they were just talking about clinical staff (therapist, case managers, etc) and not “other” staff like myself.

During orientation, many of my questions were met with “oh, well, I’m not sure since it’s a bit different for chefs” and the next day, I was left without guidance for 2 weeks to figure out my own schedule and onboarding plan while my manager was in another state (I reached out for help & was repeatedly deflected to figure things out on my own, and no one told me how long she’d be gone for).

Anyways, being a chef, I got to know the patients and exchanged contact info to keep in touch- seeing people come in detoxing & unable to eat and then seeing them on their last day completely clean their plate was heartwarming, and I wanted to stay in touch with a select few who had remarked about being homeless at times (so that if they were homeless again after leaving, I could bring them food or just help them get help again).

I realize in hindsight that was not smart, but in the moment it seemed harmless and ok since I wasn’t clinical staff or privvy to the majority of their case/why they were there. 

A coworker was aware of what I was doing and encouraged it even (again, not an excuse but pertinent to this next part). I left a few dishes behind one night (12hr shift, usually other staff will pitch in or leave it for me to get to the next day). Well, this particular coworker was so pissed off, that as “payback” she went directly to HR to tell them about my communications, which she had screenshots of from texts. She has mentioned being remorseful to other coworkers, but Im still at a loss over her making me lose my job/health insurance over a couple dishes.

In less than 24hrs I was terminated- I was honest, said it was true and with the screenshots it was cut & dry. I thought id maybe have a chance at taking an ethics course or a suspension, but they curtly kicked me to the curb. I’m applying for unemployment benefits and saw that if you were fired for cause, you can be denied. And now I am wondering if this incident is going to follow me for the rest of my career and keep me from every holding a job ever again. I’m terrified. I’ve never been fired before, always a model worker/going above and beyond. I feel hopeless. What can I do? Where do I go from here?

1d65rei,Boss is being petty- do I have options?,"Quick summary- been at this company for about 2 years. Excelled in my department quickly. Since my initial interviews, had expressed an interest in an alternative path in analytics. I have applied for a role in analytics that has recently become available. I needed my boss’ okay, which she gave. I heard she told my new boss I was “opportunistic” and would leave within a year.

Background on work history
-excelled extremely quickly in my role, my boss (38F) and I (35F) are friendly
-paid below market value, but the work environment is great (usually)
-I am well liked and a huge linchpin for my team as a resource and training
-I helped build out a new optimizer for my team which I am still leading on (with the help of 1 newer teammate)
-I have, professionally, turned down a management role in my department as I am content to not climb the corporate ladder at this time
-my boss “requires” me be available for dinners and team building, this is not in any expectation or job description. I work 45 hrs/week (30 min lunch). I made a point early on that my work hours have a hard stop, I was told this was fine
-I have discussed my salary openly, my boss has found out. I disclosed to my direct coworkers, not like I’m yelling it at everyone, one of them snitched to her. This is a protected act in my state. Retaliation by the company, of any kind, is illegal. I am an advocate for Worker’s rights. I will not apologize for it. The snitch is on her own in my books. Selling out your fellow worker. Tsk tsk.

I heard this evening that my boss is sabotaging my chances at a role I applied for and has said I “shot myself in the foot” because now she could never give me a raise again. Since then she’d need to raise everyone. Her prerogative, but totally illegal to actually say that.

I don’t think I have a lot of options aside from hoping I still get the role or applying elsewhere. Like I said, the job doesn’t pay great, but I love the work culture. It’s hard to like where you work when your boss is working against you.

Any advice?

1d65qe2,Looking support after multiple visa refusals,"I am not sure if anyone will even pay heed to this post but I am extremely dejected right now and I just need to get it out of my chest. 
So here is my story.

I have been to the United States almost once every 1-2 years since the last 10 years on my B2 visa. One of these visits, I had to rush to the states to take care of my father who got really ill while he was there on a vacation. I ended up over staying for 5 weeks in addition to the 180 days granted by i-94. 
Once I was back in my country, I went to the US one last time for 2 weeks before my visa was set to expire. I sent it for renewal as soon as I was back and was hoping for a smooth process. Unfortunately, I didn’t get my B2 visa renewed after being interviewed. 

Despite the refusal, I went on with my on with my plan to study in the US. 
After working really hard on my applications and securing an admission, I showed up for my F-1 visa interview. The questions that I was asked were mainly directed towards my sibling’s status in the US and had nothing to do with my course or my plans. 
I did not qualify for the visa, yet again.

With this trajectory, I don’t think I can ever turn this refusal around and probably doesn’t even make sense to try again. 
At this point, I feel like I have hit rock bottom. Somehow getting so close to everything I worked hard for and watching it slip away. I am so reluctant to give up and try other options because I had such high expectations from the education and the training that I would receive in the States.

I'm certified thru azure and am an honroably discharged army veteran. Yet, I can't find work. I've applied to over 700 jobs all over the country. Had multiple interviews just to not be selected. 
This last job I interviewed for was for a cloud op engineer position. The recruiter said the company loved me and my last meeting with HR would be to go over pay. They dragged me through four interviews. Apparently, they were less than 24 hours away from offering me 80k but then an ""internal referral"" (probably a buddy) came out of nowhere at the 11th hour and they gave him the job. It's always who you know not what you know. And that one was disheartening. I have a family to support and one can only take so much rejection before it starts to get to them.

1d64in5,I don’t want to drop my major in psychology and minor in CJ but I also want to do nursing.,"For started the reason I chose psychology was because it was something I’ve always loved growing up, I enjoyed the idea of being able to figure someone out and analyze them and their brain. I have taken a upper level forensic psych class my 2nd semester of my freshman year and I was very good and loved it which it hit me that I should work with “troubled” youth because its who I was friends with growing up and it was because I have always been open minded to every walk of life. People have always trusted me even without me saying a word and knowing I made someone feel that safe just being there I knew I needed to do something helping people. So, I met with my professor for said forensic psych class and I explained to her everything about how I am dealing with others traumas and how people seem to confide in me without me saying a word so she told me with the love I have and passion for psych I could do forensic psych path and work at advocacy centers and then we hit forensic interviewing and I thought it was perfect. From there on since I had left her office I was excited to have finally found something to look to and feel like it fit me and made sense or so I thought up until recently.

I started working at my mothers job a clinic and all I did was scan paperwork and help write referrals and then they realized they needed more people and so they looked at me and said “you learn quick and work fast and are a hard worker, do you think you could learn if we taught you to be an MA?” (Medical Assistant) and I agreed because I mean maybe it’s something I could fall back on if I end up not liking psychology for some reason. And health was always my backup plan if I wanted to change majors! So now working at the clinic and being trained by an MA and seeing how it works I realize I might enjoy that sort of career too. I’m now at a point where I’m think of how psychology in order to do the sort of things I’d like to do I would need a Masters or a PsyD for which I planned for but then after putting scrubs on and learning all I have learned as of now the backup plan I had of taking the steps to become a RN (Registered Nurse) just in case I didn’t want to do psych have become a new love for me I don’t know what to do. Because I love both and I know I would do amazing in both and I’ve heard from people in those fields I’d do amazing in them I’m lost. Is there something I could do that involves all three? Nursing, Psychology and, Criminal Justice?

I grew up loving psychology and the idea of analyzing someone from the inside out but I also grew up being at the hospital with family, always being the first there and helping the nurses anyway I could, even if someone needed care at home I’d always be there. Or being at the hospital and learning so much from all the times I was there with family I was able to explain what the doctor or nurse was trying to explain because all those years I learned so much medical terms. And criminal justice with the idea of being in law enforcement and once again helping people? There the three things that have never left my mind and I’m at a cross road at what I should do as I love all three :( so I thought maybe I could finish my psych major with minor in criminal justice and continue to train at the clinic so I could eventually get certification and work my way up from there and eventually get to RN and work in a hospital with kids because they like me as I said previously and help them get through things. Or if we had a case with a kid who had to deal with something a kid should never have to experience such as SA, abuse,etc or something of the sort, I can help them with psych and CJ such as using techniques I’ve learned to help cope with things like that and help find proper resources for their situation. I’m not sure where I should go with those three paths and I’m looking for any advice or a career that can include all three or even if my plan I explained could work.

Anything helps :)",Alien-shmailen450,1,1.0,1,1717299919,2024-06-02 03:45:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d64in5/i_dont_want_to_drop_my_major_in_psychology_and/,6,2024

1d640qk,"URGENT Applying to a new job, but there's one problem.....!!!","Please don't laugh at my situation I know it's not cute!

I'm applying for a dream role. I've applied to this company before and got all the way to round 5/5 before I was rejected, but kept in touch with the people that interviewed me because we had a great rapport. Shortly after getting rejected by this company I ended up getting a job with a different company. Well in March I was let go due to a combination of health issues and poor work performance because of said health issues (gallbladder failure that I ignored for a year and severe tonsillitis kept me out of work for over a month). I was there for about 6 months.

  
Now the company is hiring again for the same role! I think I could be a shoe in. Currently I'm at a new job that's really great but I've been looking for new work lately because the pay is awful. The biggest issue is a few months ago I was giving life updates to one of the previous interviewers and they know about the job that I was previously at that let me go so now I feel like I have to put it on my resume otherwise I risk being potentially interviewed by them and questioned about it. 

**QUESTIONS:**

What should I do if and when I'm asked about my previous job? Should I tell the truth and risk them thinking I can't handle it? Should I lie? Should I risk not including the job on my resume and show a gap or risk getting interviewed by that person who knows? Right now my resume reads in the order below:

**Current job (has nothing to do with the industry I'm applying to)**

**Job that let me go (same industry as job I'm applying to)**

**Impressive job (same industry as job I'm applying to, I quit because I no longer liked it there)**.

1d63urc,Do I quit after a decade? ,"This post will have a bit of venting so it will be long but if you can read it all, I appreciate any wisdom, opinions and ideas!

I just finished the 2nd phase of interviewing and have been invited to the 3rd/final stage. The position is entry level with a small local government- public works department. My dilemma is; I don’t know if I’m offered the position, if I should take it….

My current job, can be really stressful at times. I know due to my experience a lot of folks come to me for questions but it’s exhausting especially when sometimes it feels like they don’t take the time to think for themselves before asking. I don’t have all of the answers, sometimes but I take the steps to figure out the answers compared to others. I work on a program that moves fast with high volumes and honestly has no business having entry level team members that can’t make their own decisions because of lack of knowledge. But due to low staffing and so much turn over, this is how the program got stuck this way. 
The other stress is related to the decisions my company makes. It’s clear a lot of the senior level execs have no clue how the “little” folks do their work and how the decisions they make have massive impacts and the toll it takes on us. It’s kind of always been like this but the past few years it’s gotten worse. There’s so many new execs that came from the outside, they’re disconnected with how things really work and don’t take the time to learn it. If I go into the details of these impacts from bad decisions, we’ll be here all day, so I’ll save you from that. Just know you’d make faces wondering why the heck a technology company isn’t very technologically advanced for certain core departments. My favorite thing to say for my department is we are the red headed step children of the company. **sorry to any redheads reading this…

Now I know the grass isn’t always greener on the other side, and all companies have their issues, but I don’t have warm fuzzy feelings about my company anymore. I think within the next few years the company will continue to have big changes, maybe even a massive sell off/downsize, for sure increase debt and due to my experience after the program I’m on finishes, I bet I’ll be moved to a position I don’t want any part of. 
There are so many new employees that don’t know how to do their jobs (most of it to no fault of their own, we don’t have real training /on boarding program and the experienced folks are already stressed with their own work load and no time to train.

With all that said, why is it hard for me to make a decision?

1. Massive pay cut - approx 30-35% (percentage doesn’t include a loss of annual bonus either). LUCKILY the cut in pay won’t impact my family and bills too much since my husband has a really good income (I actually don’t have to work at all, but you know… queue in Destiny’s Child “Independent Woman”… HAHa, please don’t judge me and my mental illness! I’m totally not all independent, the hubby does a great job providing, but I don’t like the stay at home wife/mom gig, as Ive tried it before.  I’m the better saver, more frugal as his expensive hobbies stress me.

2. In Office - right now I’m hybrid, 3 days in office with an average 40min commute each way. New job 5 days in, commute is within the same city I live in, 11mins away from home. 

3. Experience - I would be the new person, and learning new things. Current job I know my stuff, if I don’t know something, I definitely have my established network of peers. I’m losing 10years of relationships and hard work with promotions and reputation.

4. Flexibility - I have kids, elementary and middle school, sometimes there’s last minute taking time off or schedule adjustment (start later/early). With the new job I have to wait for probation period to be over and wait to have enough collected PTO to take vacation days.

5. Guilt - I have been part of this special program since it started. There are so many new folks, even my manger is new. Me leaving would greatly impact them and I would feel like I left them hanging.

I tend to work long days, partially because I don’t have a good work/life balance but also after majority of everyone is gone/logged off, that’s when I can actually focus on my own work, since I have to help everyone during the day. Then the  days I say screw it I’m logging off on time, I feel shame or think about work late at night. 
New place, there’s no taking work home. 5pm is 5pm, close up and get out!

I was hoping I could get some advice from some more experienced workers and seasoned individuals out there.

I recently graduated with my Master's in Environmental Science. I was offered a job across the country from where I am offering 50k/yr, with an option to obtain a PhD for free while working. The company is offering 5k in moving costs as well.  This job could also have the potential of working alongside NASA and hopefully could potentially lead to a long-term career with them. 

I have 2 dogs, my wife and our house. We would be selling our house with minimal profit and moving across the country for this and I am just wondering if this is worth the move now? Should I negotiate for a higher salary given my background and skills or settle for what they offer and move anyway? Should we stay here and maybe look elsewhere, given that our region does not have a lot of jobs for my kind of field.  Out of respect for the company, I am trying to keep details limited and would just like some insight given the information as a fresh graduate looking into a major career opportunity on if negotiating out of grad school is common, and if working for universities allows room for negotiating.

1d62uub,Will leaving Leadership Development Trainee program early burn bridges? ,"I'm a recent grad and I got a position in a leadership program where I can get a full time position in a leadership/Supervisor role. 

The problem:
1) I have social anxiety and I really don't want to be in a leadership role that makes my anxiety worse. Although I do put myself out there and get therapy and I understand the importance of getting more exposure therapy, I really don't want a position that triggers my anxiety because I am unable to think clearly when I'm really anxious. So I would like a remote position or something where I don't have to deal with people all day that is only 8-9 hours because it seems like this job wants most to work 10-11 hours, and I'm not passionate about anything that much to work that long.

Why did I join the program?:
I thought it would break me out of my anxiety but I'm not seeing much changes and it makes me want a remote job even more, especially after having an anxiety attack at work. I also was hoping that there would be a role where I can keep to myself, but seems like they actually want me to be a supervisor (shocker).

Also, the commute is almost 2 hours each way. I was supposed to find an apartment closer but my parents' financial situation wasn't as good as I thought, so I help them and I can't afford an apartment while helping them at the same time if I also want to save money.

So the drive is taxing on my body and I feel as if I don't have time to do things that I like because I'm always tired. I am currently looking for remote positions but I am incredibly afraid of letting them know I won't continue with the program if I get a remote job because they have been training me for months for a leadership position.

Civil Engineering in 2019, and two years of experience as Site Engineer. And did my masters in Construction project management in 2022. For past one year I've been working for a logistics firm till now. I'm not sure where I'm making mistakes. From 2022 Dec, I applied for all type of roles that are related to my expertise, but never got anything. In short, I'm completely fed up with my Construction career. But now for past one month I've been thinking of starting preparations for getting into IT specifically cyber security. I have no prior knowledge in anything related to IT except the fact I know basic programming while doing my bachlors. So I recently started cyber security course from Google (coursera). And I'm interested in learning, what I'm thinking is that if I completed this certification along with CompTIA secuirty + certification may have chances to get into an entry level position in security field by early next year (max). But it's only my pov. I was all wrong for past 4 years. So I think I can't risk anymore. It would be really helpful for me if you could give me any thoughts on this. That'd be really helpful for me.

1d61c9j,How to put monetary value on ease of current job when considering job change?,"Hi,

I'd like to preface this by acknowledging that I'm incredibly fortunate to have to choose between two good options here. It's laughable post because I really am in a good situation and don't mean to co

I'm currently working as a data analyst making 95k with 10% annual bonus potential which I'll be getting for sure-- so we'll call it 104.5k. I have an incredible relationship with my manager who understands the work-life balance very well. I sincerely value the service our company provides and feel good about the work we do. I work from home and legitimately have about 15-25hrs of work per week given the week. I hang around to make sure i'm available but can pop out any time, or read from home, go for a run etc. It's the least stressful job I've ever had. It suits my personality well (I mean who would complain about any of that) but I'm particularly sensitive to feeling trapped in a 9-5 and climbing the corporate ladder has never been of interest to me.   
  
An old boss who I also really respect and enjoy working with just reached out and is offered a director of analytics position that pays 150k. She's definitely a hard ass though and is the type to send emails on Friday at 5pm asking to complete a quick task before the weekend. I'd absolutely be working +40hrs a week but fortunately it's still remote. The position would be in higher education for the admissions team essentially trying to increase enrollments, not something I really care about but also not something I'm ethically opposed to or anything.   
  
I know this might seem like a no-brainer especially for those who are driven by career advancement and finances. The money would be great and I've been saving to buy a home and this would make it possible even though I don't have urgency (unmarried, no kids). But, from a young age I've always know that I will never be on my death bed thinking ""I wish I would've spent more time at the office."" I get burnt out easily.

The ultimately question is how to put monetary value on the comforts I enjoy in my current job? 45k is a significant raise and having a director role on my resume would be great to set a baseline for what I'm able to do in the future. But I really have a good thing going right now and don't know if it is a risk being miserable 6 months from now. 

TL;DR Current job is suuuuper easy and I'm happy, new job would be a 45k raise. How do I put monetary value on my current situation?

1d613uf,"Thoughts on Taking a ""Gap Year"" in Early Career?","Hi Reddit! I'm strongly considering a pretty non-traditional move and would appreciate any advice you could give me.

  
For background, I'm a 23M Mechanical Engineer. I started with a Fortune 500 right out of school and am just hitting 2 years with the company. No complaints about the job, but there are talks of layoffs coming in the next 1-2 months that have me thinking about my next move if I'm on the list. This company is the biggest engineering employer in the state, so to find another job it's very likely I'd have to relocate at least a couple of states away.

  
My thoughts are that instead of relocating to another job, I might consider taking advantage of my relative youth and doing something more interesting for a year or so. My #1 contender would be getting a sailboat and travelling around the Caribbean or Mediterranean. This is something I've been seriously considering for almost 10 years, including spending time learning to sail on smaller boats for the last 2 years just for this purpose. Based on my quite research, I should have more than enough savings to make it work without too much issue.

  
My main concern is this: with only 2 years of industry experience, is a one year gap in employment going to keep me from being able to get a job once I'm done? This is something I really want to do, but not at the expense of my future financial security. Most other examples of similar stories either happen much further into a person's career or before/while they're in school.

1d605gx,WFH boundaries? ,"I have multiple disabilities including adhd and I could use some advice. I have been working part time for a small business. I have been working remotely like 20 hours a week for the past few months. I have been working Monday through Friday. The owner keeps calling and texting me on the weekends (not every weekend, but he’s done this at least 4x in the last few months). I respond because I feel obligated to reply so I don’t get fired or he thinks I’m ignoring him but it kind of makes me uncomfortable that he texts me on the weekends when I told him
I would be mostly working Monday-Friday. This is only my second job because of my disabilities. I wanted to post here to see if the unspoken rule when you have a job (of any kind) is that you are “on” 24/7/365. He has also asked me questions about my disabilities which I only answered because I felt comfortable enough to do so, but that situation and this situation makes me not sure he’s not very good at boundaries. The company is very small. I have contacted vocational rehab for their advice but they do take the weekends off which is good. So hopefully I’ll hear back on Monday. Vocational rehab has also spoken to him and they told me that they think he’s not very organized. This is far from my dream job but I also really don’t want to mess things up because it’s super hard to find a job when you have a disability and that’s why it took me to 25 to actually get hired. I just don’t want to do the wrong thing.

1d5zokn,Need to figure out the next step of my career,"Hello everyone, as the title reads I need to decide what my next step in my career should be. I have worked for an independent contractor in a rural community for 4 years now. We primarily do HVAC installation and service but we also do a myriad of other things including plumbing, electrical, construction and remodel, water line repair and installation, and residential pipe fitting. I feel that I have most experience on the hvac side of things but my job is different almost every day. I started as an apprentice and now earn $25 per hour and a gas card for my personal vehicle (with the caviat of using it as a work vehicle when needed i.e. hauling material and towing). I do not have health benefits or a 401k. 

My boss will be retiring soon and offered to sell me his business which would involve the cost of many things such as a contractors license, insurance and more. The upstart is too high for me to afford and my credit makes it difficult to take out a loan. I also am aware that there is no more opportunity for growth with this company as I will not be paid more that $25 per hour down the road. 

I am considering looking for a hvac job that can match or better my current pay, however I am unsure of my skill in the feild as I do not do this every day for work. I can install furnaces amd ac systems and have limited knowledge of service. Hvac companies hiring are at least a 1 hour commute frome where I live. I'm feeling a bit stuck and not sure what to do.

1d5z8ka,How can I make money? What work options do I even have right now???,"I’m (24F) currently in the hospital due to pregnancy complications and will be here for the foreseeable future. I’m looking at like, 1-2 more months, and I’ve already been here for a month.

I did not qualify for disability. I was laid off from my corporate job in October and started working 3 different gigs for a while because I was still acting as the breadwinner while my husband was back in school. I ended up just working my part time job two months ago because I became too pregnant to do my other gigs. I worked part time for a small local business. Because of this I don’t qualify for FMLA or any sort of disability.  (Thanks USA)

My husband is back at work and currently makes enough for our shared bills. He hypothetically could pay my personal bills, but he’ll be stretched very thin. Our babies will probably need NICU time (yes, babies multiple.) and I luckily have insurance, but a bill is still a bill and from what I understand, there is the potential that we’ll be billed separately.

I planned on saving up my last few checks to cover my personal bills for the next few months and not return to work until the babies were 4 months. We cannot afford childcare for multiple children. Right now I am planning to work at a daycare and enroll them there, but that is about 6 months from now.

Is there ANY work that I can do from a hospital room? I can’t seem to find any WFH jobs available for the city I live in. If there’s any little gigs I could do for extra money, I am not privy to them. I have all the free time in the world while on bedrest and could probably muster a good schedule when I bring my babies home. I have a headset and a laptop available. I literally just need to make 600/mo to float by. Ahhhh!!

A woman who works in the operations team (basically customer service- dealing with tickets, phone calls etc.) is going on maternity leave. I have been asked to take on additional responsibilities to help out the operations team (to take on tickets and calls) in her absence. I explained that I am already overwhelmed with my current duties and worry I will not have enough time to help out. They understood and said they would find a different way to cover her responsibilities. I was then contacted by a higher up member of the company who explained to me that this is more important than what I am currently doing as what I am currently doing is not as urgent as the tickets and calls… and was told that I would be trained on this next week. He also said it would be nice for me to see how the rest of the company works and to step away from my current tasks… I actually enjoy my current tasks! I enjoy what I do! 
I’m not getting a pay raise so how is it fair that I am taking on these additional responsibilities? I also hate customer service work- I don’t want to answer calls!!! Tickets I can deal with and I don’t mind as much but calls are a whole other level.

Was hired as an intern in 2013 and was later absorbed in the campaign management team that worked with major global brands focusing on running mobile-first campaigns in the AU-NZ region.

This last team I was working in was very toxic and people took praise for the work I was doing. I did get noticed and got spotter awards too but the limelight was always stolen by the team lead. At the same time, he would try to bully me all the time, mess things up for me and give negative feedback about me every once in a while. Since this was my first job, I didn't know how to bring up this issue with the management or HR.

Later on, I was let go from the job as the company was apparently downsizing. I was told by my manager that I can stop coming from the next week and don't need to serve my notice period either. It was paid for. I didn't know whether this was for real or not, because the team lead would often joke about such a situation from a while before. There was no formal communication about this decision from the management either. But I was so burnt off from being bullied and overworked that I decided to take it seriously and didn't show up for work.

I was met by some major challenges in my personal life and decided to take a break. Eight years have gone by. I've been getting through with some earnings I make via freelancing with a digital marketing company based in the UK. Mostly content writing, though I would sometimes edit websites or manage campaigns for them.

1d5re28,Mechanical Engineering - I'm at a crossroads for where to take my career,"I'm a mechanical engineering graduate with a master's degree, and have worked for 2 years as a project engineer and for half a year (internship) as a design engineer. I have been unemployed for the majority of this year following a large layoff at my previous employer, and now have to decide which path will be best for my career.

I have an offer for a company to go into the semiconductor industry as a Customer Engineer, which needs a response by the end of Monday. I haven't heard much about this career path before, but it seems like it's a customer support technician who happens to be an engineer. The company looking to fill this role seems to be solid, but offers lower than average pay and has some weird internal culture that I would need to get used to. I would need to relocate for this opportunity, but it is only about 3 hours away from where I currently am.

On the other hand, I have had a positive interview process with a local company who does welding and fabrication work for the industry I was previously working in as a project engineer. They have tentatively agreed to a higher pay than the other offer, but it is a smaller company, and I would be working as half-project-manager and half-design-engineer at this company. They have said they will be able to send me an offer on Monday or Tuesday of next week, which is right at the deadline for the other offer.

Is the career path for a Customer Engineer something that will enhance my professional career? Or is it better to wait for this other local opportunity and hope that they follow through on actually sending me a formal offer?",kaito_889,0,0.5,0,1717260885,2024-06-01 16:54:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d5re28/mechanical_engineering_im_at_a_crossroads_for/,6,2024

1d5p7x8,Am I distracted between career and stability in life for a PIONEER level goal?,"Hello everyone,

I'm reaching out for some guidance and perspective on a dilemma I've been grappling with regarding my career aspirations and the need for stability in life.

I will start this discussion by giving a little bit of information about me and my goal. I have been a very bright (may not be a topper) student since my school time and specially since the 10th grade. In 10th grade, I became more mature and independent towards my studies and built a potential of self studies. I've always been enthusiastic about computer science and mathematics. While I also find other subjects such as physics and chemistry exciting, I tend to struggle a bit more with them compared to computer science and mathematics.

Currently, I am a working professional and still learning things in different areas independently. Using my knowledge, I have previously made significant contributions in the field of computer science and few areas of engineering providing solutions aiding in the success of prototypes. Through these accomplishments, I've demonstrated proficiency in problem-solving, conducting research, and developing solutions. I aspire to utilize these skills at a **PIONEER level** in my career trajectory. However I am facing few challenges which are listed below:

1. **Trying to be perfectionist:** I always tend to study any topic from scratch to core hoping that I learn each and every detail of the topic. I study the same topic from different sources and platforms. I also practice them which consumes comparatively more time than my peers.
2. **Long time retention of information:** As noted above, I have made contributions in the field of computer science and few areas of engineering as well, since I realize that computer science only is not enough for pioneer level achievement. I also need to study the areas of applications. However, whenever I shift towards a new field, I have to leave the practice of the previous field. Now moving back to the previous field, I have to restart the revision from the beginning. This is time consuming for me.
3. **Lack of finances and results:** I may possess the knowledge, however my habit of studying a topic from the scratch consumes comparatively more time than my peers and I remain behind. When my peers are about to land a job (with the required knowledge only as they have different goals that is money), I am still studying my field. Sacrificing job for a long term goal (because of work-life balance as I have other commitments also to fulfill. Currently relying on freelancing). I also need money to support family and fulfill my personal requirements so I can get a calm and healthy environment for personal studies.

So here's where I find myself torn: Am I sacrificing too much in pursuit of a lofty, perhaps unattainable goal of reaching the pinnacle of my field?",Escapshion,1,1.0,0,1717254917,2024-06-01 15:15:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d5p7x8/am_i_distracted_between_career_and_stability_in/,6,2024
1d5oxmr,"At work, I made a mistake and now I feel pigeonholed in my position. ","My boss is a relatively new boss, but she moved up as being the boots on the ground as an inspector to her position. Before I got hired on, she worked with the people she now oversees who have been working  in that department. And in my time, I've noticed a sense of favoritism when it comes to rules for me but not for others. 

My boss is a pretty hands off boss which I appreciate, but I felt like she has given me a bit of disservice in my path on getting a promotion.  Since I work for the government, there are certifications you need to take to at least get promoted. From there,  you have to have a sub department that you oversee. When I got hired on, they gave me a project that had never seen such unprecedented amount of work while giving me other assignments to work on. We have to test water meters before installation in apartments to make sure they are correctly measuring. With the new law in place, we started getting thousands and thousands of meters to tesr. 

I got in trouble with my boss's boss because she didn't like how many pallets of work there was. She accused of not being efficient at my job, but the issue wasn't me being efficient it was that the workload was so much on top of me having to log in a hundred working hours on other assignments that prevented me from solely working on my main project.

Fast forward to now, they reassigned me to another program that I am not overseeing as just the guy that does inspections. I took over someone else's workload in this inspection while he oversees the water meter testing. My boss doesn't like confrontation, but I feel like she didn't really have my back when her boss was talking about reassignment of duties. Now I'm coming into 1.5 years on the job, finished all my state certifications and feel like my boss just kind of brushed me off to the side as something that is taken care of for now with nothing for me to oversee. 


My question, is do I just do I quietly just do the work that was asked of me and get paid the same as the people in my level? Do I wait for a couple of months to at least have the data for my boss to show her boss that I'm a good worker and that it was just unfortunate circumstances that she didn't really seem to understand? My thinking is to wait for a while and then have another meeting asking for a pathway to becoming a senior. My boss is a cool boss, but I feel like when she got the managerial role, she didn't have to worry about anything because everything was already taken care of and now I feel like I'm just an inconvenience. It makes me sad that because I felt like I was set up for failure and now she's making the right moves now to handle the influx of work and it's making me look like the bad employee. Any advice would be appreciated.

1d5nfor,Best way to get out of the suburbs with a physics degree. ,"I live in Philadelphia in the United States right now and have an M.S. in physics with mostly laboratort experience. Unfortunately my career path has been pretty rocky and I end up in a lot of temporary work or support roles. I currently live in Philly but work in South Jersey but I'm having trouble both with driving and having a cars destroy all of my gains. the commute it horrible and I only make $19/hr right now. I get into a lot of major and minor car accidents and cry or have a pannick attack at least one a week on the way home. I've always been a very innattentive driver from a combination of ADHD and maybe vision problems. I've made up to $30/hr before in laboratory job (in the suburbs) before but I got a new car and then got fired and the new car took all my savings. All the jobs with similar skill sets tends to be like an hour away in some far away place I don't want to live in. 

Anyway I don't know whether to go back to school for something or maybe just change my job search plan. I have the skills for basic office work but can't seem to find any.  I don't know any programming languages and have only played with Matlab in college. Im not really great with computers. I'm not really set on this city but I noticed wherever I live the jobs I find are in some cooperate campus in the middle of nowhere. I have to search hard to find a commutable apartment in a city. They often don't end up working out anyway  and I end up having to take something where I drive further:( . I know if be happier if I could just remove the car from the equation but I feel stuck right now.

1d5mlyq,Evaluating the Impact of Online MS Degree on IT Career Prospects in India,"Hello,

I am from India and have graduated with a BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications), majoring in cybersecurity, with a CGPA of 8.7. I was planning to pursue a master's degree, but I have found that the MCA course has little scope in the job market, especially in IT. It seems to be more of a nominal qualification. Therefore, I believe pursuing an MS in IT or a related field from a foreign university would be more valuable for my career.

However, due to family issues, I am unable to leave India to pursue any master's course unless it is online.

1d5ix21,Landing a job with MPH or just public health in general. ,"Hi! I’m about to finish my degree in medical biotechnology. I want to change my career to public health rather than biology. 

From what I’ve heard you need some sort of health experience prior (even with a MPH) to land a job after graduation. If I work part time as a medical receptionist/ entry level admin WHILE I’m doing my MPH, what are my chances of landing a job after? 

I was also looking into doing Masters of Health Leadership and Management after my MPH if I end up doing that. The uni I was looking at has internship/ placements for this. 

I’ve collected a bunch of jobs I’ve seen people do from my research, from these related degrees: 

Health economic analyst 
Health Policy analyst 
Health Project manager 
Public Health Manager 
Epidemiologist 
Biostatistician 
Market access manager 
Health consultant 

What are everyone’s thoughts? My plan is probably seriously flawed but I’m just trying to understand my options after doubting my original career plan which was to do medicine.

I’m worried that I won’t be able to find a decent paying job. My ultimate goal will likely to be some sort of manager of a hospital or something like that.

1d5hsih,Can’t get my confidence back ," I (mid 20s) have been working at my company since graduating college, starting under a manager (huge micromanager, took credit for a lot of my work, didn’t allow me to attend meetings and consistently re-assigned my projects to herself) who was quite incompetent and immature. I took on a lot of responsibility and frequently had to cover for my manager and mentor junior teammates, despite not having a management role myself. My duties drastically changed every few months.

A more senior manager reached out unexpectedly and offered to move me to a different team in our department, which I was thrilled about. However, the transition process became very drawn out and political. My old manager seemed to resent my departure and made the offboarding process difficult. The ENTIRE department was restructured during/for my transition, which took months. While I waited, my old boss refused to offboard me in any real way and just iced me out of the day to day so I sat around doing nothing for 3 weeks. I felt caught in the middle of conflicts between management.

I feel very uncomfortable now in my role because every manager in my department had a hand in transitioning my role and evaluating my performance, and they were meeting multiple times a week discussing everything. I just don’t think it’s totally fair that managers I wouldn’t report to got to evaluate my career trajectory in any real way. None of my other coworkers have ever been “board reviewed” like this (and with no HR!)

 I feel like I’m being experimented on with all our “new processes” and I’m drowning. 

Throughout this process, I’ve gotten conflicting messages and just feel like my personality (and not work) has been put under a microscope. 
Before I transferred, my old manager told teammates not to speak to me anymore and said it would have been easier if I just left the company. Both things I was later told “was a joke.”

I didn’t ask to be moved, I appreciated the offer but I never asked for any of this. My new manager and my bosses boss who started this whole thing have been so distant, have barely checked in and it makes me wonder why we even did this in the first place? Im getting work THROWN at me, it’s never ending and I didn’t even get a chance to adjust to my new role and haven’t felt supported after a LONG, MESSY transition. Things have been so heavy and weird and chaotic in my department now. I’ve always been pretty well liked I think and now I feel like I’m being avoided. 

It makes me so anxious, disappointed and I can’t stop overthinking everything. I want to put my best foot forward in this role but now I’m just scared that I’m going to screw it up after SO much effort was put into it. We work remote so relationships already feel so isolated and I feel so alone and like I don’t belong now. 

I’ve mentioned to my new boss a couple times that I’m trying to get my confidence back (I’m not missing any work but I’m not my usual self!) but it’s just been so surface level in response. I really care about my work and I’m super passionate about my field, but I feel like that’s not well received anymore and it would be better if I just shrunk to the smallest size possible and stay out of everyone’s way. 

Is this type of messy transition normal in the corporate world? How can I move forward positively in my new role? I would appreciate any advice or outside perspectives!

1d5fxz0,I dislike my new manager,"I work at a bank (supervisor) & got a new manager in February & everything was fine at first. We got along well, laughed often, got to know each other, & I actually enjoyed her company.. however, she is a needy, VERY co-dependent extrovert while I am an independent introvert who is a team player when I need to be. Our personalities & management styles do not mesh well at ALL. Ever since she got to my branch (I work at a bank), I have sat in her office by her side training her from head to toe. And she wanted my 24/7 undivided attention which I gave to her as long as I could.. until MY work & deadlines started falling behind.. so I asked her if I could possibly be out on the floor more to check my emails & associate with our customers & she took that as disrespect. She also said she feels like I have not been helpful when her & I both know I have done everything I can to help her succeed. I ran my branch flawlessly for 3+ months alone with no manager & one full-time staff member after my other manager quit (she quit because of pay, we actually got along well). New manager is aware of how well I ran the branch alone before she got here, it was expressed to her by senior management. Her first month here, our branch got audited for the first time in two years. I led us to a perfect audit due to my fine attention to detail in reviewing dual-control documentation. She had no part in the perfect audit but took credit for it, & the auditor looked back on things from 2 years ago that my manager wouldn’t have even been able to find in our branch. This new manager is sloppy, has messed up all of my neatness with any and everything in the branch, & makes the same mistakes everyday even after I tell her to write down the correct info. She is incompetent & it takes her 1 hour to do a 5 minute task. She doesn’t know how to run a branch, & lately she has been making comments to our full-time Member Service Representative about how I’m so rude to her/him & how she’s going to “put me in my place.” He told me this because he can’t stand her & wants her gone, she is making him uncomfortable in the branch because she treats him like he’s 2 years old. She is also a micromanager who wants her fingers dipped in everything, even if it does not concern her. She is always up our behinds, all day everyday. I don’t understand. Is she threatened by me?

There’s a lot more to the story but basically I don’t know what to do. Do I ride it out in hopes that she leaves first or I get a position somewhere else? Do I cut my losses & leave to another institution? I have spoken to her on four different occasions willing to compromise. I told her I don’t like sitting in someone else’s office all day, I need space but I’m still always there for her when she has questions. She didn’t like hearing that. Each time we’ve discussed our issues it has gotten worse for me & more awkward everyday. I went to HER boss (I called him behind her back because I can’t take this anymore) & he admires her because he’s the one that hired her, so he didn’t take my concerns that seriously.  He was surprised to hear that she was struggling with basic daily tasks, but he said I should appreciate a manager who wants to be involved/hands on. I don’t know what to do.

1d5eaa9,What are potential options for me for with my career history?,"I have a range of backgrounds and looking for my next move. Could I get suggestions on good exits I could consider? 

In terms of education, I have an MBA in Finance and Bachelors of Electrical Engineering. I did a post-grad certificate for general interest in International Relations and Developmental Economics which I did really well in. I studied Data Science and AI back in 2017 but lost interest, so that's no longer for me.

Here's a summary of background:

* Strategy Consulting Manager
* Associate in Finance
* Program Manager
* Startup Co-founder
* Business Development Manager (R&D)
* Electrical Engineer

Now I don't want to do Program or Project Management. I would love to something in international development or Infrastructure finance but I don't have prior experience so I'd be leaning heavily on transferrable skills. There's Corporate strategy and Corporate Development roles I'm considering as well. Bulge bracket finance was once the dream but I'm in my late 30's and don't have advantage of age anymore.

Is there other opportunities I could consider given my background?",linkuei-teaparty,1,1.0,2,1717214277,2024-06-01 03:57:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d5eaa9/what_are_potential_options_for_me_for_with_my/,6,2024

1d5d3sw,I received a large RSU sum for a now canceled project. Will I be terminated?,"Throwaway account. I (25M) work as an electrical engineer on an advanced process. The business has been unsteady, so to cut costs my division was selected to be transferred out of the country. My team of 15 employees were asked to support the transition project, and that after completion we would be placed in other job functions at the company. As incentive to stay, the company gave us each a large amount of RSUs that vested at the end of the project timeline.

Fast forward and the project has been canceled. As of today, that unvested stock is still in my account and is currently worth $30K. It will fully vest in 4 months. There is no special project clause in the RSU grant, I just need to be employed at the company on the vesting date.

A few questions:
-Can the company revoke these RSUs considering the project is canceled?
-Should we expect targeted layoffs for the individuals who got these large RSU sums? I’m unfamiliar with the company side of RSUs and if that is seen as a big financial loss for them.
-Is there anything I can do? Obviously wait for a large payday, but I can’t shake the feeling that I may never see that day at the company. 

TLDR: I got $30K in RSUs for a now canceled project. It vests in 4 months.",Desperate_Map3756,2,1.0,3,1717210180,2024-06-01 02:49:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d5d3sw/i_received_a_large_rsu_sum_for_a_now_canceled/,6,2024
1d5cxn3,Am I ungrateful ?,"So I (25f) started working for a government sector a little over 3 years ago and 9 months ago I got promoted to a position in a different department after much support and recommendations from my old bosses. I received a 40% raise with the new position as well as significantly bigger responsibilities and tasks. At the time I began I wasn’t aware that my senior coworker “K”, who was training me, would be leaving (they officially left a little under a month ago). After I officially started in the new department they began “cross training me” in their role which they repeated was standard practice. I never questioned it and did cross training and tasks for their position apart from my own. Four months before they were set to go “K” called me into my bosses office and told me they were leaving to which my boss then broke the news that I was their top candidate and would be promoted when “K” left getting an additional 20% raise and even more responsibilities and duties. I was so shocked all I could manage to say at the time was “sounds good”. I continued training and working in my current role but I began to question my abilities. I am new to this department and field of work and felt overall overwhelmed with this new coming change. Ultimately I let them know my concerns and that I no longer wished to be promoted 4 days before my old coworker left. Now I hear whispers about me and I overall am being treated differently. I went to visit my old department and confided in my old boss who then told me I was and had acted ungrateful. I don’t know what to do or if this is a right fit for me anymore. Am I ungrateful?

1d5cqip,Misrepresentation?,"Hey, so this deals with working in the US and the offer of employment that was given to me and ultimately not fulfilled.  

When interviewing for my position, which has tiers, management offered me tier X. When they called to make the offical offer, they changed it to tier Y (substantially less), but just as a 6 month provisional period with an automatic bump to X. 

Unfortunately,  its now 6 months past that mark and nothing. I have a chain of months of emails spanning back to January with Management confirming the deal. Mutliple emails state ""Yes, you're right, we're working on the promotion and will email you next week."" (4 months ago). Talks with managemnt ""Upper managament has been working on your promotion, it should refelct soon"" (months ago). And in person conversations  ""dont think we forgot about your promotion, it should hit the system on *blank* date"" (7 months ago).

I'm consistently being hopelessly run around the ring with false affirmation. I only took this postion based on the original tier that was offered to me. You can imagine how frustrating it may be since i came from a company within the same industry, managament knew i was taking a financial hit to wait the supposed 6 months, but assured me it was just protocol and because of my experience will be automatically bumped as per the tier they said theyd offer me in the interview. Unfortunately i dont have the 6 month period in writing, but months of emails confirming what was offered to me. Being that its 6 months past when i shouldve gotten my raise, im down on what shouldve been thousands of dollars of pay. 

I'm debating if i should jump red tape and include company execs in the emails to make it an issue. Or should i seek legal advice on what my options are on fighting what was a false offer of employment.

The rest of the day I spent most of my time sitting around in the office finding myself with nothing to do. Not being properly trained or guided on my new (important) job by anybody and feeling semi-neglected. 
I showed up today and the part time employee was being trained by the assistant manager (I am replacing the asst. manager it was her last day) on processes that she does. I started wondering why would the girl I am replacing be teaching a part time employee my job tasks? I asked and she said "" I was actually supposed to be the temporary assistant manager until you got hired""  So why am I not being taught these processes now that I've been hired?

The other company who gave me an offer that I turned down, seemed more organized and put together and I am now wondering if I should reach out saying the position I took ended up not being a good fit and if they are still looking to hire I would love to take the position.

I made a mistake by not following up with an internal team about an outstanding ticket for a customer. The customer was looking for an update and my response time was delayed. My manager confronted me about it through slack but after that I felt like I did something really bad.

I also reached out to a client regarding an issue that had already been solved and this resulted in the client emailing back that they already did that step and this process has been super frustrating and they are thinking about switching companies.( our internal team was auditing tickets and I for some reason thought the issue wasn’t resolved when it was and reached out again)

I also had another customer complain about her onboarding experience and say the whole process was confusing.

And lastly a large customer that I was working with was mistakenly flagged as fraud by our fraud team and that created a huge outburst.

I’ve spoken with my coworker regarding the reaching out again to a client and she said she has done it before and we learn from our mistakes.

1d5ayp3,"Graduating College Student please HELP me make a big decision regarding my future career from two job offers
","Hi everyone,

I just finished college, graduating with a degree in Economics, concentrating in Management Information Systems and Quantitative Analysis, with a minor in Statistics and have been looking for jobs for the last few months. I have been working on my CCNA certification and really wanted to get into IT, starting at help desk and hopefully one day working in cybersecurity engineering.

Just out of luck, I now have two job offers at the same exact time but this choice might affect me for the rest of my life as it decides my career path.

-**Job Offer #1: IT Helpdesk ($55,000 /yr)** at a prestigious business management \~ More tedious, difficult workload

**-Job Offer #2: Financial Analyst ($70,000 /yr)** at an aerospace engineering firm \~ Very light workload

Clearly just from the salaries and workload, the financial analyst position seems to be the better choice. I got lucky to have this offered to me because its a family connection. Apparently the workload will be very light and its at an engineering company, so maybe I could one day shift into IT (though, I don't know if it works that way).

I need to make a decision ASAP, and really don't know what to do. I just don't have enough experience or knowledge in either to know what's out there.

How good of a career is finance? I know with IT you can work your way up to something like Cybersecurity engineering and make good money but is a similar salary possible with finance? I genuinely just don't know much about finance or its job demand, or really the demand for IT jobs at higher level position.

**Could someone please guide me on which career can be more lucrative, more in demand, and what is seen as ""better"" for today?**

1d5aj5h,Business intelligence. Job security?,"Career advice for BI folks!

Hi! I wanted to ask some advice from people who have worked in this field. Some backstory, I studied Sociology in college and graduated in 2020, worked non-profit/social work type jobs fora couple years and quickly realized that I would never be able to be comfortable in my (very high cost of living) city, decided on a career change, spend 2-3 years GRINDING and learning how to code, built a portfolio, etc. Started job hunting for primarily SWE but also other techy roles right when 💩 hit the fan with all the tech layoffs lol, and ended up having to work as a receptionist at a large tech/healthcare company. I took that job solely so I could do an internal transfer into the tech side of the company after my 1-yr transfer probationary period was up. And now I’m almost to that 1 year point! 

I discovered that we have a BI department and I am SUPER interested in it. But at this point, my biggest priority with my next role is to pivot into something that will break me out of entry level admin roles and actually help me look desirable to employers so I can have some confidence in my ability to find new jobs. The idea of having a job title on my resume that makes me stand out and actually have recruiters reach out to me on LinkedIn is a DREAM 😂 (other liberal arts major know the struggle lol)

SO my question is- is BI something that allows for job security? The example I keep using for the type of security I’m looking for is an accountant. Once accountants have a year or so of experience as an accountant, they will probably never have a problem finding an accountant job ever again lol. At this point i would even consider accounting just to feel that sense of direction and security in my career haha. Is BI like that? Or is it too niche? If i transfer into BI and work there for a year or so, does that make me look desirable as a Data Analyst or developer as well (at least on paper)? I DREAM to have that kind of flexibility/stability and not just be another replaceable employee with a basic degree. I want to get out of entry level admin jobs SO bad. 

Sorry for the long explanation! Basically just asking if you were to get let go or quit your job in BI would it be very difficult to pick up another BI or data analyst role since you have the BI experience under your belt.",happyhailidayss,1,1.0,2,1717201763,2024-06-01 00:29:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d5aj5h/business_intelligence_job_security/,6,2024

1d5ac1y,What are jobs to think about pivoting to after time in fast food?,"(I truly didn’t mean to ramble here, I am so sorry for this wall of text but I guess I needed to get more off my chest and I apologize to and appreciate anyone who reads this!)

I have a high school diploma, but due to multiple deaths in the family and other ridiculous(ly stupid) familial problems over the years my future plans kept being put on hold. The majority of the blame definitely rests on my shoulders, but we all do/sacrifice what we have to for the good of our families, right?

As far as money goes nannying was the majority of my income for a while (it was the most flexible thing that worked while still being on the home front for my remaining parent and siblings’ needs), and for nearly the last three years I’ve been in fast food. About six or so months in I became a shift leader, about a year or so later I got promoted to assistant manager and now I’m coming on a year in that position.

Without going into all the dumb, minute details, college was never really in the cards for me. I’m not even entirely sure it is now, but mostly due to life’s bullshit I’ve never really felt I had a right to make my life my own outside of my family and think about my own future.

Regardless, I need to change that. Whether it’s community college while I figure out the path I want to take in the long run or something else, I would seriously appreciate suggestions on logical avenues to pivot my work situation in the meantime. I know that no work situation is perfect but it’s definitely time to move on, largely in part due to my direct manager preferring to raze me in front of our crew biweekly (doesn’t matter if it has anything to do with me directly, the store directly or simply just their personal life) because they think that’s the smart play to get people to fall in line (it’s not, without fail every single time a crew has apologized for the manager’s attitude after the fact once he’s walked away, even if it didn’t involve them either).

Aside from that I do really like my job, the pay certainly isn’t the worst yet it’s nothing flashy, but the lack of any kind of benefits has seriously been weighing on me as well.

I realized that I really enjoy working in environments that are more social, but am very much undecided on what that may look like. Teaching is something that I've dabbled in for a long time, but due to the additional education requirements for me to teach full time at an institution. Does anyone have suggestions for roles with my current educational background that may fit better? Would prefer to avoid going back to school for now.",_-1I,1,1.0,0,1717200449,2024-06-01 00:07:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1d5a3ty/i_mightve_picked_the_wrong_degree/,6,2024
