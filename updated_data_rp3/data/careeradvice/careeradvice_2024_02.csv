1b3fh5y,Need guidance on how to approach a career divergence that I am trying to correct.,"Hey everyone, I usually try to do a lot of research on my issues myself but I’m really struggling on how to navigate this predicament that I have fallen into at my current company.  I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this and I can’t seem to get through to my boss.

I was hired by the company in October of 2022 as an Indirect Sourcing Lead.  The title doesn’t neatly fit, but I came for the responsibilities that would lead to career growth beyond the foundations I had built at my prior jobs.  I worked in Procurement as a healthcare buyer with some exposure in contract administration, vendor management, and analytics which I took an interest on the analytics side and wanted to explore that path more.  This job as Indirect Sourcing lead was to handle Medical Supply analytics, cost reduction, purchase oversight, and vendor sourcing.  Those duties were to be 60-70% of my role.  The rest of my time was supposed to be split fairly evenly between Marketing/Sales promotional products sourcing and purchase including management of our warehouse and print associate, and cost reduction efforts in the other various spend categories throughout the company.

During my interview, I feel I was misled by my former boss as there was a question that was asked that I was okay with because I associated it with small companies having employees pitching in on various office tasks here and there.  

“You wouldn’t mind if we asked you to build or move a desk or hang dry erase boards occasionally would you?” 

I nodded and thought this was understandable and would not be much of anything to be concerned about.

My first 2 months, I met with Medical supply vendor and started digging in.  I introduced the company to the concept of a GPO in order to shave some cost off of medical suppies, identified SKUs that had cheaper alternatives that provided the same or better quality, slashed our Shredding and Biohazard waste spend by 50%, and provided monthly supply performance reporting to all of our branches to help encourage more responsible and optimized purchasing.  In between there were a handful of small tasks that would come up, chair needing to be built, desk needed to be moved etc.

Then came the day that started the path that I’ve spiraled down over the last 14 months.  A ticketing queue had been passed over to me upon another staff member being terminated.  Facilities Maintenance.  I had no experience at all with this, but I’m new and thought okay I can handle this until they find someone else.  

This queue turned out to be so time consuming and reactive to emergent situations that I started losing time to properly do my procurement related duties.  I started doing those duties after work hours to maintain.  

Then after this I was tasked with sourcing new property locations and getting involved with real estate contracts and negotiations.  This I was fine with because I was refining a couple procurement skills here fairly regularly.  What I didn’t know was that I would be the sole person involved or responsible in moving an office and opening a new office simultaneously from July 2023 to Oct 2023.  

At this point I am too busy to even process what’s happening and in between, around August, my boss, the VP of Operations had left the company after promoting me to Indirect Sourcing Supervisor.  I thought I was going to take on even more which I did not have the capacity for but I noticed there was no change.  It wasn’t until September towards the end of the office moves I found out that essentially my boss had “delegated themselves out of a job”

Naturally I thought okay, well I’ve been delivering on everything so far, maybe they offer a promotion to Director of Operations(I don’t have the experience yet to jump all the way to VP)  We had a sitdown with Finance in September where this would not happen and the directive was to move me into analytics as they stated I had too much on my plate(I never spoke up about this) and they wanted to get me back to procurement and start branching into analytics to become a spend analyst.  

I was excited about this so I did not contest the change because analytics was one of the paths I wanted to take to get into business analytics.

So the directive was to restructure facilities and office moves to free up my time to get me back to my job description and start growing in my field.  We are now at March and my new boss the Director of Analytics has not helped move the needle since October 2023.  I am now at a point where Facilities consumes 70-90% of my time and Marketing Purchasing is squeezed in between.

A couple of weeks ago my boss during our 1:1 noticed I was frustrated and has been trying to pry my thoughts from me which I withheld because I did not want to express my concerns emotionally.  Last week I spent a long time putting together a well thought out email, explaining my concerns in as professional a way as possible.  My boss has me very low on  their prioritization and spends 90% percent of their time with the 2 existing business analysts, teaching them the new systems they plan to use and has yet to involve me.  

They appreciated the email, and we dug into it.  One of my expressed concerns is that coming in as a Facilities Maintenance person might have created a perception that I am not competent enough to learn analytics.  I asked them to just let me know.  I did not get a straight answer and I did get “from what I see, you don’t pay attention to detail and are not organized,”  I asked where that was seen because they haven’t seen any of my work.  Even facilities they do not know the full extent of what I am doing because they do not pay any attention to my day to day. The other  confusing part is that I hear the opposite from the rest of the organization(and my boss depending on the day).  They also never saw my medical supply work.

So now I’m here with a sinking feeling every day after work wondering what it is that I did that seems to be barring me from learning and being a part of the analytics department and no movement on facilities maintenance which is a divergence of my planned career path.

Please let me know what I’m doing wrong or what I can do to realign my career.  Thank you

The first interview was technical questions, not ""tell me about yourself, strengths weaknesses etc"".

1b3dywk,Wtf am I meant to do with my career now?,"

Apologies for the slightly panicked nature of this post but I’m really unsure what to do. I’m 27. 

I’m a cfd engineer and I have been for the last 2 years. When I took this job I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I knew I liked maths and computers. I knew I enjoyed fluid dynamics at university. And I rather naively thought that as it’s quite a niche and challenging area that i could switch later on if I didn’t like it. 

I did enjoy it initially but now that I’m 2 years in I’m realising there’s not much else I can do. I’ve become a lot more interested in the software since starting but I’m not a software engineer so a lot of those roles seems locked off to me. I have no interest in project management. I don’t like the industry I’m in and only took the role because it was CFD. 

I’m not sure what to do. I spend most of my days panicking about the future and feeling trapped now. 

Can anyone help? Thanks ",Aggressive_Pilot2761,1,0.6000000238418579,14,1709246920,2024-02-29 22:48:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b3dywk/wtf_am_i_meant_to_do_with_my_career_now/,2,2024

1b3dr6d,any advice on what my next move should be?,"Hi all. I'm truly at a loss here and looking for advice that can help me decide what my next move should be. I, 24F, attended community college for 1 year after high school. I went on an academic scholarship program that paid for all my classes and textbooks so long as I agreed to take the max credits possible in a semester and pass every class I took. In my last semester I failed a math class for the second time, displacing me from that program. I was faced with the choice to either pay thousands for my own classes or drop out. At the time I was making minimum wage working at an Applebees and I decided if I was going to pay for my own schooling it should be for something I actually wanted to do. I thought I would seek out a trade school instead because it helped me feel more secure thinking that a certification would lead me directly to a job. 
That led me to go to Esthetics school graduated from esthetics school in 2021 with a certification to practice esthetics in the state of NY. I then started hitting the pavement hard, I must have applied to 100s of esthetics jobs. It was hard to land one because I was very green and didn't have any experience besides my schooling which also happened over peak pandemic time so it effected a lot of the hands on practice I was supposed to get at that school. We ended up learning everything over Zoom, and if you know anything about esthetics or the beauty industry, you know it's very hands on and not something you can learn just from watching someone on a computer screen. Anyway, eventually I did end up landing a job at a laser salon- I was hired to be a receptionist under the premise that with some training and performance evaluations I could eventually move up to a laser technician, my dream esthetics position. I was a receptionist there for 3 months, and by the end of my receptionist position I was fully opening and closing the salon and often covering for the girl who was basically the store manager. I passed my evaluations with flying colors and moved onto the hands on laser training which was overseen by the CEO of that company. I honestly felt the CEO was hostile toward me from our very first meeting, but I tried not to think too much of it. Long story short after performing services on some family and friends (impressively might I add- my first day on the laser I gave my best friend a Brazilian, one of the most difficult areas, and it came out great) and asking a question about the machine she had apparently gone over already, on only my second day of training with her she pulled me to the side at EOD and fired me. Said I was ""too young"" and ""would be good at something else"". I was 22, working since 15,  and it was the first time I had ever been fired in my life. After this I continued to try to land a new esthetics job to no avail. I ended up going back to waitressing and also working part time at a nursing home as a receptionist to make ends meet. 
During this time, a friend of a friend reached out to me about a high paying receptionist position for a law firm; which brings us to my current job. 
I started in January of 2023 at 18 dollars an hour for basic clerical work, answering the phones, making copies, doing light personal assisting tasks for the attorney who owns the firm. After about 3 months, I had moved up to helping the paralegals manage some of the firms personal injury cases and the light personal assisting tasks became a lot heavier and more involved. I also became his ""property manager"" because he owns the building the firm is in and didn't have time to deal with renting the offices out or the tenants and things like rent roll, addressing issues on the property, etc. 
After seeing how much work this job truly entailed I had a talk with the attorney who agreed I wore many hats and gave me a raise to 22/hr. This is the highest hourly wage I have ever earned so I was happy with it. As the months went by my responsibilities began to increase, in August one of the paralegals at the firm left and I absorbed her responsibilities with no raise. They are extremely understaffed here with just him as the sole attorney, one paralegal who is a part time employee working from 9AM-1PM each day, and me. I basically have to do everything the other paralegal doesn't have time to do in addition to still being his personal assistant and managing his property. Recently I am drowning. The past two days I've hysterically cried in the bathroom because the stress of the work I have to do for the files and the firm on top of the work I have to do as his personal assistant is simply not manageable for one person. He comes to my desk and gives me 2-3 extremely intensive projects in a day when I still haven't finished my work from the previous day and it's a never ending horrible cycle. My boss is a very nice guy but he tends to think everything is 123 easy, and doesn't seem to really have a full grasp on everything that's on my plate. In other words if I were to up and quit tomorrow, he would have no idea why. Unfortunately I feel my time at this firm is coming to a close because I know he is strapped with money right now and won't give me a raise, and even if he were to bump my pay it doesn't fix the issue of we are lacking the man power to truly manage our workload. He simply will not hire anyone else because he doesn't want to spend to. This job was a really great experience for me and I learned a ton about being a property manager, law, and even real estate as he does that on the side and I help him with it. However, I've never had any interest in going into law. Real estate is a maybe. 
So now that i've stated my history, to sum it up I have 
-Waitressing experience 
-Bartending experience 
-Office manager experience
-Law clerk experience 
-Property management experience
-some real estate experience (not a lot) 
-Receptionist (and security- at the nursing home I was responsible for monitoring cameras on the premises as well as manning entry gate on day and overnight shifts) experience 
-Personal Assistant experience 

Personally I am someone who, like a lot of people, simply does not dream of labor. The ideal job for me is something easy where I can clock in and clock out without the stresses of the day following me home. I am very adaptable having worked in so many different types of jobs and good at picking things up quickly / learning as I go. I'm pretty good with technology and problem solving as well. I'm not exactly a people person but my time in the service industry and at this firm has equipped me enough to be good at talking to people. In 2020 I also suffered from a knee injury which makes standing for long periods of time difficult and kinda takes waitressing and bartending off my list of options. In order to upkeep my rent and bills I need to make at least 20 an hour and that'll be just scraping by. I was thinking of some jobs like data entry, quality control, or captioning videos, but I have no idea how to get into these fields or how much they pay. My real interests are writing, photography, and music but im not musically inclined so I love making playlists and curating. I kinda accepted long ago that none of my hobbies will make me money and i'm OK with that. I'm honestly open to anything but this job is very high stress and i'm looking for exactly the opposite. I do have the option of venturing back into esthetics and do plan on renewing my license in 2025, but man is it brutal out there in the field. 
I am open to any anecdotes or advice on what to do. Sorry for the very long post and thank you in advance. ",TimelyDebt,1,1.0,0,1709246403,2024-02-29 22:40:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b3dr6d/any_advice_on_what_my_next_move_should_be/,2,2024

1b3cly8,Is this passive-aggressive behavior or not?,"Hi everyone. Thanks in advance for any advice/opinions.  
  
I recently resigned from a job at a company and since my services were valuable and much-needed there (I was doing what amounts to 3-4 people's workload), they offered me a deal where I'd continue offering my services to them as a freelancer. The supervisor in charge of this situation has yet to send me the new contract. Since I resigned almost 2 months ago, she keeps sending me e-mails wherein she says the contract will be sent to me ""by end of this week"" or ""early next week"" or ""sometime next week,"" only for that week to pass and to hear no word from her, except for the next e-mail in which she makes the same statement, without an apology for the unexplainable delay, I might add.  
  
Said supervisor has a tendency for jealousy and passive-aggression. I won't get into detail, but suffice it to say that for a myriad of reasons I do not consider her a perfectly fair/neutral individual in the workplace.  
  
My question is this: is this not disrespectful behavior? Especially considering this very individual's insistence on respecting deadlines (I almost never missed mine, but she always made it a point to bring up the importance of deadlines), and of getting things done when we say we will. It's gotten to the point of ridiculousness. The draft contract I signed weeks ago was dated for end of January, and there's nothing to wait for. Again 2 weeks ago, I received another e-mail saying I would receive the contract by end of week last week or at the very latest, early this week. It's almost Friday now. I have a hunch she is going to repeat the cycle.  
  
At this point, I am considering telling them to forget about it. I know for a fact that they need my services, and that she is most likely being spiteful for as long as she can afford to, before #2 hits the fan. I live in a North American city where meaningless power trips in the workplace are sadly the norm.  
  
However, I know that pride tends to be my ""deadly sin"", so I'd like some outside opinions regarding this strange communication style. Should I let it go and keep collaborating with these people, or are there other fish in the sea? Has anyone experienced something like this -- is this a known form of passive-aggression/power tripping via e-mail?

1b3c0um,Challenges with New Job - help!,"  
I recently started a new job a few weeks ago, and so far, I haven't received any complaints about my work (yet). I use ""yet"" because I have a feeling that issues may arise soon.  
  
As a remote worker, I frequently appear on camera for clients. Behind me is a newly painted white wall with nothing on it, which seems to bother my CEO immensely. He consistently advises me to do something about the blank wall, claiming it looks unprofessional to potential clients. Interestingly, he conducted my interview with the wall in the background and still hired me. Now, I notice him nitpicking at other minor details, and I fear it will only worsen. He claims not to micromanage, yet he expects unrealistic contact updates and rarely allows me the chance to focus on my work.

1b39t4m,Tech Company or Higher Seniority?,"I am in the job market and trying to decide what is better between two scenarios (the specifics of salary/benefits mostly being equal):

* Take a role that just sounds ""okay"" interest-wise, but is at a well-known tech company (not one of the mega-companies, but a niche product doing very well)
* Take a role that seems more enriching for me personally, and is a promotion up to an executive level... but at a health insurance company.

I'm struggling with this because on one hand, tech seems to be the way to go. I assume I can move around and up if I do well, but I also know that doesn't always happen and fear getting ""stuck"" in a job I might not like just to be able to say I worked at a tech company.

1b38zao,Social Anxiety is ruining my chances at finding a career… feeling like a failure and unhireable,"26F, I’ve struggled with SA for as long as I can remember. My parents raised me well and they had good careers, but I feel like a complete failure and feel like I’ve let them down 😭 I completed my Bachelors in Fine Arts (useless degree) and got into Web Design shortly after. I was lucky to have found a remote job in tech during the pandemic, but only making $37K and I’ve been stuck here now for 3 years.

Financially, I’m stressed  and worried for my future. Tech is now oversaturated because ever since the pandemic, everyone wants to get into this field. My social anxiety has spiralled and I am horrible and embarrassing at interviews and I have accepted I’m unhireable. I am taking Zoloft though. Are there any decent paying careers that exist out there for shy introverted people that suffer severe social anxiety?

1b3764t,Which offer should I take? (HELP!),"I am a 22m in a HCOL and have received two separate offers on which I am struggling to decide. I have my Series 65.

$7B AUM firm: 

Base pay: $65k 
Bonus: $9k 
Total Comp: $74k 
Great Benefits 
Hybrid Work Environment 
Better title
Better location 

My biggest concern with this opportunity is that I’m not totally sure if I can do the job. I don’t want to join the firm and then they realize I’m not great and let me go after 6 months. I would be in a support role for an advisor which may not sound too bad but it has its difficulties. 

Fidelity: Financial Rep 

Base pay: $50k 
Bonus: $7k
Total comp: $57k 
Great benefits 
In-office only 
Has overtime
More prestigious (looks better on resume) 

Important to note that this is not a call center job, I would be working in the branch welcoming people and helping with basic things. Everyone who I have met here seems great, conversely, I almost feel as if I’m above this job as terrible as that may be to say. 

I’m aware that on its face, the $7b RIA seems like a no-brainer. But I am concerned with job security and am aware Fidelity has a reputation for treating its employees well. Additionally, I have already accepted the Fidelity offer and would have to back out of it, not sure if I like the idea of burning that bridge.

Would love any opinions from a 3rd party individual. I have to make a decision ASAP and freaking out a little. Thank you so much!

Today a former manager that I enjoyed working with offered me a contract position on her team with the caveat that this position has the potential to turn permanent (no promises obviously).

1b35rmx,"I received an offer for a job that pays a little more than my current, but I am not sure that I want to leave?","I use to work for a company 6-7 years ago, but the Managing Directors at the time sold the business to our competitor and I had to relocate to another office, which was 1 hour away from my home and in the end, I quit that job. One of the Managing Directors of the sold company has recently become the new Managing Director of another company in the same industry. He wants me to leave my current job and to come work for him and he has offered me a 7% higher salary compared to what I currently earn (every little helps in this current economy...?). If I accept, I will not have to worry about him potentially selling the business again because the business is owned by another multi-million pound company because they bought it over a decade ago so that clears up those scary 'what if he tried selling it again' thoughts. I would not say I am best friends with this man, but I have a strong feeling that if he retires within the next 10 years (he's coming into his late 50s), I may find myself having the opportunity to move up into a higher position because he knows me and likes me (he doesn't know anyone or like anyone at his new company because he has only just took it over).  
I am fairly happy at my current job, I get to finish at 16:30pm every day which helps my commuting time because I beat the 5pm traffic. If I am behind on my work, I get the luxury to stay behind on weekdays or come in during weekends to catch up to earn overtime. I get on very well with all my colleagues. My job is only stressful when I have lots to do and fall behind, like any other job. The building I work in is very modern and luxurious. If I was to leave my current job, the company would suffer for 6-12 months because there is a lack of staff and I manage customers with an annual turnover of £2.5 million. I am sure they would get by eventually, but if I left then they would be in a bit of trouble for a few months. Someone else from my office is training to change job positions to make it even worse for them.  
I have been reading online that opening up to my employer to see if they will offer me more money to stay is a bad idea and 9 times out of 10, accepting a counteroffer from my current employer will lead to me being forced out or leaving within the next 12 months anyway?  
A 7% increase will not sound like a lot because it's only £2000 more, but I am trying to save as much money as possible to move out within the next 1 year (first time buyer) so that is all I am focussed on at the moment, the money side of things.  
How can I play my previous Managing Director to see if he will offer me anymore money, before I talk to my current employer about potentially leaving? I want him to be able to offer me maybe £4000-£5000 more to make it worthwhile, but I am not sure he will be able to because of the wage structure in his new company? I think I messed up when I went to chat to him, I just told him that he needed to match my current salary which is £30,000 (I'm on less than that.). He originally wanted to offer me £28,500 and that he is doing me a favour by offering me £30,000 because no other person in the department I would be working in is on that salary. Taking on a role at this new company will mean finishing at 17:30pm and having a longer commute time because I will be stuck in traffic trying to get home. I must add that the miles is the same distance as my current job and I will not be paying more or less in petrol costs/car wear and tear.  
Has anyone ever been in a situation like this before? Did you speak to your current employer at the time and did they offer you more money to stay, how did it work out after you accepted their counteroffer? Are you still working there now or did you have target on your back for not being trustworthy anymore? What should I do about asking the new job offer to see if I can squeeze any more money out of them to make leaving worth my time and effort for the unknown?

The gov role would be working for the tax collector/DMV, doing things like renewing registration, driver license, tag transfers etc. They are offering $17.50/HR and includes health insurance options, retirement vested after 5 years, PTO, paid holidays etc. the usual local government package. My commute is about 5 minutes, no tolls. 

The bank role would have me doing bank teller duties and more. This branch mainly focuses on businesses and less personal banking. They are offering $21/HR, paid holidays, 401k matching, health insurance options, PTO etc. My commute would be about 30 minutes (longer with traffic) and $2 in tolls each day.

Health insurance costs like $90 per check from bank and like $7 from county/DMV so that’s something to take in consideration too.

1b357kr,My boss gave me drugs (likely by accident) - how do I bring it up?,"My boss gave me a small chocolate bar for my birthday a few days ago. She just put it on my desk without saying anything. We work in a very professional environment. She is in her late 40s and I just turned 30. 

The packaging was basically identical to the packaging of the actual chocolate brand. It was an edible. I don't eat chocolate, so I gave it to my husband. He ate it all because like I said, it had the name of an actual chocolate brand on it. It turns out it was 500mg of THC!!!!

We are in Canada and weed is completely legal where we are. My husband and I do enjoy the occasional edible, but we are lightweights and can't do more than 5mg at once. An edible with 500mg would have to be sold at an illegal store since all of the government stores sell edibles with no more than 10mg in a pack. Plus, they always have special logos on the packages and would NEVER sell one with the same name as an actual chocolate brand. 

My husband had a hell of a night (this was 2 nights ago). He was throwing up for hours, had panic attacks, was shaking, couldn't walk. After a couple of hours, he went to sleep and when he woke up felt 80% better. But he remained sort of high for about 24 hours. He's completely over it now and back to normal though. And we are laughing about it now. 

I \*highly\* doubt my boss knew it was an edible. She does live with a teenage son and I am wondering if it came from him. But how should I bring it up to my boss (if I should??). Should I text her? Should I meet in person? I have severe social anxiety so even talking to her is very stressful! I definitely feel more comfortable texting but is it appropriate to do over text?

i considered pretty much every major at this point. i’ve taken a variety of different classes besides psychology, imagined myself in every field. i was once interested in psychology (a bit?), food science, animal science, business, all of which i decided isn’t for me. i was even in the exploratory studies program until this semester, but clearly the program didn’t help me all that much. i transferred into art studies (wasn’t competitive to get into) and at first i was just happy to have a major, and now i’m just depressed. art studies i’m sure is great, but it’s not as art heavy as i was hoping, i guess. the one thing i didn’t try to consider this entire time was design and art, and it’s probably because i didn’t think i would be good enough/ the program is pretty competitive. plus, this kind of thing depends on skill. i know im artistic, certainly a creative person without doubt, but i can’t say i’m like, really skilled because im sure the other students are. i’ve never even made a portfolio. i decided that i could potentially take design classes over the summer, but it depends on if i get the on campus job or not (i don’t have a car). and, even if i take the classes over the summer and absolutely love it, i would have to get into the program, which wouldn’t happens until the middle of my junior year. and getting into the program might not even happen in the first place if my portfolio is bad. i would have to take another year or two of school, is it worth being in debt? i’m going to be an RA , which will help, but i fear debt. i have all the credits to be a psych major, all i would have to do is take one math class and i’m guarenteed in. i would also graduate on time with pysch.

They offer specializations in the second/last year, and I'm trying to decide between the one that has more job prospects + higher salary (epidemiology, $60kish starting) or the one I dream about and am incredibly passionate about (health policy and ethics, $50kish starting). 

Background: I'm about to graduate with my nursing degree in April. I'm planning on working for a year to gain firsthand experience in the healthcare system and then pursuing my MPH, and will graduate with no student loans. I have an incredible safety net (upper-middle-income + generous parents) and my partner currently makes 60k/year in marketing. We live in a MCOL city, so both salaries (60k epidemiology and 50k health policy) are very liveable with our current expenses, and if I pursue what I'm passionate about we'll still be able to save 30-40% of our net income. The jobs in health policy are fairly scarce, but I'm planning on working weekends as a nurse during my Master's to maintain my skills, so I'll have an okayish-paying job to fall back on while I job search. 

Right now I'm leaning towards the specialization in the thing I'm passionate about, as I have a good safety net + a backup job if I don't find a job right out of my Master's. What are your thoughts?

I've got a semi-complicated situation that I would love some advice on. In order to circumvent an inevitable termination, I elected to resign from my job a few weeks ago.

Do I tell the hiring manager after receiving my offer that I was just laid off and can start immediately? Do I tell them to not contact my current employer and just provide them recent pay stubs and W2s? Do I just say nothing and proceed with the background check, assuming that a gap of a few days wouldn't be flagged?

I am pretty ignorant on how background checks work, so I'm not sure if it would even update in the system by the time the check is run. Obviously, after March 1st, I will no longer be telling prospective employers that I am still employed, but as of now I am.

Any advice on how I should handle this? Don't want to get bitten in the ass here.

1b326ql,Political Career,"Hello Folks
I am in need of advice, but have no one in my life I think could grasp this internal dilemma I'm facing. 

I work at a start up political consulting firm currently. It pays significantly below market value, but treats me well. I am salary, but more often than not, I work less than 40 hours per week. It's hybrid, but i work mostly remote, I have unlimited vacation, and I have a real say in company policy. I love the job, but my boss/the owner recently told me that if he knew what he knows now, he wouldn't have hired me for my position. He wants me to have experience that I don't have enough of so I can work with clients and add value to the consulting team.

The reason I don't have the experience he wants is that I have never been a campaign manager for a major congressional or senate race. I have run state races, and I've run national field campaigns. So I have significant experience in the political sphere. I even advise people who are running for Congress anf Senate... but I have never been in charge of a huge race for a federal seat.

So he has encouraged me to apply for positions within those kinds of races. All while promising I can come back to the company when the election cycle is over. He also said it's OK if I decide not to pursue a campaign manager job this election cycle. If I can, great. But if I don't want to, or there isn't anyone hiring, then it's totally fine and I can stay with the company. I just won't be eligible for promotions.

Here is my dilemma. 

I completed my second interview for a congressional race in Michigan yesterday. The candidate has to make ot through primaries, which happens in August. So it's a minimum of 6 months. If she makes it past primaries, I work until November in Michigan.

I currently live in Arizona. So the whole time I would need an Airbnb for myself and my two dogs. So even though it pays $10k/yr more than my current job, that additional income would be eaten by high costs of housing. But it would get me the experience my firm wants.

I also have been offered a job with a firm I used to work with. They want to hire me as a training director, so I can train all of their new employees throughout Arizona. It pays about $10k less than what my current job pays, but has added benefits. Like full health coverage, a free rental vehicle, free gas, a company card, cell phone reimbursement, and more. It's also my passion to train people. I don't get to train people in my current role, but I did design the training curriculum and do training if I am needed. But with the offered role, my whole job would be to train all day everyday which I love.

The training director role is kind of a step back in my current career trajectory, but could be a step forward if I wanted to pursue a career in training instead of managing, which I would love.


So what do I do?

Stay with my underpayment firm for another two years with no opportunity to advance. (This could mean I actually hire and train my own boss.)

Temporarily move across the country for 6-9 months and actually lose money while gaining experience?

Change my career trajectory and take a significant pay cut?

1b31qyl,Salary adjustment and/or raise?,"
Hi everyone,

F31 I work for a corporation that operates in the travel industry. Full-time and fully remote contract based in Italy. My role involves setting up the product and performing content editing before it goes on sale through various channels.

Background: I've had bad experiences with small Italian companies in the tourism sector, so when their offer came a year and a half ago, I didn't even negotiate, as I needed to leave behind a period of burnout and stress.

The first year went very well, with a good year-end review (5/5) and a small salary increase based on performance (they say), but in reality, we all received it. Increase of around 6.8% gross. I don't know what the increase was for other colleagues.

Nevertheless, I've always felt I wasn't paid enough because I didn't negotiate at the beginning. I discussed it with my line manager, who is very calm, and she told me she couldn't provide information on others' salaries, but if I had such information and brought it to her attention, she would have to report it to the global manager and they would have to consider an adjustment.

So I did: I compared my paycheck with that of a colleague who joined a month before me, with the same role and type of contract. Turns out I earn €727 less per year than my colleague. (Base salary).

Currently, the company has enrolled me in an e-learning program where I have the opportunity to learn HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript. (Market value of €728, price for private clients, not for companies.) I should finish the program by the end of April, after which there may be shadowing opportunities, but it's not guaranteed that I will change roles. Throughout the program, I have the opportunity to dedicate 50% of my time to study, and I continue to be paid 100%.

As I mentioned, there is a mid-year review in April and an end-of-year review in October. There are no bonuses. There may be a salary review at the end of the year based on the company's growth. (Although last year, HR said that performance evaluations were also taken into consideration, and this was new even for my manager.)

Considering all the above information, I would like to ask for advice on how to better leverage my time and work within the company. I would also like to understand if I am justified in feeling somewhat undervalued or if I should feel more fortunate, considering everything.

Option 1: Request a salary adjustment immediately.

Option 2: Request a salary adjustment during the mid-year review in April and request a raise during the final review in October.

As I mentioned, I come from fairly toxic small Italian companies, and I am not at all used to negotiating or realizing my worth sometimes. My fear is that if I ask for a salary adjustment, I may not be able to ask for anything else during the fiscal year because I have already been given something.

Thank you all for reading this far. ",misunderstesa_,1,1.0,0,1709217291,2024-02-29 14:34:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b31qyl/salary_adjustment_andor_raise/,2,2024

1b2z7wy,Weird Job Market ,"This job market is so weird and confusing.  

In early 2023, I was casually looking for jobs. After 5 years with a company I had NO problems with and a job and coworkers that i loved,  I decided to have the bright idea that I should explore more opportunities and gain new experience. 

Well, that was The WORST choice I could have made. I found a textbook toxic work place. This is the most unsafe and uncomfortable work environment that I have ever experienced. What is so annoying was that on my interview, I was asking what was the work culture like? What kind of expectations do you have as a boss. I was telling them that i loved my job but probably should explore. Everyone on that interview lied. As I am sure they would...it's an interview. 

So, I am back in the job market. But what is weird about the job market is last year, I had so many interviews some even getting to the final round. I actually I had a job offer right before I took this position at the toxic work place and I turned it down because the toxic people out bid them. 

Anyway Last year so many interviews. Now, since October 2023... only rejection letters and like 5 interviews?!. I was comparing my calendar from 2023 and 2024. I had at least 2 interviews a week. Now I can't even buy an interview. What is crazy is that I have an even better job title with an even more reputable company. I was sure people would jump to get me. But... what is going on! Everyone is hiring... I can even get an interview. And now this time, I am actually seriously looking for a job. I need to get out of this job Fast.

1b2x1ww,What skill to develop to the maximum that can be worth to the short term too ?,"(I might post this message on various subs to get as many opinions as possible. Sorry for the long post)  
  
Hi, I'm a 20-year-old student currently enrolled in a program that I'm not particularly fond of. I plan to switch my field of study next year, but that's a minor detail. For about a year now, I've been doing some basic freelancing work like editing, translation, voice-overs, etc. It's worth noting that I'm French, so I mainly leverage that aspect. While it's fun, the income is insufficient and quite unstable.  
  
I have a huge passion for cybersecurity, which I have finally started to delve into. However, I'm just at the beginning. I read a lot about this topic and practice on websites like TryHackMe, but I'm still a beginner (though passionate!!). A few months ago, in an effort to secure better jobs on platforms like Upwork, I noticed that copywriting skills were in high demand. I was intrigued by the marketing thought process behind writing, so I started to educate myself in this area. I took some courses and read books on the subject, but my practice has been minimal because I was focusing on my courses and the prescribed textbooks. I quickly realized that copywriting is a challenging skill to master and would take time. Honestly, I'm not particularly passionate about copywriting, but learning it has proven useful in many areas and remains a valuable skill.  
  
Here lies my dilemma: in a few months, I'll need to contribute more than I currently do to help my parents keep my apartment for my studies. Therefore, I'm seeking freelance jobs that could be either part-time or involve recurring tasks. I'm interested in freelancing because I love the flexibility it offers, which is perfect alongside my studies. I'm aware of the option of taking a traditional part-time job, but I'm posting here to get advice and insights since I'm someone who loves to learn and is motivated.  
  
Considering that I have my studies and dedicate the other half of my day to learning a new skill, which one should I focus on: cybersecurity or copywriting? Note that I'm not expecting to become an expert in a few months, as that's simply not feasible. However, is it possible, by working hard on one of these skills, to land small or even decent beginner-friendly gigs that don't require a lot of expertise after a few months or years? I'm not looking for a significant income but rather something that could provide a supplement while continuing to learn something I love.  
  
I have a strong preference for cybersecurity, but it seems more complicated to freelance in this field, especially difficult to find gigs as an absolute beginner, even for minor tasks. I'm not particularly fond of copywriting, but since I have some basics, maybe I could manage to find something after a few months of learning.  
  
I would appreciate your sincere advice and ask that you not suggest just taking a regular student job. Lastly, I will take your advice seriously and am very motivated.  
  
Thank you for reading and for your advice! :)",Seacrafter6578,1,1.0,0,1709201829,2024-02-29 10:17:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b2x1ww/what_skill_to_develop_to_the_maximum_that_can_be/,2,2024

I have been with my current company for close to 2 years now and I have managed to really gain some good credit amongst the management. My manager knows that I am a product expert now and has been providing me woth really huge opportunities. I have really enjoyed working with this firm, but there is one thing that always makes me feel uncomfortable. I see people being let go of every now and then due to performance issues, which is fair, but this happens without any prior notice or placing the employee in a performance improvement plan. Please keep in mind this is not a huge firm (100-120 ppl) and the management is really bad with confrontations or people/ conflict management overall. But they have no qualms accepting this and don’t mind me intervening to resolve some issues for them (I was a people manager for a few years and I am fairly good at conflict resolution).

But, the company is soon going to start processing for my Visa and I feel like I should give them a headsup about my pregnancy as if it is anytime after June, I won’t be able to travel. I made all these arrangements with family so far because I know that no one else here is eligible for the business visa to this country ( very strict rules and a lot of clearance which I already got). But, I am worried if my company will use this as an opportunity to let go of me instead of them having to pay me during my 6 months paid maternity leave. Though I am confident anout my capabilities and ownerships here, I still feel they may do what seems best for them in terms of money (that’s the pattern I have noticed here). What do I do?

The gov role would be working for the tax collector/DMV, doing things like renewing registration, driver license, tag transfers etc. They are offering $17.50/HR and includes health insurance options, retirement vested after 5 years, PTO, paid holidays etc. the usual local government package. My commute is about 5 minutes, no tolls. 

The bank role would have me doing bank teller duties and more. This branch mainly focuses on businesses and less personal banking. They are offering $21/HR, paid holidays, 401k matching, health insurance options, PTO etc. My commute would be about 30 minutes (longer with traffic) and $2 in tolls each day.

Health insurance costs like $90 per check from bank and like $7 from county/DMV so that’s something to take in consideration too. My family is telling me that government role is the way to go but I’m looking for some other insights and opinions. Thanks!

1b2qydi,"Successful 18F double major looking for more of a enviro/science background, any ideas?","Hi! This might be too long/too much info but I appreciate any of you who are willing to give any input.

I’m currently 18F, working for an environmental company that uses food waste to make carbon negative fuel (just hired), pays well and I get to travel a bit too which is cool. I am double majoring (social science concentration in law & policy//strategic communication concentration in research & analytics and in a remote undergrad program at a top 15 (US) university. 

I started working for a senator at 16 as an actual staffer (not an intern or page) and did that for two years while being senior staff on 3 political campaigns and doing a lot of volunteering, am on two nonprofit boards and founded a local and a state wide environmental nonprofit. I also proposed & wrote two bills (not enviro related). I graduated junior year from high school but just worked full time for the senator and then was hired for a year to run two smaller nonprofits (and paid to write one of the two bills) but left after that to pursue more environmental issues.

For better or for worse, I am a very career oriented person and want to work in the international environment and climate sphere (or space). In my ideal future, I would pursue a dual JD/PhD, the only issue is that they would not be in environmental science or adjacent science fields. 

I don’t want to be a policy writer or academic on environmental policy with no background in science and am trying to find a way to accomplish that without getting another bachelors (doctorate isn’t an option since my last math class was calc junior year). 

I was thinking about finishing my undergrad in 3 years to spend a year doing a masters before phd but would want it to be remote because of my current living situation, only able to move after the traditional four years. Also masters are expensive and I still don’t have experience in undergrad or proper math and science classes even though I could work hard to try and pass but likely with mediocre grades. 

Any ideas? **How can I consider myself an expert in environmental science so I feel comfortable using my policy expertise to specialize on that?** I know I can do my dissertation and focus in the doctorate program on that but just looking for alternatives routes that I haven’t considered.

1b2po1k,Can you still get a job in Tech?,"You can still get a job in Tech.  
Many people believe they need to leave the tech industry. Others feel disappointed they were pushed into STEM. Many of you are too young to remember, and I was a kid during the 90s, but remember when everyone was a mainframe programmer? And then no one needed a mainframe programmer, but people who were really passionate about tech stayed in tech. They just got different tech skills.  
If you are one who's interested in tech, one who's excited about new, emerging technologies, there will always be a job for you in Tech. If you are someone who went into tech because you thought you'd make a lot of money, easy and quickly - It is probably best to find something you actually like.  
If you find yourself laid off today and you want to push through, think about two things: What is in demand? What is interesting to me?  
I would take a strong look at these areas - Cybersecurity, AI, and tech in healthcare.  
And yes, soft skills are more important than ever. And if you're REALLY good at soft skills, there are always tech sales! And that can be very, very financially rewarding.

1b2m23m,Is it normal for an employer to request a final interview in-person but not pay for the flight to their headquarters? Is this a red flag?,"Hi - I’m a senior in college applying for jobs and I recently applied for a business development position at a small company (around 50 employees). The job is located in Chicago while I’m currently in Boston - a recruiter reached out to me to apply since the industry that the company works in is kind of niche and I have internship experience in it.

I went through two rounds of interviews over the past couple of weeks - a zoom interview with the recruiter/HR person and one zoom interview with the business development manager. I got an email earlier today from their HR saying that they were impressed with both of my interviews and resume and wanted to invite me to an in-person interview in their office in Chicago. The email also gave a specific day for the in-person interview (it’s on a random Thursday next month). I emailed them back enthusiastically accepting the interview and asking about the logistics of the trip. More specifically, I asked if they were able to reimburse my travel accommodations (flight costs, hotel booking, etc.) They said they don’t typically cover the cost of travel for candidates and are unable to reimburse the trip.

I’m new to the corporate world, but is it normal for a company to invite a candidate for an in-person interview without paying for travel costs? It seems like a red flag to me but my parents (who are immigrants and unfamiliar with corporate American culture) said I should go. I just can’t help but feel if a company is too cheap to pay for travel expenses, they’ll probably screw me over financially if I end up working for them. 

Obviously I’m not trying to be entitled and I know the job market is a bit tough right now. I’m grateful to be getting interviews but I also don’t want to work for a company who expects a college student to miss class to travel for an interview on their own dime - especially when the flight and hotel costs hundred of dollars.

she is subosed to show me how things is done and review my work before submission etc.  


but I have noticed that she always make stupid excuses to submit my work I don't know maybe this is the  firm policy that seniors submit the work.  


for example she tells me  send me the work to check it before submision then she submits it, or tells me we will review the work with our manager later today and waits till I leave and clock the 8 hrs and goes to the manager or call him and review and submit the work without me and when he asks about me oh he left !!

also in 2 ocassians she literally claimed to the manager behing my back that my work is hers and I offcourse corrected the manager.

1b2l85x,Higher Ed Admin Assistant ,"Hi there would love some advice on how to deal with this. I’m an admin assistant for an English language program that runs at two separate community colleges under each of their Workforce Development departments. We had a division meeting today for one of the colleges where I found out the entire workforce division at one of these colleges has about a third of the number of students and five times the support staff. I can only assume the other community college we service has similar stats as they are about the same size. I’ve essentially been doing the job of five people. I’ve been feeling pretty burnt out recently, and today was definitely the last straw. I really like my coworkers - the faculty and other staff are super sweet and love the mission of working with new American citizens and refugees etc - but I’m not comfortable with the workload and compensation. I’ve been at this position a little under a year and have previously worked in more corporate environments as an operations specialist and business analyst. I chose this admin job because I was having a baby and didn’t want to work the usual 60 hour weeks in a stressful corporate environment. How do I navigate expressing my concerns to leadership? Or is it just a dead end and I should start looking to move on.

Which I did pretty easily online. The difficult part is step 2  
  
2. Obtain 1,000 hours of supervised appraisal experience over a minimum of six months.  
  
This has been almost impossible for me to do. It’s been hard enough finding licensed appraisers, and all the ones I do find I’ve reached out to via Facebook or email and they said they don’t want to supervise anyone and weren’t interested.

1b2khob,Seeking Advice: Struggling to Learn and Grow in Current Sales Role,"Hey everyone,  
  
23M in British Columbia, Canada, and I've been working at a small business (15 employees) for the past 6 months as a BDR/Implementation Specialist. My role involves 50% sales and 50% operations in the health care tech industry (B2B) where we deal with both hardware and software. The company has some promising patents and is on a growth trajectory.  
  
Before this job, I had just a year of sales experience in the fitness industry (B2C). However, since starting here, I haven't received any training or guidance, which is something I was really hoping for at this stage in my sales career. Initially, I started with prospecting and outreach, but after a month, I was shifted to focus solely on operations due to the company hitting sales capacity (significant projects lined up from Q2-Q4 - I'm mainly helping ramp up for those).  
  
My issue is that I feel like I'm not learning anything new. I joined this company to grow my sales skills and experience, but I've been thrown into an operations role with a low salary (40k) with no potential for commission. While the company has great potential, I find myself with a low workload and struggling to stay engaged.  
  
I'm torn on what to do next. Should I ask for a compensation revision, or is it time to start looking for a new opportunity? I really want to learn and progress in my sales career.

1b2k4gn,"Fired right before 1 month mark, could not get a reason","So, I just started working remotely at a startup 3.5 weeks ago as a senior software engineer. I only had one coworker in my department, who I felt despised me right from minute 1. As for the entire company, I am the only one not part of their clique. They all either knew each other before this or had mutual acquaintances. I have only had positive feedback about my work ever since I got there, with the sole exception of one time a couple weeks ago, my boss told me he would have rather I had prioritized some other issue today than the one I did. However, the sole coworker in my department really disliked me, and I know he and my boss always spoke in private, because many times they would reference something that was new to me, I would mention that I hadn't heard that, and they would say something to the effect of ""Oh sorry, we should've updated you on that, yeah him and I decided on that the other day, etc"". I even met with the CEO last week while at a conference, and felt like it went great.  
So today, I get asked if I can join a video call, and I am told I am being let go. I ask why and they just say ""Uhh... well just... 'general fit'"". And more than once I asked them to elaborate, and they would say ""that's all we are prepared to say right now"". And then told me they'd be more than happy to be references (an offer which I will not be taking them up on).  
I asked my recruiter if he heard why, he told me that 2.5 weeks ago he heard that my coworker and I ""weren't getting along and they would talk to me about it and see what happened from there"", even though as I said, I was consciously making sure that I was nice to him and that the contempt was not mutual. And they never ""talked with me about it"". And my coworker was a slightly less senior engineer than I was. I also turned down an offer from another company to take this job. It should be noted that I am 31, male, and I have never had problems with a coworker before; I have always been professional with my coworkers and able to get along with anyone.  
Should I reach out via email in a day or two and ask for feedback from them? Maybe there was some performance issue my boss didn't feel like confronting me about? Or should I really just assume I was fired because my one coworker didn't like me so they got rid of me?  
Or is it normal for companies to not give a real reason if the firing is within the first month? I know if they kept me 2 more days they would've had to pay my recruiter. It just makes it much harder having to re-enter the job market without a real reason for losing this job.",Extreme_Hall1255,1,0.33000001311302185,2,1709160654,2024-02-28 22:50:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b2k4gn/fired_right_before_1_month_mark_could_not_get_a/,2,2024

Hey!
I graduated a month ago and I received an offer from a Big4 firm to go in a team that focuses on Due Dilligence, M&A, Valuation and Restructuralization. It is heavy in corporate finance.

I don t have much experience in this field, I have done some finance/accounting courses at uni but that s it. I cannot say that I enjoyed them a ton or that I was very good at them.

Based on the interviews/case studies that I made for them, I was told that depsite gaps in finance and numerous mistakes I have potential and that I had the best results compared to other candidates.

Should I take this opportunity? 
I feel that I should learn finance to be competitive in the future in higher management roles but on the other hand I am worried that I will not succeed as it s distant from the fields I worked in and the skillset I have.

1b2jfmd,How do I choose between money or time?,"27M here.... I'm currently working a sales job with great compensation. I'm able to afford my living expenses and save a decent amount of money every paycheck. However, all good things come with a catch. 

Although I am making good money, the work hours and pressure at work are really starting to wear me down. This company has an extremely high turnover rate among the sales team due to the constant, expectation to overwork every single day, and the cutthroat, 'sink or swim' culture the company has. Additionally, I have a travel territory so I spend at least one night in a hotel a week, meaning I spend even less time with my wife and pursuing personal hobbies. 

I've only been in this role for 10 months and I'm starting to miss my previous remote sales job. Before my current role I wasn't making what I was wanting to earn but I had a remote job that provided the best work-life balance. I was able to workout, run errands, read, and work on hobbies during the work day.

So now I'm conflicted... Should I continue to grind it out, make money to save/invest, or should I prioritize a more balanced life with less savings/earnings potential... I think I can get my old job back with a promotion and a slight pay bump since I left on good terms.

Help me out here reddit. I don't have many other people I can relate to on this as most of my friends have way more chill jobs. Am I being a baby when it comes to hard work? Is 10 months too short of a stint to stay at a company? I don't feel that where I am is sustainable but I'm beginning to question if I just need to toughen up or if it's time to look elsewhere...

I work in a special needs school for a private multi million pound company and am subjected to being spat at, scratching and biten on a near weekly basis along with working with children who ‘play’ with fecal matter at times.

I have asked my workplace to provide me with a hepatitis vaccination as per NHS guidelines stated here ‘If your job places you at risk of hepatitis B infection, it's your employer's responsibility to arrange vaccination for you, rather than your GP’. 

However work refuse stating the risk isn’t as bad as I’m making out.

I asked to go to occ health and then they wouldn’t see me as work deliberately misworded the referral.

I then contacted occ health and got a copy of my file via a subject access request and it clearly states that my workplace doesn’t want me to get the protected as they don’t want to pay for the cost of the vaccination.

Is there anything I can do? I was thinking about long term sick as this is causing me a lot of anxiety through fear of potentially becoming ill and my workplace not giving a shite about staff.

1b2hdei,"My responsibilities have doubled this year without any pay change, how do I ask for a raise?","Hi everyone,  
  
I'm seeking advice on how to approach my boss for a raise. I work remotely as a Senior Content Manager for a small marketing firm and have been with the company since June 2022. My salary has remained at $75k since I started.  
  
Initially, my role focused on content strategy and managing a writer for our client blogs. However, my responsibilities have significantly increased. One of my bosses left, and I took over planning and writing emails for two of our largest clients. In August 2023, my blog writer was let go, and I assumed all their responsibilities, handling both strategy and writing for the blogs.  
  
Recently, I was assigned a new client with a very specific voice and tone, increasing my workload further. Despite these additional responsibilities, there hasn't been any effort to hire new staff to fill the gaps.  
  
But I've never asked for a raise before and am honestly not very good at that stuff. The only reason I haven't asked for a raise yet is that I leave for my honeymoon on March 9th and will be off for two weeks, although I am making sure to get ahead so nobody will have to do any additional work while I am gone.  
  
My boss is very casual and (besides this issue) a great boss who is very personable and understanding, almost to a fault, and I would be surprised if a raise has not crossed her mind before.  
  
I believe a raise is justified, considering the significant increase in my workload and the fact that, with inflation, my purchasing power has decreased. But is something like 20% more of a promotion than a raise?  
  
What do you guys think? How should I go about asking for one?",johnycarson10,2,1.0,1,1709154202,2024-02-28 21:03:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b2hdei/my_responsibilities_have_doubled_this_year/,2,2024

1b2g2ci,What’s a better avenue as a Data Analyst who is not great at coding?,"Hi. I am stressing myself out on what skills to learn to progress. I am not sure if this is the right place to post but hopefully I can get some insight. 

I really do like data but I am not the best at statistics or complex coding. I am not good at really intense programming. 
I am currently a data analyst (wfh) who works mainly with sql and excel. Before then I worked in accounting, also in excel. 

Education background: 
I majored in engineering but stopped going around year 3 due to finances and no motivation/ felt numb. I don’t really want to go back, I’m in a very good mental space now.  

Moving on- I love sql and visualization and have been constantly looking for new skills to learn. I really do love learning, I am just not the best with complex math. I enjoy organizing a lot and working with data files, excel and sql. 

The main things I have gathered of skills to learn for an array or career paths in data:
Azure, AWS, excel, sql, Scala, NoSql, PowerBI, python, spark, kafka etc ( I don’t even know where one would start)

The basics of what I know:
MS SQL, postgreSQL, Tableau, Excel (advanced) 

Careers I've seen: BI analyst (would that be a jump down from data analyst?) Database Developer Sql Developer (where do people start?) Data Engineer Data Scientist (y'all are so smart but I don't think I can qualify) ETL/ELT
Developer
what should learn for each?

My point:
I know there are very smart people in the world who are very good at data and it is so inspiring. I want to learn. I have worked on Udemy, Coursera, Datacamp,etc- but I will confidently say complex coding is not my strong suit, though I’m trying my best. What I’ve seen for skills to learn seem so advanced that I question if there’s a path with less intensive programming. I’m horrible at calculus and algebra. I love to be creative and I love working in sql it makes a lot of sense to me- but every time I try java or c+ again it is so stressful for me. I did it in school and got good grades but it burnt me out. I am wanting to find a place for me, and I know there is one. I just need to pick up more skills. Is there any career path that is not as mathematical? 

I know there are people out there wayyyy smarter than me who will rightfully get a really advanced career. And I of course would love to follow that, but in a less technical side. I spent a lot of time getting to where I’m at and I’d love to keep going so if anyone has input on what direction I can research or look more into I would appreciate it. I have a lot of free time outside of work to learn as well so if there’s anything recommended I’ll be more than happy to check it out. Thank you!

1b2fwkd,Passed over again for an internal role,"I work at a huge company in an interesting industry. I came here 2 years ago as the role was a great intersect between data and finance. I am super passionate about data & analytics. My goal is to shift away from finance (previous role(s)) and move fully into data. My current role offered a great opportunity to get my foot in the door with a great company I’ve always wanted to work for and a good stepping stone to move into data fully

I’ve networked a lot in the company’s growing analytics department and know many people over there now. I’ve been networking, going out of my way to self-start new projects and learn new skills that I would need in this dept, reached out to people in this dept for advice and help on related projects i’ve started, and am praised for my ability to teach myself new things without being asked as well as working hard and being a dependable and collaborative person to work with. My manager and team advocate for me and say great things about me, and encourage me to pursue these roles

Recently some great data roles opened up internally in these depts that i’ve been waiting for and on teams that i like - and I just learned today after waiting for weeks that I was now passed up for the second position i applied to. They both opened up in Jan, i applied for both and networked with the teams/managers beforehand (have been before the roles were even posted). I really wanted honest feedback and made a point to clearly ask for it, but both times they didn’t have anything but very positive feedback and that I was a great candidate but someone else was a better fit and I was the second choice. They also recognized that I do have the skillset too as I made a point of driving that home during the interviews. It seemed that the hiring managers may have already had someone in mind for both roles. Candidates who were already within the department were chosen, which is a huge advantage for them plus they had complete exposure in their now former roles 

I was told today by this hiring manager that “we’ll find something for you” (in this department). That’s not reassuring as I’ve already applied twice and been rejected. I feel like I can maybe apply 1 more time before it is overdone. And what is the point if a departmental candidate will be chosen over me every time? Why put myself out there again if I won’t be chosen, and other managers in the department know that I’ve already been rejected twice?

I work in the same building and hall as most of this dept and it does feel awkward. I know it will get better with time, as I’m sure everyone has experienced this before including me, but this definitely stings more as it’s internal and in close proximity 

This feels really cruddy and although I know I should keep my head up and maintain a positive attitude, it definitely feels like I should consider looking elsewhere as it seems apparent that there is not a path for me here

I know I should give this time to pass and not make any rash decisions. Rejection is a good thing and this is an experience that i will grow and learn from. I also think everything happens for a reason, and i’m thankful i even have a job right now. But would enjoy hearing your perspectives and experiences.

1b2fu43,Quit my job without another one lined up,"I would love advice and another opinion.

I don’t take quitting a job lightly. But I had reached a stage where I would cry on the way into work and just found myself shutting down more and more. 

I worked at a law firm for a year.  It was a small law firm. The owner and his wife ran the law firm. 

The firm was very disorganised and always had cash flow problems. 

Things were going okay until the receptionist decided to resign. 
It was then decided that they wouldn’t replace her but rather I would take on the responsibility in addition to all my duties as a candidate attorney. 

There was a lot swearing and berating from the start . My boss would ask me what the fuck I was doing for anything little thing. Such as looking for a document in a file when it turned out the document was in his hand.

My boss’s wife was in charge of the accounting. She’s very intense and aggressive. She would make a point of telling me that the cash flow problems in the company were my fault and that she couldn’t do her job because of me. For example I used caps lock in an excel spreadsheet . Even though at the time I had only been there a few months. 
I was also blamed and called upon to explain errors or work that wasn’t even mine. Another person could do a fee note and she would call me to her office to discuss it. Even I pointed out that it wasn’t my mistake she was still unhappy. 

I made a mistake on a file where I sent out an evidence bundle that was missing two pages. I apologised for the mistake to her and another senior in the company. I took responsibility for not checking the documents throughly enough. She then said that I was affecting her family and by the end of the meeting I was in tears. She then went to the other staff and told them I wasn’t coping and was making so many mistakes and that they should try to assist me. She suggested that when one of the attorneys or directors called for me that one of them should go as clearly I wasn’t up to scratch. She then drew attention to the fact that I’d been crying as my face was red. 

On another occasion she referred to me and another girl as those fucking bitches who work for me. 

This was all in the first few months. 

I then decided to rally I made sure my work was immaculate and for a while was left alone. 

Towards the end of the year, we were told to prioritise doing billing and invoices. Which I did, this caused tension though because the husband didn’t like that I wasn’t doing as much of my legal work but rather the accounting work his wife was giving us. 

Things kicked off this year when I was behind in my legal work. Even by her own acknowledgment ‘’it wasn’t that bad’’. 

I pushed hard to deliver the files but nothing was right or satisfactory. I had done an instruction which an attorney had given and that was fine but I hadn’t captured an email that was sent in 2022 on the fee note. This carried on for days. Getting chewed out for tiny things. Some of which wasnt even work I had done. If I tried pointing that out she told me to stop deflecting.

Then on the Wednesday she started berating me in the corridor and it kicked off. She was shouting about how I was behind and taking too long and she was taking the work away from me. I kept saying I’d do it and catch it up but she just kept going. At one point I said to her so what do you want me to do now? 
Then she called a meeting in the board room to discuss me and how useless she feels I am. Other staff, even staff I’m supposed to be in charge of, were  also in this meeting. She then dragged in files I’d worked on and kept going through them until she found mistakes and then shat on me for those. 

I kept calm and tried to take it constructively and nodded along. But I think this only wound her up more. At one point she screamed at me that she knows what she’s doing and that I’m not being singled out. 

This was a two hour session of being screamed and shouted at. What drove me insane was that at the end  of this she went up to other candidate attorney and asked him what he was doing, and he said I’m catching up my files that are behind. As he saw I was getting reamed. She smiles and says no problem.

I went home broken after that day. But I decide okay I’ll catch up, give her a wide berth and this will all blow over. I walk into the office the next day and she’s sitting at my desk going through my papers and note books. She then tells me she’s confiscated my files and I can only do one thing at a time with her supervision. Even though at this point I’ve run two trials by myself, managed a client by myself etc. I now have to show her every email I send. 

I lasted a few hours of her antagonising me. She also told the other candidate attorney all about how she was micromanaging me. 

I sat there and I couldn’t work. I felt like I don’t know how to type my own name. I was humiliated and my heart was squeezed from the tension and I couldn’t stop crying. And I’m not a crier ordinarily. I thought fuck this, nothing is worth this and resigned with immediate effect.
So  now I’m unemployed. I know I had to leave. But I can’t help feeling like a failure. It’s been a month. I’ve been on some interviews but I feel companies don’t want to hire someone who resigned from their articles. I also don’t know how to explain the situation without bad mouthing the company so now I seem vague and non-committal.",Necessary-Repair-141,19,0.8600000143051147,20,1709150638,2024-02-28 20:03:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b2fu43/quit_my_job_without_another_one_lined_up/,2,2024

1b2flwc,$180K remote vs $280K hybrid offer after a month on the job,"These posts are always fun - And I know this sequence of events has happened to others. But I wanted to post here to discuss job changes after a month at a Director level.

I was offered a remote Director-level position with a $180K salary. Not a month later..... I was offered a hybrid director-level role at $280K. 

The no-shit decision is to take the hybrid role at $280K. However, the internal conflict is the ""feelz"" of letting the current employer down.....My primary coping mechanism has been telling myself the following 

\- You don't owe employer 1 anything. Its my life. And if someone will pay an additional $100K for my time, that's awesome and stupid to turn down. 

\- I didn't know any of these people at company 1 a month ago , and any bridges that might be burnt...well, I probably won't see these people again. 

\- Stop being a people pleaser and caring . It's business and do what's best for you. 

So outside me writing this stuff down to cope..... Has anyone in a director-level role had this job-hop situation come back to bite them?

1b2ezll,Advice on becoming a data analyst as a recent graduate who lacks work experience ,"I (f23) graduated spring of last year with a degree in marketing and management. I didn’t really know what I wanted to do until the coming weeks of graduation. Throughout college I did not take on an internships nor did I partake in any clubs. My social life is also pretty small since I am a bit of an introvert. However, I did work for a bit in the beginning of my college years (I served at a few restaurants). But since I have graduated, my goal has been to get into data analytics. 

However, I didn’t know I was going to be pursuing this type of career, so in college I did not enroll in any tech/computer science courses. As of currently, the only coding experience I have is with SQL, which I learned for free from online platforms like Leetcode and edx.org. Recently I finished Harvard’s free course on SQL and an still working on completing the final project. I also just started another Harvard’s course on Python and am looking at a few others courses regarding Excel, JavaScript, etc., to hopefully expand my skill set and be more comfortable with coding. 

I’ll do my best to keep this short but aside from doing what I have just mentioned above, I am completely lost and anxious on finding a job as a data analyst as someone who completely lacks valuable work experience and am learning everything on their own. I’m hoping that with these courses I’m currently and will be taking I can use the final projects to build some type of portfolio for myself to show employers my skills. For anyone out there who was in the same boat as I am or currently am or just anyone who’s able to offer advice and guidance on what I can do, please help ! I really need any advice I can get. 

Also, for networking, should I try taking advantage of LinkedIn ? I’ve heard people will reach out to alumnis or just employees in general that are working at companies they’re looking to get into for guidance, and I’m thinking maybe this might be a good idea. I honestly haven’t tried to reach out much to ppl and kind of shy away from this idea bc I’m very insecure about where I stand right now with me being unemployed and lost. Again, sorry for such a long post but any advice will be genuinely appreciated. Thank you so much !

1b2eziy,Confused about how to restart my career (M36),"I need help from fellow Redditors on where and how to restart my career. So I am a B.E. graduated in 2010. Post which I worked for a couple of years in MNC as a tech support. I was not really inclined towards development or corporate jobs in general. I have like four years of job experience in IT. You see I was younger and had time on my side and I wanted to explore a lot of options. I had a passion to start a restaurant, which I did, successfully ran for about 3 years. I sold the business just before Covid hit, as micromanaging the restaurant got very stressful, and got out with profits from the sale. During lockdowns, with no other options for business in my mind, I picked up interest towards trading in the stock market. I invested quite some time to learn from the basics by myself and I am still doing the same, though I don’t make much money from it. Of late, it’s taking a toll on my mental health as trading is a very lonely profession. I hardly make new contacts/friends as I work alone from home and I am finding it depressing. 
Now I want to get out and do a regular job and be occupied and meet new people. I don’t mind any field. If any of you have sailed through a similar boat, I would appreciate your suggestions on how to approach companies. Also open to suggestions regarding doing any courses that could land me a job.

1b2eyyn,EE or Instrumentation Eng ?,"Hello everyone, I am 21 yrs old. I have an intermediate diploma in Instrumentation & Control Eng. Technology. A GPA of 3.96 out of 4.00. Not booksmart/nerd just good at what I like/understand. Currently in an office job “Instrument Designer” still in my first month.

I have 3 options mainly speaking as of now.

Option 1: My college that I graduated from has a bachelor program where I can get my Instrumentation Engineering degree. The cost is only required for the first semester then the rest is paid by the gov, so I can collect some money from my current job then quit when the bachelor program opens “nearly august”. The program would require approx 2.5 to 3 years. After that I would have less than a year of work experience and an Instrumentation Engineering degree.

Option 2: I can study part time at a university that evaluates 100% of my diploma’s credit hours. Only requiring me 2 years to earn Electrical Engineering degree. Although it’s a bit tough 7-5PM work then 4-10PM classes. There are some good flexibility in the job as well as that university so I can manage by getting courses on other time or such. After getting the degree I can continue in my current job until I have 5 years of experience then apply for another as an Electrical eng + that experience. But not sure if it counts as relevant exp “Instrument Designer which is kinda like a Technician’s title”. Also from what I heard that university is much easier than the college I studied in so I shouldn’t struggle a lot, just need to pay 75% of my salary each month for 2 years which is fine.

Option 3: We have a training program at a very reliable big company that also starts nearly at august. 1.5 years of training then working as an instrument technician probably. It’s just a matter if I get accepted there or not. 

The reason I mentioned option 3 is because I really like hands on work. And I had an internship being in the middle of the field at above 30c and I LOVED it honestly. The time flies by, doing something that I have passion about and all.

I like problem solving and my hobby is electronic tinkering and designing few diy devices as fun little personal projects. So I like the aspect of engineering as well, but as a job it’s most likely an office job getting a BOM “Bill of Material” list and approving stuff and taking responsibility. Oh did I mention I hate management BS.

It’s really tough because I want to make my family proud and be the first Eng in the family, my brothers are all Technicians and everyone I meet recommends me to get an Eng cert. I don’t wanna regret it later down the road, and I don’t want to be in an office 24/7 hours either.",LevelRealistic6217,1,1.0,0,1709148634,2024-02-28 19:30:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b2eyyn/ee_or_instrumentation_eng/,2,2024
1b2eng6,Getting out of sales?,"Hate sales but don’t know where to go

Hello! TYIA for any advice. I am 24 and currently work in full-menu sales for a professional sports team. I have been doing so for one year so far. I love working in sports — the perks are awesome and I know I am lucky to be here, but I absolutely hate my day to day. 

I thought I would like sales because I enjoy working with people, but I’ve discovered that I am not intrinsically motivated enough for this. I see other coworkers of mine thriving off the competition and the chase of a sale, but I feel it wears me down and I dread going to work each day. My managers are also challenging and no one on our 20 person sales team has been here longer than me — incredibly high turnover rate in comparison to the rest of the company.

I know I want to continue to work in sports if possible, but I am not sure how to transition from sales to another field and need some guidance. I feel stuck in the sales lane at the moment and my only opportunities for advancement are to become a sales manager, which is not something I want to do. 

Any advice on seeking out a new position within the same company, transitioning from sales to another field, or ideas on what I should do with my Econ degree is much appreciated! Thank you.

1b2ekm8,"What to talk about in a meeting withsomeone who could potentially employ me in the future, but has no space for me now.","I am set to meet with someone on the team of a pretty well known PR agency, let's call him Roger. I am about to graduate college and I am joining the job hunt. I reached out to a family friend who connected me with Roger. Originally, the family friend reached out to inquire about any work opportunities. Roger said that they weren't hiring right now, but she'd be happy to set up a meeting with me to talk about the ""marketing world"". 

I am very honored and grateful that I have this opportunity, but I have no idea what to talk about. Roger has been open about the fact that they aren't hiring and don't have space on their team, so unless something opens up in the future, I won't be getting a job from them. Obviously, I still want to make a good impression.

Should I ask about their company or, should I talk more generally about the state of the advertising/marketing world? Should I be asking lots of questions or sould I be talking more and showing what I know? Or should I do a bit of everything?

1b2ejif,Should I resign from my job?,"Okay so I’m genuinely debating if I should put in a two weeks notice. I’m (soon to be 24F) very young, at times probably naive and have only been working in corporate for a little over two years now post college. I’ve been both a coordinator and an analyst within HR for three companies now in the last 2.5 years. I’ve moved companies three times now because I was apart of the tech layoffs twice in one year from my first two positions. 

Anyway! I’ve been at my current job for over a year now and I joined because I thought it’d be a great career pivot. I’m making substantially less than I was in my previous roles but I figured why not take the leap of faith as it was a good company, would be a better career in the long run and would hopefully help me avoid ANOTHER layoff. Fast forward a few months, I receive a new boss than who hired me, he absolutely doesn’t like me, never missed a chance to belittle me, doesn’t include me in team meetings and projects and verbally informs me within the first three weeks that he doesn’t understand where I “even fit in” on our team when I asked why I wasn’t being included in meetings/projects. That was last summer. Since September I’ve received another boss, who now has my previous boss as his boss. 

Things were going well with me and my new boss and he was making me feel like I was important to the team, giving me tons of projects and overall just being super nice to me. Well performance reviews hit, my old boss did mine of course (it was subpar which wasn’t shocking) and ever since then my current boss has done a complete 180 on me. My current manager now also no longer includes me in meetings/projects, ignores me when I message for help, and barely speaks to me in office. Yada yada yada a lot more has happened but I don’t feel like typing everything, let’s just say my experience at the company hasn’t been good. 

In turn, I’ve been debating leaving the company but have been struggling to find something new in the current job market. My mental health has declined insanely over the last few months. Just last week I left work at 4:50 PM, went to a dentist appointment down the street, at 5:20 PM my manager is mass texting me asking me for a bunch of work that needs to be done by the following morning (that I obviously can’t do immediately because I’m sitting in a dentist chair by 5:15), I’m shaking so bad in the dentist chair that the dentist keeps stopping while she’s filling my teeth because she thinks I’m in pain. Nope, no pain, just extreme anxiety! And this isn’t unusual at this point. My job gives me insane anxiety, I’ve started seeing a therapist for the first time ever, I wake up every morning nauseous scared wondering in what way I’ll be belittled in office today, I cry myself to sleep often, it’s just a mess. 

I told myself to just stick it out until I find a new position. Well it’s been months now and I’ve never struggled to find a job even after two layoffs until now. I was just informed that I’d only be receiving a 0.75% raise, so obviously I checked everyone else’s on my direct team’s new salaries (I’m in HR hence I have access) and everyone received 6% or more! My boss’s boss was the one in charge of our salary increase. I knew he’s never liked me but WOW. Not even 1%? 2%?

I fear I’m at my breaking point of just giving a two weeks notice because I sincerely don’t think I make enough ($60,450) to be deal with constant anxiety and nausea. 

Can someone, anyone from the outside looking in tell me if I’m crazy for putting in a notice and just working retail until I find my next position? Is this normal in corporate? My previous managers at my first companies were lovely. I feel like I might be crazy but I’m literally losing it working with these managers.

I currently hate my job because of my coworkers. I work in the buisness sector for a corporation. I share an office with other coworkers who have the same position as mine. These other coworkers have tried to make my life a living hell by reporting information to my direct report such as what I do, what I don’t do, and that I have a lesser workload than they do. I have defended myself on numerous occasions to no avail. I personally feel they are jealous and emotionally immature individuals who have nothing better to do than focus on what I am doing. They also want conformity and I feel their tactics are a power move to coerce me into doing what they think I should be doing. My direct report has attempted to mitigate the situation without any positive outcomes or resolution. 
I do not quit out of spite. I love the work I do, I just truly dislike them and sharing a space with them. 
I recently have been interviewing for other positions. I have two job offers for much better pay, higher position, and ability to work from home. 
I have been contemplating whether or not to quit since I don’t see the situation improving. I also don’t want to give them the pleasure of me leaving because I know how my presence alone bothers them. I know in my heart the best thing to do is leave.

1b2e0ln,Need advice on career options after college,"Hey guys,  
I am a computer science undergrad in a top tier Indian college. I'm currently in my third year and have already received an intern offer from one of the top companies.  
I'm looking for some genuine advice on the career options I can consider after college. Following are some things that are important to me:  
1. I do not see myself enjoying an SWE job, since I'm not interested in development, debugging long code, system design, etc.  
2. I'm not interested in the application of ML/DL techniques since I find it to be very laborious.  
3. I'm extremely inclined towards mathematics, algorithms, problem solving, and it is the area that I'm really good at. (I have quite a few achievements in competitive programming)  
4. I do not know if I'd wanna do research, because publishing work in the field of algorithms is extremely challenging.  
5. I'd like to pursue something that involves, problem solving, analytical skills, and math, and at the same time pays really well. (Maybe CA, finance or something but I'm clueless about it).  
I do not have a very strong work ethic, and minimal effort has always given me good results because of which I've never had to work hard for things.  
Additionally, I'm more of a person who likes to enjoy life and not work that much. I wanna go on a world tour, tutor kids, open a book cafe, build legos, learn how to make my own clothes (I already know embroidery, crocheting, and knitting).  
I know there are no free lunches, but I'm hoping to find something that I will like doing, that pays well for me to fulfil my dreams, and has a good work life balance.

It took me more than the average years to get complete(will be completing soon lol) my undergrad degree because I was so up in the air with what I wanted to do and had to work 2-3 jobs and couldn't fully be a full time student each semester. I have a semester left before I graduate with my bachelors. I really want to figure it out and have a set goal to work towards to.  
I will be graduating with a psychology degree and I have done a few science courses.  
I have a strong passion for science, nutrition, and psychology. I was (kind of still am but just really open-minded) a pre-pre student. I would love to be a physician associate but I'm starting to feel burnt out from all of the requirements needed (pce, volunteer, shadowing, studying for gre). I would most likely need to do a post-bacc to finish the remaining pre-reqs needed so I probably wouldn't be applying for another 1.5 years, on top of that I also think my perspective on life changed a lot recently. I just want to live life and travel and just be able to do the things that makes me happy on the side. I would need to do a post-bacc and then do my years of PA once accepted (will not have time for anything except study). I'm just not sure if it's worth to dedicating another few intense years-- I may just be scared of my mental health going down hill due to the intensity of the workload. I've also heard the nightmare of admin and health insurance being a pain in those roles, too. I'm seeing a lot of friends and people I grew up with finally living their life and enjoying everything they always wanted to do so I'm sure that outlook I have is not helping lol. I'm still shadowing, volunteering and working on my patient care hours, but I'm also open minded to other careers that pay well and have work life balance. I wouldn't mind doing a masters program either if needed.  
I guess I'm just looking to see if there is any careers that you guys may be in or wish you went into. I'm interested in learning if you enjoy your job, do you feel well compensated, is there growth and what are the negatives and positives?  
I would really appreciate your responses, I'm just a bit stressed and a little lost. I grew up in poverty and I guess I just have the constant anxious feeling of not wanting to mess up.

1b2dpw0,Unfair Treatment Advice,"I work for a very large brewery. I have been here for four years now, working very hard to earn my place in a management role. I desperately want to get out of my current hourly role for a variety of reasons. I recently finished my Master’s Degree, have completed several projects to improve the process and save money and energy in my department which have gone unrecognized. I shadowed a manager who holds the role that I am going after on several different occasions and have now interviewed twice for this position. In total, I have interviewed 7 times for a promotion since I started working here 4 years ago. 

Every. Single. Time. I get the same result. “We really thought you interviewed great it was a very close decision for us but unfortunately we chose someone else. We want you to keep interviewing.”

There is literally nothing else for me to pursue within my current position that would help me stand out, I have done everything. I have a feeling I am being treated this way because of my age. I am in my twenties, and every time I am beaten out of a role, the individual they hire has been here longer and is ten years older at least. Some of them don’t even have degrees at all, but they would rather hire them than me. Do I have a case for ageism? Should I file an HR complaint? I have no option to leave the company really because I haven’t gotten any experience in actual management and now I feel as though I’ve wasted my time trying to get it here.

1b2d1gx,What would you do if you were in my shoes?,"I graduated in 2020 with a B.S. in ecology (I went to school late and graduated at 26 years old). I was able to find a position in 2021 doing field biology surveys and I have been doing that for the past three years. I am now at a weird crossroads in my life. I'll turn 30 this year and my life goals are changing.

&#x200B;

Info on what field biology is like:

\-Large amount of seasonal work and heavy competition for permanent, benefits accruing positions.

\-Low pay: PhDs make \~100k starting and the entire field maxes out at \~150k. I made 45k last year working 45-60hrs per week last year.

\-Constant travel: This is honestly the biggest factor for me. At 30, I'm starting to feel like dating and potentially having a family are possibilities I might miss if I stay on this track. I cant really achieve either when I move every 4 months.

&#x200B;

Okay so now my dilemma and my search for advice:

Options:

1. I have recently accepted a position as a seasonal plant ecologist. This would provide me with plant ID experience, a skill which is vital for wetland delineation positions. Wetland delineation is  one of the ways to gain permanent and semi localized employment. I wouldn't have to move constantly.
2. I am interviewing for a permanent, benefits accruing position which offers 55k (but in California) doing the same wildlife surveys/construction monitoring I have been doing for the past 3 years. If I get this position I would abandon my ideas of going to school and it would likely require moving constantly and being away from any ""home base"" for weeks at a time. 
3. I am considering going back to school for the med field and here are more Ideas I have on that front:
   1. Nuclear Medicine Technologist: This would take (including pre-requisites) about 16 months to complete. I would do this seasonal plant ecology position and start classes the spring of the following year. I would graduate in summer of 2026 (almost 31) and be \~22k in FAFSA debt. The average salary is 85k/yr.
   2. Pharmacy school: My grades are too low to get into med school :(. This would take 4 years to complete and I would need to take out \~100k in student loans from Grad+ and FAFSA. I am concerned by the saturation of this market and the general plethora of extremely upset pharmacists (retail is the most likely job outcome and people seem to absolutely despise it). The average salary is 125k. I would graduate in summer of 2028 (almost 34) and if i take the seasonal position it would push this date back 1 year. 
   3. Some other medical technologist role with similar outcomes to the Nuc Med Tech.

For some background:

 I've been employed at my company since January 2021. I was hired on as a Senior Software Developer and was offered a competitive salary for my position at the time. I have a total of 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer.  


The Problem:

If you guys need any numbers with regard to salary and other things please let me know. inflation has been astronomical between 2021 and 2024 I wanted to see how to approach my boss to give me a fair raise that would account for inflation and a bit more. I also recently discovered that a coworker of mine who just graduated from university 1 year ago is making only 2k dollars less than me. 

If you guys need any numbers with regard to salary and other things please let me know. I utilized a CPI calculator to come up with the salary I want to ask for.

1b2cept,"Got fired from a Recruiting job first month in, what should I tell my next employer?","I've been fired by the Owner of the company after getting back to the office after working from home for two days after being sick. I came into office Monday, but went home to work because I did not want to spread my germs, and the HR there told me to go home.

Took another day off next day, asked the HR again and told me to work from home, or take a sick leave. I decided to work both days, even worked after hours to make calls.

The moment the owner showed up to the office, I was sent into the office and was told that I wasn't the right fit for this job long term, even though I was outperforming my peers in terms of KPI. He specifically told me I was too ""fast paced"" for this job, which doesn't make sense to me. I was on the phone all day, while my peers were chatting away flipping papers. All my managers who was working with me told me I was doing a fantastic job, and that if the owner had a problem, he would call me in the office beforehand to talk about it, but that clearly did not happen.

currently I am working in an office with 0% travel and I spend ""only"" 38-40 hours a week in the office, please see my questions below:

1. Is it rude to ask how does typical day/week look like in terms of location where we travel, when do we travel, working hours etc?
2. Is it rude to ask how many hours are we expected to work in a given week (not including time spent in hotel, but it should include traveling time outside regular working hours)
3. Should I ask for more money if 45+ hour weeks are expected? E.g. if I am currently making 80k but I only work 38-40 hours, should I ask for at least 95k if 45h working hours is expected (and similar math if 50-55 hours is expected)
4. If they say they can't give me that much money is it better to stay in the current position?

However I started taking noticed that my coworkers (it’s 3 of us all together) don’t include me in things. They go off on their own, leave me in an area till they get back, talk amongst themselves but stay quiet when I’m around, etc. they were talking to me at first and I felt like they was getting to know me and our workdays would be easier. However, one of my coworkers told another one that she was uncomfortable around me and our schedule got switched around. (I was told our schedule would be switch for other reasons before I found out the about the situation.) I was confused because I never tried to make a move on her or look at her in any disrespectful way. In fact, I made sure to do the opposite because I was told a lot of guys tried to date her and I didn’t want her to worry about me doing the same. Coming to work has been really awkward for me and I’m left out even more now. I really don’t understand what I didn’t wrong and I believe I won’t find out. I even asked the other coworkers if she said why she was uncomfortable around me. He said he didn’t know but I’m sure he was covering for her. I don’t talk to anyone there anymore and I feel very uncomfortable being there. My manager seems like he’s taking their side and barely talks to me. I have another interview line up and I felt so upset that I even called my mom to let out frustration. I don’t want to make others or myself uncomfortable and lead to a situation that could escalate.

I am 25 years old and just graduated with a BA in Polysci (I had to take some time off which is why it took so long). I originally picked political science because I was set on pursuing law school, but last semester it hit me that it wasn't really what I wanted to do. I also have a lot of social anxiety, and was in no clubs, did not pursue any internships, and only went to school and worked the entire time. I have always been passionate about technology, but realized that I did not spend all these years learning the skills necessary to pursue a job in tech.

I have watched many videos on resume and cover letter building and try to cater each one to the job I am applying to, but I guess I just can't get it right at the moment. It's discouraging getting all these rejections, and not getting FOMO seeing younger, more qualified people having jobs lined up while I'm here, but I try to focus on sticking to it.

1b2axfo,Turned down a great job offer because I felt too burnt out to handle it,"I was recently offered a sort of ""dream job"" at least it was a well paid position in an area of research I am excited to go into. I had been looking for that type of job for years but never was qualified enough, and finally got an offer for it, but I turned it down and now I feel terrible.

The job is the same pay as my current role due to research grant restrictions, but I am currently an assistant and this is a coordinator role on another project. My current role is extremely flexible and easy to do, but is still in a prestigious institution that has set me up for a lot of training opportunities and movement in the future.

The thing is, this new job is kind of exactly where I wanted to go next. But I turned it down as I have suffered multiple bereavements, estrangement, a severe health scare and a breakup in the past 12 months. I feel completely burnt out mentally and physically and i barely know who i am anymore. I turned the new job down because I was afraid the amount of work would burn me out even more (seeing what my current research project's coordinator does is exhausting just to look at - I feel bad for her every day). 

The most recent bereavement was only 3 weeks ago, and I was feeling hesitant to jump into something so quick. I felt it would be better to have an easier job for a bit longer and than try to find something later when I know I can handle it. The problem is though these projects are super uncommon to find and definitely to get, so I am kicking myself a bit.

I kind of feel I need a bit of time before focusing on progressing my career, but on the other side I wonder if diving into an exciting project would help me with the depression of the last year. I can't tell as since the first bereavement last January, I barely made it through the year, but I was also a bit bored from my current role not being very challenging. At the same time, I felt maybe grief and stress needs something other than a work challenge as it's a challenge in itself. Even with an easy job, the ongoing stress really negatively affected my life - I couldn't exercise, sleep, meet friends. I actually dont think I've laughed or had fun in about a year. I wondered if work needed to take the back seat for a bit so I could figure out what to do with my life as a whole person now that I've lost so many people and normality in my life, not just as a worker.

Anyway, does anyone have any advice on working through depression and burnout?",Winter_Visit6480,1,1.0,0,1709139362,2024-02-28 16:56:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b2axfo/turned_down_a_great_job_offer_because_i_felt_too/,2,2024

1b2a4c4,Should I include my projects as Experience on an internal application even if they weren't technically my employers?,"So I'm looking at making a lateral move in my company that ive worked at for over a year. I've already included my resume, cover letter, etc. The portal is one of the weird ones where you have to include your Education, Skills, Experience, etc. despite it being in your CV anyways.

My last official job ended in October of 2021. I graduated in July 2022, and started this job in Jan 2023. I have some projects I've worked on that highlight my skills/experience which kind of fill the gap between my last ""official"" job and my current position at the company I'm trying to make a move in. However, they're obviously not official employers I've had in the past.

My thought is that I'd put the projects as experience anyways, with the ""Employer Name"" as the name of the project, and my ""Job Title"" as Project Member/Lead. Now here comes an important note.

When you finish the application, they have you sign on this statement: ""I authorize The Company to verify my present and past employment and education and understand and agree that any misrepresentation made in this application is grounds for discipline up to and including termination. Also, I grant The Company the authority to allow legally constituted authorities to review all pertinent parts of my personnel file for official businest purposes

I hereby further authorize The Company to solicit all information which it may need in connection with this application and to request each person referred to in this application (except as restricted above) to provide all such information to The Company I hereby release all such employers, firms anil persons from any liability or damages whatsoever resulting from providing such information to The Company: The Company is hereby authorized to circulate my upplication and any other information which it obtains from the employers, firms or persons referred to in this application to The Company affiliates, divisioris and all legally constituted governmental or regulatory authorities for official business purposes.

I also understand and acknowledge that any employment by The Company is terminable ot-will by either The Company or myself, with or without notice and with or without cause.""

So, my question is: do you think it'd be too risky to list projects as Experience for this? Would that be considered a ""misrepresentation"" since they weren't my actual employers? Or do you think this is harmless and I should stop worrying so much? Any recruiters/hiring managers specifically have thoughts on this? Sorry for the essay of a post.

1b28x2m,Advice on how to ask for a raise/how much I should ask for ,"How to ask for a raise? 

Looking for advice on how to ask for a raise

Hey everyone! I have been a paralegal at the same firm for 7 years, doing estate planning and family for the first 4 and now purely civil litigation. I have 10 years experience total, along with my associate’s degree in paralegal studies. I absolutely LOVE my job and my bosses and the people I work with. 2 years ago I moved out of state and they surprised me by offering to keep me on remotely part time. We are a small firm (3 attorneys and 5 paralegals, 1 receptionist) in a small county in central California. Our county is very poor and has a high poverty rate, so I know we aren’t going to be getting paid the LA/Bay Area rates. 

With that being said, I currently make $22.70/hr. I was going to ask for a raise in January as that is my work anniversary month, but then they gave us a raise (I went from $22 to $22.70) which is a COLA adjustment that they give as a raise. 

My husband and I are looking to buy a home soon and I would love to be able to contribute more to the down payment. I have no idea how to ask for a raise in light of the fact I just got one in January. I also am apprehensive because I’m just so grateful they kept me on. Paralegals in the state I’m in now  (MS) make half of what I make, and I live in a rural area where I would have to commute an hour each way to work, as well as find and pay for childcare and work full time all to essentially lose money. 

They also just hired a new paralegal and I know when they posted the ad they put starting rate at $26/hr. 

I really don’t know what to ask for and how to ask for it and could use some advice!",DogMom0727,1,1.0,0,1709134632,2024-02-28 15:37:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b28x2m/advice_on_how_to_ask_for_a_raisehow_much_i_should/,2,2024
1b28lnj,Letting my boss know his goldenboy is trying to get me fired,"Title pretty much sums it up. My boss and I used to be pretty close I was a lead of my group. Myself and 2others were leads. I ended up taking another opportunity in the company that made me have to give up my lead position but was still under the same boss. One of the other guys quickly became my bosses golden child who could do no wrong. Long story short the guy is simply a yes man brown-noser. I always told my boss the truth to him which at times frustratated him but he always reflected back on and and told me he appreciated my openess. This made him come to me when he was in a bind or wasn't sure on what to do.

Fast forward about 2 years. I have heard from a few of my colleagues that the golden boy thinks I'm ""a problem child"" and would like to see me gone. He has also made some comments to others about how the place would be better without me on and on. I'm aware of a few times he has told my boss things like I was talking to person x in the corner or he saw Y happening with me down the hall.nothing he can really pin on me but just drip feedong the boss carrots to character assignment me.

One of my other coworkers told me that golden boy told him he was a jealous of my previous relationship with my boss and never understood why he came to me but that was soon to be changing.

My boss and I have had a bit of a declining relation but still overall I'd say on good terms. Over the last 2 years. We used to go to lunch biweekly. We haven't went in over a year now. And today he asked me to go. Not sure why all of a sudden. I wanted to bring this subject up but wanted opinions on if I should or just let it go.if I do how do I go about it.

I graduated and became a manager at Amazon I quit cause of the same reasons u listed above after I couldn’t find a job I SETTLED for a job as a live in care giver. I’m currently homeless so I rely on the patients home to have a warm bed to sleep in at night. I do my best to make sure the patient is well taken care of care of clean and comfortable aside from that I hate my job. I constantly get sick because old people are always fucking sick. And it
Gross me out so bad that I’m coming in such a close contact with them that I’m getting sick today. I finally feel my self getting better and this lady breathed in my mouth and I instantly started getting a head ache I felt the head ache coming on sometimes I can’t believe  I’m that sensitive in my body. I’m so pissed at her cause she ain’t had to do all that kind u she ain’t even brush her teeth and I had just brush mines I can still feel her cold breath touching my tongue I was bending down putting her shoes on and she let out a deep breath looking down on me and for some reason I felt full on contact of her breath on my tongue. I hate that I have to go through this I hate my life . I seriously need to stop doing this job but I don’t have any support system to go take my time and go back to school to maybe get a quick license that takes a couple months work and save I’m coming from a abusive house hold I can’t go back I will literally unalive my self if I do. And I don’t want to do that. So I’ve been on my own. I’m working towards bettering my situation but some times i get so dismayed. I’m so sad all the time I’m so worried all the time. I’m so scared so scared I’m so heart broken and I feel so low. I’ve been living a hard life ever since I was a child I always wanted to grow up because I had faith that my life would be so much better as an adult in my mid 20s and I’m just so sad idk if it will get any better I have so much hope but I’m not sure if it matters. I hate my job so much. At first it was cool I was humbled to be taking care of people that can’t help themselves. But now I’m just miserable I’m watching my life go to waste just like how I did when I was in college. Take in mind there’s only so much I can say in this text but just know staying at Amazon wasn’t an option and staying at what one would consider a home wasn’t either. I’m so sad I feel so useless and worthless. Don’t @ me and tell me what I’m doing is of use and I matter with the job that I do respectfully I don’t want to hear that cause I hate my job and I know the potential I have to do bigger and far much more better things that are more compatible with my skills. Not saying thag care givers aren’t needed and they aren’t good. But u have some people who love this line of work no matter the illness they contract and are compatible with this line of work and some pple who aren’t.

1b277vf,Onboarding PreEmployment,"

Hello Guys, 

Thank you in advance for any input 

My situation - 

I am currently trying to get a job into a Company A (Government Contractor Company) 

I listed on my resume that I was working at Company B but never did work there. 

This role requires experience for this role at Company A. 

In which I said I was working at this “Company B”

They have asked me to provide my W2 for Company B that I was never employed at. 

However, I used to work for a tax firm. In which I provided them the W2 for that Company which we will call Company C 

I was advised by a connection inside of Company A to say that Company C and Company B are partners. 

After providing that documentation they replied to the email stating that they cannot verify the connection between Company C & B and have asked me to provide some sort of validation between these two companies. 

I really want this job and I’ve never experienced where they would give me an offer and undergo a deep back ground check.… 

What can I do for them to stop asking? 

Company C & B are not related but im sure they want to make sure that I was at company B. 

What would be a valid and firm reason that I cannot provide them this validation of information? 

Any ideas would be helpful and awesome thank you in advance. 

I just want them to stop asking and mark this as a discrepancy the least

1b2592w,Boss offered a $7K raise after I put in my two weeks.,"I work for a very small video company. It’s me, my boss, and our accountant. It’s a very lonely environment. I sit at a desk on discord most days just so I have someone to talk to.

I recently got a job offer at a bigger video company in a city that’s 90 mins away from me, but it’s a place I’m looking to move to by the end of this year. 

They are going to let me do a hybrid situation — do most of my work from home, go into the office for more hands on work. 90 mins commute. I told them I’d love to work with them.

So I put in my two weeks with  my boss, and he offered me a $7,000 raise to stay at the company… which is more money than I’ve ever made before… and it’s weekly pay.

My new job could only match my current pay (pre-raise), and has a MUCH better environment. It’s people my age and it’s not so isolating. But, it’s monthly pay. Yuck.

I either take the better environment and lesser pay with greater flexibilty, or I keep this current “isolating” job and make more money?

I could really use some advice on a tricky situation I'm dealing with.

So, about four months back, I switched teams internally because my old team didn't follow through on a promised promotion, and it left me feeling pretty frustrated. The team itself and the work I enjoyed

But now, after spending some time in this new role, I'm realizing it's just not for me. The clients, the team vibe, the day-to-day – none of it's clicking for me.

I let a friend from my old team know how I'm feeling, and they offered me a way back in at level and pay I am at now (I got a promotion when so moved teams) – which sounds great!

But here's the thing: I haven't talked to my current manager about any of this, so I'm not sure how to break the news to my current team that I am going to be moving and that I am unhappy without ruffling feathers.

1b230ly,Career Advice: Feeling Lost in Supply Chain Advisory Role,"Hey everyone,  
  
I'm at a bit of a career crossroads and could really use some guidance. I've been working as a supply chain advisory consultant for about 1.5 years now at a company specializing in supply chain software. However, our advisory branch is relatively new, and both internally and externally, it feels like there's a lack of recognition and structure.  
  
In my role, I closely collaborate with large multinational companies, evaluating their supply chains to ensure readiness for the implementation of our software. While the work is engaging, there's a persistent feeling that our branch lacks clear direction. There's ambiguity regarding our future goals and the career path for consultants like myself.  
  
On a personal note, I hold a master's degree in operations research, which has provided a strong foundation for my work. I also have experience in implementing supply chain software, having served as an implementation consultant for two years before my current role. This background adds depth to my skill set.  
  
In addition, I've been noticing that the promotion approach within my current company is not clear, leading to a lot of frustration among employees. It's challenging to see a clear path for career advancement, which adds to the uncertainty.  
  
Lately, I've been contemplating whether to stay with my current company or explore opportunities within the industry. I'm particularly drawn to companies that prioritize employee development and offer ample growth opportunities.  
  
Has anyone navigated a similar situation or have any advice to offer? I'd greatly appreciate any insights or experiences you can share.  
  
Thanks in advance!

1b2205h,"New to the industry, need help! I have two offers, one pays more but I never heard of the company, and one 8k less but it's well known. Which would be a better pick?","I am new to the industry, so any information or opinion would help. Thank you!

I quit my old job due to bad management and got pigeonholed for a few years (yes I should have quit a long time ago, but I wanted to speak out to see if it can be resolved). My goal for the next job is to learn more and make up for the time I wasted in the old company. 

I currently have two offers that I am deciding between. I will note the noticeable differences below:

Company A

* 10k extra
* Require 2 days in office, 50 miles away from my house with 1.5-1.75 hours of travel in each direction
* The company runs similarly to my previous company - Mergers & Acquisition Company and does similar projects and so many others (in different fields) that I will not be part of it at all
* A lot of my coworkers from the old company were from this company for some reason
* Suspicious because they gave me an offer after a 30 mins phone screening and offered me a title that required 2 extra years of experience (salary is lower than the average people in this title)
* 401k match depends on the company's profit from the previous year and 75% of them will be invested in company stock that will be vested in 3 years
* Company HSA contribution of $50/biweekly
* No bonuses, annual salary increase could vary from 0 to 4% based on the manager
* Their noticeable projects are interesting to me, but I believe I will not be in that department to work on those kind of projects

Company B

* 10k less
* Require 1 day in office, 24 miles away from my house with 1.5 hours of travel in each direction
* Might need to pay parking fees
* Standard 401k match that will be vested in 3 years (0% before 3 years)
* No bonuses, salary increase based on performance (merit increase at the end of the year)
* More formal, well developed company
* Different from what I was doing before, but the foundations are the same

I am wondering if the extra 10k is worth it for me to ""gamble"" my future in Company A as it runs similarly to the previous company and I am scared to experience the things again. But, it can also be better because of the management style which I am not sure how it's like. Also, the title is too glamorous. I know my skill is not there yet, so I'm not sure if they will require me to have that level of skill even if the responsibility aligns with what we discussed about my daily tasks. However, if I do pick Company A, I will have a higher salary to negotiate for my next position if I don't enjoy working there for a couple of years, and with the title, I can jump higher to the next position. 

If I take Company B, I will see a more stable future since it is more well-formed. Unlike Mergers & Acquisition company that changes regularly.

Please if you can share your opinions on this two companies or share things that I don't see.

Thank you!",_xxllmmaa,1,1.0,2,1709112489,2024-02-28 09:28:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b2205h/new_to_the_industry_need_help_i_have_two_offers/,2,2024
1b21aj8,Entry-Level Remote Recruiter Jobs,"Hello,
I am an ex-music teacher of 5 years who recently had to move to a rural area. I’ve been out of a job for 8-9 mos. I’ve been trying to get an Academic Advisor or Admin Asst job in person and remotely, but no bites. I’ve come to terms with the possibility of working at my local grocery store or subbing until an opportunity opens up.
 
I am wondering if becoming a recruiter is a viable option right now, or just as flooded as my other aspirations. I understand people’s utter disdain for recruiting, but I think it would be a great intermediary position for me. I feel like my experience as a teacher in recruiting and retaining my music students in addition to working in fast-paced, in-person and remote environments may give me an advantage, but I am not sure if I am qualified. I have metrics on my resume for recruitment and retention of my program/studio and as well as in customer service and upselling. And I also have a lot of experience with being “on” all the time, learning new technology, and conflict-resolution on the daily. Working in the classroom has given me *a lot* of transferable skills, but it’s very difficult to be taken seriously as a professional and fast learner anywhere I apply.

I work for a freight company in NZ doing a mixture of customer service / operations for both imports and exports. 
This role sees the whole process through from booking the freight at origin, to invoicing it once delivered. It also already entails account management parts. I was ‘promoted’ today to an account management role taking on 7 accounts, but have been told that there will be no pay increase, no change of contract for the next three months until ‘I prove myself’. I will also still do the operations role which is highly stressful as it is. So I am really after some advice! What do I do?

1b1yn9h,Passed over again for internal role,"I work at a very large company in a really interesting industry. I came to this company 2 years ago as the role was a great intersect between data and finance. I am super passionate about data and analytics and genuinely enjoy the work. My goal was to shift away from finance (previous role(s)) and move fully into data. This role offered a great opportunity to get my foot in the door with a great company I’ve always wanted to work for and a good stepping stone to move into data fully

Recently some great data roles opened up internally that i’ve been waiting for and on teams that i like - and I just learned today after waiting for weeks that I was now passed up for the second position i applied to. They both opened up in january, i applied for both and networked with the teams/managers beforehand (before the roles were posted). I really wanted honest feedback and made a point to clearly ask for it, but both times they made it a point that they didn’t have any feedback and that I was a great candidate but someone else was a better fit and I was the second choice. It also seemed that the hiring managers may have already had someone in mind for both roles

I’ve networked a lot for the company’s growing analytics department and know many people over there now. I was told today by this hiring manager that “we’ll find something for you”.

Sure that sounds great, but my pride is definitely hurt over this plus not getting the roles. Being rejected twice in the department that I work in the same building as/and the same hall feels bad. I know it will get better with time and my feelings are certainly valid, as I’m sure everyone has experienced this before including me, but this definitely stings more as it’s internal and in close proximity - and I’ve been networking, going out of my way to self-start new projects and learn new skills that I would need in this department, and am praised for my ability to teach myself new things without being asked, working hard and being a dependable and collaborative person to work with 

Unfortunately, about 6 months into my role, someone on my team left and I have taken over their entire role (which is a core financial role) for over a year now. So I am doing 2 jobs with one of them not being what I signed up for nor want to do. However I have maintained a positive attitude and taken on this work and vastly improved the processes, stakeholder connections, and reporting/insights that have driven executive-level decisions.

I’ve made it apparent after I met the 1-year requirement that I wanted to move to analytics. This feels really cruddy and although I know I should keep my head up and maintain a positive attitude, it definitely feels like I should consider looking elsewhere as I don’t feel valued. I work extremely hard in my current role and do 2 jobs but my team dynamic/culture is poor which is a different topic entirely. I don’t ever get thanked or feel appreciated for the work I do and that I’m taken for granted. However my team still says great things about me and encourages me to apply for these roles. They advocate for me which is huge

I know I should give this time to pass and not make any rash decisions. Rejection is a good thing and this is an experience that i will grow and learn from. I also think everything happens for a reason, and i’m thankful i even have a job right now. But would enjoy hearing your perspectives and experiences.

1b1yaml,Clueless,"Hi all,

 I (25M) am going to lose my job that I hate in a couple of days (I work as a recruiter). I graduated in 2020 and obv COVID happened and this was the first job I could get and I stuck with this for 3.3 years now. I'm usually the top performer in my team and I lead the team as well. 6 months ago, I dropped my resignation in anger (I get screwed by my boss all the time because he thinks I hate the job). I told him that I don't like this job and I want to leave. He convinced me to stay back. I stayed back. Now, out of nowhere they put me in a PIP and the PIP ended yesterday and I gave one closure within the PIP period, my other PIP mates showed zero progress. Now, he has extended PIP till Monday so that others can show some progress
As much as I hate this job, the money was OK and it was the only thing that kept me sane as I had no clue what to do in life. Now I feel it's high time I part ways with this job but I have no idea what I like or what I'm good at. I liked Biology a decade ago and I'm not sure if I still like it. Even if I want to pursue a career in it, it's next to impossible to do a biosciences masters after a mechanical engineering undergrad. Regarding my fiscals, I have zero money saved up (I plunged my 3 years worth of savings to buy a plot). My parents told they can support me till I find a job but I'm not sure for how long. What do I do fam?

- Thanks to financial problems (thanks, dad!) and my own stupidity, (not an excuse, but I'm 95% sure I have ADD/ADHD) I'm currently preparing to retake my O/Ls and A/Ls this year...for the third time now, I think. You can't do anything in this third world shithole of a country without it, unless you're filthy rich or have the stench of a politician's cock on your breath. 

- My mother's the only one working right now. I've applied for part time jobs and internships, but they won't accept someone who has no work experience. And like I mentioned before, these assholes care deeply about your qualifications. So that's a dead end. We've taken out loans to buy groceries, and I've had to go days without brushing teeth because we couldn't afford to buy toothpaste. Disgusting. 

- I have no real, practical, tangible qualifications or skills. I don't have the time to develop anything because I'm studying and doing past papers 24/7. 

- I like writing and I'm extremely fluent in English. That's about it. That's about all the real skills I have. Fucking pathetic. I'm thinking about learning how to code, since software engineering pays well - but I have no idea where to start. 

- I know what I want to do with my life. I want to work in the film industry. I want to act, write and direct films. I want to create. But starting all that in Sri Lanka is a dead end. I want to move. I want to migrate to UK or Australia, anywhere but here. Fucking hate this swamp, there's no future here if I want to follow my passions. 

- Basically, I want ideas. Some way to make some clean, legitimate bucks online so I can support my mother and get experience. I don't care what it is. At this rate, I'll sell my body if I have to. If I was a girl, I would've opened up an OnlyFans yesterday. 

- But yes, I want ideas. I'm desperate here. I'm losing my fucking mind. At this rate, I might rob someone. I don't know.

Details:

* Mechatronics engineering degree
* Previously worked in a diverse range of companies, ranging from tech startups and small businesses to large corporations. Longest continuous employment was almost three years overseas for a very large multi-national manufacturer.
* Left my most recent role after over a year, due to no prospects for advancement or lateral moves
* Out of work for a few months now
* Looking for either a **product/process development/manufacturing role**, or pivoting to a more **traditional mechanical design** role in aerospace, composites or building services
* Being pressured by family to take whatever is available regardless of long-term prospects
* Would prefer to stay in Auckland, NZ for personal/family reasons

What I've tried so far:

* Have been judicious in what engineering roles I'm applying for, based on the advice of an old friend to focus on roles where I can be the ""top candidate"" and bring something critical to the table that no-one else can
* 20 applications + 8 expressions of interest --> 9 interviews, 11 rejections, 6 ghosted, 6 still in progress (will share Sankey diagram of my various job applications via PM on request)
* Have networked with old classmates and former colleagues, who simply say to check their respective companies' careers sites from time to time; no informational interviews offered
* Currently checking in regularly with a recruiter specializing in deep tech, who did a shoutout on LinkedIn on my behalf
* Have considered going back to Uni for a Masters by coursework, but the courses directly relevant to my skill gaps are locked behind prerequisites unavailable to mechatronics graduates
* Have looked at the Mentor::Me program at Engineering NZ, but the membership fees are quite steep, and seems to be targeted at recent graduates

1b1vqtk,Business generalists?,"This question is for those of you who have gotten a Business Admin degree and who have basically just generalized in several different business industries over the years (secretary work, customer service, hr, technical data management work, logistics work, maybe sales, maybe management, insurance, etc) but who have never *specialized* in one area.

How are your work prospects? Is it easy for you to find any kind of average paying business industry job? How do you sell yourself to employers who may be confused about your long term goals after seeing that you’ve worked in several different business industries?

I’ve earned an AAS in business and have considered going to WGU to extend it out into a 4 year degree after a few years of different types of office jobs. I don’t know if going back to school again is really worth the student debt. I’m not looking to get rich or even to “climb the ladder”. Just looking for long-term stability in the job market in an average job that won’t break my back.

If I’m being honest, I don’t *like* business. I find it dull and boring but somehow *still* incredibly draining being chained to a desk 40 hrs a week. Most jobs are like that though. I see it as a means to an end. I don’t like the idea of specializing with an accounting degree or supply chain management degree. I feel like that could really get me “stuck” in something that may be miserable. This is why I’m wondering if being a “generalist” would be a decent option.

I would *love* to become an school teacher, but the folks over at r/teachers have scared the crap out of me lol 😅. Sounds like the “bruh” and “skibidi toilet” kids are running the classrooms, and admin is completely dictating the teachers’ methods of educating.

When I mentioned that we have a leader of Team B on the meeting already and asked if there’s additional expertise having the 2nd Team B member would lend, I was simply instructed to remove the Team B leader and replace them with Team A’s requested person. 

It’s weird that the Team A person is giving me direction on who to include on my meeting instead of my own boss, and that this direction is about the attendance of a different team. The Team B person they asked me to remove has been playing a key role in my project… the situation just feels odd. 

I haven’t worked closely with Team A leader yet but I am autonomous and far along enough in my career that I shouldn’t be receiving directives with no context.

Have no problem doing it just need to understand why at a high level.

Anyways, I have decided that I will only try to go for a PHD if I get in a top 10 program, because they are the ones who get most academic jobs in the field.

I recently got approached by a couple of consulting firms. One of them is a Big 4. The positions are more of a manager/senior consultant role, with a good pay. I have worked in consulting before (but at an entry-level) for a specialist firm, and I didn't enjoy it -- mostly because of my team and the long hours.

Should I make the move, especially at this level? How would you handle this situation for leverage? Long-term, which is more beneficial?

Also, career-wise, is a manager role in consulting (or finance) different from the one in an MNC?",INeed2VentNow,1,1.0,0,1709088766,2024-02-28 02:52:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b1v5g0/multinational_to_consulting_should_i_move/,2,2024

1b1tlqu,Being blocked from moving internally - ask for a raise?,"TL:DR - I was chosen for a role in a different group, current group is not allowing it to happen because I am too valuable to them, do I ask for a raise?

I work in finance for a mid-sized publicly traded company. I have been with the company, in the same group, for over 4 years (including 1.5 years as an intern). Around a year ago, I spoke to my then Director about inquiring with other finance groups within the company to see if they had any roles that I would fit in. I felt and still feel to a greater extent that I have derived the value I can from my current functional group. Shortly after this discussion, our company announced a massive reorg - separating our one company into two publicly traded companies. This would require a massive amount of work, especially for the group I was in. Hence, any thoughts of me moving were halted. 

Fast forward to the end of 2023, the separation was all but complete, and my exact role, title wise, in a different functional area was posted. I spoke with the hiring manager, told my current manager that I had done so and that I was going to express interest, applied to, and was chosen for the role. It’s important to note that this was a lateral move solely about gaining more experience and building relationships in other parts of our company - not about money, as I was satisfied with my salary and did not assume the move would come with a raise. 

We are now 4 months after that, and I am not in the new role, and will not be for an indefinite period of time. Here’s a summary of events since I applied:

- Per a mentor of mine who worked in the group I am trying to move to, my current director told my would-be boss that I would not be good for the job. Which I obviously proved wrong in the interview. 
- the same director mentioned above pulled me into their office, and told me not to “fuck them over” when I was given the job. 
- my former director had a conversation with my current director, and was told that I should be happy where I’m at and shouldn’t get “too big for my britches” 
- There was radio silence for weeks after I learned I got the job, I began to ask my manager the situation, getting non-answers. This led to the below event. 
- I had a lunch today with my boss and director, where they essentially begged me to not leave external, tried to convince me how the group can still benefit me, and that my move to another group can come at some point - no timeline given. They said they would “treat me well” come performance reviews (September) and to “trust them”

I have been and am continuing to look and apply external. Despite the above, the company I work for is a great place to work, usually. The new leader of my area after the reorg is toxic, only feeding into my desire to get out. My ideal situation was never to leave the company. 


My question would be, considering they are handcuffing me for their own benefit, and at least in my mind hindering my development, do I ask for a raise now, rather than wait to see if they keep their word and give me one during performance reviews?  The lunch today probably included 25 minutes of them taking turns telling me how great and valuable I am. 

It is important to note that my salary has risen 40% in under 3 years, including a promotion to senior. I have also received 500 shares of stock vesting in 3 years (~$30k). I have been treated well other than this, which is what gives me pause in demanding a raise now.",Lazy-Fox-2394,3,0.7200000286102295,1,1709084473,2024-02-28 01:41:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b1tlqu/being_blocked_from_moving_internally_ask_for_a/,2,2024
1b1tg4j,I hate my job and I feel trapped,"   
Is this defeat? Waking up every day believing it's going to be a good day, encountering the gaze of a stranger at the train station, kids going to school laughing with their parents, the seasons starting to change, feeling hopeful, feeling the sun slowly hitting my face.  
Is this what it feels like to be defeated? Being someone else for 8 hours a day, from the moment I walk through the office door until I leave. I feel a weave of weariness and tension in my body.  
And I swear y'all I've never felt as tired as I do now.   
My boss keeps creating dramas and conflicts over how the other offices do their work, as if she were the coordinator (she's not), but she's been working here for 35 years and loves her job, she's passionate and works very well, she knows more than anyone, I'll give her that. But I can't handle her level of drama, her outrage, and anger every time she opens and reads an email. That doesn't bother me, the problem is that she wants to share it out loud, then she expects my feedback, that I get outraged alongside her; and believe me, I've tried everything:  
\-Short responses, doesn't work   
\-Not responding, she ends up getting frustrated and it leads to a bad tone towards me for the rest of the day   
\-Short responses but showing indignation, this just makes her want to keep sharing all the time.  
Really, it doesn't matter.   
It doesn't matter. I'm exhausted.  
I wish I had seen the signs earlier. I've been working here for 4 years (pay is better than average) and the only years I really enjoyed were the first two, working from home at the beginning because of the pandemic, and then in a hybrid schedule.  
I'm exhausted.  
I feel it in my body, my bones weigh me down and I feel tired, I feel the physical tension just from sharing the same room with this person. I've been trying to change jobs for a long time, without success. But I keep trying. I'm just another person, the hours I spend locked in that office, I'm someone else. I feel like a robot, like someone pretending to be interested when I'm just... defeated. *Yes,* I think this is defeat. Saddest part? I really like my job, it's an NGO, I get to help people. The only days I sleep well are fridays and saturdays. On sundays, I feel the taste of anguish from noon, anticipating the week to come.   
I can't help it, I followed all the advice of my psychologist but nothing seems to work.  
I used to be a hopeful, cheerful person, the one who was always willing to help and lend a hand to my friends when they needed it. Now I'm just the shell, only the shell of what I used to be remains. My family and friends say I'm more irritable: it's because I no longer have the energy to listen to other people's problems, I feel like my quota of drama has been filled for the day, I wish I could be the old me and be there for the people that need me.  
Before I felt useful, I could help, now I don't have the strength. I'm broken.",Repulsive-Stress5744,1,1.0,4,1709084046,2024-02-28 01:34:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b1tg4j/i_hate_my_job_and_i_feel_trapped/,2,2024

I make good money on this position, but it's making me increasingly stressed and feeling worthless. I've been unmotivated even to do things that I like to do in my spare time. I feel depression creeping up on me, I've gained weight and stopped doing things that I like, including good/healthy habits, it even affected my sleep schedule (been sleeping like 12 hours a night and still waking up tired).

I have enough money to pay my bills (which are not much) for months ahead, and I'd get some more money from quitting as well (I'm in Brazil so not sure if it's like that everywhere).

I feel that I need a couple months to put my mind back into place before going into the next job, so I'm not sure if applying for other jobs and leaving after getting one would be the best option. I would also be doing research during this time and catching up on errands and random tasks, so it wouldn't be 100% idle.

And lastly, I have a pretty good resume compared to the grand majority of my co-workers, and looking around on LinkedIn reveals kind of the same thing. So i \*believe\* it wouldn't be that hard to find another job a few months from now.

1b1qy7n,"Overworked, underpaid, but investing in my future","I’m a 33F, single mom. I have a masters degree in marketing and communications with over 10 years experience in the field. 

I recently left corporate America to get into the cannabis industry. I accepted a job as a marketing and communications Director for a small business. There are only three employees, including myself. I take on a lot of the work of k I accepted a job as a marketing and communications Director for a small business. There are only three employees, including myself. I take on a lot of the work including keeping up the website, doing social media planning events, going to chamber of commerce functions, graphic design, writing business and marketing plans, keeping track of all the COAs for our inventory, keeping us compliant with regulations, etc all while working retail selling products to customers.

I get paid $17/hr to do this and I happily accept it because this is the industry I want to be in and this job could lead to something amazing. 

Today at work I was going through the website and making sure everything was compliant with Square policy as they are holding a significant chunk of cash until we are. 
The owner took on going through social media to clean that up of any health claims, his solution was to simply delete posts. I voiced that I would like to do it because that’s my body of work showing what I’m capable of and I’d like to edit the posts rather than delete them. 
He called me outside and accused me of not caring or knowing how important the square money is and that he didn’t think I had time to go through and edit and also update the website. I explained the website was mostly finished and I thought I could do it, he didn’t agree so I basically said I don’t either but if you need to delete them then I’m not going to argue the point it really wasn’t worth the argument to me in the first place so I was confused how we got there. 
He ended up saying well we don’t see eye to eye on this so just go home! Which frankly confuses me even more because now that pushes getting the money back out even longer since I didn’t finish?

Anyway, he really is normally a very nice and understanding guy, probably too nice and lets people get away with more than they should, but he has a lot going on. I haven’t heard from him since I was sent home 3 hours ago, which isn’t long, but I open the store everyday so I’m not sure what to do tomorrow, I was going to send the following email but hoped to get some feedback before I do?

Email below, edited for privacy:

I want to start by apologizing for how things ended today, I got more emotional than is necessary because I’m passionate about my job, but I also want express how disappointed I am in how the situation unfolded. 

It was assumed I didn’t care or didn’t see how important the square money was. Of course I understand that, we’ve had conversations about it and as a small business any money being left in limbo is stressful. I also understand how stressful your life is right now with (his nephew), (his dog), (his other full time job), and (the business) all taking up a lot of your capacity. 

That being said, I believe rather than sending me home, the most effective course of action would have been to give me the opportunity to work through the posts while I was there today and anything that didn’t get done could’ve been removed. That way we would still have the website, social media, and COAs ready by EOD today. I was also okay to simply let them be deleted if that wasn’t a path you wanted to take, I did have some feelings about it because I’m still growing and learning, but I did try to make it clear that if that’s what you prefer then that’s what we do. 

I’m so incredibly passionate about this industry and it’s that passion that gives me the ability to see all aspects of what is important to the business, cash flow, social media, marketing, organizing the COAs, I’m happy to do it and get it done quickly, I wish you could’ve had faith in my ability to do that. 

I love our customers, I love (the business), and I really hope we can find our way through this situation. I’m not sure how you’d like to move forward from here, please let me know if I should come in tomorrow. 

All of that aside if you’re still wanting everything ready for square tomorrow this is where I was at:
I had just finished up working through the pain tag and was in the middle of the sleep tag, I still had the other two you sent to go as well. All of the COAs are pulled and in a folder on my desktop called COAs and all of the products (excluding the ones mentioned in the tags) have been updated or removed to reflect the no health statements and/or no current COAs status.

1b1qbhr,Job Offer Decisions,"Hi All. Just putting my thoughts down here while I attempt to make a decision. 

Job A: Been there for 9 years. I have a title I don’t love and little room to promote. It’s a stressful industry with a ton of regs. That being said, I love my job. I love where I work, I love the people I work with, I love the actual physical location.  10 minutes from home.  For what I do, I’m paid at the top of the range. Health insurance with dependents is pricey and cuts into pay. 5 weeks PTO, with another week or so after my 10th year.  Change in management has brought about a shift in culture, huge turnover, horrible politics and it’s just not what it used to be. But if that cleared up I would happily be there another 30 years. I’m burned out. We are in like our 30th Covid outbreak.  11% annual contribution to retirement regardless of employee contributions. I’m emotionally attached to what this place means to me, and to my family, and what it used to be, and probably some emotions from working through Covid. 

Job B: Temp to hire without a concrete timeframe.  Also a non profit. About 50 cents per hour more pay to start, with a promise of higher wages upon direct hire. 2 weeks of PTO. 3% employer match to a retirement plan. Also a non-profit but not the same industry. Way better title. Same hours but 30 minutes away. Lots of room to move up, networking possibilities. Less excitement, quieter, more structured/narrower scope of responsibilities. No benefits until hired on, no details on the cost of them. Have not met the employer or been to the office. Less regs, no Covid outbreaks. They want me to start ASAP. More money, more growth opportunities potentially.

My current role is my second professional full-time role out of college. I’m in my mid-30’s and took a weird path after high school, but have a ton of great applicable street-smart experience. 

I have a hobbyist background in tech - I’ve been following tech news my entire life. I ran a tech blog as a my source of income through my college years. I’m an OK web developer and am expanding my programming knowledge by the week. 

For anyone in the fields of tech product or project management, how would you recommend someone with several years of professional experience start thinking about making the shift? Obviously, I can’t jump into programming heavy roles right away, which excludes me from a lot of my dream companies, but I’ve been punching up my whole professional career and that’s fine. I think a lot of my day to day skills are transferable, but truly just not sure exactly how to speak to the correlation in interviews.

Any courses anyone would recommend? Certificates? 

Truly, any input is welcomed. I am looking for my next challenge.",Nervous-Local-1034,1,1.0,0,1709075732,2024-02-27 23:15:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b1qbb0/want_to_shift_to_productproject_management_but/,2,2024

1b1q5gn,How should I request a salary increase?,"I am a Technical Manual Coordinator for a company in the oil and gas industry. My position is the equivalent of a Senior Technical Writer in experience, but I do have more responsibilities than a standard technical writer. Two years ago, I negotiated from 54k to 60k based on a job offer I received, but my supervisor retired in December and I've taken on several of his job responsibilities since then. I looked through average salaries for my position in my area and found that, of course, I am being underpaid according to those online sources.

I want to approach the subject of a salary increase due to my time at the company and my increased job responsibilities, but I don't want to alienate my temporary supervisor (we were previously at the same level, but I was moved beneath him so someone could handle my PTO requests while they work to fill my previous supervisor's position) or jeopardize my current working situation.

I've drafted the following e-mail, but I'm looking for comprehensive feedback, especially from HR professionals. Identifying information has been redacted.

""Good afternoon,

  
I am submitting a formal request for a salary re-evaluation following the assumption of additional duties over the past two months, my increased level of experience while employed at ---- for the past four years, and the criticality of my position to successful operations.

  
Following the retirement of ---- in ----, I have adopted the following duties:  
•	Technical manual project management  
•	Backend documentation upkeep  
•	Management of technical writers  
•	Document preparation for technical writers

This has significantly increased my workload and should be considered for fair compensation.

  
When I was first hired by ---- in 2019, my experience qualified me for a Technical Writer II position. After four years of working for ----, my experience can now qualify me for Senior Technical Writer positions. Additionally, I have been given additional duties over the past four years which place me in a project management position as opposed to a product development position. These changes in work scope and experience should be considered for fair compensation.

  
With only three active technical writers across both the ---- and ---- locations, the importance of the Technical Manual Coordinator position cannot be overstated for the health of ---- as a company.

  
Finally, upon researching average compensation for this and similar positions, I found median salaries were listed as:  
•	$79,186 via Payscale.com  
•	$95,200 via Salary.com  
•	$109,000 via Glassdoor.com (for Senior Technical Writer)  
•	$110,000 via Glassdoor.com (for Technical Manual Coordinator)

  
The median across those three sources (with only one entry per source) comes to approximately $94,795 for the average compensation of an equivalent position.

  
Please let me know when you would be willing to discuss this further.

  
Warmest regards,

1b1q5c6,Hiring manager is friends with someone I used to work under so he is just calling him instead of letting me provide references ,"So my last company was fairly toxic. A lot of micromanaging, people flying off the handle at coworkers and calling them stupid and incompetent in front of the team, the best people were constantly quitting due to these reasons which was not good for morale. And it was public sector so our high turnover was especially embarrassing. My team was very happy with me as was my supervisor. I’ve never received any alarming feedback but I do feel I didn’t do my best in that job. I felt very burnt out because of the above reasons so my performance from my own personal assessment had slipped. 

This person is my bosses boss and though he’s a nice guy, he’s definitely embroiled in all of the upper management BS that has caused so many of us to leave. I left in January. He also never worked directly with me so tbh he barely has a clue what I’m capable of. Upper management has been known to slander former employees to prevent them from being hired at new companies. He’s probably the most compassionate and kind of all of them but he pretty much abides by the status quo so I have no idea what to expect.  

I’m afraid he’s going to screw me over. I already reached out to him asking if he’d be okay providing a reference but he hasn’t responded. I also don’t like that the hiring manager didn’t let me choose my references but hand picked one instead. Should I consider that a red flag?

1b1pnbs,How to use engineering background for job transition?,"Hello everyone, I was looking for a post about this topic but I can't seem to find anything directly. So I apologize if this is a repeated question. What I want to know is if there are any people on here who have a background in electrical engineering that are no longer working in that area and what it is you are doing now and how you got to that point.

A little bit of background on myself. I went to school for electrical engineering back in 2010. At that time everybody was telling me that engineering was a good career choice and that it was a high demand field. Because of this and because I didn't really have anyone to go to for any kind of advice. I had a hard time my first year and didn't qualify to get into the co-op stream at my university. So I decided to just focus on my grades and make sure that I was on the higher end when graduating. However, after graduating I came to find out that nobody cares about grades and it's all about internships and experience which I did not have. Needless to say, I had a hell of a time finding a job in my field. After a year of searching and applying to every job that I could think of related to engineering, I decided to go back to a community college to get into there internship program and got a job working as an electronics technician. My plan was to use this position as a stepping stone into a better position to utilize my background and my education more. However, here I am 6 years later still doing the same job.

Been talking to some career counselors and they don't seem to give me the best advice in terms of what my background is and what I should be pursuing. My current employer seems to hire lots of IT people and I know a few of my co-workers who have moved from the position that I'm in currently into IT. So over covid I decided to start taking some certifications to maybe try and transition that way. I'm currently working through my CCNA.

If anybody has any advice for what I can do with my background that I could jump into without going back to school for many years. Or at least for a short period of time that would be amazing. I'm currently 32 which isn't young but isn't old. So doing another 4-year degree or going back to school without any income would be a little bit rough but doable. Any advice on the matter would be much. Much appreciated.

A side note, the career counselor that I went to go see had told me about getting into data analytics or database administration, but those seem to be not careers that you can transition to in an entry level. It seems like you need to have some level of qualifications before being able to get into those positions. There is a one year college certification I could go get but again I'm worried that I'll finish that without work experience and employers will overlook me.",dirtydirty9,1,1.0,0,1709074132,2024-02-27 22:48:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b1pnbs/how_to_use_engineering_background_for_job/,2,2024

1b1p3ru,"Pretty sad about the state of my job, and wondering if what I am thinking is a good ideal?","Hey guys, I work at a pretty awful contract. This contract is forcing me to get their insurance, and their insurance is unfortunately going to put me deep into debt. I have already begun receiving like $400 doctor bills, and I am worried I am going to be receiving a stack of them of them soon. Before this contract took over at my job, every company previously allowed me to carry my own insurance, but ECS refuses to allow me to do this even though they have told me that they could let me, but they won't. I have email proof of this. 

Of course I am beginning a new job search, but I am really sad that I have to leave to leave a job that I have been working at since 2017. I sent HR a recent photo of my bill telling them that this is why I always carried my own insurance, so I wont be saddled with multiple $400 bills. It's like they refuse to budge even though they know that their health insurance is putting me deep into debt.

I am wondering if I should tell HR that or if I should wait until I put in my two weeks, that I am incredibly depressed that I am forced to leave my job because their unwillingness to allow me to carry my own insurance, and that I shouldn't have to be forced to leave my job due to this.

1b1olvu,Anyone have suggestions for a career change?,"I'm looking for advice on a career change as I'm becoming convinced my specific area of finance (investments) isn't that interested in me.

My career ""path"" is as such: I graduated with BS degrees in each of Chemistry and Biochemistry cum laude (I'd probably have done better but I worked extensively during college). I had initially gone into science with the ambition of commercializing some new technology and owning my own company; however, due to several medical issues I had (a whole battery of allergies and dyshidrotic eczema), I moved away from science and went into education for a time (mostly doing adult education and in-home tutoring).

After spending a few years in education, I decided to get back on track by going to get an MBA specializing in new venture startup. I did exceedingly well in my finance coursework and was given some nudges to go into finance, given my strengths with math.

So, I went to work as an assistant at a registered investment advisory firm, gradually working my way up through several quick promotions to an investment analyst role--trading, process automation (mostly Excel VBA), portfolio model research projects, process automation, and so on.

I was perhaps a bit too good at my job and, due to a bit of turnover and lopsided redelegation of the work, I ended up spending several years working 70+ hour workweeks. Several family members developed cancer over that time (at one point we had four people who were in end-of-life stages at once) and, coupled with lack of improvement in my work-life balance (interfering with my ability to be present at home), I resigned.

I spent a few years tutoring while helping with the family and eventually rotated back into an operational role for a different RIA. However, after two years with them I was laid off--a part of a reduction in staff due to a severe drop in revenue.

It's been six months now and I have gotten very, very little interest in my candidacy. My job searches have been long before; however, I've met with career professionals before to discuss my processes and it doesn't seem there are any glaring faults in my approach.

So, I'm considering what other options are out there. I'm exceedingly good at processes, have some programming (VBA, SQL), analysis, modeling, reporting, process documentation, time management, workflows, among others. I am good at higher level math and enjoy puzzles and intellectually demanding tasks.

However, my passions consist of things like alcoholic beverage production, artisanal foods, amateur astronomy, philosophy, theology, economics, reading (basically anything), writing for pleasure, jazz, classic cinema, board games, strength training, and travel--with the greatest passions being alcoholic beverages, astronomy, and philosophy.

I'm wondering if anyone has any creative suggestions for what other directions I might go in--especially if it is a potential landing spot in something I'm passionate about. If it's still in finance. that's great--however, what I have always loved about the field is its dynamism, learning opportunities, reward for detailed/analytical thinking, and processes and so would welcome other considerations that have a similar set of appeals.

1b1oc48,Higher Salary or Familiarity? ,"Short question: is a job thats 10-40k worth applying to when current job is easy, comfortable, and flexible when new job at higher salary has multiple unknowns??? 


Longer question:
Im in a “good” dilemma one could say. I landed a job this past July which was really a getaway car for me. I was applying to everything and anything to get out of my night shift. I basically went back to a previous job I held for another company. This job I never really liked. Its just kinda boring. Im undecided if I should just stay here and eventually work my way up or keep applying to other jobs that are higher pay that Im qualified for, but not as comfortable in. 

Current job: have been doing this job for 6 years. 1 with current company and 5 with other. Its never been interesting to me, but its easy. Im crushing the required metrics, work from home, no travel, super flexible schedule, optional overtime to make more money if i want BUT this job is capped out in pay. Only way to “move up” in this job is apply for a management position if and when one becomes available. Could be years. 

Other jobs im applying to and interviewing for are between 10k-40k higher. Idk these jobs. Id be learning a new skill. Maybe its easy maybe its not. Idk if id be stressed or would be working long hours. No idea.

Luckily, just got a job offer for the same role with a lot less pay but more flexible hours (I could choose to work only 6 hours a day, like a part-time job).   
  
Thinking about doing the Google Project Management certificate which I'd definitely do during the free time that I'd have. Then I think I'll start programming courses later, but unsure if it's worth it cuz my head doesn't do well with it (did some free introduction online courses on Linked, and it was rough). The new job would pay the bills, but no savings for sure.  
  
Would love insights from anyone who's done the certificate or faced a similar choice. Is it worth it given my time and energy with programming courses? I recently read an interview with some CEOs from big tech companies, and they said that AI would replace most of the workers in this field.  
  
Also planning to get a Work And Holiday visa to Australia in June, so not sure if I should pursue something else that would be beneficial to get a permanent visa there later like continuing with my interpretation skills cuz my intimate goal is to move out of my country (not enjoying much being an interpreter).

For the record - I’m aware that I was dumb and overly confident

For the past 3 months, I’ve been working so much more with a lot more visibility within not only my team, but the department. I was feeling confident with my position and where I was in terms of growth and development opportunity. Only today to find out I would not be getting promoted, and it would only be a 1% increase (which is insulting more than anything since inflation is higher than that). 

As said by my manager - issue is that all the change happened in the last 3 months. Performance reviews happened in November before any of this really took. I had just moved teams over the summer so I was only with them for a few months at this point when reviews were being done. Manager claims to have tried fighting for me to get more but was denied. They’re also aware I’m upset by this considering I should be getting more. When asked if I had thoughts or questions, I said we can discuss later this week or next as I needed time to process my thoughts. 

How do I fight for the promotion? I’m going to continue applying outside, but at this point I don’t know what else I can do here. I want to tell them about the role I rejected for my growth and future at current company, but I know I’ll just look dumb.

1b1l22d,Career transition from Healthcare,"Hello!

I am looking to switch my careers from healthcare.

I wrote and erased so many times, trying not to complain in this post, but long story short, I can no longer work in a healthcare field, making the minimum wage and carrying out multiple responsibilities in an understaffed environment.

I started off my career as a Medical Assistant making $15/hr (the minimum wage in Toronto at that time), handling reception, administrative, clinical support, and cleaning as the only employee at the clinic. I was then promoted to Manager after my probationary period, where I was given extra responsibilities with a $1 salary increase. I quit because they wouldn't hire more people and I had to work frequent 12 hour shifts, 6 days a week. I still can't believe I was able to do that. Probably that's why I'm suffering from anxiety now.

I was managed to get a medical assistant job at a different clinic but the situation was worse since I had to work for 9 doctors all by myself. I quit before the probationary period. I wanted to work in a hospital, working my way up, and then get out of healthcare, but then through the experience (interviews), I realized that they are looking for female applicants only, which makes my goal infeasible. I was shocked that they were so open about this and everyone thought I was a girl before the interviews (they always used the wrong title; Ms instead of Mr).

Overall, I have 1 year of work experience in healthcare; 1 year as a medical assistant, 7 months as a manager (while working as a medical assistant) excluding my latest 2 month work experience. I have a degree in biology and chemistry, but I don't remember a single thing I learned at school. I am willing to explore opportunities in different industries, but I have no idea where to start...

1b1k6o3,How to be happy living with zero money and financial crises?,"I'm 24 I lost my job last year. Was stratigically layed off using PIP as an excuse. Since then I've lost all my confidence and my will to do anything. I basically gave my everything to that job. Was forced to overwork, instead of 9-5, was working 9-12, sometimes answering calls and meetings past 12 midnight, i was pushing myself, was burnt out, still giving my all that was left. I felt that this job, it's all I've got at that point because I had dependents at home (none had a regular income), while as a rational individual i kept on upskilling and doing a course during the night time and planning to quit eventually after I get a hold of a new job, but my current job did not leave me with much room to rest or appear for interviews, do the interview task etc.

What I really hate is the timing they choose to fire me. I was grieving the loss of my mom when the PIP started the company, there was no one to guide me. My manager gaslighted me into believing it's not really a big deal, just continue to deliver each task on time, take more, do more, but note I was already overworking, pulling all-nighters doing whatever I can, she knew what was going on in the company, it was understaffed and everyone could see that, they were incurring heavy losses and was cost cutting, i was scared of losing this job as it was me and my family's survival (who was in a different city), so i dropped the course, and pulled out everything i had and gave it to protect this very job, what followed was my worst nightmare.

It was my biggest mistake to trust my manager I was doing well as per my her but she said it's not in her control at the time of firing me without a notice middle of the month. She knew it all along as she was involved in the hiring of an intern. She could have been transparent with me. I'd used my remaining time and energy better, I'd have decided better. I was a fresh grad i didn't know better, didn't had any connections. I had no one in that city to reach out. It was far from my home. I had rent to pay, security that won't be returned now, pay for travel, flights and move and more than everything and education loan. I wish nothing but the worst to all of them who were involved.

An year from then and i still haven't healed. And I don't know how to. I wish to get a job, i wish someone offers me one, because to be honest I'm tired, i apply and apply and apply, only to receive a few call backs but none can match my previous CTC, the few who can waste a lot of my time in rounds and rounds of interview, assessment and what not only to not give me job. I really hate my life. I can't even die because that would be another trauma for my family.",fckallthings,10,1.0,1,1709061180,2024-02-27 19:13:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b1k6o3/how_to_be_happy_living_with_zero_money_and/,2,2024
1b1k5ph,Please advise on which role to choose!,"Hey Reddit, I've got a bit of a career dilemma. I've received an offer from a top 10 company in the US, for a recruiter role focusing on internships in the Bay Area. The appeal lies in the in-person aspect and the audience I'll be working with. The offer includes a salary of 100k and RSU of 12.5k/year. 

However, I'm currently in the final round of interviews for a role at a top 3 company where, based on my research, the salary would be 15-20k higher, with double the RSU and a bonus of up to 20% of my salary. The catch is, this role is remote and a sourcing role, which isn't aligned with my long-term goal of transitioning into recruiting.

I have about 2 years of experience as a Sourcer and really want to move into recruiting for my long-term career. Is it worth taking the potentially lower offer for the in-person experience and audience, or should I consider the higher-paying remote role even if it means staying a Sourcer & feeling a bit secluded? Any advice would be appreciated!

TL;DR: I have a job offer as a recruiter focusing on internships in the Bay Area with a top 10 company, but I'm also in the final round for a remote role at a top 3 company that pays more and offers better benefits. The remote role is a sourcing role, which isn't aligned with my long-term career goals of transitioning into recruiting.

I’m a fast worker, have a bachelors degree in my skill-based job that I’ve worked with from and intern to a full time employee and have about 5 years industry experience. My industry is media production. I like the people I work with. I work remote, and overall I enjoy what I do. Sadly, I’m still making under 45k…my salary range is 42k-55k for my position and yet I started out lower than that before they made salary transparent. This year they gave no raises and said it was bc they’d rather not commit to a number and give out big bonuses…which never came. 

Now I’m actively looking for new work but I’m someone diagnosed with social anxiety and am medicated now, but it still is so draining every set of the way. Opening LinkedIn activity makes me experience cold sweats and I end up doom scrolling. I’m good at what I do and I have a great range of clientele. In the meantime I’m working the same job and have not communicated that I’m looking for obvious reasons. I want a decent offer letter to show my current manager before I bring it up just to see what they’ll do.

1b1jxl9,Regret after starting new job?,"Hi guys! I started a new job two days ago and i regret taking it so much. I was at my last job for about 2,5 years and overall enjoyed it. Of course there were stressful times and some parts i did not thoroughly enjoy, but most of the times i loved my job, the team and how flexible it was. I started looking around because my workload was decreasing because of the economic situation in my country and i felt bored at times due to lack of work, and stressed because i feared getting laid off. I applied to some jobs, got an interview at a startup and a couple of hours after the interview they let me know they cancelled the other interviews and want me to work for them. Their pay was a lot bigger and since i’m only 24, it seemed like a good career leap. They let me know on a Friday and wanted to know ASAP if i’d take the job and when i could start, so i kind of felt pressured to accept the position and did not think things through as much as i should have. There were some minor tasks that came up on the interview that i was not famililar with but overall it seemed like i would be a fit. I gave in my 30 day notice and felt right afterwards like i might have made a mistake. Anyways, I had some off time last week before starting at the new place and they wanted me to come in on a couple of days to do some onboarding and work (for free), which i dumbly accepted. I officially started on Monday and I hate it. It doesn’t help that I managed to get sick on Sunday, but did not want to take a sick leave on the first day so i have been pushing it through. The ""onboarding"" was them just loading all sorts of information on me and when i ask questions, they tell me to just figure it out. They had no onboarding plan for me or guidance on how i should proceed. I am so confused, I came from a small PR company into this big tech startup and i have no clue about anything. Most of my new colleagues just ignore my existence. I was supposed to do creative writing for them but all tasks/onboarding have been regarding really specific growth marketing stuff which i have 0 knowledge of. Today i spent the entire day translating some long legal documents from a third language that i don’t speak through Google Translate (the skill of this language was not listed on the job ad and i’m weak at legal stuff). Today during a team meeting it was told that my onboarding was done and some coworkers already expected to see results in growth marketing due to me starting (in 1,5 days, what?).  My ""mentor"" asked how i was doing today, I said I was pushing through the documents he asked me to translate and he hinted that that there’s so much more stuff to do and I’m too slow. My work hours were supposed to be from 9-17, but i have been stuck at the office until 17:45-18:00 both days and have to miss my hobby class due to that. I was supposed to start writing articles and social media posts for them and I have no idea when or where to start with them and I’m slowly realising I have 0 interest in the business lane the company operates at. A couple of my new coworkers have joked about how they are surprised i haven’t quit yet, which i find odd. My former team lead (we had a great open relationship) asked how my new job was, i shared my honest thoughts and she said their doors are always open for me. It feels a bit embarrassing to go back to my old place but I feel like I made a mistake of going away from somewhere i felt comfortable at. Should I just stick it up at the new place? Thanks!

1b1jsji,Career Dilemma: Electrical Engineer Seeking Direction,"Hey everyone,  
I'm facing a bit of a career conundrum and could really use some insight. I hold a bachelor's degree in electrical and electronics engineering and have been working in the semiconductor industry for about 2 years, mainly as a business analyst. While my current role somewhat aligns with my academic background, I'm finding myself increasingly disenchanted with the idea of pursuing it long-term.  
Interestingly, when I chose electrical engineering, I deliberately avoided the path of computer science and coding. The thought of spending my days in front of a screen, chained to a desk in a 9 to 5 coding job, didn't quite captivate me. Now, as I contemplate my future, I'm relieved I made that choice.  
Many of my peers have transitioned to the IT industry or are pursuing master's degrees in VLSI. However, VLSI doesn't quite pique my interest; I'm concerned it might become tedious over time.  
On the flip side, I've always had a fascination with photonics, semiconductors, computer networking, and optics. These fields seem to offer more dynamic and engaging career prospects.  
But here's where I'm torn - I'm unsure which path to pursue next. Should I delve into further studies in one of these areas, or should I explore a different avenue altogether?  
Any advice, anecdotes, or insights you could share based on your experiences would be incredibly valuable as I navigate this decision-making process. Thank you immensely for your help! 🙏   


P.S. I should also add that the notion of delving into core electrical engineering doesn't particularly excite me either.

1b1jf9d,Bait and Switch job offfer,"Context: 31 yo male, working as a project manager for a large multinational company. I currently live in Brazil but have family in Italy (Veneto region). I've been going well career wise and developing good work at current employer. With the good work, recognition has come and I was offered to a senior project manager position with necessary relocation. Initial discussion and verbal agreement was that I would relocate to Italy where I have family and friends and I would occasionally travel to be onsite where we have projects. This would be great for me and my gf since we want to move and start our family as we plan to have kids. After a few discussions, the potential manager of the new role informed that he would rather have me based in Spain where most of the projects are and also other minor conditions of the role have changed such as role name and I don't have a defined job description yet.

Question: I took it very badly that they want to change the location to a country after verbal agreement to where I have no social circle and I'll be isolated. Plus I'm interpreting these changes as a red flag where they caught my attention to the job and they know I want to relocate to Europe to manipulate me to accept their conditions only.

-wide clinical experience (home care, hospital, nursing home, and doctors office)
-had a valid criminal background check with me at the interview (for anyone who says they hired you without that!? lol)

I can't refuse to do certain tasks, in favor of others, because my tasks are assigned to me. What is not immediately assigned, I see the guys actively avoid, while I am expected to volunteer. When at impasse (i.e. nobody volunteered), the non-core stuff will be assigned to me more often than not. This is impacting my ability to focus on core/ visible/ high value tasks, and, frankly, I am ending up less competent because I don't have the relevant exposure. Please help!

I have so much admin/ non-core on my plate that I can't focus on what actually matters because I spend my days chasing, assembling, liaising and researching a million things.

The project I was hired for hasn't started yet, and I'm stuck working on leftover mini projects that I don't have an interest in. I'm also not sure I will be interested in the new project when it does arrive.

I've been given tasks I've never completed before with close to zero guidance and no clear timeline, and when I didn't manage to complete them in time (again, I wasn't aware of the timeline so did not prioritise the tasks, and I also thought that I was working in the right direction when I wasnt), they just got taken away from me, without anyone explaining how I should have approached the task and was told I should have ""asked for help"". This means that if I ever have to complete the task again in the future, I still have no idea how to do it properly.

 I don't particularly like my coworkers or the way the research team operates (very inneficient processes and stupid rules that make us loose a lot of time). I'm also autistic, and despite sharing this with my supervisor, I don't feel like I'm getting the support I need, I end up stuck with irregular work hours and unclear work instruction, which cause me a lot of stress.

I believe I would be better suited to industry, but since I only recently started I don't know if I could quit without tanking my career. This is a 2 years fixed contract, with possibility to extend afterwards, but I'm so burned out already I don't see how I could last for 2 years.

Additionally, several individuals I have spoken with have advised me against pursuing a broad master's program and instead recommended focusing on a more specialized field such, as this is what most companies prefer. Consequently, I am feeling uncertain about which direction to choose.

My previous boss was a micromanager who did not allow us to make decisions on anything consequential and almost always disregarded our recommendations to go with his initial decision. Even when we were SMEs on the subject, best case was we had to do extra work to not only prove out our concepts, we had to prove out that his concepts were wrong and often multiple times with multiple iterations.  

My current boss gives us autonomy to make decisions and work on projects, but will give recommendations when asked. I’ve found myself subconsciously trying to defer from making decisions because I am not used to it and am not fully confident in my abilities to make the right decision.

But is it worth all the sacrifice? To spend all my saving to study a master degree? Or should I just go back to my home country and applying for scholarships to Europe instead? I love Australia but heck, its expensive and Im tired working in service. And to land a job in my home country as a bachelor graduate at 28 is too late no one gonna hire you because you’re too old.

1b1c6jo,What next after Frac Operator?,"

Finally, I did it. I left the food industry about a year and a half ago. After 17 years, I just couldn't advance anymore, and I wanted more than I was getting.

I decided the oilfield was the place for me. So I became a frac operator, got a CDL, and have been working in this position for over a year.

Started as an entry-level Frac Operator 1 and now almost 14 months in I'm about to get my 2nd promotion to Frac Operator 3.

My job is hard, and it takes me away from my family. 15 days on 6 days off. 17-18 hour days. Usually working in another state from where I live. Even been talk about some of us going to another country (wouldn't mind but farther away means harder to get home).

A pro is that I'm making double what I've ever made before (cleared over 100k my first year).

Wife and I are financially stable and well taken care of. Looking at buying a house. The only debt we have is what we choose to hold to help keep credit scores high (maybe 5% of total available credit).

The biggest reason I'm asking this question is that I don't think I want to work as a frac hand my whole life and I can't help but to feel my 2 boys need me home more than I am.

Is there something I can use my experience for that will provide a similar income but keep me home more?

For defining my abilities more. I'm 5'8""/160lbs, not the weakest on the crew, but definitely not the strongest, and that is a huge negative mark while being on a frac crew.

Suggestions and questions are welcome. Has anyone been in the frac side of Oilfield and moved to something else?",tbohrer,20,0.9599999785423279,9,1709041487,2024-02-27 13:44:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b1c6jo/what_next_after_frac_operator/,2,2024

1b1bihr,Diving into the Unknown: My Upcoming UX Design Internship ?,"Hey Reddit! 👋

Picture this: after a grueling six months of UX Design training, here I am on the verge of my very first internship in the vast ocean of an international company that’s a real mover and shaker. Exciting, right? 😄 But here’s the twist: during the mission briefing, I was presented with an epic overview of the UX team’s activities — heaps of focus groups, idea generation workshops as far as the eye can see, and a deluge of user interviews.

But… (and this is where it gets juicy 🍿), all that encompasses what the whole team does. And me, in all this? A humble intern with big dreams, what exactly will be my role in this saga?

So, I turn to you, wise and seasoned Reddit community, in search of your advice and stories. 📚 What specific tasks might fall to a little intern in UX Design, ready to conquer the world but fully aware of their current limitations? Will I be the hero of focus groups, the strategist behind ideation workshops, or perhaps the silent guardian of essential logistical supports?

🌟 Your mission, should you choose to accept it: share your experiences, advice, and maybe even some closely guarded secrets on how to shine (or at least not fade away) in a UX Design internship at an industry giant.

Do you have fail-proof techniques to add value while soaking up knowledge and experience like a sponge? Are there any ninja skills I should polish before stepping through the office door on day one?

Thank you a thousand times for your help and insights, which will be my compass in this uncharted jungle. 🧭

1b1bi5o,Information needed on factory jobs,"

Can someone help me with advice on factory jobs confirming past employment and background check expectations

Any body with info on Clopay corporations employment ( or general factory information)

So I recently applied to work for clopay ( pick to light department) I’m curious how far back they go with past employment verification, cause I did last my previous job but it was 20 years ago ( I’ve been a stay at home parent) and I’m not even sure those jobs still have the same management. Also I did include on my resume/application that I only worked a short time for both, but I’m worried one of them might tell them I quit without notice ( it was a summer job and I was 16) 
Another question I have is if clopay requires HS diploma? I was told it’s preferred but not required. ( I had my first child only a couple months prior to graduation and didn’t go back 🤦🏼‍♀️) hopefully that’s not an issue. They didn’t ask during my interview if I had graduated and they did hire me, I just have to pass the background and drug test ( which I’m not concerned about drug test at all) but I am a little worried about background ( I have 2 attempted thefts from a few years back , but I also know they hire felons so…) idk my husband thinks I’m worrying for no reason, he also works there and has for years! 
Final question… how long do background checks/ drug tests usually take to be completed? I signed the paperwork for both this past Wednesday, they said I should hear something by this week. I’m just so anxious! I need this job so badly!

1b1baqz,“YoU sTiLl hAvE tIme”…?,"“You’re Still Young. You Have Time”

“You’re only 19…”

Is what I always get when I talk to people about my confusion on what career path I’d want to take. 

Backstory: I graduated 2022, I’m not in college as I’ve been moving, and procrastinating as I don’t want to jump into a career that I won’t like (I know I can switch it), however I’ve always been attracted to AVTF (Audio, Video, Tech, Film) which is a class I took in school and I also was a YouTuber for a short while that the people loved so I thought that was for me.. but I soon stopped and gave up on it.. like usual.. I’m not sure if making videos is my passion and if it is.. that’s cool, but my dad always told me to have a degree to fall back on incase things don’t work out.. I stream here and there, but college always comes back to my mind that I need to apply before it’s too late.. anything at this point just apply. Is what my mind says. 

I of course want a career that makes good money, good enough I can live in a loft comfortably that’s not in the hood, good enough I can put money aside to save for trips, and possibly end up making more money where things like having to save up won’t be much of an “issue” anymore. Enough money to give back to my mom and dad, and get my mom nails done, go on dates with her, give her money if she needs it, and to help her with her candle business. 

I want to be happy regardless, “genuinely enjoying my career as I’ve couldn’t have made a better decision” type happy. 


SKILLS: I have a vast knowledge of creating graphics, recording and managing videos, perfect timing sequences, speaking to people, knowledge of history, learning complex concepts with some ease, easy navaigation of tech devices, some knowledge on how to create apps from a program I was in called M-A-D Learn.



INTERESTS: I love tech, the complexity, I’ve always been attracted to complex things, when everyone found multiplication easy, I found it hard, when everyone found division hard, I loved it. Same with physics. I have a love for science as well, I love how everything can be broken down.. however I don’t want to go the scientist route and end up as a cyborg working for the (b)eep state or the CIA.. so I deterred from that route. However if there’s a way to avoid that I’m all open to hear anything at this point. I see so many people saying they’re “37” or “42” and feel like they’ve wasted their years and I feel that way at 19 going on 20 seeing my friends in college pursuing what they think to be their passion, or girls my age moving out into their “first” apartments, making videos of their day in the life(style) wishing that was me as it seems they have their lives together,  and here I am. Don’t get me wrong I came a long way as a person with mass growth and development.. I’ve been told to find something and stick to it but I always end up thinking this isn’t for me because it hasn’t lit that light inside of me.. One thing that always has been able to spark that light inside of me has been learning history and hidden history, growing up playing uncharted Drake has always awed me, learning the REAL history and the fact a lot of it is hidden has always piqued my interests into traveling and learning more.. sounds funny to some but I get excited just talking about it.

QCC (questions comments concerns)

My questions would be..
1. Are you happy in your career or are u just saying you are?
2. Have you found your passion? Your mission in life?
3. How does your career help other people?
4. Is your career able to afford your lifestyle without any If, Ands, or Buts? (Aside from responsibilities and things like helping your parents/spouse/kids)
5. What advice would you give me/yourself at my age, 19 going on 20.
6. What should I do now to be able to sustain myself for this economy’s future? (I was given a list by someone in tech I met through an Uber on learning the financial and business aspect of the economy from how it became to how to read the market) 
7. What questions should I ask myself?

P.S. I also love to learn, so that equates to loving to read, recommend some books if you’d like to too.

TL;DR: Just read the questions above.
I’m looking for hard honest truths nothing sugar coated.. I’m past that.

UPDATE: I’ve been looking into SCAD, they offer in depth programs and career opportunities right out. I know it’s expensive, but it’ll be worth it right?

1b18dx2,"Two job offers out of uni, what should I do?","I'm a recent graduate (cultural heritage and new media design) and just got offered two jobs: one in marketing for a museum, another at a technology research institute. 

My dream job: using new technology to create past environments and stories about the past (incl. the historical research and the visual story). Which job will get me there? 

An overview of the offers: 

Museum: 
Pay - equal 
Time - 4 days/week 
Location - 2 hrs away but 2 out of 4 days from home 
Work - marketing support so basically anything the senior marketeers want to get rid of (maybe later room for my own creative freedom) - easier work but may be boring
Work culture - more relaxed 
Vacation days and perks - equal 

Research: 
Pay - equal 
Time - 4.5 days a week 
Location - 1 hr away, 3 out of 4.5 days in office 
Work - reseacher. Working together on research documents, going places to do the research etc.

1b188re,My boss is offering to pay for us to pursue something we’re interested in,"Apologies if this is the wrong group for this but not sure where else to post.

I’m (25f) an operations manager for a very well known restaurant. I started at this restaurant at a different location as a server and within a year worked my way to supervisor and now my current position, which came with relocation to the Bay Area.

My general manager is a really amazing leader and just a great guy overall, and when he created the overall budget for the year he included a budget specifically to pay for the management team to enroll in some kind of class to advance our career growth if we wish to do so.

I have previously owned my own business but had to put it to rest after a little over a year of operating it - this was for a variety of reasons but looking back on the experience I wish I had more knowledge of business management. I want to own my own business again in the future someday which is partially why I’m in the role I am now, I already feel like I have learned a lot.

I would like to use this opportunity to enroll in some kind of course or program that teaches about business ownership & management. I feel that I’m a great manager, and I’m very organized, and I am definitely a go getter. The areas where I felt I was lacking was more of a leadership mentality, financial literacy/understanding, and being able to re evaluate the issues I was facing on the fly. 

I’m not interested in college courses or anything, I’ve been just fine without a degree so far, but I was hoping to get some recommendations for (preferably) online courses of some kind that could help me strengthen my business management skills for a better understanding of these things. 

I also wanted some opinions on if that is the best course of action to take - are courses a good idea? Or would some kind of mentorship/coaching be more valuable? Or an entirely different option?

This is a great opportunity my boss is offering us and I want to make sure I use the allocated money for this very wisely and on something that will best benefit me.

1b180uo,"I don't have fantastic marks and don't study in a prestigious university, how can I improve my CV?","Hi, 

I'm an Italian student studying for his bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering. 
My bachelor's degree will take me 5 years (the official duration is 3 years) to complete, with a valuation around 90-95/110, so my CV will be, due to my age and marks, not the best thing ever.

I'm obviously willing to improve it in my master's degree (my choice is a Master's degree in Robotics) but how can I do it?

I'm looking forward to do it mainly because my main goal would be to get a good job in the UK in the future (note that I'm an English citizen even though I've never lived there).
Just for information, my English level is among B2-C1.


Which path do you consider the best most valid in terms of career between:

1)Enrolling in an average Italian university (University of Florence), with an Italian taught program, then getting student exchange abroad (I was considering Japan) for 6 months and a traineeship for another 6 months.


2)Enrolling in a prestigious Italian university (Politecnico di Torino) with an English taught program, and only getting a traineeship abroad for 6 months.

3)Enrolling in a pretty prestigious university abroad (I was thinking Aalborg) with an English taught program.

I'm open to any advice in regards, thanks for your time.

As title says, I don't feel like IT job is for me. I'm not into computers not into coding. I don't like working straight for 8-9 hours on computer. Instead I want some job that includes some field work.

And then there is my father who Is a class 1 government officer. I want to be like him even more than him.

I did my btech in IT just Because I got good grades and the university I went was the one of the top universities in India, and there are no other courses than IT. So I had to take that course. I thought I will develop the interest in this field. But it's been 4 years, I don't love coding and all. I cleared oncampus interview and here working just because I was smart enough. Now I know I won't be able to do it further as it's none of my interest.

I want a job that has power and pride. I want a government job. I just want to be happy in life with good amount of money. I don't want to learn all these new stuffs in IT. I'm 21 BTW.

1b177cy,What should I do now?,"I will be 30 this year, I feel my career is doomed. I am from India and I did my masters in social work. The very reason I did this is that I needed more years in my education, i.e. Bachelor and Masters combined, because I wanted to study abroad on my favorite subject, which is 3D Animation and VFX, and build a dream career in Gaming or Film Industry. The foreign universities did contact me when I completed my 3 years bachelor and they suggested I should get a master's degree to satisfy the criteria of 4 years bachelor's degree which was not in my case.  
After completing my master's in 2019, I got my reality check and realized that I may not be able to study abroad because of the lack of finances. I decided to join a development organization given by my placement officer in college.  
After completing and getting exploited for 3 months in the organization I left and also I had to leave because of my extreme domestic issues, though the issues are in control for now. I started freelancing as a photographer to support my expenses but I realized the market is saturated and almost everyone wants free service because of the competition, also I needed good quality equipment to sustain my freelance work.  
Soon after that, COVID happened, and freelancing stopped completely. After a year, I got covid along with my family. 2 more years lost.  
I realized that 4 years have passed since my last 9-5. I still yearn for a career in 3D art and game development space but I do not have a formal education or degree in this field, even though I can teach myself the skills it would require investments for PC upgradation and also requires time. And I have neither of them. The default answer that comes to my mind is that I should get back to my old social/development career. But the following questions come to my mind.  
Should I do something I don't enjoy as much?  
Should I give up on my dream career?  
Should I reanalyze my dream career? (as these are deadline-based work, and there is a saying -all that glitters is not gold)  
Is it possible to grow love for a particular subject that you think you don't like at all and make a living out of it?  
How will I fill this career gap and get back on track?  
Currently, I am severely financially constrained and my parents are aging and ill. I take full responsibility for my condition. Please be kind. I want to turn around this situation for good.

I'm a 30 year old man who makes around $35k/yr and who's only real work experience has been my current job. I've been working as an entry level factory worker for 6 years now. My particular company doesn't promote any higher than my current position without a college degree and I never finished college, however the hourly pay is extremely good for any entry level work in my state (Texas) ($19ish/hr).

1b14vby,Transition to Accounting-Seeking Advice,"Hi all looking for some general advice as I’m considering transitioning to accounting.

I have an MBA and have worked 15 years in big pharma as a senior project manager however this was as a contractor in various business “bpo” roles. I’ve done everything from data stewardship to marketing operations and govt contract management. I stuck around like many others who graduated at the height of the Great Recession with hopes of eventually getting in directly at this Fortune 500 to no avail. 

I ended up in Customer Contract Management handling Medicaid rebate work for rebate analysts for the past 4 yrs until my work was automated. Hopefully this isn’t too triggering for folks but pharma has been ruthless in its development of AI to reduce head count and have started that initiative in finance. The f500 I worked for had a full in house RPA division of developers and SWEs who work on a project basis shadowing employees across business units to automate anything and everything or at the least to disband as many full time positions as possible. Word to the wise if you’re ever told that some of ur tasks are being automated so you can focus on “higher value work”, RUN. 

That being said I’m very concerned about how AI will affect accounting roles moving forward but I’m hoping to get in at a government level or at least in a smaller company or different industry that’s slower to respond. 

My question is how realistic is this for someone who’s 38 with some financial experience and an MBA but not an accounting undergrad (Corp Comm Major and a minor in Business Admin from Penn State). I plan on taking courses to beef that up but are there any certificates or “fast track” courses anyone recommends? I also of course expect to start entry level but have heard in several places here that automation is affecting those roles heavily. 

Any feedback on the “Robert Half” and other temp agencies is also greatly appreciated as I am badly burnt out from the instability of almost 2 decades of contract work and would rather avoid them if the experience won’t help me secure a permanent position moving forward. I’ve often found contract work is like a Scarlet Letter to employers as being “sub par”. 

In addition if there’s any recommendation on the type of accounting branch to pursue that’s more in demand or has a better outlook that would also be appreciated. I could be wrong but the linear career path that accounting seems to provide is very attractive as well.

Please help me 1) understand where I went wrong and 2) move forward somehow. I needed this job.  
Drug tested for pre-employment on Thursday 2/22 in an urgent care. Urine test was ""POCT- 3477 - XC-10 Panel NO THC (3477)"" through eScreen. Offered to review Rx's and was told no need. Drank QCarbo 16oz about 3 hours before the afternoon test. Also took Zinc and B12. Hydrated more, pee turned from green to very yellow but that's usual for me. I did barf but tested negative for everything on 2 at home tests afterwards. Lines were fainter for ""BZO and COC"" but they were there....Nervous but felt ok about it.  
I did do blow 2/14 while drinking... then stopped BUT did 2 average sized bumps Sunday 2/18 (Valentine's Day SUCKS). Hydrated well Tuesday through Thursday (Body Armor, water, Gatorade, Liquid IV, cranberry juice)...  
MRO did not contact me, or try to! I called maybe two times with no results ready. Then employer told me Monday 2/26 saying test was ""in review."" I called to be proactive. Told I was positive for cocaine. I asked to review my prescriptions/intake of anything that could cause a false negative. MRO said no. Gave me an option to pay $150 for a retest of the SAME sample (sounds pointless). \*\*Did the MRO make a mistake here that could benefit me?\*\*  
Possible Factors:  
\- Ex bf and I still hooking up, he's a heavy addict (no lectures plz, it's cut off now ha). Unprotected 2/14. Took Plan B 2/15. Other unprotected interactions until day before test, with pullout. (Swollen down there recently and might have a UTI, doctor looked day before test but said it seemed okay)  
\- After 2 weeks off, injected 1.5mg of semaglutide under doctor's advice...on the day of the test.    
\- Have quit 5 Rx's in the past six months (I was so proud, this was tough, most were for mental health.) Still have leftover Abilify, Gabapentin, and a few others but don't think I took any. Currently only taking Citalopram (Celexa) 40mg each night.   
\- Also take Integra (iron) for anemia. In the few days before the test I took something for a headache (idk acetaminophen or ibuprofen), maybe NyQuil one night, and Benadryl for allergies.   
\- Drank my first (and last) Celcius either the day of or one day before the test (Mentioning because of some viral TikTok about it causing a false positive for coke...could Yerba Mate cause this too?)

1b13n9v,Company not paying contractual commission and offering a vaguely put together commission plan months into employment that does that reflect my performance. Does anyone have any advice how to navigate this and what I need to do? ,"Company not paying promised commissions despite exceeding job expectations

I joined my company about 8 months ago as enticed by an offer letter promising a lucrative sales commission structure enabling uncapped earning aligned to a clear on-target income range. No incremental policies or delayed eligibility mentioned at all. I have a base pay and added on commission structure in a client engagement role. I mange everything that goes on in the account from service satisfaction to advising with roadmaps for future projects and strategy. 
Fast forward today after exceeding performance expectations against my core responsibilities around client account growth, strategic planning, and sales channel optimization - I still have not received any commission payments owed or a formalized retrospective plan.
I discovered this only after asking repeatedly about missing backpay assumed owed based on goals publicly recognized I already supported related to capturing over $250K in new business and previously lost billing.
However now they finally present me a very restrictive plan limiting my commissions solely to new sales I directly source myself. Anything outside that ignores the account leadership duties I execute steering big wins. The vague, subjective criteria of ""personally coming up with and influencing"" the client on projects leaves too much ambiguity on what earns credit.

1b13jhc,25% pay cut for an NSF job?,"First time poster here. I’m a junior-mid software engineer working a cushy corporate gig. I do very little, have tons of free time, like my team, and am substantially overpaid. Before this, I was at a startup and worked extremely hard for much less. 

Comparing the two experiences, I’ve found I am having a hard time with work just being work. I do derive meaning and purpose from my vocation at this stage of my life and it bothers me how much I just don’t care about what I do. A job opportunity has come up that I’m in the early stages with but it sounds very close to a dream job. The trouble is that it is a government job, would be a substantial pay cut, and all I ever hear is shit talk about government funded research and engineering.

My main concern is if working with the gov will be a circle jerk with tons of red tape handcuffing me. If engineering work in NSF programs are slow advancements, have worse talent compared to private tech, complacent managers, or are micro-managey I’d rather just keep the money I’m making now. I am also worried about funding cycles cutting or derailing development efforts or changing priorities, since this is an important area that often gets neglected/politicized depending on the tides. I will miss the money but my main financial concern is if going down in pay will hurt my perceived value in the future. 

Does anyone have experience working with NSF programs, national labs, or non-DoD government organizations as an engineer? Was it rewarding? Were you given freedom? Did you find it helped your prospects later on? I could really use some guidance on what to expect, since I have a lot of preconceived notions and this would be a big leap.",Creature1124,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1709010094,2024-02-27 05:01:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b13jhc/25_pay_cut_for_an_nsf_job/,2,2024

1b13foc,Poor hotel experience when traveling for work?,"Hi! I work remote but every few months my company requests I fly out and stay a few days to do some things in person. They pay for everything. 

Previously they would put us up in a luxury hotel. It was absolutely incredible. Now they have switched hotels, which is understandable—I’m sure the other one was very expensive and I expected a downgrade. However, this one is no good. It is worse than the ones we’d stay in during family road trips trying to keep things as cost effective as possible. It is filthy, poorly lit, sketchy, and the staff are nonexistent.

I really really don’t want to stay in this hotel ever again. It’s creeping me out. I would happily pay the difference for a standard hotel like a Comfort Inn if it’s more expensive, but this one is a DoubleTree and I can’t imagine it’s cheaper than a Comfort Inn, even though it’s really giving Motel 6 vibes. 

Typing this avoiding the bed and upholstered chair bc tbh I’m a little worried about cleanliness but I definitely have to sleep here tonight. How can I communicate to my employer next time that I’d like to stay somewhere different and don’t mind paying the difference if it costs extra?

1b130m9,Company not paying promised commissions despite exceeding job expectations,"I joined a my company about 8 months ago enticed by an offer letter promising a lucrative sales commission structure enabling uncapped earning aligned to a clear on-target income range. No incremental policies or delayed eligibility mentioned at all.
Fast forward today after exceeding performance expectations against my core responsibilities around client account growth, strategic planning, and sales channel optimization - I still have not received any commission payments owed or a formalized retrospective plan.
I discovered this only after asking repeatedly about missing backpay assumed owed based on goals publicly recognized I already supported related to capturing over $250K in new business and previously lost billing.
However now they finally present me a very restrictive plan limiting my commissions solely to new sales I directly source myself. Anything outside that ignores the account leadership duties I execute steering big wins.

I came to the US on a green card but still couldn’t get a job in my industry,(been here for 2 months) not surprising given how things are right now in the tech industry. I am wondering what is the best course of action right now, I have savings (enough to last me 4 months with no income) and I managed to get a job (minimum wage) to pay for my living expenses, however I am starting to panic, should I go back to school here in the US and get a masters degree, that will cost me a lot , will probably need to take a loan, or should I just keep applying and hoping I d get a job in the next 9 months or so and maybe get certified in certain tools to increase my odds? I am honestly lost, or should I maybe try scholarships, my gpa is 3.74 (engineering program overall grade ) and I might be considered a minority in here, so wondering if that maybe could help? Please share your thoughts or any advice , and if I should go back to school what major would help me the most? I am in Massachusetts. Tools I worked with: mainly sql, SAS VIYA and SAP BO.  
  
And please, I would appreciate it if you don’t tell me I made a mistake leaving my country and quitting my job to come here, I am already starting to doubt my decision, also, even after graduating it took me 9 months to actually get my first job, like that’s how bad things are in my country, and I was tired of getting paid peanuts compared to people who have experience abroad , AND I hated my last job so much my health was going downhill, so me coming to the US is also a break of sort, I’m in my late twenties with no debt, no responsibilities.

I’ve worked 4 jobs in the field since graduating and I’ve hated and sucked at each one. I find the research completely uninteresting, I hate animal work and I have a hard time keeping up with the demands of my jobs. 

I’ve always been an amazing worker at my jobs throughout school and received Bs and As in college but since entering into my career I’m consistently the worst employee. 

I think my poor performance is half due to being uninterested in the work and half due to struggling to understand science when it’s not taught in a lecture/textbook. The longer I work the more I dislike it and the more anxious I am about being fired. I’ve already been fired from one job and have made an effort to do better but It only lasts a few weeks before I’m back making mistakes or checking out during meetings. 

I’m currently enrolled in a programming certificate course and it’s something I like a lot and I’m doing pretty good at so far. I hope a career in the field will be something I excel at and enjoy. Unfortunately I won’t finish the certificate for about 10 more months meaning I won’t even be able to start job searching until the fall. In addition to that the tech industry where I live is at a low so it would likely take 6 more months at least to actually land a career after.

1b0z5y6,Advice on moving from physical engineering to computer or data science,"Hello

Throw-away. As background, I'm late twenties and still in my first ""real job"", with my second anni in March. I have two bachelors degrees, one in aerospace engineering and another in a foreign language. It took me a while to get my feet under me due to longer schooling followed by pandemic, so I feel like I'm kind of late to the work force. I work at a semiconductor manufacturing company as a process engineer in the factory space, meaning I am somewhat ""in charge"" of machines that actually do physical things to make chips. 

&#x200B;

In practice, I do nothing with the nuts and bolts, but do a lot of data interpretation and analysis and make recommendations based on that. I am not going into details, but I learned a lot of SQL and a bit of python, and have stood up automated systems and automated data pulls that save my small team over 20 hours per week so far. It's an uncommon skill for this job title I think, based on the people I've met, and my boss is pretty direct with praise and actually advocates for me pretty strongly, since some of these things had fixes available but had festered for multiple years.

&#x200B;

It turns out I like working with computers like that and want to move over to working exclusively with computers/away from factory machines. I don't like my primary job duties very much because the machines are old, break often and cause a lot of weekend work. My work life balance is fairly poor.

&#x200B;

I'm really just looking for advice on how to make this kind of move. I feel like the primary skills from my job (knowledge of the factory machine) are very specific and non-transferable, which I dislike. My secondary skills which I picked up are better, but since it's not my main thing it feels like I need to really work to distinguish myself before I try do a career change like that, even though it's just from one kind of tech to a different one. 

&#x200B;

I'm looking at two plans. The first one is to stay an additional 2 years and try to pick up/complete some kind of significant project that uses python and/or get some kind of python cert, but then try to move off to a different role like how I want. I know it's recommended to job hop every 2-3 years, but I feel comfortable doing this because I've been getting good raises (7%) and I expect a promotion, and I'd still be learning things.

&#x200B;

The second plan would be to do work on python like the first plan, but stay for 4 years total (instead of 2) to pick up an additional degree in computer science, as my company would be willing to finance something like that I have been told. I've read that degree isn't as important for computer science if you have some experience, so I was leaning away from this, as I feel like I'm in a good spot to get this sort of experience in my current job. Also, I'm sure I'd reach a soft ceiling in compensation by then that would frustrate me.

&#x200B;

So, idk, does anyone have any advice? My feet are getting a bit antsy and I want to put in some elbow grease to set myself up for the next thing.

If I don’t get the other job (hopefully i do) should just I sign the LM offer and still look for another job closer to home or just forget it, be grateful and move to Orlando.

I have been searching for jobs for around a year, and just recently accepted a job (job A) just to make some money while I continue to search. This position starts next week, and I finalized my start date last week.

I recently got a request to interview at a separate company I've been trying to work at for a long time (job B). It would be a 40% higher pay, working less days, and with a lot more room for career advancement/educational opportunities. It would also allow me to move back out of my parents and on my own again (I had to move back in with them last year because of a family emergency).

Job B wants to interview me next week. I have not told job B that I have accepted another position, as I don't want it to appear poorly. I also (obviously) have not told job A I am still interviewing.

1b0xuqa,25M - should I change career or stay?,"25M To change career or continue on my current path?

For context, I am one of those people who is still unsure what they want to do with their career. I have always been an indecisive person and struggle to stick to one role/team. I have always found myself changing role every 1-2 years if I don't see any progression or change, this has been evident in my experience thus far. 

I Graduated a CS degree in Australia and currently just finished a Technology Grad Program at a large bank. I've been working at a bank for around 5 years and have worked in various different roles ranging from customer service, risk & regulatory compliance, leadership and now technology (project management). 

A year ago I took a pay cut from a manager position as I was offered the graduate program at a large bank after graduating from university. I took the opportunity as it felt like a once in a lifetime and I was happy to take the risk at such a young age. After a year in the program, I'm starting to realise, I don't think Tech is really for me, and I just don't enjoy the corporate 9-5 life. 

I've always wanted to work for myself, but with the degree and experience I have, I just don't feel I have any transferrable skills to open a business. I have been seriously considering getting further certifications and going down the road of becoming a Mortgage Broker as I have worked in lending prior and have a keen interest in Property. Not sure if this is the right move as it would require me to start from scratch in an entry level  and work my way back up.   


Should I stay and live a comfortable life with my current employer or take a risk and change career?

1b0vm0f,What advice would you give me at this point in my career?,"29 yo, currently living in san jose, california

I have a bachelors in electrical engineering and 7 years of hardware project managing experience (4 years was based in shenzhen, 3 in san jose) for several Chinese companies that manufacture various parts for consumer electronics for companies like META and Apple. I've been trying to apply to major companies like Apple and Microsoft but so far, I haven't even been able to get a single interview despite being referred by friends to dozens of positions across the industry, most of which are entry or low-associate level positions. I realize that competition is likely extremely fierce and that people more qualified than me are likely also applying for the same positions. 

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel like it would help my resume to have a meaningful masters degree under my belt and I also kind of want to take the time to transition away from hardware into software where positions in the bay area are more plentiful. There are, however, several issues that I'm encountering right now:

1. While i recognize that self-learning is important, I don't want to waste my time and money takings lessons for something that eventually turns into a ""certificate of participation"" that hiring managers will dismiss with impunity. So for example, a degree at Harvard or Yale would probably hold more weight than a hundred unrecognized certificates on Coursera.
2. Just browsing through admission information for grad school has been an extremely humbling and stressful experience. Not only because my grades in undergrad were awful (I'm talking <2.5 GPA awful), but I didn't receive my bachelors in the US (in a non-english speaking country) which adds extra layers of difficulty when applying. Because of this, I've been wondering if it was worth it to study undergrad again and pivot into another bachelors degree (and basically hard-resetting my life near my 30s).
3. As for what I plan on studying, I was looking into either data science, machine learning or just a standard MBA. However, I am open to any direction that would be helpful.

Nice people, cool office, retreats, and a cool laptop to work from home with.

Yet, for the last few weeks, i've been feeling stuck. I was promised learning opportunities that I have yet to get. I had a supervisor who was going to teach me a really useful and cool skill, but they switch departments a few weeks into my time there, and i haven't seen them since. It is only me and my department boss in my department now. And we have some communication issues. They're a lovely person, but i feel pressured to be like the person i replaced. Not in a job sense, but in a friend/family way. It kind of puts me off a bit, since I like to try to keep my work life drama free. The company hasn't been doing well financially either, and had lay offs a few weeks ago. (They are known for spontaneous mass lay offs)

I saw a job posting earlier today, and it seems promising. Seems to have good learning opportunities in areas Im weak in. I know the grass is never greener on the other side, though. A big pro for me, is that they have an actual team I would work with. They also work with some good companies, and the listed salary is higher than what i currently make (my current job promised me 46k but they only got me at 42k, this new job would be 50k) im not super serious of changing jobs, but it would hurt to just check it out, right?

Im a bit by myself on this as i dont want to be moaning at work to other people one because there is uncertainty for us all with job security and two because people are not really trustworthy. I can respect them and keep their stuff to myself but doesnt seem to work the other way.  


my situation is this. majorly demotivated and have a boss that constantly negative not motivating in anyway and has a habit of saying things that upset people.  


I have had a couple of teammates now that have been able to get away with lots of things yet i get called up on very minor things that aren't a big deal at all and the boss is happy to make negative comments to me probably just for kicks which knock confidence and kill motivation.  


it really gets me angry when people are rude or make nasty comments for no reason. I bite my lip a lot.  


Now at the point where i have no motivation, absolutely no respect for my boss, actually cant stand being anywhere near them.  


Im on a 3 months notice which feels like hell even if i am actively looking for a new job.  


I cant really bare to be there any more i dred each day.  


i dont really want to hand in my notice without finding anything else as it looks bad but I cannot bare my boss or the workplace anymore im totally done.

My colleague who was getting away with lots of things is now leaving with very short notice and i dont want to pick up their job as well as mine. I feel i might be forced to but i am way past staying late and busting a gut now Id rather just do my job and well and find a way out.  


I can imagine being forced into it but with combination of no motivation seeming lack of job security anyway and lack of appreciation im not going to be able to cope with that.  


can anyone relate and offer any advice in my situation?

1b0tvxz,Help! Manager isn’t letting me WFH,"I’m one month into my first job, so not sure how to go about this situation. When I applied it was advertised as 3 days in office and 2 days at home. After asking my manager about this I was told to come in every day for the first month and then see where we are, which was fair enough. Now, I have a good feeling he’s going to want me to keep coming in. 

Every team in the office but a few from ours is WFH on those days, and some people in our team have been there months and still aren’t able to, which just feels really odd. 

The person that is training me is also WFH on those 2 days, so we are communicating online whilst I’m in the office. I completely understood that it was the best way for me to learn by coming in but now it’s not making a lot of sense to me. 

After reading my contract again doesn’t specifically say 2 days home, 3 days in but that it’s up to my manager. However, the job advert stated this clearly. One of the reasons I applied was because of this as I’ve moved far from my home town and ofc the hybrid balance was appealing. I understand that I’m new and still learning, but is it fair to say something as I feel pretty confident in the role and that I communicate well online with the person training me.

It’s been a lot of work, 7 days a week, so sometimes I take it easy on certain days and stay in touch with my manager ie: migraines, sicknesses, family stuff, travel plans. These things don’t happen often but I’d rather keep her in the loop. She always says that life work balance is super important and has never faulted me for anything that’s came up. 
Thing is, I’m paranoid and struggle with calling out in any form, or missing work in any form. I like my perfectionism because it keeps me safe. 
I am remote and I’ve been told repeatedly that I have trust and that they really want me to stay.
However the work load is really intense sometimes and life has been tough lately. 
Over the last 2 weeks I have kept my boss informed but now that my grandma died last night I’m scared to say something and causing her to lose doubt in me / replace me. I’ve also never had to tell an employer about a death in the family before so I’m a little confused while dealing with the sudden grief. My dad just had surgery and then I got sick which she’s aware of. My grandma just died last night which I haven’t told anyone about yet. 
Should I tell my boss about the death or just travel for the funeral this weekend and hope I maintain the image that I’m completely dedicated to the job despite personal stuff? 
Edit: employee handbook says I would get up to 4 days bereavement for this type of situation as long as I have proof.

To fill you in on my situation- I graduated from undergrad a little over a year ago with a Bachelor's in Psychology. I did really well in school and was initially planning on going to grad school to become a therapist, but my family encouraged me to look into business instead. I've been working part-time in BizDev and completing internships on the side for the last year and now know that the sales field isn't right for me long-term. I've always been interested in HR and took an HR Management course in my final year of school.  
I know that if I'm planning on making the switch, I'll need to go take the APHR or get some kind of certificate in order to make myself more hirable. But what else would you recommend I do? I'm also looking to get your honest input about what your everyday role entails- I wasn't given very accurate info regarding what I currently do and am trying to approach this potential shift with eyes wide open.  I'm also aware that the market really sucks right now lol, but I feel as though I've been wasting my time in my current role. I'm fortunate enough to be able to live at home while I figure this out so no worries on bills as of now.

My boss promoted me to supervisor but the manager won’t acknowledge it

I was promoted to a co-supervisor position and my responsibilities include making a job list for my team, checking on people to make sure they are doing their job correctly, checking on the status of our product. The other supervisor has the duties of delegating the job list and checking on the team. The manager heavily favors the other supervisor, to the point where when we have a new employee, the manager won’t acknowledge my presence while introducing the other supervisor as a supervisor. There’s been times when our team member will come to me for direction and before I can answer, the manager will says go ask the other supervisor. This has essentially prevented me from having any authority at work, I basically come in and do my job but it’s not acknowledged and makes me feel like I’m wasting my time. Sometimes I feel like the only reason I was promoted was to pickup the other supervisors slack. When I first started, the other supervisor used to be my supervisor. I never complained but I know a few people did because he wouldn’t pick up his phone to give us more work, and when he did, he was always telling us how there is no work out here, causing people to work slow. I also caught him telling the manager those same people he told there was no work- he told the manager they were lazy. I’m not sure if this is still occurring as I don’t report to him anymore. He treats me the same as the manager- but worse, withholding information, not including me in the team, going straight to the manager when I could’ve easily been asked.

1b0skp7,Concerns over raise,"I graduated w/ a bachelor's in mathematics and statistics from a great 4 year university in early 2023. I took a job close to home taking over the books (AP, AR, and inventory) for a local company. I started the job while still in college at 21/ hr, contingent on a ""good boost"" upon graduation. After asking for my raise in June(graduated in May), I was told to wait for company raises to come out in August, which boosted me to only 22 hourly.

 I have since taken on more and more projects including integrating APIs between softwares, creating roadmaps and processes for the company, and as of late using data analysis to conduct job profitability reports. Since graduating I have earned course certificates in Data Analysis/ visualization from Google and IBM, which I haven't disclosed yet to my company. After requesting a raise up to 27 hourly(which I felt was still short, but a good start), my company countered by saying that I was ""worth all of this and more"", but asked me to take half now and the rest once again in August, when company raises come out. Being told that I was worth all and more of what I asked for, and then being told to be okay with missing out on thousands of dollars in what I am ""worth"" felt like a slap in the face to me. I routinely work 48-50 hr weeks keeping the books clean and taking more responsibility. 

How should I move forward?

I know that a language is only a tool, but playing around the circle of tutorial hell, and reading about the current market condition, made me many times to change my mind.  
  
Some time ago, I did realize that IT isn't only around programming, and coding. there are many different paths, and I am thinking about standard IT road,  
  
IT Help Desk/Support - > System/Network Administrator...  
  
Currently, plenty of free time which I am normally just wasting instead of focusing on and learn specific materials.  
  
First of all ask inside my company to potentially switch if I gain some certifications, like CompTIA A+, and Network+..  
  
Do some people have the same minds? Grind too long and too much effort for coding/programming topics, too blind that there are more possibilities and opportunities to work, and play around with technology.

I do think I will get the position as I’m on the final round, it’s an internal move, & I’ve gotten great feedback thus far. How would I go about asking for 75? I’m having my final round with C-suite so I wouldn’t ask then of course. But is it too late?

But i actually no longer have the “spark” i feel like my inner joy of doing this gets muffled with all the negativity. Things that bring me down:
- my work relies in part on collaboration and some people who will never help you but just complain, 
- office politics. One of the higher managers always complains that i don’t talk to him enough because he wants to micromanage me and my direct supervisors love my independence 
- my job requires working with international teams so being on call till 9-10 pm multiple times a week is the “norm”
I really do not want to quit this job, but also want a way to be motivated to do it again. Like i already “meet expectations” but i lost that passion that was helping me break expectations in a way and think outside the box to solve problems. Not that i’m a workaholic i just don’t like to feel static that i do the bare minimum and go home everyday.

1b0mpv0,Should I leave a job where I'm underpaid before being vested in the pension?,"The job I'm currently at is a government one where we are vested in our pension after 5 years. We pay in a little under 6% each paycheck, and each year of service raises our pension pay by 2% of the average of the highest 3 years of pay. I would get the pension at 55 years old if I decided to take it then. While this is a pretty great pension, I'm underpaid by about 20k a year or so, if not more, compared to what I should be compensated.

 I've been offered a position in a neighboring government where I would be paid around 13k more than I currently am and it would also be a step down in responsibility (going from a manager to just a regular staff member). They don't have a pension, but they do match up to 7% of my 457 contributions and there was some paths for advancement that they said would probably be opening up within the next year or two (lots of people retiring). 

I would honestly prefer to stay where I am and simply get a raise to the midpoint of my salary band (currently I'm only slightly above the absolute minimum for the band I'm in, I'm not even within the recommended salary section of my band), but I don't know if that's going to happen. Realistically, they won't be able to hire someone that's halfway decent at the amount they are paying me and will have to hire at the midpoint for the position anyway, and the new hire will probably use the health insurance here, which I don't (on my wife's plan cause it's cheaper). I'm also only 8-9 months away from being vested in the pension, so even if I did leave I'd at least be able to get the 10% of my pay once I hit 55. 

I'm honestly leaning towards not taking the other job, but I know I can't stay here unless my pay really increases (like a 20% raise). I'm beginning to get a lot of calls for interviews as there are now multiple attractive positions open near me, but would I be stupid to leave when I'm so close to getting the pension?

I currently work for ophthalmologist as a tech and make 20 an hour. My original plan was to pursue dentistry, and this is a path that does truly interest me, but I can’t get behind the hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt and another 4yrs of school. The main problem is I hate my classes, I find no motivation to do my classes. I do well in them, but just have zero interest. I’ve thought about many different paths from construction management to finance. I really enjoy putting out fires so to say. I thought a type of personal finance would suit me really well, but I don’t want to be in the business ness of sales. I just have found that I value my time with my family greatly and would want a career with a great work life balance and decent pay. Anything over 90k would be ideal for me. Dentistry hits everything on the list, but the debt and time commitment is something very hard for me. The time I would lose seeing my daughter growing up would also be very disheartening. I enjoy many things, but solving issues for people and helping bring guidance to their life is what I find myself enjoying. What would be some good careers to look at or should I just stick with dentistry and see if I even get in to a school? I should add that I do have a daughter and fiancé.

It is exactly the role I have been looking for with the exact benefits/PTO I want and the pay is within my acceptable range. I have been applying for this job at a few companies and have been rejected. I did not directly apply at his company but their talent team reached out to me. I have a very niche skill set that is perfect for the role, I believe the reason for my rejection at other companies is because it’s generally a remote role so the jobs get 10,000 applicants.

I started interviewing and didn’t tell my partner, thinking nothing would come of it. Lo and behold, they loved me and kept moving me along in the interview process and have made the offer. However, after my 2nd interview, they let my partner go due to poor performance (which I don’t necessarily disagree with, as much as I love my partner). The company would have no idea we are in a long-term relationship, we are not married yet so we have different last names and the company is huge anyway & it’s a completely different department/service line.

I’m not afraid my partner will react angrily, but rather emotionally/hurt because his feelings of shame and failure are so raw. I have been extremely supportive, wrote their resume for them, took & edited the photo for their headshot, gave them my old cover letters to help draft their own, etc.

1b0jltl,"Boss just got demoted, what should I do next?","On Friday, my team lead informed our team of 6 people (him + 5 under him) that he was being demoted and moved to another department. That leaves 3 other team leads left and about 20 people under them (including us 5). I was going to send my project manager an email suggesting myself for his role and an interview. If I got it, I would've negotiated for a promotion and a decent raise (10%+).  
  
However, on Monday morning, my remaining team of 5 got a call from the two project managers that they are figuring stuff out but not confident anyone on the project is ready to be a lead, and ""open to suggestions."" It seems like now is not a good time for them to promote someone and pay them even more as we have some big deadlines coming up in a few months. I could go into more detail about the personnel structure of the project, but basically, they are delegating responsibilities to be more spread out, and this is a ""great opportunity to get some more responsibility.""  
  
My question is this: is this just a means of taking on more responsibility without being paid more? The only way to get the next promotion is to be a team lead, but they essentially said that is off the table right now.

1b0j3ih,Dumb to go back to school despite having student loans?,"Hello all - I am 27 years old and I’m considering going back to school for a nursing degree. I originally got my bachelors in Kinesiology and went for my DPT but was dismissed after a year due to my GPA (i needed a 3.0 by the end of the year and had a 2.97 - I never failed a class but got a C in a 7 credit course). I was in the progress of getting diagnosed with ADHD and got my diagnosis a week before my final attempt at appealing but was still denied. I currently work a government job that pays okay - bills are paid no problem but I live fairly frugally (4 roommates/utilities are included in my rent). My job is boring and I don’t think I would like to work at a desk for the rest of my life. I enjoyed working in healthcare through clinical and being a PT aide, I also loved learning about Pediatrics and Pelvic Floor in PT school. This is why I am considering going back but a problem lies with finances. I have $77k in federal loans ($44k from PT, $33k undergrad), $0 private loans and I plan to keep it that way. I haven’t paid anything towards my loans yet since I was in school and with the SAVE program I qualify for $0 current payments. I most likely would have to take out more loans in order to go to Nursing School but I am thinking either ADN at a CC or ABSN that would be less than $25k. My fiancée and I plan to be married before I would start and he’s agreed to support me while i’m Nursing School for a year. Would this be a dumb idea?

1b0in8g,"Should I stay at my job, I’m doing only for resume? ","I’m going to try to keep this as short as possible. So basically, I got an on campus job working in agriculture news basically. And I want to get an on-campus job in Plant breeding. I figured picking up this job may help boost my resume and help me get a lab job with Horticulture that is hands-on not what I’m doing now where I work at home and basically just read and compile news together in a document. 

This job is honestly very time-consuming and I normally spend 10 to 15 hours a week on it but I only put 10 hours into the timesheet for me to get paid because I can’t work more than that. I know I should probably mention that I work more than the hours I’m putting in, but I also don’t want to seem slow since the other person that works there finishes their work in about an hour they do about half of what I do so I guess you could say two hours compared to my 10 to 15 hours. It’s not something I want to do. I don’t feel motivated to do it, and it makes the work drag on a lot. I know most of it is because of my learning curve, having to learn how to work excel and graphs and charts. 

I really want to ask to cut my hours in half to about five hours a week instead of 10 which would mean I would work probably 5 to 10 hours rather than 10 to 15 hours.  Or the second option is switch back over to 20 hours of my current job. I have two. And just stick with that one, and completely quit this one altogether. Since at my other job, I just get paid to sit at the desk and study and greet people. It’s very simple. The reason why I say this is because this job is affecting my grades. I completely flunked a test last week because I just simply did not have the time to study between getting this job work done and all of my other classes so I had to sacrifice one test to do better on my other test and finishes work. I’m just a little nervous to ask and I feel like my email needs to be worded very very well. My boss is not exactly the most kindhearted person they’re very straight to the point like if you asked to start work late or takeoff the response is “ whatever you think is best” in the most short sentence possible to make it known that they definitely want you there even though you have something important to do. My other job that I love that I’m thinking of just switching completely over to I can literally call in because I want to go on a run or I want to go to Hawaii and they would be like yeah ok go ahead.  not that I’ve done that I’m just using it for an example. 

Anyway, sorry for the rambling but in short how would you word this email to possibly quit or cut hours for the job that I don’t like. Would you quit or would you keep it?

1b0hlfg,Lost at What to Do - More Money but no job Satisfaction,"Little backstory. I left a previous job where I was doing what I loved gaining experience in IT along with a job that had to do with my degree. I had recently been promoted to a System Admin but was only getting $20 an hour with the occasional monthly bonus of around $450. Obviously, under paid, but I had great work life balance and genuinely enjoyed going to work every day. I have my side hustles and get VA compensation monthly so money was never an issue for me. 

A friend from college told me about a salary opportunity at his job where I would be making $75k annually plus generous quarterly bonuses. This easily puts me at over 100k annually. Id say around 105k -110k depending how well I do. I’ve been here 7 months and the work life balance is horrible and I get no enjoyment out of the work I do. I also have to travel every other week for 3 days. My passion for my side hustles has taken a back seat and I just don’t have the motivation or drive to work on them as much anymore since I am mentally drained by the end of the work days. Weekends I am off, but I am constantly trying to get ahead for the following week. I am a recruiter now and my work days consist of the same thing day in and day out. I can’t see myself doing this for much longer, but the pay is great. Should I suck it up and stick here longer because of the pay? 

I’ve been looking around and found that my old job was hiring for a Data Admin position at 60k. I actually ran into one of my old bosses at the grocery store this weekend and talked to him about it. I left the job on good terms and he said to contact him if I ever wanted to go back. I’ve talked to my girl friend and she says I should go back, she knows how stressed out this new job has gotten me and has seen how it has affected the passion I had on my side hustle. I just want to hear some of your opinions. What would you all do in this situation? With this job and my side hustles I’d estimate my yearly income at around 150k or so. I’d essentially be taking a 40/50k pay cut if I left, but I could make some of it back by focusing on my side hustles again.

I live at my dads worn down ranch. I quit three higher educations, one because my foundational knowledge in chemistry was poor and a lab mate scolded me. Two because my fellow students were batshit crazy and the teachers too. E.G.: classmate copied my facebook profile, a secretary hit on me , asstudent coordinator acting as if I was her *son* becasuse we shared surname. Three becauese PEOPLE TALK and the things that happened at #two was shared by teachers who were either married or regularily held regional knowledge-sharing meetings. or because that student coordinator mom thingy thought she should ""help"" me by gossipping.  it didn't help that my family behaved very punitively towards how I acted out over the things happening at #two. they even made up stories about me to the family doctor because .. why?? my sister had gotten pregnant that year and somehow that had to affefect me in any way possible that they could inflict damage. they wanted me sent to psychiatric ward because of rumors THEY MADE UP. like true narcissim. I later learned my sister and her bf wanted me out of the will. then aditionally at #threee, I had for the first time hired a personal trainer. she didn't want to work wiht me but she did not tell me that and she was generally a spiled brat or had preexisting conflicts with the leader of the pt-only-gym . she went on holiday mid programme and wanted to continue the program into study time ( september) and only booked like 10-14 which was in the middle of my day long study schedule. The PT gym was ""open"" at 06:00-22. but this bitch claimed she was ""booked with other clients"". like no available appointments twice a week for four months. naturalley my costudents came to see me as an ""abstinent slacker"". Really I was trying to get in shape and have more energy to be a fit student of finance.   
now I have 3 years student credits to study for. meaning I will only get my bachelors. no masters.  I am out of money and in debt. thankts fellow asshole humans.

However, the last time I asked for a raise to a reasonable 96k I didn't come off like I was asking for too much..  they only upped my salary by 4k.  (from 82 to 86).

the reasons for my rejected ask were incredibly stupid, like one time during a Teams meeting, I was sharing my screen and double clicked the wrong excel file during my presentation, a human error that was quickly corrected. The CFO gave his own reasons like a filter on a pivot did not have the checkboxes checked, however since he was rushing me, I did not get a chance to do a final pass on what I sent him to make sure everything was perfect.. Anyhow, he's proficient enough in Excel to quickly see the checkbox wasn't checked, and quickly corrected it, so he used that as an excuse to shoot down my request along with my direct boss. 

Anyway, I've been at the company almost 10 years and I think it's fair in the very least to get 110k which is what my lesser skilled colleagues who do the same unchallenging rudimentary/day to day tasks without a high level

Unfortunately this was bad timing as my Dad was dying of Cancer and i had to take a fair bit of time off to spend in the hospital with him and do what needed to be done for my family.
Work were telling me they understood and were happy for me to do whatever I had to and would make arrangements, but it was all a lie because they ended up firing me just before my probation was up for ""Lack of committment and dedication to the job""
There were also signs during my time there that this was never going to be a fit, given only 1 person was past probation, people were walking away on the spot and the few people that survived more than 6months were incredibly nepotistic and toxic its sickening.

After a sort stint of a few months of Grief, countless interveiws, and 3 job trials that wernt a fit (one because the contract got pulled out from me on the 1st day by a dodgy boss), depression and some really stupid thoughts of ending it all.
I ended up working back in the residential side of things, with a local guy who is great, looks after me and doesnt work too hard...... though here is where my current dilemia starts....


When i started with him in March last year, he had (including himself and I) 6 employees and was trying to build up his bussiness to break into the commercial sector and opperate as a commercial subcontractor and the idea was that Id be put into a Foreman/PM roll while he took care of all the background stuff.
Now there is Just me and him and he is sunseting the business over the next couple years to retire and the business build up is all but stopped as he is just happy to keep it as it is.


Im kinda stuck as I basically have a job until he shuts, but theres no growth for me.
Im way more qualified and experienced than he is as well which also makes it a little awkward.


Soo do I stick it out and stay there in relative comfort for a while (my wife thinks I should because she has ideas of starting a family even though we really cant afford to) or do I start trying to push back into what I actually want to do?

1b0bc2o,What route should I take? Any advice is greatly appreciated.,"Hello I’m 22 years old (I turn 23 this year). I was a college student up until recently. I decided to take a break because college wasn’t as promising as I thought. I am currently working a job I hate but it’s sustaining me. I hated almost everything about college (the campus, classes, loneliness). I am not passionate about the degree I’m pursuing so it constantly lead to (anxiety, depression, and burnout). I’m not sure if I should return but I really really want my bachelors degree. I just don’t want to experience the same miserable things I did before. I don’t to rack up more debt. But I have been exploring other career options since I returned home. I might be interested in being a flight attendant. But I’m scared because it’s a huge step outside my comfort zone and I’m scared. I’ve always been sheltered and I don’t really know anything beyond the four walls of my room. So I’m not sure I should just go back to complete the degree because it’s something I really want to complete. Or take the chance of doing something else? Please help me.

1b0b91s,Any advice for an artist looking to get into the animation/gaming industry?,"Hopefully a good place to ask for help with this.  
I've been feeling really stressed and anxious in the last year or so over my career, mostly because I'm 26 already and don't feel close at all to where I wanted and still want to be, and I have no idea how to get there, so I would really like some help.  
  
To keep it short, I always wanted to be an artist in an animated movie, a video game, or even a comic. That can mean anything from an illustrator, a CG artist, or an animator, I love doing all of these things. I went to art high school, and for the past 7-ish years I have been working as a video editor, where I also ended up doing some animation, illustration, and CG. My dream has always been to be a part of the big studios, or maybe have my own someday. I know that they get overworked, and I'm sure that I would hate it eventually, but it's something I really want to do despite that.  
  
The problem is that, in my country, this industry practically doesn't exist. Most people where I'm from leave for Hollywood to become artists, but I have no idea how to do that, I tried looking for international colleges and universities, but they are all WAY too expensive for international students, without even considering the costs of living, and the fact that the one time I did try to apply to an international school I didn't get accepted. There is a school in my country that has a degree in animation, and I have signed in to try to apply, but even if I get accepted, I doubt that getting a degree from a school in my country would really help me get a job elsewhere, especially when, from everything I've been told, studios don't care about your degrees, they care about your portfolio.  
  
All of this is made 10X worse by the rise of AI usage, I've been to several job interviews recently and each one talked openly about using AI instead of artists already, and this technology is still in its early stages. There have already been mass firings in these industries in the past several years, and it will probably only get worse in the coming years. It's gotten me to the point where I have to wonder if I should read the room and pursue a different career, which is scary since this is what I have wanted to do since I was a 5-year-old. I have no idea what else I'm even good at.  
  
So, TLDR, if anyone has any advice on how I could get a job in the animation/gaming industry when I live in a country that doesn't really have those industries, I would love some help. Also, if you believe that going to college is a waste and I should do something else, maybe? And if it's even worth trying at this point due to the terrible state of these industries.

1b0aqe5,Teaching while saving for grad school?,"Hi everyone, just looking for some advice. 


I graduated with a B.S in Speech and Hearing, and the plan was to go into a graduate program to become a speech pathologist. 

The only thing is I'm in debt, my husband became disabled and unable to work, long term disability ended and we're waiting for months to see about state disability.. and grad school is EXPENSIVE (60k+) 

I've been working as a substitute teacher since graduation and while pay is fair, it is inconsistent. I thought about getting my license as an speech assistant, pay is about the same as right now but consistent work. 

Or I have an opportunity to work as an intern teacher, a 2 year program about 10k, though there's a grant that'll cover it if I sign that I will work as a teacher for 4 years. 

I don't want to be a teacher but I'll make at least 20k more a year than I make currently starting in a few months. I can wait to do grad school until I can afford it and get some debt under control . I don't know why I'm hesitating I feel like this is best for my family but I just can't get over that I said I'd never be a teacher. 

Should I become an intern teacher, do 4 years then finish school to be a speech pathologist or just get grad school out of the way and have money tight for another 2 years?

1b0a9zi,Should I change my major for a better future career path?,"Hello! I’m currently a 19F attending a good university located in South Carolina. For starters, I went to an arts boarding school for three years and was accepted into NYU for English, but doubted myself, and in turn decided to go to another university for biochem. However, I completely hated it and while I passed, I didn’t have any ambition for the STEM classes I was in (and found the material somewhat difficult).

I changed my major last semester to English and History with a minor in anthropology. I love all the classes, teachers, and work, but sometimes it feels kind of lackluster. Though, it’s a way better transition and I believe I could do this forever. However, I’m having second thoughts again. I feel like I should choose something a lot more useful, even If I’m not absolute on the career path I want. A lot of my STEM friends hate their majors but they’re promised really good jobs. I love my major but my future probably isn’t bright like theirs.

Truthfully, I’m stumped about my future. Before, I was happy with becoming a teacher or professor, but now I’m just fulled with anxiety that this isn’t the best past. I’m thinking of changing my major to English and Business, with a minor in something but I’m not sure. I really like English and writing, but I feel the smartest decision is to pair it with something more useful than history.

1b06tvl,Should I pursue medical school as a nurse practitioner? ,"Hello everyone! Sorry if this is long winded.

I'm turning 30 this fall. I currently am a nurse practitioner, have been working as one for the past 7 months. About 2/3 way through my NP program I realized I really wish I had pursued medical school, but kept with my program and even did a one year ""residency"" to help me feel  better prepared.

Every day I go into work wishing I wasn't a midlevel, wishing I had just done the whole thing of going to medical school. The problem is my husband is a second year med student and we want to start having kids in the next year or two. I just don't see how time, financial (we would live off his residency salary) or location wise I would be able to manage it, especially since wherever we go for residency won't be near any family to help raise our children.

I have a strong desire to be a mom, but I also have this huge itch to go to medical school. There are parts of being an NP that I love but overall my job is pretty crappy. I get paid 84k currently to do the job of a physician (I do have a physician I can go to with any questions), and the liability of a physician. If I were to pursue med school I'd have to quit this job for prerequisites and MCAT prep because I put in around 50+ hours a week and have not much spare time. I'd likely go back to working as a nurse. 

My husband is in military so I could use his GI bill to pay for 3 years of my schooling, which he has brought up himself. He's very supportive. He also will have very little med school debt because of the military. 

The only way it could realistically work is if I got into school near wherever he gets into residency, which would make it even that much more difficult to pursue. I don't see us doing long distance for 3+ years.

Or do I just suck it up and be an NP and maybe pursue when kids are a lot older? 

Any tips are appreciated. ",Comfortable-Job-3011,5,0.9900000095367432,7,1708915719,2024-02-26 02:48:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b06tvl/should_i_pursue_medical_school_as_a_nurse/,2,2024

I work in a university as a project manager and in September due to some issues not being resolved with a colleague in a partner institution who was operating as a lone wolf and causing issues I applied for an internal job in another department. Same pay but it was permanent (I am research contract.) I was offered the new role but the same day found out I had miscarried at 8 weeks pregnant. Then a week later my boss rang me to say he was unwell, awaiting tests so would be off the project. After two weeks of time and space I made the decision to take the new role. Subsequently my boss was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and was dead 2 weeks later. I spent the next two months supporting the new academic director and finally started my new role in January feeling immensely guilty about leaving my team. However a few weeks into the new role I found out I was pregnant again, and had a really difficult transition with no support. The reasons I took the role (develop a new service, team) haven’t materialized and I miss the old role. My old role was advertised late January and I applied. I was successful at interview and now have a decision to make and I can’t decide.  

Basically I am now 10 weeks pregnant and reasons to stay in the new role is it is permanent and I might get more opportunities long term within the new dept as there’s more roles. Reason to go is I don’t think the current role is the right fit for my skills, I don’t like the mundane work and going back to my old team would make the pregnancy easier as they’ll support me (the line manager already knows and said she would love me back to help before I go on maternity leave). The contract is up 31 March 2026 but likely to be extended another 4 years with government funding (but no guarantee.) however the issues with the other colleague are still present - though I think it would bother me less. It’s being an emotional few months and think my rational judgement is impaired so looking different perspectives.

1b03cja,Managed Expectations Working For Aerospace Companies (One In Particular) Will Serve You Well - OR The Incompetent Leadership Crisis Plaguing Aerospace Contractors,"In my long career as an engineer, there is a few experiences that really stuck with me. At the time, I made excuses for the negative experiences I had with certain companies. Chalking it up to being my fault in some way, but with time and a more empirical set of standards for measuring the performance of these companies, I have instead come to realize the absolute absurdity of how aerospace programs are being run by the largest contractors. I wont name any of them specifically as they've shown to be petty when receiving criticism, you can probably guess at who they are though. I can't stop you from guessing....  
  
Let's start with the pre-employment. You will often be subjected to a series of interviews with a mix of different interviewers in different conference rooms. It's mostly theatrics. It is rare that anyone you talk to during the interview process will engage with you in any other way than with cliché interview questions they've found on the internet. Generally during your interviews the most useful person in the room that you will have the most interaction with and possesses the most technical knowledge will be the quietest one. If you're lucky the group will tell you who would be your direct supervisor if you are accepted into a position, but more often than not the hiring process is so convoluted that they have no idea what program you're going to or what your responsibilities will be when you get there. Twice I worked for a certain company that will remain nameless, and both times the interviewers told me that they knew exactly what they wanted to do with me in terms of responsibilities. To my surprise the person making these promises was no longer part of the program by the time I started by my first day. Let me repeat that, the revolving door of leadership at these companies is SO BAD, that the manager who interviewed had either left the program or had been replaced by the time I started my first day. There are more than even odds that the people who interview you will have nothing to do with your experience actually working at the company. During my first tenure at the company, I had NO MANAGER for four months and I was the only employee left on my team because the experience was so bad that they had all left. That should have clued me in that the company was a bad investment despite their reputation. The first time I worked at this company was less than a year, and in that time we went through 3 direct managers, 2 senior managers, and 4 directors. There was no stable leadership anywhere near the actual workers providing anything resembling direction. But I'm getting ahead of myself, let's talk about what they do worst ONBOARDING:  
  
During my exit interview at the end of my first tenure with the company, I used the words ""The worst and most disorganized professional experience of my life."" to describe my onboarding and early days with the company. I felt harsh at the time, but years later, on the first days as a manager on their flagship program I heard it described exactly the same way by several talented engineering as I had to run their exit interviews because they were quitting after less than a year due to the incompetent way their onboarding and subsequent tasking was handled. I'll talk specifically about my experience though.  
  
My first day starts with orientation. Turns out that for reasons I would find out later, nobody in may chain of leadership had submitted the paperwork the main gate needed to process my badge. Frustrating, seems like a low bar to hit, but adaptability is expected of engineers so I rolled with it and got some people on the phone to get it sorted. I finally get through the gate and get to orientation. Presentation is about what you would expect, the presentation is a dice roll of who you get and how seriously they take the presentation but nothing really to complain about there. After that though, your manager is supposed to come collect you, because your don't know where you're supposed to go yet and the campus security is armed and told to watch out for anyone wandering around trying to get in places they shouldn't.  
  
15 minutes after orientation, no manager. 30 minutes, no manager and no responses on his phone. 45 minutes later someone who WASN'T EVEN THE SAME MANAGER FROM THE INTERVIEW shows up and collects me. He let's me know he WOULD HAVE been my manager but in the time between my interview and now he replaced the previous manager and then decided to leave for another program, so, at the moment, I would have no manager. Interesting, but the eager young engineer I am, I roll with it. We get my my cubicle, I am shocked to find a a filthy, and i mean DISGUSTING (Looked like someone let their 2 year old eat lunch on it and then let it sit for months), but otherwise empty cubicle. I mean empty of all equipment that would allow me to do my job. No computer, keyboard, books, documents, drawings, NOTHING. Keep in mind, this is a company that will NOT allow you to use your own assets for work (as most companies wont) so I'm a little perplexed as to the riddle of how I'm supposed to do my job. The not-manager then proceeds to pull out his laptop and put in the equipment request IN FRONT OF ME and tell me that it will be about a week before they get delivered. In the mean time I should just sit tight and use conference room computers to do my mandatory training with a guest account, you know, when they're not being used for meetings. Which I wouldn't know, because THE CALENDAR REQUIRES A LAPTOP AND ACCOUNT TO ACCESS THEM! Ok, that's dramatic, I figured out a system to make it work (which was rather clever if you forgive my lack of humility) but the point is that the chain of coordination, leadership, and organization failures the company made that made this necessary is absurd and unacceptable and I should have gotten up and walked out on the spot.  
  
I'm writing this, because I hope that you have the self-respect to hold them accountable to their failures and not be intimidated by the size of the company or the Level of the manager. The experience only gets worse from there so I'll add more cautionary tales. Engineers are leaving large aerospace contractors in droves and I feel like they will never change and hold their leadership accountable until the negative experiences are shared with the engineers that are the backbone of their profit margins. Coming up next.... an engineer with NO MANAGER for four months has to figure out how to run an entire team himself because one of the largest aerospace contractors in the world can't keep their leadership appropriately staffed!",TheSpaceshipMechanic,2,0.75,0,1708905901,2024-02-26 00:05:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b03cja/managed_expectations_working_for_aerospace/,2,2024

1b030a0,Seeking Career Advice: At A Crossroads in my Life,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently at a crossroads in my career and could really use some advice. I recently received a job offer that seems promising, but it's located far from my home. I'm torn between accepting it and continuing my job search for something closer.

Here's a bit about my situation:

- My previous job involved a combination of roles: research and development specialist (handling product registration and coordinating with suppliers), quality assurance analyst (conducting physicochemical analysis and managing raw materials), and document control for ISO documentation.

- While the new job offers a good salary, I'm concerned about the distance and potential impact on my work-life balance. I have debts to pay, but I also received separation pay that can sustain me for a couple of months.

- I believe I can find a job with a similar salary closer to home, but I'm unsure about the job market and remote job opportunities in my field.

I'm seeking advice on the following:

1. Should I take the job offer despite the distance, considering my financial obligations and the separation pay I received?

2. What other job opportunities should I explore given my previous experience? Are there remote job options or online opportunities that align with my skills?

3. How can I effectively search for remote job opportunities in my field? Are there specific platforms or strategies I should consider?

Any insights, advice, or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!",ohshites,2,0.75,0,1708905034,2024-02-25 23:50:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b030a0/seeking_career_advice_at_a_crossroads_in_my_life/,2,2024

1b02g4b, To Take a Year-long Placement or Risk My Chances?,"
I'm in a real dilemma regarding my career path and could use some advice from this wise community. I'm currently in the second year of my MEng Integrated Masters in Mechanical Engineering, a 4-year course, UK Student (Home). Since last September, I've applied to over 100 companies for a summer internship or placement, reaching the final assessment center stage with only three and receiving only offer from Siemens Energy.

I had continously updated my CV and done many mock interviews with positive feedback - I just get the short end of the straw unfortunately.

Here's the crux of my dilemma: accepting this placement would extend my degree to 5 years. Is seizing this opportunity the right move, or should I aim for a placement closer to my final year, considering the conventional wisdom about penultimate year placements? Given my track record with applications, I'm not confident about securing another placement or summer internship next year if I pass on this.

I'm thrilled to have received an offer but simultaneously overwhelmed by the logistics and implications. The placement is a 40-mile drive from where I live, translating to an 80-mile round trip and roughly 2 hours of commuting each day. I've inquired about deferring the placement for a year, but unfortunately, that's not an option Siemens provides.

I'm really torn. On one hand, this placement could provide invaluable experience and a significant edge in the job market post-graduation. On the other, the commute and extended duration of my studies are significant considerations. Plus, the uncertainty of securing a placement next year if I decline this offer is a constant worry.

What would you do in my shoes? Accept the placement and adjust my course duration, or take a gamble and search for opportunities next year, potentially closer to home or in my penultimate year? Any insights, personal experiences, or advice would be greatly appreciated.

P.S I do have an offer for summer internship again at a civil company that I did a summer intership last year as well. But I don't see it as beneficial to repeat.

I’d much rather ask for clarification than do something on my own, mess it up, and cause a bunch of issues. That’s why I worry and ask so much. 

My manager pulled me aside and told me that he sees how nervous I am, and he wants me to be more independent in the role. I totally understand where he’s coming from, but I figured the first few weeks of any job were fair game. Meaning, this is the period when I can ask and learn as much I need to, and it’s understandable. 

Now I’m worried that they’re gonna fire me for not learning fast enough in the few weeks that I’ve been there so far. I will try as best as I can to do everything on my own, but again, I don’t want to take on something that I’m unsure of, potentially mess it up, and then get in trouble for messing it up.

However, I have also been considering going for the DPT route, but the schooling costs are around $110k, and I still need to complete one pre-requisite and then apply to the program.

But it would just take longer for me to get into it. I know that DPTs make around 80k starting, but I would eventually work in the Home Health setting where there is more pay (around 110K - 120k), plus I like the idea of driving around and not having to deal with any co-workers, and working by myself.   
  
What I am looking for in a career is decent to good pay, less stress, and work-life balance. I’m not sure which route would be a better investment, or just better in general in terms of the career, and if I will regret the DPT choice or not If I go down that route. I have also shadowed both and that still hasn’t helped with my decision

1azwu6o,Top Management wants to put me on a PIP.,"I work in sales and as any sales person, I have a monthly target that I must achieve. To give some context, I started this job a year ago. The probation is 6 months and to get the job permanently, I need to achieve my monthly target at least once in these 6 months. 

I startedted off selling our solutions to SMES( first 3 months of my job). It was hard and after noticing how much the SME was struggling, I was scared. Then an opportunity, came up for me to work with enterprises in a different city then I originally work in. They were struggling to find someone for the job, so they put me there. I was worried because it’s a different city, I don’t know much about it. But the meetings were mainly online and if I had to commute to a client meeting , it was going to be a 2 hour drive.  So, I figured why not try. And I thought I would achieve my target faster, so I can get confirmed.  Which is what ended up happening. I got lucky and within my first 2 months in enterprise got the job permanently. It was hard, the leads were not coming in, so I needed to do lots of cold calling and prospecting. I got lucky in the sense that the prospects I called at the time needed our solution. Also once thing to mention is that, this city they put me in has been untouched by any sales person for 3 years and our competitors have been dominating it there while we weren’t focusing. I didn’t see this as a problem until I saw the lack of sales.

Anyway, since dec it’s been dry sales for me. Nothing coming in. Lots of leads, I worked hard on it and got lost due to budget constraints and just overall it not being a priority for my clients anymore. This was not good because I didn’t have much a pipeline. (Since I was building it myself). Nevertheless, I kept on hustling and commuting 2 times a week to the other city to have physical meetings with my prospects.  At this point my manager sits with me and warns me I need to get my numbers up or I’ll be put on a PIP. I keep trying but the issue is we recently increased our prices like crazy. And clients are not liking it( so lots of sales people are closing deals anymore) and unfortunately since I have been no sales since Dec… it’s looking really bad from my end. 

My manager sat with me 2 weeks ago and told me he has been fighting with top management as they want to put me on a PIP( I’ll be terminated within 2 months if I don’t improve). He said he has pushed until the end of April as a max but after that for sure I’ll be put on a PIP. 
I explained my struggles in this market, and the lack of inbound/ outbound leads. And how it takes time to generate leads by prospecting…not all leads will be hot. He knows, but he can’t do much.

The funny thing is other sales people have done worse than me and not been put on PIP’s. It’s rare …but I know of some people who are just sailing through.

The company has high turnover between sales people. Now I know why. 

Im scared. I don’t even know my new target for 2024 yet. I feel like a failure. I’m really trying my best …still doing the commute to the other city for multiple meetings in a day ( and they don’t pay for gas btw)..and still no results. I have some big sharks in the pipeline, but they will take time to come through. We have a minimum number of input we need to do in a day, and I always exceed it…because if I don’t we also get called out. 

Any advice on what should I do? Is the problem me?

1azw8ws,Mechanical engineer with experience in Sales and Procurement seeking advice if going back to an on-floor engineering job would be a step back in my career or it would be better to continue my career as a Commercial engineer.,"Background: I am a Mechanical Engineer. I always wanted to make interesting stuff, hopefully invent something new and which led me into Mechanical engineering. Got good grades, a couple of good internships and participated in SAE Baja. Entering the workforce during covid did not help as there were many layoffs and not many jobs. Had to enter the workforce as a procurement engineer and the company shifted me to sales due to my man management and communication skills. Later shifted jobs and became a supply chain officer. Now trying to get into project roles, so that I am closer to a project and can work as an actual mechanical engineer. But finding opportunities is difficult to come by.  
  
Currently, I don't know if it is worth pursuing a career in Mechanical engineering as my fellow mechanical engineers pursued careers in software development and IT and have made it further in pay and career advancement. I see fellow engineers now pursuing an MBA and trying to move to marketing and Finance. I always wanted to move to management but only after considerable experience as an Engineer. Some of my friends say with sales experience, I will never be able to get entry level management positions in an Engineering firm without floor experience and the best I will be able to do is become a sales manager. At this point after 4 years of experience in Sales and Supply chain, if I am going to go back to engineering jobs I have to take up entry level positions and a pay cut. My 4 years will be mostly not useful and will be like starting over. I feel lost at times and don't know what to do or how to plan my career ahead. Feel that I am behind my peers in my career and feel my decision to go back to the shop floor will take me back to the staring point (restart) of my career.  
  
I am not targeting any particular industry as I believe it is futile in this job market and would go to any industry which has to do with mechanical engineering. I initially wanted to get into sustainability but finding entry level positions is extremely difficult and what i have heard is you mostly do very less engineering and more accounting and the growth and pay is also not very great.  
  
What I would like to ask people here is, Is it worthwhile looking for and starting over as a mechanical engineer at lower pay and would such a career decision help me in the long term? As I mentioned earlier, After a few years I would like to get into management/consulting hopefully in an Engineering firm and would my Mechanical/Project engineering experience which I would gain now if I make the switch, be useful, as opposed to continuing my current career path as a sales engineer/procurement engineer. Are there any people who took a step back such as above who could maybe share their experience or someone who have had fulfilling careers in sales and Procurement engineering.  
  
I am open to any and all advice. Thank you in advance.

1azvekk,Do you think my work environment at work sounds bad and/or strange at all?,"I work at a office job at a large company. Here's what it's like:

1. There's 3 people on my team, my manager and 2 coworkers. Both of my coworkers are about 30 to 40 years older than me. My manager joined the company about the exact same time as me. I would say my manager differs any questions I have to my coworkers about 90 percent of the time.

2. Whenever there's any event outside of work like a team lunch, my coworkers don't show up. Instead it's always just me and my manager. I believe my coworkers don't show up because they just don't want to. I think they just care about money when it comes to work.

3. My coworkers say they're 'busy' pretty much 100 percent of the time and if I ever need to ask then a question they seen to say they're 'too busy' about 90 percent of the time. Personally, to me, it kind of seems like they're faking that they're extremely busy. Thats just my perspective though.

4. My manager never asks what I'm doing. For example, this week I could sleep at my desk the whole week and he wouldn't notice or say anything.

5. It seems like my coworkers strongly want to live in the past. Like, they have windows XP on most of the computers for our team and they seem very uninterested in new technology tools like Jira.

Do you think this sounds like a bad and/or strange work environment. Would you like a work environment like this?",Ben5544477,1,1.0,1,1708886732,2024-02-25 18:45:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1azvekk/do_you_think_my_work_environment_at_work_sounds/,2,2024

Been with the company for 8 years and this is the first time I've gotten myself in trouble. Honestly just disgusted with myself and right now feel like all the work and progress I've made over these years have been for nothing.

Manager who's meeting with me is Honestly a sound guy but I know he's got a job to do and he is a hard ass when it comes to this kind of thing.

1azu9cm,Did I ruin my chances at a stable work life? How to change?,"A bit of backstory: I’m 29F, from a third country. Initially, I had a decently going career as an ESL teacher in my home country. Did that for four years, looking into progressing ok once I finished my degree. My work places were highly renowned, but teacher salaries were always not great. Watching my colleagues with as much time in their careers as I had of age, extremely exhausted and working crazy hours for nothing…well, I decided I didn’t want that for me. 

With the support of my parents, I moved out to Iceland to pursue a degree in Icelandic, intending to settle there. For a masters, I’d pursue something a little more marketable, but you can’t really live there well without a command of the language and I thought myself in love with it. I worked part time (and sometimes full time) at a restaurant doing basically everything a waitress, a hostess and a shift manager does. Four years after, I’m almost done with my degree but I no longer live there and no longer can. It almost killed me, in many ways. 

My husband and I are still based in Europe, still want to stay here, but I see no sense in continuing my degree. All I want at this point in life is a stable job with a decent progression that pays okay. Nothing insane, it’s just me and husband after all, but I don’t think I want to be working service like waiting tables forever - but I also wasted four years in a degree that’s useless and that I don’t even know if I can finish. 

I’m hopeless and scared and I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any passions that can turn into a career and I’m not averse to studying something just to work with it without having any natural inclination or love for it. I just want a job that makes me feel like I’m going somewhere, even if it’s nowhere glamorous.

1azsqb5,Got a job offer,"Hello all,

A little bit of background, I live in a small little town in KY. Avg income is 20k, avg house hold income is 40k for my area. For reference. 

I’m in my 30s. I’m currently a retail store manager. I make around 54k a year plus a chance to receive a 10% of my salary bonus at the end of each year so currently a $5,400 bonus check. This bonus is performance based and I’ve received it every year so far but obviously it’s not always guaranteed. I’m salary, work 50+ hours week. Days are split days off. Been doing this job for around 4.5 years.

I have just received a job offer as a loan officer for a local bank. I know a couple of the loan officers and president. Good people. They have offered me 60k a year. The schedule is better, Monday-Friday and one Saturday a month for 4 hours. Holidays off. Laid back, freedom encouraged, no quotas to meet at this bank. 

Current retirement for me stock. Retirement at bank is 401k.

I’m still figuring some other details out such as any bonuses, how raises work, opportunities to move up, etc. but so far this is the base of what it looks like. 

I like my current job now to a point, but I have no work life balance. I feel like I work all the time. I get phone calls all the time, some weeks working 6 days a week. Etc. I feel burnt out. What keeps me there is I have a pretty good boss, have pretty good employees, I like the community and customer interactions. But like I said, I feel like I don’t ever get a break, I work a lot, and there’s a lot of headaches involved in retail  management.

Pay, I get paid weekly now and bank is monthly pay.

The bank is less hours, basically 40 hours a week vs my now 50+. If you look at pay on the hour, technically I’d be getting a big bump in pay on the hour trading more pay for less hours.

What do you guys think? Seem worth it? Opinions? Suggestions? Pay and schedule??

1azsnd8,2 months into a new position and I realize I don't like the job,"Title says it all. The first 2-3 were great and I was getting a lot of good feedback. Following weeks I got a little deeper into the role and while I’m still receiving good feedback (aside from corrections to learning curve mistakes) I’m finding that I have no desire or interest in performing the tasks given to me - not out of laziness either. After carefully looking inward I’ve realized that I’m just not the right fit for the role. The job itself is IT/tech support heavy and I prefer people-facing type of work (I went from medical background to this role). I take accountability for not doing enough due diligence.

I know my next step is to find a new job or return to my old position and I’m wondering what the best approach to that would be.

1azsj40,Plumber/Pipefitter or U.S Border Patrol?,"Hello all. After 4 years of dicking around after high school, dropping out of college twice, backpacking throughout Europe, etc, I have decided to finally “start” my life and get going on a career. I’m now in the gym 4x a week, running, studying Spanish, etc. Improving myself.

Anyways, I’ve narrowed down my career path to these two options. Both pay great, have great benefits, plenty of time off (I love traveling), and you retire with a pension (if you’re union in the trades). Both would make my passion for language learning useful and something that would advance my career.

You’re also doing meaningful work in both, which is important to me (I lean left and am pro-immigration btw before anyone accuses me of being a MAGA supporter for even asking ab BP).

Some pros I see for plumbing is that you’re much more in control of your own schedule, esp in the union, and I want to own my own business one day, which would obviously be easier w/ a highly in-demand skill such as plumbing. But if I went BP I could just do personal training on the side or something; I’m passionate about fitness.

Some pros I see for Border Patrol is more job stability and a more “exciting” job, but I’m not sure if this is actually accurate or not.

1azrkjc,"In business, can you treat ""let's get together sometime"" as a real invitation?","If someone in a purely social situation says, ""let's do lunch"", I have learned to just treat it as a meaningless statement.

However, if there are potential business benefits to knowing someone, if the person says, ""let's do lunch"" or ""let's get together"", may I assume that since normal social rules don't apply in business, you can and should respond by proposing specific dates and times?

Specifically, I have a neighbor who went to the same university that I did, at around the same time, and we work in the exact same industry.  A family member pointed that out, so I contacted the neighbor on LinkedIn, pointed out the commonalities, said, ""happy to meet sometime"", and the neighbor responded with, ""yes, we should meet sometime"".  I assume that since it's a potential business connection, then I need to propose something specific for a meeting?

I worked for a company that was tasked with testing features on let's say a smart speaker in a facility. Signed NDA etc etc.The company tasked with the testing abruptly stopped. Told all the workers to stay home. Apparently, the testing company had no idea what happened. Locked out of the testing facility ,all the smart speakers where seized by the manufacturer. Fast forward 4 years later and there is a new company coming into the facility doing the same thing. I applied online, told them I worked for the previous company, told them I knew what the job entails and how I missed it very much.... Then I got to thinking....
    Should I have even told them that I worked for the previous company? Are they more likely to say they don't want anyone from the previous company because of the way the old company ran things? They want new people for the new products?
Or are they more likely to say oh we got some people from the last company let's get them in here they know the facility and we just show them how we run things?

1azprfw,Nurse practitioner to physician,"Hello everyone! Sorry if this is long winded.

I'm turning 30 this fall. I currently am a nurse practitioner, have been working as one for the past 7 months. About 2/3 way through my NP program I realized I really wish I had pursued medical school, but kept with my program and even did a one year ""residency"" to help me feel  better prepared.

Every day I go into work wishing I wasn't a midlevel, wishing I had just done the whole thing of going to medical school. The problem is my husband is a second year med student and we want to start having kids in the next year or two. I just don't see how time or location wise I would be able to manage it, especially since wherever we go for residency won't be near any family to help raise our children.

I have a strong desire to be a mom, but I also have this huge itch to go to medical school. There are parts of being an NP that I love but overall my job is pretty crappy. I get paid 84k currently to do the job of a physician (I do have a physician I can go to with any questions), and the liability of a physician. If I were to pursue med school I'd have to quit this job because I put in around 50+ hours a week. I'd likely go back to working as a nurse. 

My husband is in military so I could use his GI bill to pay for 3 years of my schooling, which he has brought up himself. He's very supportive. 

The only way it could realistically work is if I got into school near wherever he gets into residency, which would make it even that much more difficult to pursue. I don't see us doing long distance for 3+ years.

Or do I just suck it up and be an NP and maybe pursue when kids are a lot older? 

Any tips are appreciated. ",Comfortable-Job-3011,4,0.8100000023841858,3,1708872917,2024-02-25 14:55:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1azprfw/nurse_practitioner_to_physician/,2,2024

1aznp6a,Need Advice for Navigating a Tough Workplace,"Hey everyone,

I could really use some advice on a tricky work situation. Here's the lowdown:

WFH Double Standards: My boss works from home a lot due to family stuff, but when I asked for the same due to a fever or something, it was a straight-up no.

Blame Game and Chaos: The boss’s boss blames my team for software problems he asked for, and then blames our team for others quitting due to overtime. But he never fixes the real issues.

Communication Breakdown: My boss's boss is MIA most of the times, not picking up calls or answering emails, yet expects everything done pronto without clear priorities.

Trust Issues: Other teams shut down ideas without even talking about them, and it feels like there's zero transparency.

I'm new in this organisation, and I want to figure out how to handle this mess and still learn something useful. Any tips or advice would be awesome.

1aznig1,am i being taken advantage of as a 17 year old waitress?,"I've been working as a waitress at a restaurant for 7 months now, and I'm thinking of quitting.  
  
On Saturday and Friday I work 6-whatever time the restaurant closes which can be 10-11:30 as it depends on when the customers leave. I stay as the last employee when my co-workers all leave at 10 with my manager and hoover and mop the entire restaurant floor and set the bar up by refilling the sauces and drinks, drying all the glasses and cutlery from the wash and putting them away, refilling small commodities given as freebies to customers and clean the toilet once a week. I'm the only waitress and I feel really overworked, not to mention not once in 7 months have I taken home any tips. I've just putting them in a jar under the bar and have had not a clue where they go as I was too nervous to ask but only my most recent shift asked if i could keep 10 pound and my manager told me 'put it in the jar and ill take care of it'. Sometimes he'll give me an extra 10 or 5 on top of my 8 pound wage but that isn't cutting all the money I've been specifically given by customers.  
  
I used to have a co-worker waitress but she had a surgery and now she works in the back on Fridays and Wednesdays. So, my manager asked me if i had any friends who i could work with stating he wants someone in the bar and someone on the restaurant floor. After i told my boyfriend that, he told me that my manager could easily find a waitress but he wanted me to find one as he won't have to pay them as much as they wouldn't be a minor.  
  
I don't know if I'm overreacting or something but i just feel like my manager is trying to be as cheap as possible as I'm doing the job of probably 2/3 people but my main issue is I'm being overworked and underpaid. Do i quit? What do i do?

1azkfxa,Please guide me on what I should proceed with ,"I'm a CS student in the final years.  
I just know basic C, Python, Shell, Java, MySQL, Lex (Flex), YACC (Bison). And I'm really confused with what should I focus on, like Web development, App dev (like Android studio), CyberSecurity, ML, Networking, Data Analyst, .....

Please take time to read and guide me accordingly. I'm just scared for what's to come.

So, the thing is, I have only seen what Android app development and Web development (HTML, CSS, Python, Django) looks like.  I have no clue what the others look like or the kind of coding/skills I need to learn/develop for it. I'm really stuck and been googling stuff with no positive results.

**1.Web development:**

As far as I know, I'm finding the front end (HTML, CSS) to very be dull. Do devs really learn them and code it line by line with 'divs' and all    OR    use UI making/designing tools to make the front end quicker ? And yes, the backend requires manual coding.

This is what comes to my mind about Web development as a whole.

Front end, CSS - [https://imgur.com/a/KHiEhXF](https://imgur.com/a/KHiEhXF)

Front end, HTML - [https://imgur.com/a/igezKlh](https://imgur.com/a/igezKlh)

Backend - manage.py, views.py, urls.py, models.py

**2.App dev (like Android studio):**

Also, here what I know is, its similar to Web Development. We have backend with Kotlin/Java (like Python/Django in Web).... Then we have front end XML (like HTML in Web). So somewhat similar, but I'm expecting the backend to be broader here with more complex stuff.

This is what comes to my mind about Android/App development as a whole.

Front end - All those XMLs, RAW files, Drawables etc.

Back end - [https://imgur.com/a/ppJWlXJ](https://imgur.com/a/ppJWlXJ) , all those Java, Kotlin files.

**3.CyberSecurity, ML, Networking, Data Analyst and other fields:**

Zero clues. Doesn't know anything about what languages are used, what the coding looks like (compared to the above pics), the tools, code structure. The internet tells me that I need lots of patience and have to develop lots of knowledge which is really time consuming and would take years to catch up with the others and get a job. I don't even know if math skills are required here (which the above ones doesn't require as far as I know). Please provide me with the relevant info. And set of codes from files, the structure etc...

I saw this from one of the reddits *""I'm a cs engineer and I've been working as a data scientist for almost 3 years now. Currently, my job is around 60% of creating ppts, interacting with business stakeholders, meetings , 20% of creating power BI dashboards, and 20% of working with python and sql to analyze data or (rarely) build ml models."".* Don't know how complete this is about a Data Scientist. And not sure if you guys actually get what I'm looking for. Please bear with me for this.

I find the Backend to be my thing with the 1st two. But really would like to know if anything else exists that's even better for me. I also enjoy making simple C programs on my own that solves problems based on the concept in my mind, like for eg: finding FIRST, FOLLOW, searching, sorting, etc...

To conclude, I would like to say I really have no info about it and doesn't know which one to pick. And if anyone manages to help, please tell from where I should be self learning about these?

1azke3y,I am a lawyer but my passion is in the arts :( ,"Hey everyone, 

I (26F) come from a Desi Muslim family and my father really wanted me to be a doctor my whole life. There was a lot of pain and fighting involved in me getting him to stop pushing that on to me but then my options were either engineering or legal. I went for legal, graduated - I am content with where my career is going right now but it doesn’t bring me joy. 

If I stop deriving my self esteem from a title then I realise that my legal career brings me no joy whatsoever. 

My true passion has always been in the performance arts. The stage is where I’ve always wanted to be. I’ve been on the stage since a very young age as well, performing in school productions. I write poetry, I can perform theater, I am an okay dancer and I can sing. I want to use my art to heal the world because I know healing myself and others is my purpose. 

It’s just so scary in this economy to think of a career switch like that…

I am also afraid of what people are going to say, whether I will ever make it, how will I fund or support myself… 


any help, advice, comment is appreciated

1azjyty,Continue study vs Take online course,"Anyone who is in IT here? I’m really need  help with some opinions. 

Hi guys, I(27m) have a degree in IT. I have a 3 years exp in web development. Currently, I just changed my job from software developer to High Level Control (HLC) system executive. The main reasons are due to workplace distance and family reason. 

Lately i found a bit bored from my current job. I love to code and I have a dream to develop my own website & apps in the future. 

It seems like being a HLC executive is a bit boring but I quite near to my family right now and have a quality time with my 2 years old daughter.

Therefore, I am thinking to continue my study in master of IT/CS. It’s also one of my goal to get a phd in my field study. However, i afraid if this is the right choice or the right time. 

Some people say taking online courses is better since it is shorter and less expensive. 

But i also think that continue my study is also good opportunity to elevate myself and be a prof in IT sounds good to me. 

As people who have many exp and insights in IT world, what do you guys think?

If you are in my shoe, which want will you probably take and why?

1azen39,Underemployed but good company don’t know what to do," Looking for some career advice!

So I have 5 years experience in CPG area jobs… and I only make $70,000 (high cost of living city). Most of my experience was for a distributor/wholesale and I also worked corporate for a store as well. One of my jobs if I had stayed I’d be a product manager by now and I’m really regretting leaving but their office isn’t where I live now anyway. My last job laid me off. So I accepted the job I got which is basically entry level again, everyone else in my position seems to have barely any experience. I feel pretty embarrassed that I’m so overqualified and I’m starting all over once again. I had been applying and interviewing for jobs paying 20,000 more. 

However, my manager is really great, the company is good, it’s fully remote with flexible time off. But while I’m not that career driven I’ve barely done any work and it’s bothering me that I should have a higher level job by now/ the fact that my past jobs had way more to do than this one. Plus being single and still with loans, it definitely hurts that I should be able to make more. 

My first like job check in with my manager is coming up and I’m wondering if I should say I feel overqualified. She’s even mentioned hoping I don’t quit because I haven’t had much work yet haha. I’m thinking I’ll also mention that I can do like any work at all whether it’s technically my responsibility or not, just to learn more. But it’s complicated knowing I could do so much more and not being sure there’s much for me to work towards at my job now at least quickly especially as I don’t think I want to be a manager on my team as it’s basically just selling

B) go the white collar route. Get a customer service job at a big company while learning sql and tableau in hopes of becoming a data analyst in the near future. Pros are working remote and making a good salary. Cons are job insecurity and dealing with a possibly harsh corporate culture/hellscape.

His feedback to me:  
It was along the lines of this ""You have been here for about 8 months and came in with some experience in what we do. During those 8 months, you were learning the ropes and I can appreciate you are humble.  
I am not too sure but I feel you are not shy, but maybe hesitant. I'd like to see you participate more and ask questions, even pushback if you don't agree with something. I know we are in different time zones and that could complicate things, but I'd like to see you more collaborative this quarter. I want to put you on a project but I don't know where to put you""

""You've mentioned in X meetings that we are evaluated us on a few factors. I'd like to know what they are.

I understand the volatility of our jobs and that it could be difficult for you, if possible, it would be nice to understand a base of what exactly the company is looking for from me""

To be honest, I feel a bit frustrated because I am not exactly extroverted but not crazy introverted. We have 30 min virtual meetings 2x a week and I sit with other people who have a lot of experience in the company and they have amazing ideas. Also, slack messaging is where sometimes people share their findings.

1azbdg3,I can't decide what I want to do (too many options not too few),"I am at a loss how to continue my education and career.

I did a couple semesters towards a business degree and while I absolutely hate it and am not great at it in college, throughout my jobs I've always been praised and went above and beyond expectations.
(No brag, just to put it into perspective that I'm not just talking out my ass, I worked at Amazon for a while as a student and they even extended my contract to what was possible max. etc.)

Now I genuinely hate being in an office. I don't like interacting with people, I don't like making connections, I don't like business in general. However, unfortunately, I seem to be really REALLY good at it.

I used to be interested in becoming a project manager but that job title seems to hold less and less value and is just used for any managerial position tbh. I also can't believe some of the qualifications they expect for an ENTRY position. But that's no news for any job I suppose. Also I'm not sure if there is much specialization unless you get an MBA or do online courses such as CSM on top of a general business degree. However through online school it seems like aquiring a business degree would be good enough.

I am interested in trying to get into vet school but I want a backup plan because it's obviously a very prestigious and hard thing to do. I love animals, biology and chemistry and want to help them where I can. But again, this is probably the hardest path/ taking a bit of a gamble as I don't have a good portfolio for this as of this moment and would start building experience from here on out to the best of my abilities (through internships, volunteering, side jobs etc etc).

I was thinking about data science, potentially going through one of the courses offered online where you also get externships etc.. I used to be a business Informatics major but at the time I didn't have drive to learn so I switched to business. However I am confident that I could get my ass up nowadays to learn what's needed.

Another thing I've been playing with is home inspection. I'm someone who is really keen on detail and I already kind of do it in every home I am (friends, family) just to myself and without tools so to speak. Just seems like a fun thing to do, however I get that self-employment is always a risk.

I've also played with the thought of going through nursing school to become an RN and then maybe a CRNA (Nurse anesthesist). I love science, especially biology and chemistry, so I feel like this would be a great way to help with that.

Similarly to that I have been thinking about going to school to become a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer which is an associate with externships (about 2.5 years total).

My skills are in biology, chemistry, business, languages, management (I just love it I don't know maybe a spectrum thing) and it might sound superficial but I just want to make good money. I have to be honest with myself since I like living comfortably. I also am a fast learner.

I've been wrestling with this for years now and I need to finally make a decision so any input is welcome.

1azajm0,how to break into an analyst role?,"Hi everyone,  
  
I need some advice on how to land a job as an analyst in a good company. I'll keep it brief but provide enough context about myself. I'm 32 years old and graduated in June 2023 with a Bachelor's degree in Business (MIS minor). I moved from CA to OH a few months ago and plan to stay here for now.  
  
I worked as a bank teller for 2 years. I was good at my job and also handled tasks like account opening, closing, ATM maintenance, and anything else my manager would ask me to do. I didn't really like the job because customers were often rude and demanding, and the workload was very heavy, but it was good for the time I was in school. Before that I worked as a sales associate in a retail store, and prior to moving to the US was a regional manager for a retail business in my country.  
  
I've been unemployed for the past few months and have been applying to analyst roles, accounting jobs, and almost any role that involves analysis for the past two months. I have almost applied to 100-150 jobs. I'm mostly using LinkedIn to apply for jobs. I've had some interviews but haven't had any luck in securing a job. I got the Google Data Analytics certificate to help me stand out when applying, but it hasn't helped me land a job yet.  
  
Honestly, I'm considering going back to my job as a bank teller while I continue to search for a new position. There are days that I just feel like I'm getting old without achieving a good career and it can be frustrating sometimes not getting any responses after interviews.  
  
I want to work in an office, and I'm aiming to break into a career with a starting pay of around $25-$30 an hour and the potential to reach $100k a year within a couple of years.  
I would appreciate any advice on what kind of role or job is best considering my background. Or if any specific certificate can help.  
  
Thanks in advance.",Nalardi_Echidna70,1,1.0,0,1708821873,2024-02-25 00:44:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1azajm0/how_to_break_into_an_analyst_role/,2,2024
1az9lvv,When to throw in the towel,"I'm a 32m, live in Raleigh NC, and have worked as a freelance software developer for 5 years. I go to school for Software Engineering simultaneously.

I graduated from a boot camp in 2017, this boot camp no longer exists (NYCDA).  For the past 5 years I have worked on Upwork doing freelance software development jobs. 

I've barely been able to get by working these freelance jobs. Most of the jobs I either complete, get fired from, or eventually the client stops working with me. Admittedly a lot of these jobs are crap and they're mostly inconsistent.

While doing this I was hoping to get a salaried gig. Two years ago I did. A year later I was fired for failing to complete a very complex task (essentially working with a big ball of mud). After this happened I went back to working freelance again.

Recently I got a contract that I really wanted. I ended up working as a Full Stack Python Developer leading a project. Essentially just me and the client. I made a bad call architecturally, cost the client time and money, and was kicked off the project 2 weeks ago. This client was essentially nothing but good to me. Literally the perfect client.

After this, something in me just broke. I've sacrificed so much for this career.

 Living with my mom, sleeping on the floor, losing girlfriends, having no money, borrowing money from my parents, spending hours creating portfolio pieces, doing leetcode for hours, couch surfing with my friends, insane roomates. All over 5 years. 

Between work and studying I live like a recluse. I barely ever leave my house. A lot of the times I won't see or talk to another human being for 4 or 5 days. 

My friends and family tell me that I'm a pretty determined/stubborn guy when I set my mind on something. I've survived some pretty wild stuff.

But there is a point where I have to ask myself, why I'm doing this? Why am I living like this?

I'm 32. My friends are having kids, setting aside money for retirement, living their lives, actually socializing, making decent money.

I'm lucky if I'm making 500 dollars a week before taxes. I'm lucky if I talk to another human being twice a week. There's been weeks where I see no one. Just studying and contract work.

I've been seriously looking into starting an apprenticeship in plumbing. I'm prior service so I might be able to get in to an apprenticeship or something. Maybe look into classes. It's something that interests me and I think I'd enjoy it.

My question for you guys is this. When did you know when to quit a career? What were the signs? Am I just going through a hard patch right now?

Any feedback is appreciated.

1az8wcv,Behavioral Interview Question Dread - Sales/Account Management,"Context: I have worked in tech sales/account management for almost 5 years now, since graduating college. Interviewing externally for competitive account management role 

In prepping for my upcoming interview for an account management role that i want to knock out of the park, i’m nearly fully prepared…. Outside of a few dreaded behavioral questions i assume will be asked:
 - tell me about a time when you failed
 - tell me about a time when you excelled

I’ve had a great career at my current company, crushing my number every year as an account manager. That being said- I’m panicking horribly under the realization that I don’t have good cases to recite that really profoundly would sound good in an interview. Every failure i’ve encountered was with customers that already had communicated to us that they werent renenwing/were out of budget approval, and werent really a failure attributable to my efforts/work. Conversely, every success I’ve had has just been by way of hard work to get them the things they needed to sign/expand/upsell (whether that was just leveraging internal resources, badgering necessary teams (legal, engineering), or executing a successful but standard sales cycle.)  

In my success in this role, i’ve always just felt like a problem solver. Problems arose, and i subsequently addressed them and moved on. I truly have no examples worth boasting about or failures that could be productively highlighted.

Does anyone have any good examples ?

I was recently was admitted to Stanford's Master's in Electrical Engineering Program. I also have a job offer at a trading firm for a modeling role starting \~$125k in LA. I'd like to pursue this further education to both deepen my engineering fundamentals and increase my future job prospects. My plan is to stay in industry after completing my Master's. Stanford allows me to be a part-time, online student if I'd like. I'm trying to decide whether to 1) Take the job offer and pursue the Master's part-timeor 2) Reject the offer and pursue the Stanford Master's full time.  
  
In my opinion, I would need to go full time to make the most of my time at Stanford, allowing me to work with leading faculty, build friendships, and work on interesting projects. On the other hand, pursuing the part-time option would allow me to fund my education while getting relevant work experience. The job offer also comes with great benefits, but they wouldn't be willing to fund the Master's program. I'd like to get input on this tradeoff between being a full-time student in person and being a part-time, online student. I would really appreciate any guidance.

1az6euk,deciding whether to stick with job i hate,"Hey, I’m 21 years old and in college right now. I also work full-time as an EMT, and have been at my current position for about 3 months. I have about 2 and a half years of prior experience, but this job makes me feel stupid every single day. I had trouble learning to drive our rigs since they’re about 2 tons bigger than any rig I’ve ever driven. I’ve also been making a lot of mistakes since this job is so different from what I’ve done in the past; which my coworkers will gladly point out at any opportunity. This is my first time working with nurses so directly as RNs make up a majority of the team. As a 21 year old, I am finding it really hard to be able to relate to or have conversations with people who aren’t even close to me in age. There is no one even within 10 years of me on the team and it’s very isolating to me. 

That’s the negative side of things. The positive is that this job is very good for my future career (planning on applying to physician-scientist programs), I’m paid very well compared to any job I’ve had in the past, and there’s quite a bit of station downtime that let’s me work on school. 

What I’m wondering is if it would be crazy for me to jump ship so early into this job and search for more research-focused jobs. My city doesn’t have too many opportunities for research, so I would of course stay here until I found something. Or should I broaden my lens and look for work somewhere else? I’m not really sure what I should be doing right now and it’s causing a lot of stress on me.

1az5y3c,Which is the better option? Banking or high-ticket closing?,"Hi all,  
Looking for some career guidance to make the best decision long-term. For background, I'm a 24 year old associate working at a top US investment bank (think JP, MS, GS) in Treasury Services for high-growing tech corporates. I've worked at the firm in London for 2.5 years where for 18 months, i rotated across 4 different teams until joining full-time in the sales team in April last year (10 months in the role so far). I have one year of work experience before this in markets (FX Sales) at a European bank but left due to harassment from a manager.  
I worked really hard to get into this firm and don't come from a super privileged background so prioritised earning good money. Long-term, i think i want to start my own business / be a stay at home mom and thought i'd do corporate for a few years for experience. Now due to some personal issues, i haven't been performing at work and I'm on a performance improvement plan which seems to just be getting worse. I have realised i don't enjoy the role as much as i thought or the industry in general, i've lost motivation to try but then force myself to work because of the pay. My manager believes i'm not the right fit for the role and has suggested i search for other roles in the firm and he can help me move if i want that.. but now i feel like im screwed either way as even if i pass my PIP with flying colours, he may not give me good feedback. I made a decent salary (£80k) for my age and generally the work allows for a relatively good work life balance when compared to IB. I have around £26k saved, single, no kids, mortgage or debt.  
Separately, i used to work part-time for an entrepreneur in the education space as a high-ticket closer (glorified sales rep). In doing this, some months i almost made the same in commission as my full-time job. They have asked me to join full-time with them and it's fully remote. I'd work remotely in the evenings and not the mornings (7pm-1am, works as im a night-owl). I have the potential to make up to 10-15k a month in this but it's commission only so it's not guaranteed but depends on my ability to sell. They can also fire me much more easily than a large corporate so less security but i can move out of London and significantly reduce my living costs.  
Is this a wise move? I'm SO unsure what i want to do with my career and feel like i'm just coasting in my banking job without real joy or passion. I want out but i feel like i could regret this decision as i'm so early in my career without significant experience (2-5yrs) in one team.  
Should i leave/ take the risk with this sales job or carry on and stop whining because this is a great, high-paying and secure job?",Nayatar,1,1.0,0,1708810140,2024-02-24 21:29:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1az5y3c/which_is_the_better_option_banking_or_highticket/,2,2024
1az5htz,Should I go back to university at 29?,"TLDR: soon to be 29, master's degree in astrophysics got me nowhere, worked here and there for a few years but nothing stable, now I'm stuck. To get out of this situation I'm thinking about starting again by going back to university to do another degree. Does it make sense?

I'm almost 29, I already got a master's degree in astrophysics and I graduated just before the pandemic started. I spent the following 2 years trying to get into a PhD, studying the same things over and over just to see every entrance exam being delayed or canceled, and the few that actually happened were so full of people that I had no chance (talking like 200+ people for 2 positions). In the end I was completely burned out and wanted nothing to do with the entire field.

I started looking at other possibilities. I did several online courses, mainly on programming and data science, but didn't really like it, and when looking for a job I couldn't get it because everyone wanted people with a computer science or data science degree.

Instead, I ended up writing articles for various websites, mostly on science and East Asian cultures. Over time, I got more and more into the second one, and I started thinking about going back to university to study East Asian cultures, but then I got an opportunity to work abroad and immediately took it. This led to a few other things, but by the end of the year I was again stuck at home. I started a blog and worked on that for all of 2023, but it didn't really take off. I've been applying for jobs again since November with no success. I recently applied for a big institution, but I won't know if I got accepted until June or so.

So, with very few work experiences on my back, a master's degree that got me nowhere, and no PhD, I'm stuck, so I'm again thinking about doing another degree to get out of this situation.

I would love to study East Asian cultures. I've always been good with languages and I already know a bit of Korean, Japanese, Mandarin and Cantonese from courses I did both in person and online. And of course I've always been passionate about the subject, even more so in the past few years. There is a great university that teaches this in a city that I know very well. I would have to move to the other side of the country, but since most of family lives there, I'm lucky enough to have people there to help me (but I still haven't talked about this with them, or anyone else tbh).

If I can complete the degree in 3 years I will be 32 (not counting a possible master's), which feels really old to start looking for a job again. But I guess that being in uni, I would get more opportunities and finding a job would be easier, right? Also, maybe I could move abroad with this, which is something I really want to do (not naming which country I'm from, but living here is hell).

What do you think? Does it make sense to start from scratch at 29? After years of not studying, is it hard to do it again? I don't care much about the age difference with other students, I'm more worried about investing (at least) three years and a lot of money just to be stuck again.",molamolasun12,9,0.8399999737739563,17,1708809044,2024-02-24 21:10:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1az5htz/should_i_go_back_to_university_at_29/,2,2024

I love playing and watching sports, adventuring, working out, among other things. Although this doesn't seem like a big deal, I worry that not having practicial engineering experience will hurt me in the long run. I've come to realize that academic performance is a very lackluster indicator of whether or not somebody is a good candidate for an engineering role. With this in mind, I find that outside of school, I have little to no interest in doing engineering-related activities. The spare time that most of my colleagues use to participate in EDT and FSAE and 3-D print CAD models, I would much rather be playing soccer with my friends and hitting the gym and checking out various places in the city. I have tried joining engineering student orgs, but I found that my passion quickly dwindled, and that my intentions for joining were not genuine.

With that being said, I think that a possible solution could be to get a job that is not necessarily engineering -based, but requires a lot of hands-on work. This way, I could build up my practical skill set. I was wondering what would be the best field for me to work in order to gain that type of experience. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

1az1xs2,2 Job offers. No clue how to pick.,"I recently lost my job and have been interviewing like mad.  Finally got 2 job offers.  

To give a background, I went to university for Environmemtal science and worked as an environmental tech as my first job out of school.  It was a good experience but paid very poorly so I ended up going back to serving then taking up sales afterwards which I enjoyed.  

Fast forward to today, I have two offers but for entirely different roles.  One is a Surveyor doing mostly land/topographic surveys.  Pays $21, a lot of the work is outside in FL.  The office is also a 10 minute walk from my apartment.  There is also an environmental department which I could move into which I expressed to the hiring team and they felt confident that I’d be able to do that.  

The other role is more of a sales development role as a surveyor.  Salary starts at 50K and has clearly defined metrics for pay bumps, which the first is a 10K bump, then next would be an additional 10K.  This does not include commission.  Downside is the job is a 40 minute drive from home so I’ll need to buy a car.  There are metrics you can hit that give you work from home days.  

My mom and SO are pushing me towards the first option.  But it’s hard for me to pass up on more money.  Not too mention I’m scared of what being outside working could do to my body long term.  One plus is that the start dates are a month apart so I can feel out the first job and jump if I’m not feeling it.  But I’m sooo conflicted.

1ayzc4s,Continue with CS Degree or pursue ESL teaching?,"Tl:dr: conflicted about continuing a CS Degree or stopping it to pursue ESL teaching.
Lot of anxiety about wasting my life, my prime years, and don't know what to do.


Hello, everyone.

Back in 2020, I finished my first year (out of 3) of my Computer Science course with a major in Software Engineering.
I paused my studies at the start of 2021 because I wasn't convinced if I wanted to continue and for the past 2 years I have just been working normal retail jobs.

Well, now it's 2024, and I have just finished my first week back at university and a lot of those doubts from 2 years ago have come back.
I do enjoy computer stuff. I've always had a passion for technology, but the course material is challenging (I knew it wasn't going to be easy)
 but another ""dream"" of mine is to become a language teacher.
But from what I know and through some research it doesn't pay as well.
I also know that getting into the Software Engineering space as a fresh graduate is extremely hard at the moment and I feel discouraged.

I guess I'm just looking for some guidance on what to do here.

 I'm 22 (turning 23 soon), in Australia and I have a lot of anxiety about wasting my life.
If I had it my way, I would be teaching ESL in Europe. I speak English & Italian and I'm conversational in Spanish. Currently studying some Turkish.

Comparison is the thief of joy, I know, but I feel like I'm ""behind"" and too indecisive.
I'm currently considering taking on a higher workload for uni so I can graduate quicker as the idea of spending 2 more years studying is also making me feel anxious.

Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you 🫠

1ayyvwa,Feeling like it's a lot harder than it needs to be for me to break into a $100k+ salary,"33M here in the US. I have an MBA from a large state school since 2021 and 3 YOE working with data, on top of another 3 years after my undergrad working with Excel and other tools used to analyze data and prepare internal/external reports. In school I even got my Six Sigma Green Belt and did a Capstone project/internship which were super helpful.

  
I totally understand that every year of experience matters. I feel at this point $100k is not some far off dream. When I finished my MBA I could only get $65k to start at a tech company in my medium sized city. I did well and after a year got a raise, but wanted to be an actual data analyst. What I was doing was more of a Process/Business Analyst role, so I did not want to miss this opportunity at a Logistics company.

  
Being a data analyst has been awesome, but I feel underpaid for this as well. I make right around $80k. No bonus this year as the industry is struggling and management is not making great decisions to really increase revenue (lot of old dudes who are near retirement). Also, my current manager is a good analyst but a bad manager. Never gives good feedback and is very passive. I feel like all growth is my own and all leadership skills I developed on my own without any mentorship.

  
Recently I decided it's time for the next step. Since January I have applied to nearly 100 positions and gotten a few interviews, which is great. 2 positions I feel really want me. One with a bank as a Sr Data Analyst, and one in Healthcare as a Lead Data Analyst.

  
After 3 interviews and a month total talking to them, the bank was excited to offer me the position for....$90k, along with ""VP"" in the title. While that sounds dandy, I told her that $100k was the minimum I would need to take the role, and I had mentioned this to her way back on our first call. She told me she thought I wanted ""at least $80k"" and I reminded her that I told her $80k is what I was making now, and wanted to push into six figures which she then told me was well within the range of this role. I was a little disappointed, but she said she would go back to the hiring manager and see what he says. I honestly would not be surprised if the bank ghosted me and I am back at square one after waiting a month on them.

  
The other role in healthcare seems promising, the recruiter told me to keep him in the loop of other interviews as the hiring manager liked my resume out of the other 77 who applied, and he told me interviews would begin scheduling next week. While I am excited, I have no idea if they are just blowing hot air.

  
Point is, as others have said on here, it can be really hard outside of the largest cities to break $100k. They will do everything in their power not to go there, but once you get in, the salary increases are much easier. I know this turned into some weird rant. I honestly know I will get where I want to go this year at this rate, but it is almost comical how weird employers can be with people who clearly have the experience.

  
Anyways, rant over. Hopefully this is an encouragement for you all to keep pushing until you get where you want to be. The process sucks but you have to keep going till the end!",idontknowyet,252,0.8399999737739563,188,1708792796,2024-02-24 16:39:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ayyvwa/feeling_like_its_a_lot_harder_than_it_needs_to_be/,2,2024
1ayycau,Afraid I made a huge mistake. Accepted an offer yesterday and woke up this morning panicking because I didn’t negotiate. ,"Accepted a position yesterday that is a 30% increase in pay. I’ll be going from 130k with expensive healthcare, no bonuses, and near daily pressure to grow my account to 170k amazing benefits, bonuses, long term incentives, and some benefits that I’ve never even heard of before. I am thrilled to have been chosen by this company for this position - the competition was stiff and I know this will be a life changing role for my career. 
All this being said, I woke up this morning really upset that I didn’t negotiate - like not at all. When I got the call that I had been chosen HR asked to confirm my address and salary ask I put in my application (165-170). At this time, I told them that after interviews, I felt I needed to ask for more. HR said what I asked for was mid-range, that they have to evaluate based on x,y,z and get back to me to present the offer…it could take a few days. The next day I got a call where we reviewed the offer and I was told 170 is what was approved which I accepted after a chat with my new boss the following day. 
I can’t get the words “mid-range” out of my head - I’m not a mid range employee. I am dedicated, loyal, passionate, curious, experienced and really humble (writing those last two sentences made me want to puke). I’m angry bc I feel like I didn’t advocate for myself. I was so grateful for the opportunity that I just rolled over and I really don’t want to resent this next step because I want to be here for like 10+ years. Like I said before, the benefits are amazing and it’s a windfall of cash (not stock or equity) starting after 3yrs and it’s all based on my performance (I’m not in sales and it’s a really stable industry). 
Why am I writing this…I guess I’m looking for experience from others? I always hear such aggressive advice about always negotiating but is it ok to just accept an offer that’s a dramatic improvement from where I am now? The company seems generous, compassionate and has no history of layoffs - they’re nonUS and take hiring very seriously. I’ve read reviews and they’re glowing. Can you help me get this semi-regret out of my head?

1ayy8vi,What kind of job lifestyle should I pursue if I want to focus time > money. Pros and cons of sales versus a Salary job?,"I am in my 20s and I am single.

Sales is great for making money but requires a lot of time and effort to learn and to produce numbers, in which could leave me little time in my days and/or week for pursuing my interests. If I did sales, I was thinking D2D since I can go out and brute force opportunities instead of waiting around like at a car dealership.

Working a salary job, preferably a part time job (provides me more time for myself throughout my week), will be much less mentally exhausting/challenging, but a part time could sometimes take me longer to try hobbies and interests, since I would make less money, depending on how expensive a hobby/interest is.

I would like to make as much money as I can in a shorter time, but I really only care to break even with my bills and have a bit extra for interests.

My current job I work at is pretty low stress and pretty monotonous, I want more, I’m 26 and I don’t get a whole lot of satisfaction at this job. I get paid good but it’s just kinda boring. My company has been in a pretty rocky spot with turnover and has had some pretty bad internal issues as far as the work we are performing and the relationships we have. It’s family owned but has gotten so big I know I’m just a number to them.
 
I have an offer on the table to go work as a sales/PM for a crane rental company and I’m not sure if I should do it. I don’t have any sales experience but I do want to try and get into sales. On top of that I’ve always been fascinated with heavy equipment and cranes so working with them would really excite me. Their offer matches my pay, plus commission. And a huge benefit is their office is 10 minutes from my house, I currently drive 1hr+ to get to work and on the way home over 1hr30 at times. 

Part of the reason I don’t want to leave is because I’ve gotten complacent and really comfortable because my job is pretty easy so why change what isn’t broken. Plus I’m just hella nervous to try something totally new, and the guilt of leaving my current team in a rough spot.

Part of why I do want to go is the closer drive, higher earning potential, get to work with something that excites me, and a good chance to learn some new skills and try something new.

1ayxlc2,Do I stay or do I go? 15-20k raise for a more junior position ,"I’m 25F and living with my boyfriend (we have no children). We’d like to buy a house in the next few years and have been saving towards that goal. 

I graduated 3 years ago and have been working full time for the same company since then. I started as a recruiting coordinator and was promoted 6 months ago into a recruitment specialist role. 

However, we’ve been hit hard with multiple rounds of layoffs over the past 1.5 years and have been on a wage freeze since before my role change. I’ve been promised a compensation adjustment but it would not come into play until Q1 of 2025 when the wage freeze will supposedly end. The entire team is also on reduced hours (30/week) for lower salaries than our original base, so I’m actually working for less than what I made when I was first hired, and in a new role with more responsibility. 

I love my team and my manager, and I enjoy the challenge of learning new things in my current role. I feel like what I’m doing now is valuable experience for moving up in my career later. However, I started interviewing elsewhere purely due to the money and received an offer for a senior coordinator position for a much larger company. I would still be remote but the role is a 12-month contract. There is possibility to extend but no guarantee. In Canada I would be considered a fixed-term employee - meaning I still have access to benefits and don’t have to manage my taxes like a true “contractor.”

My current salary with reduced hours is $43,500 CAD and my new offer is for $65,000 plus a 6% RRSP match. My current company has promised to return to full time hours and salaries as of summer 2024 which would bring me back to $50,000. I can pay my bills at my current salary and put $500 away in house savings every month but I also have no retirement savings.

I understand that taking the new offer would be the smart choice financially, but would be a step backwards professionally. From my research on the company, I also think it’s unlikely that the new role would convert to FTE at the end of my 12 month term. Ideally I would love if my current job could counteroffer to keep me, as we’re already stretched thin and I don’t know how they would cover my work. I’m just not sure if matching the other offer is something they’re financially willing or able to do right now.

I think I’m just looking for any objective input! I know the general rule is follow the money but I also want to prioritize my professional development at this stage in my career, and I think there’s alot of value in being with a supportive manager and team.

1ayvr3a,"Early 20s, stressful situation","I'm 22, and I finished a bachelor's degree last year in something I can't and don't want to work with. I wasted 3 years of my life on something I can't pursue. I think what happened is I got depressed and turned on auto-pilot robot mode to just finish it, instead of dropping out to do something else.

I'm interested in getting into a programming career instead because it seems like way more secure of a path, with less social pressure. You're more hirable if you actually have a real skill in something. Plus, I'm just very interested in learning all I can about computers.

The problem is, all these educations I'm interested in start after summer, so I have absolutely no idea what to do with my time right now. I would have applied for educations last year instead, but I took a year to study math to be eligible for it (which is what I'm doing right now). I picked the wrong high school program, which barely contained any math at all, because my country is stupid and allows for certain high school programs to skip math that's required for any higher education that matters. Also of course, because I'm stupid and picked the wrong high school program because I didn't know myself nor that this was the situation I'd land in. I wasn't a script kiddie, but I really should have been and now I'm paying the price as an adult.

It wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't just learned I'm being kicked out of my student apartment for not currently studying, because they just changed the rules at the worst possible time.

Technically, I have enough money to last me 2 years or so, and parents who are well off and willing to support me no matter what, but I need to learn to be independent. They are willing to purchase an apartment for me, but I'm afraid of letting them do that unless I earn a real income. Applied for every possible job that I can find that I'm qualified for in my town, not getting any of them afaik. I did get a ""test-work-day"" at a local cleaning company, I absolutely hated it but I'm obviously willing to stomach it if I end up getting nothing else, but I could possibly not get that either.

I have no close friends I could room with, no real skills that matter and absolutely not at a professional level nor am I passionate about polishing them, the only thing I'm interested in right now is to learn about programming and computers and I can't get paid to do that. I could move back home to my parents, but I don't think my chances of getting a job there are any higher. I could gamble with fate and try to self-study programming as much as I can, and then maybe my lack of income won't matter in a few years, but I could also be wrong about my perception of the programming world and find out I don't actually want to do that at all.

1ayvgn6,Advice: how do I choose?,"I currently work for a multinational company with very good prospects. It’s completely remote, no sign of RTO, great team, excellent benefits, work is fun but laid back, relatively easy. I appreciate all this and very much enjoy it. Total compensation is about 100k (US), with high likelihood of promotion and salary increases.

I am being head-hunted by a prestigious company in my field to join a team they are creating. This would be entirely different work, very niche, but I am one of the few people with experience in the field. I know some people on the team, they are also great to work with, the work would still have good work/life balance, it is also completely remote. The work would be mentally challenging, which I am looking forward to, and it could open a lot of doors in the future. For someone just starting out, it’s a very exciting opportunity. Total compensation (on first offer) is 115k (US), with the opportunity to negotiate up, but I talked with a friend on the team and their 13 years of experience nets them 135k. 

I think if it were just a question of work, how interesting it is, I would take the new job no question. 

However, there is another concern, and that is parental leave. Current company offers 14 weeks fully paid with option for extra time or a slow transition back as half-time, and, as a woman who wants to have children, this is big. The new company is in a male-dominated field, and has no parental leave policy at all. In their offer, it says I am welcome to take up to 12 weeks unpaid leave (with manager approval), which is pretty disappointing, but I am finding is also very common. After some math, if I decide to take that, I would be making $29k less per year than the salary stated, and therefore less than currently. 

A third option would be to use the new offer to leverage a higher pay for my current position, but I feel uncomfortable doing that. I’ve only been here for six months and have made friends with my manager. I was told that bringing an outside job offer may sour them for future promotions/treat you differently. 

I’m looking for some advice on how to approach the situation. I feel that regardless of what I decide, I will enjoy what I do. But babies are definitely in the future, and I would love to have time to spend with them. But I also love the challenging aspect of the job being offered. Any insight appreciated, especially from women!

1. The effectiveness it will have in the job market when I get out of the military in 2-3 years.
2. Not sure what career path I want to pursue when I get out.

The reason I started this program is because I wanted something broad that could be used in any industry.

1ayvb1j,Career Delima,"I've been performing the same role (a position that is significantly above my pay grade, involving direct interaction with executive management) for over two years now. Initially, I enjoyed it, but lately, it's become monotonous and frustrating. While my management appreciates how I enhance their image, I no longer feel challenged or able to learn anything new. Consequently, I believe it's time for me to pursue a different role. I've conveyed my dissatisfaction to my immediate supervisor and expressed interest in transitioning to other areas within the company. Despite assurances of a forthcoming move, I'm skeptical for several reasons:

1. No successor has been designated to assume my responsibilities.
2. Whenever I inquire about job openings, my inquiries are evaded.
3. My supervisor's superior (who is relatively new) has repeatedly emphasized my unique competence for the role and intends to retain me in it for at least another year.
4. Given the high visibility of my current role and the positive light it casts on the organization, there's little incentive for them to release me.

Despite enjoying the work I do, receiving favorable performance evaluations, and garnering recognition from top-level executives, the lack of challenge, coupled with the incompetence of the new boss whom I find intolerable, has led me to feel like I'm squandering my time.

Recently, I was presented with a job offer boasting higher pay, a superior rank, and comparable benefits. While it appears to offer significant opportunities for growth, the new role doesn't align with my interests. I'm only contemplating it because I sense that my current situation is holding me hostage, hindering my professional and personal advancement, and I'm disenchanted with working under this incompetent boss. On the other hand, given the turnover rate among management in my current employer, it's likely that this boss will eventually move on, or when I do transition, the chances of crossing paths with him again are slim

1aytk6a,"My GF loves cleaning, but should she make a career out of it?","Hi all, I came here to possibly get some advice from this community on a subject I have very little knowledge on in hopes to help out my GF. 

  
She's in her early twenties and is taking a gap year from school because she's trying to figure out what she wants to do next time she enrolls. Her first year was spent enrolled in a major she felt sort of forced into due to her family forcing it down her throat all her life, and now she wants to take it slow and figure things out before she puts even more money on the line. 

  
It's hard for me to give her advice on what career option she should partake in, because I've known what I was going to do since I was a child and have no reason not to continue. My advice usually pertains to, ""What are you good at already?"", which didn't yield any results up until I noticed how often she cleans. She cleans at her parents house, her grandma's house, my house, her friend's houses. If you ask her to clean and help you with something, she does it in a heartbeat. So we thought that she could possibly get into the Cleaning business (IDK if there's a more professional term for that), but we have no idea where to start. 

  
She's doing her own research but I came her to see if anyone had any advice regarding this career choice. I personally have concerns regarding the closeness to her ""clients""; she may just enjoy cleaning because it's for people she cares about, not just the cleaning that gets her to do it. It may not pay as well as she'd hoped her first career choice would. Her clients could be even shittier than whoever she has to deal with now. 

  
Regardless, this seems like the best option for her given the circumstances, because we're both at a loss as to what strikes her as enjoyable, fits her, and is something she's good at, but not too tedious to get through school to do it. She wants to be able to choose a career where getting through the school or learning of it isn't a slog, or if it is then its at least so enjoyable that she can get through it.  
Sorry this was a lot, but I'd appreciate any and all help regarding this topic. I'd like to do whatever I can to help her out and this is the best idea I have. Thanks for any and all advice! If you have any questions regarding her to get a deeper insight into this career or other career choices she can fit, ask away!

1ayspma,Boss makes me feel horrible. Would you quit?,"Sorry in advance for the rambling post..
For starters, I work for a relatively large pet food supply store. When I was hired 2+ years ago, my boss and I got along - she even gave me lifts home after work. I started as part time, worked up to the only full-time employee and I was one of 2 in consideration for assistant manager at one point. That seemed to be the tipping point, so to speak. The girl who recieved the promotion was a friend, and she was always one of our bosses favorites. I'll admit, I was shaken. I thought the position was mine as I have previous supervisory and admin experience (the other girl did not - this was her first job), and the last ASM recommended me for the job after she left. When my boss took me aside to tell me, It hurt - but I didn't fight this decision, I hope I took it with some grace - I never disputed it anyhow..

Now since then, her attitude has shifted. I attempt to greet her in the morning, and I recieve a glare and silence in response. I am the last to know about any relevant day-to-day information, new products or events; I've lost assignments and tasks that I was once the go-to person for; I've lost the  training of new employees; she is dismissive of me even when I approach asking for help (in front of customers too) and just makes me feel so utterly disliked to the point where multiple new employees have outright asked me ""what I did to make her resent me"". 

I have recieved a write up since then as well, which was based off of some bogus lie an ex-employee told her. My boss did not care to hear my side of things - solely writing me up on the other's word though it was untrue. Despite feeling defeated, I took this chance to ask her - even if it appeared only this way to me, if I had done anything else to upset her as she had seemed unhappy with me in general for the past while. Her response was a short, curt ""no, just the issues in the write up"" 

Fast forward 8+ months, I went from being confident in my abilities and a positive, happy, outgoing person to what resembles a shell now - almost on the verge of tears on a daily basis from the daily stress and anxiety of just seeing her, and that constant dread of ""what did I do wrong, am I getting fired today?"" I've never doubted myself like this before.
--> And yesterday, one of my long term regulars comes in, we start chatting and he mentions that he gave me a STELLAR review in person to my boss a couple of months ago.. which she never relayed to me.
I did a bit more digging, and turns out some of my co-workers have recieved positive customer feedback about me before and taken it to her. Theres even a couple of google reviews. Not ONCE has anything ever been shown or said to me. Why would a boss not want their employee to know they are valued and appreciated!?
 Not sure why this is my snapping point, but I am highly considering quitting. Am I wrong to feel this way though? Am I interpreting her actions incorrectly?

1aypibr,What do you actually do in finance? ,"I'm currently finishing up grade 11, entering grade 12 in a month (last year of school). My plan until now was to do something in STEM - specifically Computer Science. I've now come across finance as a career and it seems interesting. I've always had a mathematical inclination and my interests have always been in Physics, Computer Science and Math.

Banking, finance is all new to me - I've always been STEM focused but these careers seem interesting to me - mostly because of the math and logical reasoning. I'm not familiar with them however. I have literally no idea what people in this field do. I was looking to get some insight on these careers and if they'd suit me as someone who likes applied mathematics.

Note: I'd say I'm above average in mathematics but not extremely smart. I've always liked applied mathematics - as used in physics, engineering or optimization problems (huge calculus fan). However, I HATE stuff like lemmas, theorems and geometry (Olympiad math if you will). I like some basic things like the pigeonhole principal which is very intuitive. I don't get the point of other stuff tho like fermats last theorem. To me, it has no real world use (I might be wrong obviously) and just doesn't seem as interesting compared to something like a differential equation for a chemical reaction.

Poly graduate here! I was from diploma of pharmaceutical science. My plan was to enter NTU, however because of my cgpa (ard 3.3 gpa) doesn’t hit the minimum requirements, i applied through ABA route, the chances of getting in is still slim. 

Theres 2-3 months before i get notified whether or not i got in. My intern job offered me a position as a marketing associate and requires me to fill the position soon. The pay is 2k. However, I don’t know if i should take up the job as it is pretty irrelevant to what i want to do in the future and what i want to study (QA in pharma, biological science). Because idk if i could even get in NTU, another option would be is to get a gap year and work for a known pharma company to obtain relevant experience and skills that would help with my uni application. However, i will need to decide now cause the company is hiring now (referral from my teacher). If i was to accept the position and ended up getting a spot in NTU, then… it would have been a waste..? 
I ruled out going to SIT (cause they dh the degree iw) and private unis (cause of the tuition fee). 

TLDR; Should i wait for my uni applications result to be out and decide the best way forward? or Should i accept the marketing role? or apply for the QA job in pharma industry?

One of the jobs that I am interested in is with the Arizona Supreme Court, on the staff side. The pay that is listed in the job opening is a significant decrease from what I'm making right now. I don't mind taking a slight decrease for better work life balance and for a position within the state, but I've been trying to find out if there's any kind of a range for the position.

Positions for the Arizona State Supreme Court don't specifically list a grade or schedule information. Is their pay structured differently? If they do follow the same schedules, how can I determine what grade the role falls into? The schedules I could find do not list the exact same position titles.

Also, I have colorful hair and tattoos. I should be able to cover the tats but do you think the hair will be an issue during the interview? I also don't know if I should disclose my ADHD.... I'm basically overthinking everything. ",KeybladePrincess,1,0.5,0,1708749757,2024-02-24 04:42:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aylu1x/az_supreme_court_job/,2,2024

1aylcd2,Converting a contract position. How do I negotiate?,"Background: I am currently a contractor at a major multinational. I was hired, with an expectation that I will be onboarded full-time within a year. I am approaching the expiration of my contract (I still have several months), and I wanted to discuss this with my senior. Recently, I have been given increased responsibilities and my team (including, senior management) have appreciated my work. 

However, I wanted some advice on how to discuss the conversion to full-time with my boss? I still feel like it's not a guarantee, and my contract will be extended instead. How do I navigate this?

I understand that it is a corporation, and they will prioritize their own interests. But, I really like my team and dont wanna burn any bridges with my boss when I discuss this. The contract extension will also entail a pay bump, so I don't want it to seem like I am ready to jump ships. But I believe a contract position also limits growth opportunities. Nonetheless, I have other job options to explore -- is that something that I should bring up?

What are your thoughts, recommendations? How can I broach this topic respectfully without limiting my negotiating power?

1aykkys,Seeking Advice: Dealing with Persistent Bullying Colleague,"

Hello everyone,

I’m reaching out here because I’ve hit a breaking point at work and I’m not sure how to proceed. For the past five years, I’ve been dealing with a colleague who has consistently bullied not just me, but others as well. We’ve both been with the company for 12 years, and her behavior has been escalating to the point where it’s affecting my mental health and work-life balance.

Here are some of the main points of what I’ve been experiencing:

	•	My colleague, let’s call her AP, constantly calls or emails me for help, even though she’s ranked #1 in the department. She asks for assistance on simple tasks she should know by now.
	•	She often gets me to do her job for her or seeks my advice on issues that have been discussed before.
	•	AP gossips behind people’s backs and gets upset if they don’t respond to her requests immediately.
	•	She tries to draw me into her personal life drama, often calling me outside of work hours to discuss marriage, family issues, and more.
	•	This behavior has led to poor mental health and anxiety for me, to the point where I’ve sought therapy. I wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks, constantly on edge that she will call at any time.
	•	To document the situation, I’ve logged information and written a statement detailing her behavior over the last few years.

Today, I reached a breaking point and confronted her about how her actions have been affecting me. I made it clear that I could no longer contact her outside of work, as her conversations were causing me to have panic attacks, and I’m currently in therapy because of our interactions. It’s worth noting that when I mentioned therapy, she had the audacity to ask what therapist I went to, which only adds to the distressing nature of her behavior.

This confrontation was spurred by a few other colleagues who confronted their boss about her behavior, which ultimately led to my manager addressing the issue with her. Today’s conversation was difficult, but I needed to set boundaries for my own well-being.

However, I’m now worried about potential repercussions, as AP is “friends” with my boss outside of work. I’m also concerned about the personal information I’ve shared with her getting out.

Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice on navigating this would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for listening.",LeaveTheGTaketheC,1,1.0,0,1708745811,2024-02-24 03:36:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aykkys/seeking_advice_dealing_with_persistent_bullying/,2,2024

1ayk3fn,Is this insubordination?,"I work in customer service for a chemical manufacturer. I feel this company is very toxic. 

They run extremely lean and on top of that have fired four people in six months and have not rehired (supposedly someone is starting next month, but could bail as others have, who knows). We are really understaffed and the workload is huge, but we never get any praise for how much we do. 

Over the summer, after management fired someone, the senior manager held a meeting with the remaining team explaining why he got fired (apparently lying on order entry metrics and being behind on work). The CEO also sends out a quarterly report on the people who were fired and why.

So anyways, our weekly “best practices” meeting has been cancelled literally every week besides the first meeting six months ago, but we had one today. Earlier in the week, a manager sent out a different order entry checklist than the one we have been using, instructing us to use that one instead. The one we have been using is a pdf form, where there are nice, vertically stacked text boxes to fill out 13 pieces of information along with a title for the space and a check box, where you just click the box and it checks it. 

The new checklist is also a pdf but not a form, but is in the companie’s files as the most recent checklist official document (6 years old). It is not labeled well, haphazardly spaced, there are boxes that do not check, and the spaces for the information are not fill-outable. A coworker asked how it would even be functional, and management suggested we do pdf edits and highlight the check boxes and paste in the information as red text boxes, which we will have to adjust for size each once, then put them next to each data point (po#, delivery date, etc.). My coworker said to me that they are not using it because it’s stupid.

Management had a meeting with us basically beating us up saying there were 5 inquiries in 3 days on order entry, and we aren’t entering orders accurately enough. So she said we must use this official checklist and attach it to our orders, which we were already doing with the user friendly checklist that is exactly the same information, except actually functional. She doesn’t even care if we fill it out or not, but said if the checklist is attached, then we are liable and showing we checked the order, and if we make a mistake, then we will have to start filling out a very detailed spreadsheet on each order. She made us sign a document at the end of the meeting stating we understood we have to use the checklist.

A coworker asked if this will be considered to impact our 24 hour order entry requirement metric, like will we get more time to enter orders, since we are using this annoying document now, and she said no, we are still expected to enter all orders in 24 hours (which is hard with the high volume and all the hundreds of emails we get a day).

It is annoying because management only tracks how timely we enter orders  and think it’s the only thing we do, meanwhile I send 50+ emails and 50+ IMs a day about order changes, updates, issues, check reports, etc.

My coworker said that this new checklist will be time consuming to fill out since it’s so not user friendly, and the manager said well we should be spending more time when entering order and taking our time (adjusting text boxes 13 times on each order?).

The meeting made me angry, and after the meeting I downloaded the checklist and made it a pdf fill out-able form that is actually easy to use. And I adjusted and shortened some titles that actually match our order systems titles and are grammatically correct.

I showed my coworker and sent it to her because she asked me to. She likes that it can be filled out now, but thought me adjusting the titles might not have been the best thing.

Thoughts?

1aygw1x,To Follow Up or Not to Follow Up After an Interview?,"To Follow Up or Not to Follow Up After an Interview?  
A common question I encounter is whether candidates should follow up after an interview or an initial outreach email. Some believe that if an employer is interested, they will surely get back in touch. Others are impatient and follow up the very next day for feedback. However, neither approach is ideal.  
Let me share a personal story. There was a time when my dream company never responded to my applications (I hadn’t mastered networking yet). Then, one day, I received an email from their recruiter, which seemed like a mass email sent to hundreds of candidates. I replied eagerly but heard nothing back. I decided to follow up, and to my surprise, I received a response. Although the role they initially emailed about was no longer available, they had another opportunity that might suit me. I interviewed and ended up working there for almost five years! If I hadn’t followed up, I might never have had that chance.  
Based on my experience, here are some tips for following up:  
1. Email Response: If you reply to a job-related email and don’t hear back, wait 2-3 days before following up.  
2. Post-Interview (Promised Timeline): If the recruiter said they’d get back to you in 2 days, follow up in 5 days.  
3. Post-Interview (No Timeline): If the recruiter didn’t specify a timeline, follow up in a week.  
4. Max Follow-Ups: It’s okay to follow up a maximum of two times.  
5. Follow-Up Tone: Ensure your follow-up email is short and friendly. Instead of expressing frustration, try something like, “It was great speaking with you the other day. I wanted to follow up on the next steps.”

1aygam1,I left my job for self-employment and just feel weird about it,"I left my job almost 2 years ago to pursue self-employment., Real estate investor and I’ve been buying rental and flipping houses. Things are going well.

I had been working in sales for an equipment manufacturer selling, fairly expensive industrial machinery. They were complicated systems and typically purchased as part of a large project. When 2020 hit all of that got put on hold especially my international accounts. Naturally, my numbers looked pretty bad in 2020. mid 2021 my boss sat down with me and talked about my numbers and told me my career at the company was becoming in jeopardy because of it. I was able to sell enough in the second half of 2021 to hit my goal and I left my job in June 2022 and hit my goal for 2022 as well. 

But after that meeting, my relationship with my boss never really recovered. He started second-guessing my decisions and asking me why I wasn’t spending more time on the road or coming into the office more often (I was a remote employee). It just wasn’t a good trajectory and I could tell things are going to get any better. I knew him pretty well by then and he was treating me like one of the employees he didn’t like dealing with. He would avoid calling me and there was no friendly chitchat. 

So I got my stuff together and in 2022 I put in my notice and left. They encourage me to stay on a couple of months to finish active projects which I did. On my last day of employment he sent me a performance review worksheet, which was not very favorable, and asked me to sign it. I didn’t agree with it at all for a variety of reasons. For instance, my attendance was considered poor. even though in eight years of employment, I never used a sick day and required all kinds of after hours and weekend travel. 

I told him I wasn’t going to sign it and I spent the whole last day of my employment pissed off. I didn’t call him or our president to say goodbye. Just tossed my stuff in a box and mailed it to the company with my final expense report.  

For whatever reason I’m having a hard time getting over this experience. I guess it’s because it’s my last day of real employment and I feel like I left on bad terms. It’s stupid to feel this way because I’m self-employed and I’m happy, but I work there a long time and I really enjoyed a lot of the people I work with, and the customers. It just sucks to feel like I left on bad terms.

Little curious if anybody here can relate. ",somerandomguyanon,12,0.9300000071525574,6,1708733608,2024-02-24 00:13:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aygam1/i_left_my_job_for_selfemployment_and_just_feel/,2,2024

I plan on attending UTEP, currently I have around 20ish college credits. My major is Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. In terms of MOS I’m looking to do 68R or 68T, though I’ve heard these jobs often inter-lap (and that they’re hard to come by). After my service I will apply to vet school and fund it through the GI Bill.  Some things I am wondering are as follows:

- how can I increase my rank and maximize my earnings before basic training and also while in the military? 
- 3 or 4 year contract? what contract gives me better benefits
- will my time in the military adequately prepare me for vet school? As in, do they offer enough medical opportunities, connections, mentorship, etc
-how does TA work? How much money does the GI Bill really give you? What about the TSP? 
- How would courses requiring science labs work? Do vet schools accept online labs? (Assuming they’re online) 

Background:
-Texas resident 
-Over 500+ hours veterinary experience in spay/neuter clinics abroad, mobile veterinary clinics, animal shelters
- Competed in a couple of veterinary science competitions 
- Certified Veterinary Assistant 
- Have taken dual credit and AP classes (Eng 1301, 1302, USH 1301, 1302, GOVT 2305, ECON 2301, AP Spanish Literature & Culture, AP Spanish Language & Culture, AP English Literature, PHY 102M, PHY 302K)
- Working on my dog groomer license
- Strong professional references from two vets  I’ve worked with 
-Graduating HS in May
-I’ve taken the ASVAB but don’t know my score yet

-Texas Tech (safety)
-Ross (dream)
-Cornell (dream)
-UF
- University of Arizona

1ayf76n,In a situation ,"Hello all,

I recently separated from the Navy after 9 years. I am 29 years old. 

There’s this unspoken rule of thumb for active guys is that you should make a decision of whether to stay in or get out around the 10-year mark; I decided on the latter.

I decided to get out for a few reasons: 

I have been with an amazing woman for a few years now, and “military life” isn’t exactly the most conducive way to maintain a healthy relationship. 

Second, I was privileged to experience being at the top of my game for my rank (E-5), and I felt like I could do better.

Last, I was at a crossroads; either I full-send this Navy thing, or I get out and try to become something “more.” To be clear, I didn’t know what “more” is — I still don’t — but I knew that in the Navy, I would never obtain the income necessary to live the type of life that I have envisioned for myself.

In making this decision, I sat down and figured out the things that I had going for me: 

1. I am at the tail end of a Bachelor’s in Business (~6 months left until I obtain the degree)

2. I have extensive experience in heavy equipment operations due to being an Equipment Operator in the Navy

3. I have a current CDL license 

4. Had a job lined up to run a small trucking company

I had a few other things on the list, but those are the highlights.

Anyway, I got out and started running this company. It wasn’t too bad; my boss (the owner) is a great person, I was managing reliable, older guys, and the work itself wasn’t complicated.

The pay was $45k salary, which was very low (HCOL area), but I figured that I would be able to ride it out for a year or two with a part-time job until we began to achieve sustainable growth. Also, my fiancée and I split bills, so I didn’t think it was going to be too terrible.

I also have to add that while I knew that it was low, I had seen all of the financials and I knew that he was paying me a fair wage based on what he was making in profits (Around 28%).

And so it began. I worked for him for around 25 hours a week, and supplemented the income as an Uber driver at night.

But after five months in, started to really dislike the job; the commute was unpredictable as it ranged from one hour to two hours (we live in Southern California), progression was incredibly slow, my boss was jaded with the work, and I never really got past the point of being an “errand” boy. 

So I started to look for other opportunities and gained an apprenticeship for the local operator’s union — to which I got accepted — and here I am, waiting for work. 

This is obviously a great opportunity that capitalizes on what I am good at, but I’m sitting here like: “This is what I got out of the military for?” 

Apologies for the anti-climactic ending, but I have a desire to be “up there” and the opportunities that I am obtaining don’t feel like the the types of opportunities that will eventually get me to that level. 

If I sound like a spoiled brat that isn’t appreciating the blessings that I have been receiving, I take full ownership of that. But what the fuck man, isn’t this “life” thing supposed to be grinding on the path that leads us to achieve the things that we truly want, and not settling for anything less?

1ayezeu,left IT and thinking of coming back,"I shouldn’t be allowed free will because idk what to do so here I am turning to Reddit for feedback. Sorry for rambling. I (late 20s female) have worked in IT in a help desk role since college and into my after college professional life. I left IT for an opportunity to work in another field for a company that’s a major player in that industry (don’t want to go into specifics in case anyone who knows me sees this). I do smaller projects in that field for fun and wanted the challenge which is the main reason I took the job. I had been looking into other IT roles when planning to leave my previous job and applied to my current company for fun not thinking I’d get hired. 

I enjoy the work I do now more than when I worked in IT but I took a $10k+ paycut to join. Also I knew pretty quickly that I don’t want to stay with my current company for long for various reasons. I planned on staying a year and then find a job that’s in IT but not a help desk role. 

A few weeks ago I got an offer to interview for a help desk position and took it to practice my interview skills so I don’t get too rusty on that knowledge. Fast forward to now and I have an offer letter. This new job will pay $20k more than my current job. I know on paper I should take this new job but I wasn’t too fond of IT. It was something I can do and not something I really enjoyed doing. But I was already planning on leaving my current job later this year after finishing up a few projects I was excited to be able to lead. My siblings say I’m an idiot for potentially passing on the money especially with the current job market, but I also want to see my projects through. 

I’m not too sure what to do. Any insight would be great. Thanks in advance!",PotentialCanary3774,1,1.0,0,1708730302,2024-02-23 23:18:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ayezeu/left_it_and_thinking_of_coming_back/,2,2024

However, some people around me seem to think it'd be worth finishing up just to have it on my resume since I'm already close to finishing, and I haven't been working while I've been in school. The cost to finish though would be about another $10,000 and another year of classes and fieldwork, taking up time that could be spent getting work experience and money. To me, the opportunity cost of actually getting work experience on my resume and a weekly check far outweigh whatever value-add I get from having a niche master's degree that I won't use on my resume. However, I'm not sure how employers would see it.

1ayekh4,"My boss never discussed my 2023 performance eval, should I?","My boss still hasn’t discussed my 2023 performance evaluation, the written version of which she completed and sent me in early January. Entering the end of February, she still hasn’t mentioned it, though we have weekly 1:1’s and regular slack cadence. I’m unsure whether I’d be better off bringing it up, or just follow her cue.

The actual eval was fine. It was more critical than I would’ve expected (meets and sometimes exceeds expectations), but nothing I’m going to lose sleep over. I think she’s doing that Goldilocks tactic they prob teach at management seminars where she praises contributions generally, but listed a few specific criticisms, and ambiguous targets, keeping the overall review middle of the road and noncommittal enough that she retains the flexibility to do what she wants with me.

So I’m not really sure whether I’m better off asking to discuss it or letting it sit. Part of me thinks bringing it up would show initiative and effort toward improvement. But alternatively, who would I be impressing, and would initiating a discussion she doesn’t want to have just irritate her and do me more harm than good?

This is part of a more general trend in her not really acting as a manager. She never holds team meetings or communicates with our 5-person legal team as a group, only meeting with us each individually. For example, a few weeks ago a colleague left and was replaced. The change was never acknowledged or addressed with us as a group, even though we all worked quite closely with her given the small team. She told us of our raises and bonuses by posting a screenshot of the amount on slack, again no discussion or explanation, and during onsite events when we’re all together in person, she’ll rarely spend much time in the office, arriving mid morning and leaving after lunch.

So all of this is to say that not discussing the eval is part of a pattern. On a personal level I find it off-putting. But professionally I’m torn, because on one hand the lack of supervision can be quite nice, but I’m not sure whether I’d be better positioned for advancement with a more engaged supervisor. And if the latter, how I would go about facilitating that.

So returning to the original question, should I raise the eval discussion?

1ayeean,I work hard but my company is small and low on cash. Can I ask for a raise and does a promotion even make sense?,"I'm facing a challenge in my career journey and could really use some insights. I'm currently employed as a Product Manager at a startup in Berlin, Germany, where I've found myself thrust into a position of significant responsibility. 

  
Working in a startup comes with its own set of hurdles, particularly concerning financial constraints and heavy reliance on investor support. Nevertheless, I've been pouring my efforts into driving the tech and product org forward. From orchestrating operations and processes and making them more efficient and productive, to crafting roadmaps and managing stakeholder relationships, I've been taking on a multitude of roles. While I believe my contributions surpass those of a Senior Product Manager, I find myself lacking direct reports, aside from a handful of freelancers and engineers whom I manage in an informal capacity. My intern, who was reporting to me, just quit and is going to a large corporation. Our COO is getting replaced by a CTO who I would report to.  
Given these circumstances, I wonder whether it's prudent to advocate for a promotion, such as to a Product Lead role, or to request a salary increase given the current circumstances. It's worth noting that our app's performance metrics, particularly in terms of user retention and revenue generation, have not met expectations. However, I attribute this more to overarching management decisions which have impeded focus in our product strategy. In contrast, my recent measures to regain focus and implement more scrum principles have increased productivity and satisfaction among the engineers.   
For context, I'm 27 years old and currently earn an annual salary of 60,000 euros, without any bonus. Despite being promised ESOPs a year ago, I have yet to receive them.  
I'm grappling with the balance between recognizing my contributions and acknowledging the financial constraints of the company. Any advice or insights on navigating this situation would be immensely appreciated.

1aycxko,Feeling lost in my current stage in life,"Hello everyone! Apologies in advance if this post gets a little ramble-y and vent-y, I'll try and limit that as much as possible.

**My Background**

I am a 26M who graduated from my undergrad around 4 years ago with a double major in Chemistry and Cellular/Molecular Biology. Since graduation I worked as a bartender for 2 years during covid, but had an opportunity to escape the service industry and work as a seasonal environmental educator. This initial experience with seasonal work resonated deeply with me, and I spent the following two years working seasonally in the world of trail building, environmental education, volunteer management, and environmental stewardship. Most of this work was done during the spring/summer/fall so in my off season I found work at my local climbing gym as an instructor, as well as an odd job doing sales at a tech company (I hated it). The seasonal life worked well for me, and I discovered how much I valued working in a field that I felt was making a positive societal impact. Consequently I also discovered how much I despise making money for a company where I don't believe my actions are causing any sort of societal good (I quit working my sales job 5 months in despite making a very good income to go lift rocks all day on a trail crew, and my mental health improved significantly almost over night). 

**My Outlook**

I am not a career-driven individual. I've definitely prioritized my social growth, education, and life experiences over income for my post-grad life. I've been lucky enough in my life to not have many financial burdens, and my family is well off enough where I don't need to bring in money to help out. I also know that I'm a very privileged individual and that the majority of other people in the world do not have the luxury of pursuing their passions in lieu of an income in their young adult years. As mentioned earlier I struggle immensely working jobs that I don't really care about, regardless of pay. As far as goals are concerned I would love to have more disposable income in the future but I don't have any dreams of wild success. I also don't plan on having kids soon (if ever) so a comfortable middle class life is really all I want. The traditional American/Western values of financial success, starting a family, and working hard to settle into a peaceful retirement do not resonate with me in any capacity. I've tried to pursue this lifestyle in the past working a well-paying white collar job and it absolutely killed me. But I just don't know what my other options in life are. I recognize entirely that no one really wants to work and that work allows for the pursuit of other goals in life, but god damn I have not been able to make it work for me.

**The Problem**

My most recent season ended in November, and in October I learned that my mother who I'm very close with has stage 4 inoperable cancer. Following the end of my work season I moved back to the state that I was raised in to stay with my parents and help alleviate some of the responsibilities around the house while she's undergoing treatment (and I can't say I had much rent money either). I've been living back with my parents for the last 3 months and have been working in the service industry again, and I've had a hard time deciding what to do next. Due to my family situation I've decided to stay on the east coast, but I haven't had any luck with full-time non-seasonal jobs anywhere in the country, let alone the state that my parents are in (VA). I've been considering going to grad school for environmental science and soil science, and I've scored well enough on the GRE to be competitive in the programs I'm looking at, but I'm not hugely convinced that another degree is what I need right now. I feel as though I'm at a big crossroads in my life: the path that's worked for me so far (seasonal life) has ended, returning to school seems like it would just push this decision further down the road, and buckling down and trying to find a traditional full-time job might once again wreck my mental health. 

I would love to hear from anyone who has experience in situations similar to mine, from people who share my values, or from people who hold opposing values to me and would like to share their thoughts. I'm welcome to any and all viewpoints and suggestions. All I really want is the ability to delineate my path forward and to not feel as though I've failed majorly in life by not accruing any wealth.

1aybujr,How do I decline a job offer (for now) without closing the door to future opportunities with that company?,"I’ve been interviewing with this company for a job and it definitely seems like I would get an offer for the position, I just have a final interview to go with them which just seems like more of a formality.

However as luck would have it, it’s looking like I have cancer (don’t have an official diagnosis yet as I’m still undergoing tests but my doctor was confident enough to tell me that’s most likely what it is). Given other factors my prognosis is good and it seems like I’ll just be down for a few months while I undergo chemo/radiation.

I know I should be focusing on my health first and I am but I was really excited about this job opportunity.

That being said, I’m obviously not in a position to make a career change at the moment so I’m wondering how I can politely decline the request for the final interview while also expressing my interest in applying/interviewing again in the near future.

I don’t want to mention the C word or that I’m sick as I feel like it’s a red flag on my name if/when I apply again in the future so I’d like to keep it fairly vague while also making it clear that I just can’t take on a new job at the moment and not that I don’t want to or that I’m taking something else. I was thinking something along the lines of “Life circumstances have changed and as a result, I am unable to pursue new job opportunities at this time”, thanking them for their time and transparency through the interview process and expressing interest in interviewing again for the position in the near future (they has said that they planned on hiring a bunch throughout 2024 so I’m hopeful for that).

1ayaqn5,"I work in Student Success, but I'm being set up to fail","Hello everyone, 

I would greatly appreciate some advice and insight, particularly from anyone who's felt burnt out, worked in education, or made a career transition. 

As the title alludes, I'm an academic advisor, and I have been for several years. The majority of my time has been with the same institution. For most of this time, I have genuinely loved my job, but so much of what I enjoy about it is beginning to fade. 

For some context, my individual school used to exist separately from the wider institution. Even after we merged, we operated independently for a few years, using our own systems and processes. Roughly eight months ago, the wider institution decided that we should streamline everything. The issue is that their set-up does not fit our student population whatsoever. Historically simple tasks such as collecting payments, processing registrations, and giving students access to their courses are now incredibly complicated. Every situation I come across feels like a mental game of American Ninja Warrior. 

I've tried my best to stay positive and navigate these changes effectively, but it's starting to feel almost impossible to do my job. We're told that our top priority is to register and retain students, but their system is riddled with obstacles that keep us from reaching our goals. I consider myself an optimistic person who tries to find the silver lining in every situation, but I can't shake the feeling that we're intentionally being set up to fail. 

No matter what I tell myself, my body knows something is wrong. I'm starting to feel burnt out. I'm chronically exhausted, and I'm making silly mistakes that I almost never would have made in the past.  I know I can't keep going on like this, and I need some direction. 

Here are my questions: 

1). From your experience, do you see any downsides to asking for a cut in hours? I still want to work at least 30-36 hours per week. The goal in doing this would be to have more work/life balance and time to apply for jobs. I'm very fortunate that my family could afford the small loss of income and benefits, but I'm scared to ask this. My fear revolves around letting down my teammates or setting myself up to be easily terminated. 

2). Are there any industries that I could transition into with experience in advising, administrative work, and light IT work? I'm highly proficient at navigating various types of software, but things like coding have gone over my head. Maybe I just need to start off with an easy course? 

3). How do I 'grieve' that the job I used to love is starting to become unrecognizable? Should I give myself some time to process everything that's happening, or dive right into a new job search? 

If you made it this far, thank you so much for your time!

1ay9ue5,"Boss made a few comments, and my ego was bruised, but i want to grow from this.","Today my boss witnessed an interaction I had with a potential client. Shortly after, my boss made some comments; he generalized, but the shoe fit.  
He basically said that we sometimes get too comfortable and we forget that, thanks to the clients, the business works, and we all have a job. He then said he wants us to give our 101%, then ended his speech by saying he wants us to learn, help, prepare ourselves, teach him new ways of doing things.  
I must admit that my ego was bruised, very much so haha. I am very good at my job; I connect with clients; I close deals. But lately, I've been dealing with some health problems, and my work as well as my performance has suffered. I do the minimum, but I don't go further, at least not with all my clients. I admire my boss a lot; he's always been someone I've looked up to, and like I said, I think it's mostly my ego that's taken a hit.

1ay9r96,Am I just paranoid from my last job or valid to be afraid?,"Hi everyone, so I'm 24F and I work in marketing. Right now, I have been at my current job for 7 months and it has all been going really well in my opinion. We have a small marketing team right now and I do a lot of coordinating in terms of getting our creative where it needs to go, as well as reporting and analytics for what sources are performing well. For a little backstory, last year I got out of a very toxic work environment that I had been in for a year that left me with a lot of negative patterns and behaviors in a professional environment that I'm trying to work through, such as thinking that my current boss is mad at me when she's not, or over-apologizing for small mistakes I make.

That negative past experience is probably part of why I'm freaking out a bit now. Essentially, two months or so after I started this current job, my boss asked me if I had any interest in being the digital marketing manager eventually. I was caught very off guard and basically told her that I was enjoying getting my feet wet with all facets of marketing (not just digital, and our company actually does a LOT of non-digital marketing) and that in the future I might be interested but I didn't feel ready at that point. This was, I recognize, not the most positive answer probably-- but it was honest. In our 1:1 this week, my boss told me she was now looking to hire a digital marketing manager. That sent me into a spiral that I am getting fired soon or that they're trying to push me out.... even though not many of my current responsibilities are digital-related. I think I was just afraid that I would be pushed out or overpowered by this new hire because up until now, the marketing department has just been my boss and me. Also, I'm not a manager role.... so I don't know if I would then be reporting to them or what.

&#x200B;

Interested if anyone has been through a similar thing and if I'm just being triggered due to my past experience or if I am valid in being worried. Should I start searching for new jobs?

Hi everybody,  
  
I have been at this company for 1.5 years now, and it seems like finding a new job (ideally within the company as I love the culture and perks I get from it) is the way to go. I previously worked a job as an inventory planner, and before that I worked as a Quality Assurance Admin at a truck warehouse (pretty simple admin work)  
  
My degree was in manufacturing/supply chain management and business analytics and I am 25. I have the below skills  
  
Tableau  
  
Intermediate Excel Skills  
  
Salesforce  
  
JIRA familiarity  
  
PowerBI  
  
Project Management  
  
Continuous Improvement  
  
SQL  
  
In my current job its all problem focused and work on resolving issues that pop up with numerous different teams. Work heavily with account managers and our engineering group  
  
Okay. Just wanted to establish my background as I believe it matters on helping me figure out what field to jump into but enough bullshit spewing. My question:  
  
Where do I start in figuring out what job to take next? Do I just seach all jobs within my field and start doing research on a field that looks interesting?  
  
I have factored in the rule that I should take atleast a 15% pay jump  
  
I would like to develop my technical skills further, but I do have a decent amount of experience working in operations and cross-functional teams. I enjoy being an analyst and wouldn't mind going further into data analysis by possibly utilizing SQL or python  
  
Should I start googling and seeing what are common jobs nowadays? How do I begin to direct myself and do research? I don't even know where to begin right now.

I would like to hear your opinions about the two offers I have:

2. Director of Engineering at Genentech

1ay93w5,Need advice; Back to school to make an extra 100k/yr?,"  
Hey all. Currently, I work in healthcare and make 100k working 36-40 easy\* hours per week. My day consists of about half active time and half downtime of work. This is location-specific, and other places are not the same easy work. If I were to move or relocate, I would not have as good a setup as now, so keep that in mind. I am unionized, however, so I probably won't need to quit if I don't want to. I can perform my job with relative ease, and it does not give me any stress. I am fortunate to be in this position.  
  
I have a good amount of savings that are invested, and if I don't touch it, it will be about 2m when I retire. My current monthly expenses are 3000, and I am able to save roughly 2-3k per month. I own my car and rent where I live. If I continue this, I could easily retire at 50 or so and do what I want, which is work on/drive cars, travel, have time and choice freedom. This would mean I have to give up some expensive nights out, etc. I would still get to prioritize my health by eating the best foods and having time to do fitness with that 3k per month.  
  
The problem lies in the fact that I am 30, and I feel like I need to be doing ""more"". The degree I want to get will take me 6 years and about 250,000$ (400k after interest) in opportunity cost. It would be the next big step up in the healthcare ladder. It's a technical job that has guaranteed employment and hours; however, I will be restricted to practicing in certain states which I dislike. I did the math, I'd break even when I am 45, and from there on out, I'd be ""positive"" on my investment of time. This is the only degree that makes sense as everything else is negative as far as investment of time and cost. For example, physician assistant median salary is ""only"" 120k, so it makes no sense for me to see 2-3x more patients per day than now and get paid less after the consideration of opportunity cost.  
  
My dreams and goals lie outside of healthcare long-term. I'd like to create a business or some sort of product around what I enjoy, but there is no guarantee there, and influences from parents and friends make this sound like a bad choice even though I have enough money to do everything I want already. I fear that getting this degree is not going to make me happy, but I also fear that 20 years from now, I wish I did it if I fail at everything else.  
  
How do I overcome this dilemma? If someone could give me advice on navigating this, it would be much appreciated.",phobiify,9,0.9100000262260437,14,1708715973,2024-02-23 19:19:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ay93w5/need_advice_back_to_school_to_make_an_extra_100kyr/,2,2024

New job is with a raise to 80k, cut my commute time to about an hour, but no possibility to work from home for over a year or two. 

Part of the reason I accepted is to motivate me to be more productive outside of work, but looking back at the possibility I had to wfh is definitely enticing.

1ay8iee,How did you improve your social skills and confidence in your career?,"Just wanted to vent and also get some advice. 

A couple weeks ago I (25F) was internally interviewed for a Sr. Tech role. Ive been with this company for about a year and 3 months (after a year, anyone can apply for a Sr. Tech role). Today during the interview follow-up, I was told I checked all the boxes; however, my lack of confidence is what ultimately led them to pick someone else. It felt like a jab in the stomach. I’ve struggled with social anxiety my entire life and is the sole reason I’ve missed out on different opportunities. My confidence has definitely grown over the last several years and I know I’m more than capable of handling the position. This is my first professional job, but ALL my former bosses have explicitly told me I’m their best worker and have offered themselves as references regardless of whatever confidence issues I may have presented. 

The other part that sucks is that I know who they chose for the role - my coworker who sits across from me. She’s pretty outspoken and I don’t have anything against her, but she’s not the kindest person either. She talks badly about people behind their backs, and has even gone as far as to call another girl a “dumb bitch” behind her back in the same room. I’ve been cross-trained, I’ve been with the company longer, and I always have a good attitude so it’s a little baffling, but I guess upper management doesn’t see that side of her. And I mean, being around people like that can be a little draining on self-confidence, too… you never know what they might say about you behind your back. 

Anyway, how did you improve your social anxiety and self confidence in your career? Is there a way to mask it? I’m tired of feeling this way and explicitly being told I lack confidence doesn’t make me feel good, especially as someone who’s continuing to look for other jobs but dreads the interviews.

1ay7v4b,Looking for some hope in months of joblessness ,"Hey, I'm currently in a career slump if you will and kinda trying to hang on some kinda hope.

To make the situation a bit clearer, I'm 25 and started building my more ""serious"" resume (excluding summer jobs etc) when I was 19. Since then, l've worked in a few rather big corporate companies, handling customer support and then moving onto training roles (onboarding, administrating a knowledge base or creating one, conducting trainings for employees and customers and handling post-sessions reports etc), and also worked as an administrator and SME for a visualization platform operating within a company. In all of those, I did rather well and have gathered good experience as well as good references and companies rather wanted to get me to stay, countering other offers when I wanted to leave than otherwise. I'm not saying that to toot my own horn but rather to better communicate my situation. 

At some point I took a year off as before I was working and studying full time on weekends and it really drained me. When I tried to get back to the market, it took a very long time and I got many interviews but little success, ended up with another customer service job. I got a job offer in the Netherlands so I went very happy to finally move out of my country, but unfortunately it was awful and all the conditions turned out to be much worse than those promised or even a complete contradiction of what was outlined and discussed prior to my move. So I found myself jobless in a new country and stayed at my friends for a while until I moved back home due to luck of success. I've redone my resume a few times, ho for a good result, I always get good or very good feedback from interviews yet I find myself still jobless and struggling mentally and financially. A few offers were almost lined up and then some never got back some said they needed up looking for sth different. 

I know market situation might not be ideal in many countries rn but this slump is really making me doubt any skills and good feedback l've been receiving, kinda making me feel the impostor syndrome lol.

Any advice on maybe where I should look, what to think of? Idk I'm just struggling to remain positive here",No-Recognition-3643,2,1.0,0,1708712967,2024-02-23 18:29:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ay7v4b/looking_for_some_hope_in_months_of_joblessness/,2,2024
1ay7omp,How do I decline irrelevant job tasks?,"My employer’s leadership team is required to come up with ideas to help our hourly employees feel more comfortable & appreciated at work. This includes various food events, celebrating Hallmark holidays, coming up with games/incentives, etc. These ideas are meant to be created & implemented primarily from the General Manager and HR department, but they will try to pass these tasks off to other departments. Recently they’ve created an employee engagement committee, which is meant to brainstorm what else they can do. There is an expectation for at least one person from every department to be part of it.  I’ve volunteered to join on behalf of mine, as this is a small time commitment that meets only once a month during the work day, and I believe hearing/contributing ideas will help me establish a better relationship with other departments.

I am a salaried sales manager, but I frequently assist in our accounting and operations departments; those tasks are beyond my actual job description of selling, but conducting them has become an expectation over time. I’m still required to go into an office daily and will complete my job tasks in the first 4hrs of my day, so I don’t mind picking the extra tasks up to fill in the voids. I overall believe that I am happy to help!

In my own time I am a freelance graphic designer & artist. People will commission me for various digital design projects, art pieces, and handwritten calligraphy. I do not keep these skills private, but unless I’m using them for my own clients or advancement in my own position, I prefer to keep a separation between my personal work from my occupational work. For example, I’ve designed a my own portfolio of sales material to present to my clients to close on business, and occasionally I will write thank you notes to my highest-paying business partners using my calligraphy skills.

My GM & HR team have recently taken notice to my skills and are starting to push me into using them for their employee appreciation efforts. While I do appreciate our hourly associates too, I do not manage any. I do not feel comfortable designing posters or writing every little name/content to display because in my own time I have personal customers who will pay me to do this for them.

I don't think that Biology is necessary anymore, so I plan to do Computer Science, Chemistry, Maths and Further Maths, and I would appreciate to have your guys' (significantly more experienced) views on this. Chemistry still remains to keep my options open.

Now I’m really considering start looking for a new company. 
The reason is that the last 4 months were Chaos , our director resigned and have a new manager let’s call him sham .  So sham started promising us that he will let me getting into pricing retail insurance and that we should not resign as i was carrying 70% of the department .
And i clearly stated that what I want to do and me working as data analytics( running reports and filling excel sheets ) wasn’t going to cut it for me . After a while sham 
 gave me  pricing add-ons of a policy ( he need any number just to silence his manager)  and gave my friend(we joined together) a task to price retail , who literally said to our manager that he won’t do his job as serious as me  because he hated it . 
it was a 3 weeks thing but he got the chance to do it , and when he asked him for me to join he replied that I have a lot to do and I should not join . Moving on we were in shock when some old colleague who left the company with 2 years of experience came back with literally nothing to add since he spend 1 year working as a developer doing the same reports that we do , bear in mind that he is a friend of our boss and and his assistant. 
The surprise is that they brought him back to do retail pricing, and they put a manager( who is also their friend) above us,
me and my friend felt betrayed.
And here I’m spending last month listening to my new manager dreams about the department and knowing for sure that I will not do pricing retail ever with them.
P.S : at the end of the year sham gave us the yearly appraisal . He gave me 4/5 although I deserved 3.5/5 as he said, and my friend 4/5 . 
And we were literally carrying the department of data analytics of  700 million$ company . 
You should know that all the data must be processed and cleansed by us . So our department is crucial.

My previous jobs were warehouse work and the restraunt industry. So, I was looking for a job with better hours, along with better pay. I had a 2 year old son when I started college, so providing him ejth a better life in the forefront of my mind. I thought a job in banking would look good on a resume and help with career mobility, so that's where I put my focus.

Eventually , I got a job as a part-time teller while I finished my bachelor's degree in business management. Then, I worked my way up from part-time teller to branch manager over the course of 8 years. I work for one of largest financial institutions in the country, so the benefits and pay are solid. 

However, I am very unhappy and under an unhealthy amount of stress. The BM is the punching bag for upper management. We get blamed for everything that goes wrong but no credit for what goes right. My branch is understaffed, along with all the other ones in the area. I am constantly dealing with drama amongst my staff, call-offs and general incompetence. I've been a manager for two years and I've realized it's just not what I want. I'd like to move internally but we have no corporate offices in my area, so I'd have to move if I wanted a job in another business segment. 

Now, it seems like it is very difficult to escape this line of work. I have no interest from recruiters or hiring managers on LinkedIn. I have put in a ton of applications but can't seem to get an interview anywhere. Usually I am applying for corporate roles at other banks or sales positions. I try to focus on applying for jobs that my skillset will transfer to, yet I have no luck.

1axy0kw,Is it reckless to downplay homelessness as career advice?,"I'm seeking advice on the best way to transition into more of a mentor role without getting people killed.

I've been fairly reckless most of my life. Not in a truly careless way, but if I didn't personally see a logical risk, I wasn't going to avoid things just because society said it was a bad idea.

This includes how I have navigated my career. In a certain sense, I haven't cared directly about it in the slightest. My life philosophy has always been more of a ""the score will take care of itself"" approach. 

Notice a skill gap? Close it. Feel exploited? Advocated for myself clearly and directly, without pause. Sense a conflict? Call it out. Need a change? Do it, and drastically.

I've landed at a great IT job and a rapidly growing healthcare company. Started as a tech, currently a manger in discussions for director. Feel good where I'm at and have pathways available for stepping out into a contractor role to pursue other music and food stuff or stepping up into C suite if those passions burn out or don't seem feasible to maintain my lifestyle.

BUT there's was a point where my culmination of choices without an overarching plan left me homeless. GF dumped me, didn't have any friends looking for a spot, and couldn't afford a place solo.

And I gotta say, it really wasn't that bad. Slept on couches when I could, in my car when I couldn't, and got a PF black membership so I could shower in just about any town.

To a certain extent, outside of big cities in America, carlessness is more of a risk than homelessness. A car can be a home. A home can't (as easily) be transportation.

On the other end of thjngs, each time you make a choice to play it safe, it makes it that much harder to take a risk the next time. The next risk has the additional burden of being weighed against the last risk that didn't clear the bar. The bar gets raised each and every time the safe choice is picked.

In that sense, your chance to take risks is most likely now, not later. If you don't take this chance, you're even less likely to take the next.

All of this gets summarized with the advice that I'd like to give people: realizing that you've wasted your entire life being safer than you needed to be is a greater risk than being homeless for a few months.

If you take a risk now, you face consequences now, you get over it now. When you defer them, the safe path becomes the risk. The clock never stops ticking, and life has a tendency to add more responsibility over time.

There is a risk to not taking risks, especially if you sense that you'll keep arriving at the same sort of questions and desires your whole life.

While I do genuinely believe all of this, I'm also very aware that different situations treat people differently. I want to avoid presenting this type of advice in a way that encourages blatant recklessness.

Any tips on how to frame an effective message around this all? Part of me feels rude to downplay homelessness, but I think people make financial/career consequences seem much more severe than they are, while downplaying the cost of being ""unreasonably"" safe.

1axvu9y,Needing advice ,"Hi everyone. Struggling to figure out my next job and wanted to get some thoughts and insights. 

Just a little background I am 25 years old and have a background in logistics sales. I recently decided working at my prior company was no longer a fit for me and was fully prepared to wait it out for what I want next. Fast forward a month later and I have two sitting offers and don’t know what to do. 

Job A is in logistics being a sales person for a small 3PL with about 30 employees. Loved the people when interviewing and I would be the 2nd salaried sales person on staff. They originally offered me a base of 60k and I told my recruiter it would take at least 75k to get me there. Being that I only have 2 years relevant experience and none in this particular sector of logistics I thought they would turn me down but sure enough they didn’t. Go on to say they think I’m a great fit and are willing to do what it takes to get me. As far as commissions go I make 10% on shipment which can be very lucrative and could be looking at pushing 6 figures in my first year.

Job B is on the tech side.  No cold calling all calls are leads for the service which seems pretty easy and realistic expectations from the team members I spoke with during the interview. Base of 55k and OTE of about 80-85k. 3 days a week WFH and two in office as well as 3 weeks total vacation early (holidays included) 

The reason is I’m conflicted is that my girlfriend is in professional school and is going to have a substantial amount of debt coming out and I’m wanting to try to get as much of a head start as I can. 

Do I take the higher income potential in a market that is currently down or do I take the work life balance job and probably be overall happier but make less money??? 

Any help is appreciated!",ConsequenceContent68,1,1.0,0,1708678000,2024-02-23 08:46:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1axvu9y/needing_advice/,2,2024
1axvrbp,Having a hard time to make my next move...,"Hello there, I am just about to finish my degree in Applied Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. I have a passion for DS which mainly started during my 2nd year and i kept at it until getting some knowledge about the tools and the theories. I have also participated in projects here and there plus have gathered more than a year of research experience in computational chemistry.  
Considering the market situation and everything, i am still determining what i want to do in the coming days. I want to go into the industry/work line as my first choice. Academics is also a choice i might consider.  
I mainly want to integrate my passion for DS with chemistry/chemical engineering as i dont want my 4-year degree to go to waste and I also keep my domain expertise at least. right now i have these options-  
1. Get admitted to the masters classes in the same dept which doesnt require the results of my bachelor's (as its the same dept) and try to contact professors or recruiters that will take me for a chem/chemE + Ds position. Note that trying to get a master's other than my dept will take me 6-7 months more compared to my peers as my results will take that much time to be published.  
2. go to the capital city and pursue a master's in cse with a major in data science while applying for DS related jobs to get that credibility and experience as there isnt many job position in DS in my current city.  
3. Will fully transitioning to DS be a good choice? i think its a risky move as ill be competing with cse/cs/stats grads who are already buffed up to begin with, which makes me much even more unlikely to get selected.  
Tbh, i want to go into the industry/work line as my first choice. For now, my best bet is to get out of my country as there is little to no oppurtunities for chemical engineering as well as ds.  
Any suggestions from you guys would be veryyy helpful.

1axv5sj,Do I get serious about web development now or just get married off at 18,"Hi, I'm currently 17F, in the final year of highschool. Learning to code seemed really fun, I didn't really take it very seriously but I just dipped my foot into coding. I didn't venture far enough that it could be of value but I mostly just played around. After spending a considerable amount of time on it, I have decided that I'm gonna pursue a career in Web Development. But this is where I'm in a kinda of messy pickle. So, my parents can't really afford college, I mean they can send me to a mediocre college here where I live but the courses are all outdated and it's just a waste of time and money studying here, no matter how I explain it to them, my parents don't seem to understand. I'm not academically too smart to get a whole ass scholarship for my entire period of study. And in my situation, I would most likely be married off as soon as I turn 18 if I don't try something and get out of here. 

I'm asking this purely for some guidance, I don't entirely understand what I'm talking about so help me out. So, in my research online, i've come across videos of people that learnt web development online without a degree and got a job. Of course they worked super hard to get there but is it still practical in todays world and economy. I have 6 months to at least get my foot in the door of some kind of good work and maybe at least barely be financially independent, or my parents are just gonna put me in a random college and pull me out when i'm 18 and get me married.

If you know anything, just please give me a realistic practical view of this situation. If there's a possibility for me to get a job if I work my ass off, where do I start. I'm ready to work as hard as possible but I just need a little bit of guidance.

1axtx5c,I'm 27 and I need help,"Hello! I just want sincere advice. Please be honest with me, don't just tell me what I want to hear.

I am 27(F) and I have a Bachelor’s in Communications. I picked that major back when I was 17 because I did not know what to study and, well, you know how that goes. I never really thought of the viability of my major because I never really thought I would have to use it. 
I live in a third-world country where life is pretty tought, tbh. Our money is worth nothing and inflation is absurd (Minimum wage: $5USD. A meal: $20) Young people don't really have opportunities and most of them leave. So, I thought that it didn't really matter what I studied because as soon as I graduated I would leave and just be a cashier somewhere else.

Then the pandemic happened and some personal matters made me lose a lot of money. Flash forward to today, I haven't been able to find a decent job (note that I mean... decent. Not even ""good""), I get most of my money from odd jobs, freelancing and sw (no of, something else) and I have no savings, nothing to my name and, as you can guess, no possibilities to leave the country any time soon. I can't even afford the basics.

I do everything I can think of to change my situation, I apply to lots of jobs within and outside my field and but I haven't been able to find anything. I have started tons of projects and tried to continue learning stuff adjacent to my career in hopes it would make my resume more desirable. But I'm so tired.

I had been very sincere with myself and accepted that I made a mistake when I was 17 and maybe I should learn something else. I was thinking of something more practical. However, I would still need to work to afford a new education and I don't know if it would be worth it at my age and in the place I live. 

I feel so useless and helpless I want to stop what I'm doing. I want to have a better life and I think enough time has passed for me to understand that I will never have that with what I chose. I thought the whole point of geeting that kind of education was being able to access better opportunities. 

What would you do? Do you have any tips for finding a decent remote job for someone who has been trying for so long? Would you start a new education at my age?

1axsija,What are some realistic careers for me? ,"
I am a 20 year old student at a state flagship studying history and political science. I dream of one day becoming a historian. However the chances of this are extremely slim these days as the academic market is abysmal. There is declining enrollment and greedy admins are trying to replace professors with part time lecturers. Anyways, I have decided that I will only try to go for a PHD if I get in a top 10 program, because they are the ones who get most academic jobs in the field. So I have that, but I really need to figure out what I want to do if I don’t get in. 

I hate business. I would be extremely miserable if I had to sell something for a living. As you could probably tell, I really enjoy researching and learning. That’s why I have considered going into policy work. I don’t know exactly what that entails but it is a possibility. I also could see myself going into some sort of data field, but that is really competitive and the only credentials I’ll have towards that would be a few classes in data and stats from my poli sci degree. The only other thing I’ve really thought about is law school, which I could do. I think I would be a good lawyer, but I don’t think it would be very full filling.

1axsfpt,I feel like a failure ,"I’m a 25F living in Houston, graduated college in 2021 with a bachelors in kinesiology in hopes to get into dental school in the future. 

Im 1 class shy of completing the pre-reqs for dental school as well as needing to take the DAT.
When I was in college, I worked part time for a medical device company 13 min away from my house. Upon graduating, my boss offered me $70,000 salary with a $15,000 EOY bonus in Feb 2022. By January 2023, he gave me a 10% raise. By Jan 2024, I got another 10% raise. So I currently make $84,700 plus EOY bonuses depending on how we end off the year. I’m the director of operations there but it’s important to keep in mind that we are a SMALL company. We only have 3 full time employees, including myself in that.

I have been supporting my single mother, myself, and my brother ever since my dad abandoned us out of nowhere in 2017. My mom currently works as a cook at a buffet. This was a main reason I ended up venturing off my dental track. We really needed a stable income coming into the house. And the thought of being $250k+ in debt after dental school scares the living shit out of me

I don’t know what to do with the rest of my career. Staying at this job for the rest of my life is not what I want to do. I was born and raised in the city im currently working in and im about to lose my mind seeing the same things & people every single day for the last 25 years 

I really want to be successful (as everyone does) but I fear that I crippled myself accepting this full time offer job. I’m not sure what other careers/fields I can get into with a kinesiology degree. 

I learned great skills at my current job. I handle inventory, im familiar with quickbooks, I handle overseas documents and registrations, I attend conferences as an exhibitor and showcase our devices so I also have great people skills

Im a first gen child so my parents were never able to guide me through schooling/picking a career. I guess im really just seeking some advice.

1axrtqz,Should I quit my job and work at Trader Joe’s? Desperate for better health insurance. ,"Hello, 

I’d like to think I have a unique situation, but I’m probably not that special.

I have a bachelors degree in Broadcasting and Mass Communications received in 2017. Totally useless degree. In 2016, I got arrested, which is something I am not proud of. I was in a bad place. With 1 semester left I graduated. But then became stuck with a criminal record. 

It seemed like nowhere in the world wanted to hire me. I eventually got a job working for a photographer, which led me to learning Photoshop and illustrator, which landed me at my current job which is for a screen printing company. 

I started there in 2018, quit in 2021, went to a software engineering bootcamp, hustled my ass off trying to find a job in the tech field but had no luck. Went back to the print shop.

I make $23 an hour. I pay 300 a month for health insurance on top of having to meet a $2500 yearly deductible. I live outside NYC in a very expensive area. 

We used to get annual raises but no one has gotten a raise since before Covid. There’s no 401k matching or any of that fancy stuff. I sit behind a computer for like 9 hours a day and it’s draining my soul. 

I’ve applied and interviewed at other shops but it’s all kinda the same deal. Print is old school and run by dudes stuck in their ways of operation like it’s stilll the 90s. I don’t think I want to do it anymore. 

This criminal record thing sucks and it gets in the way. I can’t pass background checks. I can’t even drive for Uber, or do DoorDash or any of those. I’ve been flat out honest about my arrest and still been denied. 

I’ve been highly considering working at Trader Joe’s. My friend has been there for like 5 years and she loves it. Sure I would be taking a big pay cut from 23$/hr but I see so many benefits. They don’t background check, you’re eligible for a raise twice a year, they put a percentage of your salary away in a retirement plan for you. Health insurance is so much more affordable. My friend pays 60$ a paycheck with a 500$ deductible. She works with a mom who has her husband and two kids covered for $250 a month. I pay more than that for just myself. 

I worked in retail all throughout high school and I know it has its faults. But the thought of being up and moving and active, completing tasks, etc sounds exciting to me. I can not stand sitting behind a desk for so long every day. It’s not natural. 

Is abandoning what could have possibly been a graphic design career to work at Trader Joe’s a bad idea?? Does anyone have suggestions about what else I could do moving forward?

Random last thought but one thing that has always interested me since I was legit a little kid was being an X ray technician. I think that ship has sailed due to the arrest though.

I’m a hard worker and I’m just looking to make an honest living and be happy. ",onlyhalfempty,3,1.0,7,1708663207,2024-02-23 04:40:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1axrtqz/should_i_quit_my_job_and_work_at_trader_joes/,2,2024

I have to quit my current job that I CAN talk about in a couple of weeks. Not sad about that because current job sucks and I actually like the new job. But I would lose friends & my relationships with my family would be destroyed.

I’m completely single, I live alone, I have no kids, and I’m not sneaking around and hurting anyone. I just need to be able to explain how my bills are getting paid without the story being at all verifiable. Hours have to be inconsistent; it would need to explain me being gone for hours at random times of the day or night, usually 7 days a week. If it helps, I have an education but very little consistent experience doing anything i could monetize (because of health stuff) so i would be looking at entry level positions.

1axr8ls,Contract Termination,"Hello everyone,  
I recently left my previous company, having submitted my resignation letter to my manager. However, it seems that the letter may not have been processed by HR, as I received a salary for the month of February. Complicating matters further, my manager has since been terminated 1 week after I left, and the HR department is remote, leaving me uncertain about the appropriate steps to take.  
To provide some context, I left the company less than a month ago for a better opportunity, and I was not facing termination. My departure was amicable, but the lack of follow-up on my resignation letter has left me in a bit of a dilemma.  
I've discussed this situation with a former colleague, who suggested that if my contract is not officially terminated, I have a few options:  
Do Nothing: Since the oversight regarding my resignation letter isn't my fault, I could maintain status quo, keeping a copy of the resignation letter in case it's needed.  
Reach Out Now: I could attempt to contact someone in HR, possibly a previous manager or another HR contact via LinkedIn, to inform them that my contract has not been terminated, without directly mentioning the salary issue.  
Wait and Terminate Next Week: Alternatively, I could wait until next week, as I've heard there will be an opportunity to choose between an offer from the new company or taking a severance package and leaving. However, this option raises concerns about potential legal issues, as I've already started a new job.  
Given my circumstances, I'm unsure about the best course of action. Should I proactively address the situation with HR, or wait until next week to terminate my contract and consider the severance package? I'm particularly concerned about the legality of having two full-time jobs overlapping.  
Any advice or insights you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your help!

1axr5bh,"Feeling unappreciated, overworked and stressed out despite having enough staff & budget to meet patients’ needs ","Hello all! 

As the title states I am burnt out, emotionally and mentally exhausted. 

I work in a patient facing role at a hospital. 
I’ve been scheduling and coordinating over 80-100 plus charts including doing registrations for new pts, referrals, labs, medications, follow ups/sick visits, insurance authorizations, getting medical records, hippa release forms, pcp change forms while such handing high volume while my colleagues are taking 2-3 hour lunch breaks, gossiping, stepping away from their desk, shopping, and on their phones. It’s been going on for months now. 

Manager is extremely hands off. I am drafting my concerns about the distribution of the workload, metrics and how performance is being measured. Manager is well aware of the situation but turns a blind eye. 

In the meantime, it’s like the harder you work and the more you take on, the more they expect and continue to demand even more while others coast by. 

Please advise. What would you do and how would you deal with this situation without burning many bridges? 

Should I get HR involved?

1axqv8l,I need some advice,"Hello, I am a female currently in my 20s. I have been working since I was 18 and going to school. I currently work in an office environment. I’ve had a good amount of jobs because I have done different types of work. Basically, I’m never without a job and at the moment I have two. When I was in school, I always dreamed of working because I wanted my own money. I was always a good student and had very high grades. I was the teachers favorite in most classes not all. But I also have a bit of a dark side when I try to analyze myself. Back in school, I remember having, some back-and-forth with teachers and it always kind of felt like certain teachers were really going after me. Not that many but some. Fast forward now I am working and I am so appalled by how abusive managers can be. It’s kind of heartbreaking because back when I was in school I didn’t think it would be so much drama at work. I take it personal which I know I shouldn’t, but it is hard to when I spend most of my time at work. I guess my question is, how can I cope at work? It really gets to me because I know I am a good worker and I have a very abusive boss. I have taken my boss to HR and HR is always on her side although I have proof. HR does not care and being a bully is not illegal basically. Just to be clear I always treat others with respect and my coworkers can say that about me as well. I don’t have problems in the workplace and the only reason I have gone to hr is because I have taken my boss and she is constantly doing stuff to me. How do you all get through it day by day? I don’t understand why people go out of their way to be unnecessarily mean, sarcastic, yell at, be little, and gaslight others? I always try to positively impact others day, even if it means it is with the smile. I really try to stay to myself, and not comment or say things that might upset others unless it affects me. But I also do not like when people are unfair and abusive. Basically, it always feels like I’m job hopping. Yes I’ve lasted like two years at a job or three but I have done a lot of little jobs where I end up walking out or do not last but only a couple months. Is it that people just let themselves get abused? Do they kiss others bottom? why is it that people in the workplace deny seeing things that they actually witness? Why is everyone so scared?

1axqjih,Got moved to a different department for “business needs” and having a hard time,"For context, I work in a small-medium sized tech company. Ive been here a few years and moved up pretty quick to a management role before getting to start a new department with an awesome director. It was honestly going really well before I got suddenly moved to a different department temporarily by C-suite. Their reasoning was because I had good product knowledge. I only had a few days notice before the move so I had to drop all the projects I was working on and leave my already overworked director behind. It’s been made clear to me that this is a good thing and they’re hoping I’ll make positive changes and gain good experience from it. 

The issue is that this department is a dumpster fire and I have no experience with this field of work at all, and my product knowledge isn’t benefitting much. I’m doing my best to contribute and learn but it feels like I’m just doing everyone’s grunt work. I feel really frustrated because it feels like a step down from what I was doing before and is not at all what I was promised. They also didn’t give me a clear deadline when I would be returning to my old job. It’s starting to feel like this was just a hasty decision made to fix understaffing issues for this department.

1axqcn4,Wondering about career path options similar to or beyond what I do now in retail,"I'm a bottom-of-the-chain leader for the freight area at a retail store. I handle the unloading of the truck and pushing the freight to the floor.

I really, really like most aspects of it. I love working with people, I really like trying to lift my team up. I think I'm decent at the tough conversations that need to be had as well as the good ones. I enjoy the constant things to do; physically moving things, moving all around the store, helping people out, etc. I also enjoy (and am generally pretty good at) the organizational aspects of deciding what I need my team to do and how to handle surprise situations.

I'm becoming less and less enthralled by the corporate-ness of some of the things I'm being asked to do, where it feels like a lot of my ability to take initiative or run things efficiently is being taken away in the spirit of micro-managing and ""it looks good on paper"" sentiments.

What type of career(s) could I look at for a similar balance of physically doing things but also managing a lot of organization-type stuff?

1axq0nw,Restructuring has me potentially competing with coworkers for open role. Advice?,"Restructuring has me potentially competing with coworkers for new role. Advice?

I work in tech. Our division is completely reorganizing. My small team is dissolving. There are two brand new groups being stood up. Everyone on my team has to internally apply to be in one of the groups.
 
The first group will do most of the same work our team does today. The expectation is that most of us will move over there. The second group will be more cross-functional, have a broader scope, and will be overall closer to the decisionmaking process.

I am a standout on my small team. I'm in a senior role. We have a manager and an architect (even more senior than me.) I'm effectively third in-command. I am confident I am among the most skilled, most valuable, and hardest working person on the team. It is close between myself and the architect. Us two account for 80-90% of the actual work. I get stuff done, and everyone knows it. The manager is mediocre. The other team members are mediocre.

I find the work of the second group more energizing. A manager position is opening for the second group. On my last check-in with my manager, he mentioned he thinks I would be a good fit for the second group. He also mentioned he was planning to apply for this manager position. I don't know if other positions are opening for the second group in the coming weeks. I don't know if the architect is interested in this manager position also. We haven't been given much info. I just know that a manager position in the second group is open and they're taking applications, starting right now.

On one hand, I want to apply. I want to be a manager, and increase my responsibility. I care about our product and our users and I think I can make the biggest positive impact. I’ve been thinking about putting together a kickass application and fighting tooth and nail for this position. I have years of feedback and results that I could call upon in an interview to make my case very strong.

On the other hand, I feel weird competing with people who I've worked alongside with for years. I don't want to ruffle feathers. I’m quiet, introverted, and not as social as the other folks on my team. Me getting this role could effectively spell a demotion for my current manager. I also don't want to apply and get rejected. Especially if they don't choose me and give it to my current manager. If that ends up happening, they'll probably offer me some senior position in group 1, or some position that opens later in group 2, but I think both of those outcomes could kill my morale. I'd feel overlooked and underappreciated, stuck under the same mediocre management that I’ve languished under for years. I've been thinking that if that happens, I’d probably be motivated to start looking for another job.

Company A is a smaller, but popular global start-up with a lot of promise, and investments from well-known investor companies. The job position isn't quite what he wanted to do for his career, but it something he wanted to learn and will be a valuable skill to have. However, the interview process and the working environment are amazing and something he was looking for. Super great company culture and opportunities to move to different positions, which was encouraged by the manager. Salary is decent with good benefits and hybrid work possible (but mostly on-site). Husband has accepted this offer due to Company B's slow responses.

Company B is a larger, global company with NASDAQ stock options. They are a US-based company but the office in SK is a start-up. The job position is very promising for husband's future and he will have better career opportunities if he can handle the role. This company however, has been very slow to work through the interview process and HR has not been very helpful. Their communcation hasn't been very good and there have been many mistakes with time and incorrect information. He doesn't know what the working environment will be like there, but the role will mostly be remote with some travel involved. The salary will be about 7k higher than Company A. They have finally gotten back to husband about the offer and role and he is torn as to whether he should take the career role or the better culture fit. 

My husband has had bad luck in his previous roles with his working environment so Company A really appealed to him and he said it was the best interview process he has ever had.

1axp0vt,Advice / Tips ,"So - I’m 24, turning 25 soon and I’ve work worked in sales since 2021 after graduating. I’ve always had a back and forth struggle if sales was something I wanted to full blown pursue. 

The last 1.5 ish years I’ve gotten pretty serious about my work and really thought this industry was for me for the long run. 


I’m coming to the realization lately that as good as I am at my job (relatively) produce good work majority of the time, bring in business, build good relationships, —that I’m completely fed up with the fact that my success is solely relied on people seeing value in what I’m saying and my companies product. 

It’s also exhausting having to always talk to people, always be on your game, and having targets hung over your head. 

I’m in fintech sales - so, dealing with investors, portfolio managers, high level executives who are extremely smart and good at what they do, and some extremely entitled and borderline psychotic people.  

Today I had a meeting with an investor who started off by saying (before even the small talk) that he is mean and not a nice person and basically was a complete asshole & condescending. I think it was my breaking point. I had my senior VP on the call with me - thank god because I was in utter fucking shock and didn’t even know how to respond. 


I legitimately had to leave the office early and felt so overwhelmed (dramatic maybe idk but it just made my crumble) 


The earnings potential is good right now,and will be great in years to come if I stick it out. But I just don’t know if it’s worth sticking out. 

Sometimes this job feels so redundant and soul sucking and nerve wrecking.

I graduated high school, did 2.5 years of college and dropped out. My could get my degree but I’m a little strapped for cash, it would take 2 more years, and it was in sociology. Not a lot of money in that degree. 

I work a retail LP job, since I was 18. Got one “promotion” to mobile loss prevention (lead a single stores LP team, about 5 people. Comparable to a store supervisor position). I helped open a new location and train a brand new team for them as well. I can’t move up in this company without a degree, at least from an LP standpoint. 

Is there any jobs I may be qualified for in the LP field without a degree but a lot of experience? I’ve checked but all LP manager jobs require a degree, or experience already being an LP manager

1axnefy,Continue applying to entry level positions or do my MBA? (Canada),"Hello everyone!

I am looking for advice on which path to pursue as I seem to have reached a stump in the road. I graduated back in 2021 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree in business management and a minor in finance. 

After graduation I worked at a bank for 2 years in the high net worth sector. I was let go from my position around 4 months ago. I have not been able to find any positions as my previous work taught me very specific skill sets and I do not want to work in the banking industry anymore. 

It appears the only positions that are reaching out to me are jobs that pay in the 40-50k range which is understandable as they are entry level. My dilemma is whether I should take one of these positions and move up the corporate ladder, or if I should do my MBA to somewhat fast track the career path. 

The problem is if I go the MBA route, I am not guaranteed anything at all and I would have to network network network which is understandable. Again this is a gamble still at the end of the day. 

The second option is I continue with the low paying positions and hope to move up the ladder to a more reasonable salary. As a reference the position I was let go from was ~$80,000 mark.

Down the line in my career I would love to reach 150-200k range although this is hard to do with Canadian salaries. 

I am 24 years old and just looking for advice on what people would do in my position. Or if there are any other routes I’m open to suggestions.

1axn4h8,I made 100k working for the UN. I’ve fucked up and I need help to get out of here.,"I started as a passionate young professional at the UN. I was planning on joining the foreign service but I thought the UN was more ethical (and I couldn’t afford to study full-time for 5 more years after my bachelor without guarantees of success, as it is required in my country - somewhere in Europe). 

After doing very stupid admin tasks at a UN agency for 5 years, I have about 150k in savings. I am 30 and I feel I have fucked up - I don’t have a career, I don’t have specialist knowledge, I don’t like the city I live in and I don’t know how to progress in life. I was one of the bests students in my class (I did law and international relations) and now I feel I don’t add any value to society. I want to feel useful while doing something ethical, but I also don’t want to work for a random NGO, I need to make a living and support my parents. 

I will probably be unemployed in a year, but even if I had an offer to stay, thinking about dying in this agency doing admin work seems like my worst nightmare. I felt I had become totally dumb, so my self-confidence was at a great low. I’m gaining back my strength after a rough period of depression, but I just don’t know what goals to set for myself.  And given the situation and the fact that I’ll have to pay bills, dreaming might be too much of a word right now. 

I have considered stopping working and trying the foreign service exam, although my passion has faded.

1axlrq8,HELP,"HELP 

Sorry it’s a longer post. If this isn’t the correct sub, please let me know! This is truly a desperation post, as I’ve been wrestling with my situation over two years and am now at the point of HAVING to figure out an answer, and turning to Reddit should’ve happened sooner o suppose, but here we go…

I need all possible avenues to a decent job based on my details below. My path is weird but HAS to have led SOMEWHERE for me I’m hoping(?). Here’s the main points with commentary where appropriate:

Bachelors of Science in Psychology 

(I earned this in preparation for an inevitable divorce which, I knew at the time, was also going to cause me to lose my career then, which was the ministry. Because of divorce and, to be honest, many many more reason, I have no desire or available path in the 
ministry. The work I did related to working with people in counseling or guidance, and the research and teaching and public speaking, however, may have some value, I’m wondering?)

I was a pastor for over 15 years. My seminary is not accredited, however, which limits the value of that 4-year degree. 

My main experience aside from (and occurring mostly prior to) being a pastor was in construction. I’m almost 53 now, and due to wear and tear and a disintegrating back (a bit of an exaggeration), I’m physically not able to work that job full time anymore, so that’s probably not the direction I can go? 

I’m looking at tech and em trying to get thru a QA engineer course but haven’t seen great options in job boards so I’m not sure the jobs are even out there? I’m looking at the programming bootcamps but am worried about owing another few grand for a certificate/license/whatever tf for a job that won’t be there? 

I’ve been doing handyman/maintenance work for my dad who graciously provided me with some work due to my circumstances, but those hours aren’t available anymore and door dashing has been my only income for a couple months now. This obviously isn’t going to get it done, as my car is legit falling apart faster than I can afford to keep upkeep on it. 

Would love to work remote even doing customer service or data entry at this point, but are those even real things? (Kinda joking…def no success finding legitimate opportunities there though). 

I’m just…yeah. Wasn’t planning on trying to start over at 50+, friends. Thankful for any honest, helpful advice. 

TLDR: former pastor and carpenter basically unemployed and very unsure of what my options are. Goal is to suss through those options once more understood, and roll from there.

1axkbq2,"Sales and SB experience, but only soft skills and arts degrees. What can I do?","Hey all, I'm happy to elaborate.

&#x200B;

I find myself in my mid-30's needing a new career. I did my degrees in Music Composition (hint: if you need a degree in comp, you aren't good enough to be professional) and have spent the decade in a few different jobs. I worked 3 and a half years as a quite successful (although miserable) car salesman before making the jump to the vendor side of that industry, working for a dealership software company in a sales role. I was by far the most junior person on my team when the pandemic hit and I was laid off. Since then I've worked for a small ecommerce business in the hobby gardening space. Over the last 3.5 years I've streamlined their processes, organized their warehouse, handled a lot of customer service and all the phone traffic, managed their wholesale program and accounts, and generally act as a jack-of-all-trades. As much as I love the position and the company, there is no real potential for my salary to grow and I've streamlined a lot of the company's work to the point that I'll likely not be ""needed"" soon, especially if the owner decides to go back to working full-time, which he currently does not. Long story short, the hand is writing on the wall and it would be best if I moved on.

&#x200B;

I'm interested in a career which can provide me with more growth potential. As I think about what I am qualified to do, I come up feeling pretty down on myself. I'm all soft skills- phone and written communication, CS/CX stuff, sales, etc. The thing about this is that many of the roles I meet the qualifications for are either sales or other heavily commission-based roles which I have absolutely zero patience for. I'm not opposed to a sales role- repping an excellent product is great. With that said, roles that provide a livable base salary are few and far-between and I hate the stress of living on commission. I'm well spoken and particularly good on the phone. I'm good with numbers and spreadsheets although I have no formal education in analysis (I've done a bit in my current role but it's all self-taught). I can understand complex rules and regulations well but I have no education in the law or compliance. I can't shake this feeling that I need to get a technical degree to find a job I like and that will challenge me, but I have neither the time nor the money for that at this stage in my life. I've considered trying for a role in finance, data analysis, or city government, but I have no idea where to start. I'm just looking for some thoughts or ideas I may not have considered from unbiased strangers.

1axit4p,Any tips for getting into sales and leveraging my background in law and entrepreneurship?,"I have a bit of an eclectic background. Long story short, I started as a tax lawyer for a few years, then tax consultant for another few. I never liked it, so in 2017 I went back to school to pursue something I was more passionate about, studio arts, where I got to dabble a bit in video production. I graduated top of my department and went to work as a director for a small corporate video production company. Less than a year later, I started my own production company with a partner. From a sales perspective, we were able to build a pretty impressive list of loyal clients in the past three years, including municipalities, law firms, museums, etc.   
I recently decided to get out of the business and sell my shares to my partner. The decision was mostly based on wanting to keep a good relationship with my now ex-partner as he is a family member (I know, I know, never mix family and business). Since then, I’ve become interested in pursuing a career in sales and I’m wondering what the best strategy would be considering my background. I’ve sent out a few applications to potential employers for junior positions, but from the response (or lack thereof), I feel like some employers may be put off by my professional experience. Also, I feel like the prospects in my city are somewhat limited, so I would consider a remote position, but I also feel like I could greatly benefit from training, which I’m guessing most often happens in person. In terms of industry, I’m open. Any advice on how to handle this career change is appreciated, thanks!

1axijnj,Veteran Unsure of a Direction,"**Background**: I am a 27 year old married father and have been separated from the Navy for about a year now. I was a Sonar Technician (STG1) and served for 8 years mostly overseas in the Pacific. I absolutely loved my job. I was meritoriously advanced to E-6 prior to hitting my 5 year mark in the service,  everything was absolutely great. I dug in to the material. Spent many nights and weekends on the ship. So much so that my leadership sent me to STG Journeyman school as a ""homegrow"", which does not happen all that often. I read about not just my own job but anything I could find. Tactics, other watchstations, weapons, engineering layouts, foreign diplomacy, etc. You name it I soaked it up. I took on many collaterals while on the ship and went the ""tacticool"" weapons/VBSS route. I had just met my now wife and was ""mapped"" to STG1 after receiving a ""BZ"" for my performance during the training cycle. I was a super star 7th fleet sailor teetering with the idea of going ACINT or putting in an LDO package. With 15 years left on my career at a minimum, I had my sights set very high and with good reason given my previous track record. 

**The Setback**: I have had nosebleeds my whole life. Nothing major but every year or two I will go to an ENT and have my vessels cauterized and that usually minimizes the bleeding. Well I was having this done back in September of 2020. I went in like any other day and had an electrocautery performed. No big deal. Next day I receive a text that I am on the ""random covid test"" list that the ship had just begun requiring. This was an attempt to slow down the transmission of covid on base and on the ships. Another no big deal. Well as I stood in line I remembered my nose was still a little sore from the afternoon prior. I told her that and figured it would be fine and she would be gentle. Well boy was I wrong. I get my nose swabbed, burns a little, but I go about my day. It wasn't until two days following when I was on the ""random"" list yet again I realized this could be a problem. I asked again if I could be administered the saliva test but was denied that request. I ended up sucking it up and let them swab since they do not offer any other options outside of quarantine. Over the next two weeks I was ""randomly"" tested 5 more times and due to the wording of the instructions on the installation at the time I had no choice to be swabbed. My septum became infected, and then perforated. I then received a nasal rhinoplasty in Japan. All of this caused me to have to leave the ship and go LIMDU. My nose sadly did not heal as planned and left permanent sensory damage to both my smell and taste. The Navy saw this as grounds for medboard and then 3 years after that one doctors appointment, discharge. 

**What now?**: I have been out of the Navy for about a year now. I attended school online for Computer Science for the first 8 or so months and then just completely lost the mojo to continue. Why computer science? I have no idea. People say its a good field and I am very good at math but I am a people person. I am currently a stay at home father while my wife works. She is almost done with her commitments and then I will be making my return to the workforce. I feel completely lost on what to do next. Part of the military that I liked so much was the structure. I knew exactly how the rest of my life was going to look because I could map it out year by year on the career ladder. I felt empowered and happy while working within the Navy. I loved the learning, the people, and the structure. I am having trouble finding something like this within the civilian world. I have always had an interest in Psychology and Mental Health but do not even know the destination or how to get there. I have never had strong role model figures in my life outside of those I met within the Navy. I feel that I am stuck in a rut right now and need the push out to greatness again. I feel my standout traits are leadership capabilities, unique and adaptive problem solving style, and devotion to knowledge. I guess I have been told throughout my career how great I was for the Navy, and as good as that makes me feel I do not know how to use it now. I appreciate anyone who has gotten this far and has any advice for me.

At the current time, I have decided to do a graduate certificate from the same department that I can roll into the MPH, if I decide to continue. The question I have, is would it be better to consider a Epi specific degree (or one that has more emphasis in Epi)? Those of you with MPH degrees, how has it worked out?

Well, I had my performance review with my current manager this past January and he wasn't aware of it. He then spoke to the senior director and both agreed I need to be compensated to match my skill set but they don't have a budgeted number yet and don't know when.

I'm currently working as a retail meat cutter. The job has it's perks, as I love working with food and it is a lax, small operation that allows me some privacy working with my team of guys who are all great coworkers.

I know there is a pay ceiling that im nearly touching, and i never planned on staying in a grocery store environment. I don't want to enter management and be stuck in customer service indefinitely. 

I've never been very mechanically inclined. However, the limited (in some cases) schooling and hands-on nature of trade work is appealing to me.

As it stands I'm a media student but I don't really enjoy it or see myself being successful in it. I don't really mesh well with the personalities of people in media and my university basically just focuses on news casting which I have 0 interest in.

1axdxij,Medical Anthropology/MPH/Biological Anthropology career paths?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently in the stage of my life of deciding what I want to do after graduation. I graduated with a BS in biology with a forensic biology specialization originally hoping to go in that route, but after a while of being out of school and working in healthcare I’ve been thinking about pursuing medical anthropology or continuing biological anthropology. I was wondering if anyone had any input about these career paths.

A couple of other things about me to take into consideration:
- I’m interested in pursuing a masters, but not necessarily a PhD (this is where I don’t know how successful you can be with just a masters or what the options even are)

- What can you do with either of these degrees? How does the job market look?

- Thought about MPH as opposed to medical anthropology but if I did MPH is there a way I could specialize or specialize towards medical anthropology?

- I don’t have a specific area of study in mind at the moment, but I have also been interested in genetics and still the forensics route (did some work in building experience for applying to genetic counseling programs for a while)

- What would be good internships to look into? I’m planning on staying at my current job at least until September so this might be tricky, but in the meantime is there anything else I can do to get more experience and exposure? 

I’m also planning on reaching out to one of my old forensic anthropology professors to discuss this further. Again, I still have to do more research as I have only recently reopened my consideration in this field, but I would love to hear anyone’s input (don’t be afraid to be honest)!",Infamous_Buyer4472,1,1.0,0,1708627021,2024-02-22 18:37:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1axdxij/medical_anthropologymphbiological_anthropology/,2,2024
1axdret,Advice: Insurance FP&A to Hospital Financial Analyst when long term goal is government work?,"Hi, looking for some advice here..

I currently work at a large Insurance company in the healthcare space as an FP&A analyst. Been here a year, pay is below average, work is definitely very long and stressful as we take part in the close process each month. Unfortunately we have a senior that joined recently so I am stuck on this team in my position, we aren’t allowed 2 seniors on the team. 

I have a friend that has an open position, Senior Financial Analyst, in one of our hospitals, same company, different division (Hospital Services instead of Insurance Services). Pay is better sure, and better room to move upward on their team, but I’m worried about career opportunity in the long run. 

My goal eventually is to movie into government Finance, but not particularly healthcare. I’ve spent awhile researching potential moves into government FP&A work as well as analyst positions such as budget analyst, management analyst, etc.

So I’d like some advice: would taking a hospital financial analyst position hinder my goal in the long run? It seems like hospital analysts work more on the hospital management side and reporting in that space (obviously probably) so thinks like headcount, bed management, managing hospital budget, yearly budget creation, also NOT a part on the close process each month. 

I can tell if this would be bad for my goals or not.

1axdpfc,Remote role at 64k or Restaurant Management for 85k at 50 hours a week,"Hi, so I am currently in a recruiting role that is remote. It is a bit of a dead end at the moment but I brought this up to my boss and they are entertaining the idea of me being in a management role that will probably end up being around 73-75k a year in a hybrid situation.

At the same time I was offered a restaurant manager role (I was a manager for 8 years prior) for a lot more money. I do have a wife and kid to look over. My wife does work too but we feel like we need more cushion in terms of savings. 

Do you think I should take the restaurant manager role knowing it has better benefits and more pay. Or stick it out with my current job and try to prove myself to get the management role for about 9-10k bump. The recruiting role I know has a lot more work life balance.

1axcdu9,"My insecure coworker is trying to play boss, and I need advice on how to deal with it","As the title says, I could really use some advice. I (32f) joined a start-up 5 months ago as head of marketing. I've worked in this sector, and in this field, for the past 7 years. The start-up management team is comprised on individuals who have, largerly, never worked for a normal company. They're mostly PDH students and ex-consultants, which is why they hired me. One of those ex-consultants (38?f) has a sales role but did some marketing on the side, which she now needs to let go of. 

And she's dealing with that as one would expect; kicking and crying. She's openly admitted that she felt threatened by having another senior lady join the management team and said that she questions her own value to the company. She also said she has a hard time letting go of marketing, and when I got the CEO to agree to a new logo, she said it 'really stung that they said yes to me, but not to her when she'd asked them before'. She seems incredibly insecure and jealous.

I just don't know how to deal with her. On more than one occasion she has 1) Posed off my ideas as if they were her own, 2) Challenged me on my knowledge in group meetings and discredited me (it's hurt my reputation), 3) Taken charge of my meetings or projects that I started 4) Pretended to tell me what to do in group meetings, 5) Gossiped behind my back to our manager. Ofcourse there's more, but the point is; It's affecting the joy I get out of working in this place. On days I do not have to talk to her, I feel great. On days I do talk to her, I often feel annoyed and I've noticed that some of my social anxiety/panic attacks have returned.

What I've tried so far: I've had a conversation with er about some of her behaviour and I've spoked to our manager in the second month I joined the company. Nothing really changed. I then tried to build up a relationship with her by talking to her on a more casual level, inviting her over for dinner, babysitting her dog... Nothing changed.

I'd like to stay, because building up a marketing team and a company from scratch has been one of my dreams... leaving is my last resort, but it's definitely been on my mind.

1axbk2h,"Am I overthinking this, or am I suspecting workplace favoritism?","Hi Reddit. I wanted to come here to confirm/deny my suspicions about something I have been noticing since my internship, and now my full time job.  
I have a coworker, who interned with me this past summer, let's call her X. Both of us have joined full time to the same team, but I suspect that my higher ups are favoring her more through subtle behaviors and I can't shake it off. It especially bothers me because I did more work than her over the summer, but my work felt pretty much unacknowledged. There are 3 incidents on which I'm hinging this conclusion so far:  
Over the summer, the manager ""tasked"" X with creating a presentation for our team. She misunderstood the instructions and we were told to redo it. Since no one was willing to pick up the slack, I ended up working 4 hours overtime to fix that presentation and submitting it in time. After the presentation ended, the higher ups asked X all of the ""how was your experience"" questions and did not even acknowledge me at all, even though I gave a bulk of that presentation.  
I joined in 2 weeks ago, and had to contact my other higher up for a question. I looped in both me and X into this conversation as both of us were facing the same issue. The higher up ended up going to X's desk to clarify the question to HER even though I asked the question, and did not even bother to acknowledge me then until I stepped into the conversation.  
Today, the other higher up (boss's boss), individually messaged X about ""a problem he wants to run by both of us"", but didn't bother to loop me in on this conversation.  
When I reflect on all of this, I tried to be realistic on whether I'm taking enough initiative to be social/ask questions with these higher ups. I am not socially awkward, or pompous, and I get along well with people. I think it's also important to mention that coworker X tutors my manager's kids (which is supposed to be a hush hush). Even though X is my close friend, I feel incredibly angry at how im being treated. I'm not going to bust my ""ass"" to prove myself, but I just want to be realistic now so I know to move out of my team as early as I can. Am I overthinking?

1axbbk4,Feeling defeated - I feel like I wasted 4 years of college on a criminal justice degree. ,"So the title basically says what my issue is. 4 years ago in Dec 2020, I graduated from college with a Criminal Justice degree. I knew it was gonna be a challenge at first but I thought eventually I would find a job that I like. The problem is I never really wanted to be in law enforcement. I thought I could find an office job that pays fairly well and settle there, I guess I was wrong. Since November 2021, I’ve been working as a detention officer (don’t even need a degree to do that) and lately I have been feeling so defeated. I hate my job so much, I feel like I should be making more and work better hours, I spent 4 years working on a degree and it all doesn’t matter. If I would’ve known and had guidance when I started college, I would’ve majored in computer science engineering, nursing or something.

1axay9e,"46, recently laid off from tech and worried I won't even be able to get a retail job.","Sorry for trauma dumping here but the gist of it is that I just got laid off from a software dev job, my first one, and due to the state of the market in addition to my lack of qualifications, I know that it's unlikely I'll be getting another one in the near future. 

Truth is the only reason I got this job to begin was though a friend who was starting a SaaS company, and he needed a cheap dev and I needed a job. It worked out awesome until the company failed. 

I've been really depressed lately and doing a lot of soul searching and realized that almost every career I've had in my adult life was the result of some form of nepotism, and if you look at my career history, it's all over the place. 

That's not to say I didn't grow into the roles and work hard, I did, but I never felt like I accomplished anything on my own, and now here I am, unable to fall back on previous fields some of which I haven't worked in for as long as 10 years in some cases.   


I need to do *something* and I would gladly take a retail job at this point, but I can only imagine a retail hiring manager looking at my resume and wondering wtf is wrong with this 46 year old software developer willing to flip burgers. I have tweaked my resume to make it less tech heavy but I had to include my previous jobs just to show what I've been doing these past years.   


I have a plan though. I'm going back to college since I never did and it's always messed with my self esteem and hurt my potential. I want to accomplish something on my own for once, namely going into healthcare, but I need to keep myself afloat in the meantime without being too much of a burden on my spouse.  


Every retail/food service place in my neighborhood has mostly teens/20-something year olds working there. Who the heck is going to hire me?   


Assuming I do get an interview with a retail hiring manager, how do I begin to explain myself without it sounding like I'm temporarily ""settling"" and that I'll be gone the instant something better comes along? Ideally I would find a position with flexible scheduling that will work with my schooling. I'll gladly stick around if it works. Do I even mention my college plans?   


I'm rambling so my question is for anyone who had to find entry-level work while middle aged and a semi-professional background, how did you do it?

1axaano,I took a wrong turn in my career… Should i wait before moving on?,"TLDR at the end.  
  
The story, which I’ll try to keep short is that I’ve been on product management roles for around 10 years. My experience has perhaps been a lucky one, since at every role and every company I worked for (around 5) i always had:  
  
Influence. From little to a lot. I always had a say in the product, design, in the team, in management, in many things that matter.  
  
Freedom. Large chunks of my objectives where for me to decide on how to tackle them, manage them, talk them through, etc.  
  
Creative freedom. Might be a synonym with above, but some of you surely understand that also being able to co-create with the design/business team can be a interesting process and separate from other types of freedom.  
  
Customer/User Closeness. I was always able to chat, interview, join a workshop, see metrics, analytics, kpis about my users.  
  
I had bad things as well. I had bad boring products, I had toxic dev teams, I had low budgets and frugal companies that don’t want to invest, I had uncertain objectives, I had terrible managers, I had to step in as scrum master, tester, project manager and even salesman.  
  
But this job… It seemed so good on paper. A digital product within a cool large company (Forbes 100) and all the interviews went swimmingly well, the people that interviewed me all seemed enthusiastic and happy to have me and to work on that project. And I’m making more than ever before.  
  
But i lost all of that, which used to bring me some type of challenge/joy/a way to do my work. I thrived with those elements.  
  
The role is also a kind of product owner, more than manager. Meh.. I’ll be honest. It’s a 98% owner, 2% Manager. Which… sucks at this point in my career. I’m kind of done with writing requirements, US, feats, etc. I can do it (I’m doing it) but it is quite joyless specially for the type of product it is.  
  
What are the red, or yellow flags, I should have asked or noticed?  
  
SAFe. SAFe kind of sucks… I know that now.. I should have asked..  
  
Size of the project. There’s nearly 500 people, mostly devs, but at least a 100 people are just a bureaucracy apparatus inherent to SAFe or large companies.  
  
Excessive use of outsourcing down to having all time zones doing something at any time of the day. (I know this can work, but it doesn’t quite work in here, ok?)  
  
I’m considering searching for new jobs, even though it’s only been 3 months. But it kinda sucks.. if I knew I could have just kept my old job… sigh.  
  
TL;DR  
I recently switched jobs to join a larger company for a considerable increase in compensation, only to find myself as a Product Owner within a toxic project using the SAFe Framework with little influence and power. Should I soldier on for a while? Or just nip it in the bud before I commit myself more?",seawitanencorto,1,1.0,0,1708618583,2024-02-22 16:16:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1axaano/i_took_a_wrong_turn_in_my_career_should_i_wait/,2,2024

1ax8myi,Am I an over needy report? ,"I'm worried I'm taking up too much of my managers time. 

They've been my manager for a few months now, they're responsive, helpful, thoughtful. However I seem to have gotten a number of go nowhere projects (Sr Business Analyst), and either run into brick walls with other departments trying to get things done (BA is pretty political) or projects were too vague with indifferent stakeholders. 

I've started ideating other projects in my area on my own (self directed or meddlesome? 😅), which get traction and results. Nonetheless, it seems like my management (Ops) isn't influencing other areas (Sales, Product), and everything in assigned flops. 

BA next to me - same manager and department - is getting well-defined, straightforward projects like ""implement this software everybody wants/needs"". I'm getting ""go to this department and do an efficiency analysis"" and obviously they're pushing back, I get the runaround, and they won't identify any inefficiencies - and management doesn't back me up. I'm left off email threads and meetings until well after business dictates that they should do ""A Thing"" but sets no scope or objective and builds no consensus around need.

I frequently check in with my manager about these issues, sometimes regarding friction with the other departments, sometimes about the vagueness of the projects. As a BA I'm supposed to drive those project structures - at least in my org as I'm not also paired with a PM. And I'm familiar with the whole ""BA needs influence without power"", but there doesn't seem to be any ""socialization"" or buy-in of the projects. 

As the history of flop projects becomes *my* history of fails, it seems more and more like I'm doing a bad job. It's feeling like I'm going to my manager with excuses, whining, and insecurity. I always have specific barriers in asking for assistance with from the manager, but it's too much for me anymore. 

My performance review was very positive with not many issues (zero around efficiency and efficacy), but there were no standout projects except one that I initiated, planned, completed in H1.

How can I tell if my manager is sick of hearing from me? Am I actually being handed garbage projects, and is there a way to know if there's some reason? Am I going to be hearing ""these were good projects, you just failed to mobilize these people""? The manager recently mentioned securing more buy-in and sign offs - is that my job or management?

1ax8kp2,"Owner lost a government contract, tells everyone we may not make it six more months, gives me 3x workload ","Just a rant here for you guys, as my work life has gone to hell in the span of two days:

I work for a family owned small business.

I actually DID love my job. Or aspects of it anyways. I was very enthusiastic about it, would sometimes think about ways to improve things even when I wasn't working because that's how great it was. They even recently moved me into a new office that I love. (I've been here for a year, took a $6/hourly paycut to come here because my old job was too stressful). The odd thing is I am actually more burdened at this job in terms of workload but I have not minded because I enjoy it. 

So Tuesday, I had to inform the owner we lost the bid for a large contract that the company has gotten for about 7 consecutive years. It accounts for about 10% of the gross revenue. 

She starts flipping her shit. Pretty much tells everyone here that we may not make it 6 more months. Not really in any delicate way either, it really upset some coworkers.

I did not sleep that night.

Then yesterday, Wednesday (which is my busiest day of the week and I'm busting my ass off of no sleep) she comes to my work station with a list 7 of new things for me to start doing ""if we're going to try and make it"". She tells me these ideas all came from her son, who I know personally to be a frequent drug user that exploits his elderly mother and I have zero professional respect for. Likely, this is where all the company money is going and why losing 10% gross is such a back-breaker. 

Two of the ideas were OK. Four were poor in my opinion. One was absolutely retarded and I could not bite my tongue. I let her know about it. 

Anyways, I went from being so happy to miserable in two days. Is this just a bad week? Should I leave ASAP or see what happens?",RandyShannon,1,0.5,1,1708614359,2024-02-22 15:05:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ax8kp2/owner_lost_a_government_contract_tells_everyone/,2,2024

1ax8bjg,How to deal with a boss that has a defeatism mentality?,"I like the industry that I work in; it provides a lot of opportunity for knowledge/skills expansion and growth. However, my direct boss has a defeatist mentality, complains a lot with no action (despite being in a position of authority), and is unprofessional by openly engaging in gossip about people within the company. I am beginning to notice a trickle down effect with other team members causing low morale; I hear a lot of “…if he doesn’t care, why should I?”. It’s a small R&D team (about 15 people), I usually keep busy with my work as I am more on the introversion side of the spectrum, I will assist others when/if they ask for help, and perform extra tasks out of my scope to help complete projects.

Should I just deal with it for the time being because “that’s life/people”, or should I actively seek other roles within the company? I would prefer to do things that don’t involve HR if I can to avoid being a target of their gossip. What things do you tell yourself to push through? What actions have you taken if you’ve been in a similar situation?

I work on not taking things personally, and tell myself it’s just work, but I can foresee issues in the future if I don’t take action now. Am I just gaslighting myself by thinking it’s not that bad?

Also, I’m hesitant to leave because:
1) Job market sucks and cannot find a job with a reasonable salary at the moment
2) Benefits are great
3) “Golden Handcuffs” stock vesting schedule/ESPP
4) Opportunities to learn new technologies

1ax7pcn,Implementation Specialist? Or Branch Manager?,"BACKSTORY  
I'm having a really hard time deciding, so I figured I'd get some online opinions. I've been a film producer and script supervisor for 4 years after college. I've had a pretty successful run doing both positions and have made enough to get by each year. However, my wife and I just had twins, and we need a more stable income. This leads to me making the decision to leave the film industry and pursue something in education, staffing, or healthcare. I seek to serve the community in my career, helping people wherever I can.

FUTURE GOALS/AIMS  
I'd like to one day own and run a company. I enjoy getting a team together to build something bigger than yourself, and I've been able to do this in my film past.  


THE QUESTION  
I have two offers in front of me:  
1.  An implementation specialist at a small and quickly growing edtech firm which sells a REALLY cool piece of software that I feel is needed in the industry.  
2.  A branch manager for a national staffing company, where I would oversee a team, gain a commission based on performance, etc.  


Both jobs have the same starting salary.  


MY STRENGTHS AND LIKES  
I have always loved solving people's problems, or rather, helping them find the solution to their problem. I love people.   
I want to make a large sum of money in order to have a big family + help out financially in the community wherever I see an opportunity. I see money as a tool to change the world.  
I'm great at running projects. I don't have insane organizations skills, I'm just paranoid which leads me to be great with details because I double and triple check everything.

1ax6aix,Would you take a new position with another department at your company for the same pay?,"I’m struggling to figure out if this would be a good move for my career. I currently work for a F100 company on a product team that is full remote with occasional travel to the office. I like my job and report directly to the head of my department, and I like that aspect, but I have a ton of responsibilities, at a higher level than my position. I get to learn a lot but since we’re a small team, sometimes it feels like I’m just doing everything to fill gaps. We’re not very well funded, but do have some cutting edge technology and other perks. 

A new role has opened up on a different product team that is a lot bigger and is always well resourced and funded. The director of that team as asked if I would like to work there in a similar role. He said I wouldn’t have as many responsibilities since they have more people so each person is not expected to do it all. The pay would be the same, but I would have to come into the office more often at least 3 times a week. The position also reports to a middle manager on their team. That person is fairly new to the company and is still learning. The technology they work with is kind of boring. He told me I was be well funded and resourced to start new projects, since they move quickly, which is the opposite of my current team.

1ax644c,My former manager was trying to get me to quit and then had her friend send me harassing messages. ,"My former manager, lets call her Janet, was a very disgruntled employee. Janet wasn't very nice to me either. Sometimes we got along just fine.


Well Janet left about a month ago, but as she was leaving, she shared a lot of things with me about the company financially. Some generalized/vague statements, some specific. She insinuated my job was at risk and told me to start looking. She continued these talks with me through text even after she left and seemed to genuinly be worried for me. 


Well I did start looking and found another job, lateral move. However, I really like my current job and have a good relationship with my current boss (Janet's former boss). I decided to be transparent and let them know I was worried about job security and mentioned my former manager said it was at risk (and I was vague, did not give the specific details she gave me). I was transparent because it just felt off. Janet seemed very sincere/genuine with me, but the things she said just didn't line up with what was actually going on. My boss was reassuring and also let me know that since Janet left, they did not plan to hire a replacement anytime soon and wanted to give me a raise, and they really like all the work I have done.


Anyways, my current boss asked one of her colleagues at her level who had a relationship with former boss to reach out to Janet and see why she was trying to influence me. Janet denied speaking with me often (even though I have text proof) and said I was a liar. She then sent me some nasty messages. I blocked her.


A few days later, a former colleague who was let go, but friends with Janet, also sent a nasty message calling me a liar and then added personal insults as well. 



I felt harassed when I received the message from the former colleague who I had never spoken to outside of work before. I sent it to my current boss and met with HR about it.



Now I'm worried my job thinks I'm a dramatic employee for having all this happen. They seem very sympathetic. They have tried to reach out to Janet since, and she has blocked all contact with everyone. Do you think my job thinks I'm a problem employee for this happening? Should I be stressed about this?

1ax61lj,Searching for a profession (calling) at 30+ years old. Classification of professions.,"In my 30(m), I've decided to finally choose a career/profession that truly resonates with me. It's another cycle in the quest to find myself.

&#x200B;

  
Sometimes, I tend to look at situations too narrowly. I get bogged down in details and fail to see the bigger picture. I want to ask you: How can I familiarize myself with the full spectrum of possible professions and career paths?  
To choose the most suitable option, one needs to see the whole picture, right?  
There are probably some cool professions out there that might suit me, but I might not even know they exist.  
Is there some sort of profession classifier?  
Perhaps there are some overviews of modern professions that have recently emerged and are little known to most people. Please provide examples of such professions in the comments that you have learned about very recently.

1ax5ytu,Tried to get my old coworker a job at my company & now she might be getting ghosted. ,"I referred a former colleague for an open role at my company. My manager’s manager is the one doing the hiring. I wrote my former colleague a killer recommendation/introduction, & my colleague went above & beyond preparing for the interview by providing a free strategy deck. 

Unfortunately, it sounds like my colleague will not get the role. My manager told me that our company loves her but can’t afford her; she may be overqualified. They decided to interview other candidates & intend to fill the role by the end of the month. I don’t know if an offer has been made yet. 

Yesterday, my former colleague reached out to me via email to ask for an update. It sounds like my manager’s manager is ignoring her follow up emails. Colleague is super talented & has other options, but it sounds like my company’s role is her first choice. 

I’m bummed because my former colleague is delightful & has niche experience in our industry that would make her an incredible asset, but it’s not my decision. 

What’s the best way to handle this situation? Between not wanting to burn a bridge with my former co-worker & not wanting to piss off my manager’s manager, I have no idea what to do.

1ax5c0e,Improving communication style?,"Hi all, I’ve just moved into a product manager role after previously being in a marketing analyst style role. I’m comfortable with Agile, I’ve got my dev team working on some great projects, and I’m doing well at unblocking their tickets. One major area for growth though is my communication style.
  
My manager hasn’t been that specific yet but I think I know a few issues here. As I have to keep stakeholders on side and maintain healthy relationships with people as a requirement of the role, I’m going to have to make some changes to:
- Sitting still in meetings (ADHD…)
- Avoiding touching my face, furrowing or rubbing my brow.
- working on being less direct or blunt, more diplomatic.
- not letting stress or discomfort show to others. 

My last role was about data and I could really rely on it to get what I needed done. This role is about coercion, reaching consensus and compromise. I can be a bubbly and friendly guy at times but obviously not all the time, especially when you have to push back on things.
  
Those who are product managers or are in leadership, how do you do it? It seems I’ll always have to be “performing” in the acting sense to hide my true thoughts and feelings.

1ax33f7,Switching from Dentistry to Corporate Sector.,"
I recently graduated Dental School from India and when I started applying for jobs, I felt discouraged and disrespected. As an intern, I previously worked at a private clinic for FREE 8months straight. I thought I’d get paid once I have my license.

Now, the highest offer I have received is 10k INR/month for working 12 hours daily and before that I’ll be on unpaid observation period for 2-3 months.

I found this experience very discouraging since I can’t afford to set up my own clinic yet and in a metro city this kind of salary is not at all sustainable.

I thought about other non clinical options such as Business, Corporate etc but being a clinical person, I have no experience or knowledge about these options. I’m not even sure if I’ll be able to do well here since I’ve always imagined myself as a clinician.

But in the given situation where my parents are retiring, brother still studying in first year, I’ll be the sole earner in my family soon and dentistry isn’t going to help me survive, not even barely.

Yes, we do have savings but why should I rely on that and why do dentists get underpaid so much? If you cant pay at least sustainable salary to a fellow clinician, why hire them and put them in discouraging situations.

Something needs to change in Indian dentistry. My love for dentistry has faded over the months. I used to be so happy treating patients but there’s no growth and life for me here. I’m the eldest and I need to support my family.

Please advise me on what I can do.",-woe-is-me,1,1.0,0,1708597037,2024-02-22 10:17:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ax33f7/switching_from_dentistry_to_corporate_sector/,2,2024
1ax332i,Unsure what to do with my career,"Hi, I graduated as a counsellor last year and had always wanted to work in the mental health industry. Fast forward, I’m working as a counsellor now full time and I’m extremely burnt out. We are expected to process a huge amount of clients with varying presentations and often we are trying to manage clients in crisis. 

Furthermore, we have more and more clients who end up ‘lost in the system’- who are needing more specialist care but it is very difficult for them to access it. It is difficult for me to see this on such a regular basis. 

Since starting this job, I have had to start on antidepressants myself as panic attacks were becoming a daily occurrence (something I have not experienced for 10+years before this!), my energy and motivation are at an all time low too. I am currently off work with WRS. 

I have been looking into leaving my job but there doesn’t seem to be many career options in my field. I have been looking at doing a masters too. Does anyone have any advice for the counselling field? Many thanks!

1ax0rn5,"Boss raged at me, now I don't have the confidence to do my job","My manager's boss lashed out at me in front of the team on my 2nd week for not completing 60 hours of work that they hadn't given me. He was brutal and questioned whether or not I had worked in my field before because I was so incompetent.

But it was a step up in my career... I feel so demoralised and I'm now filled with self-doubt.  All my colleagues have flagged it was his problem, and want to support me but I'm still on edge that I'm going to get blamed for nothing.  3 staff, including my manager have reported intolerable levels of being under-resourced and over-worked.

Please give me advice for how to weather this in the interim.  The 3 staff who have burned out quicker than me, are more tenured and admired for their work and he is burning out too.  So I think he will leave if I have a survival strategy.

UPDATE: my colleagues have given me unsolicited praise because they said they absolutely love working with me and they're so inspired as to the way myself and my manager (not her raging boss) have hit the ground running.  And that in my feedback to said boss, that I showed I had more clarity than the rest of the tenured team had in a year (but also I think I answered him back when they hadn't so they were shocked I handled it so well).  Anyway confidence is restored and I can finally push him back, and let those stupid comments roll off me.

1ax0p09,35M MBA in an unpaid internship. Should I just leave?," Hello  
I'm a 35M with an MBA (top of the country) from the EU space. I've held several middle-management positions in large fintech and telco companies. Moved to a different country because my partner got a job offer. I've networked and did everything I could for 9 months but couldn't land a job in this new country. Through mutual friends, I met this C-Level executive at a small financial services company (sovereign debt, EPC+F, project finance, those sorts of services). It's an area I always had an interest in and was never able to break into.  
This was October 2023, C-level exec tells me they can't hire until March 2024. I was bored out of my mind so I suggested I would join pro-bono and we would discuss the situation end of February. Things started great, they loved my work and I also felt that I was bringing value to the business - revamped some old presentation templates, worked on several financial models, and conducted a large feasibility study, among other things.  
Some weeks ago I raised the topic of my integration into the company and was met with ""oh we have to wait until this project is finalized, can't make you an offer until then"". Ok, fair enough. A few weeks pass by and I raise the question again. same answer. I tell them it's getting to the stage where I need to make decisions, at least give me a ball park figure of my compensation so I can decide. Still nothing, ""we can't give you a number until we close"".  
I can't help but feel that I'm being taken advantage of and that I'm being milked for free labor. at the same time, I have nothing else aligned and wouldn't want to push them too much and waste the chance to have an income.  
So, should I just stop working for them at the end of next week? Is setting a deadline for an offer on the table and walking out if they don't deliver? I do understand the constraints of paying a full salary but am I being a prick for thinking that offering to cover the expenses of me actually going to the office would be a show of good faith on their part?  
Again, my contribution has been praised and they are short-staffed. I see the red flags but need the job. At least an income could buy me some time to find a company with less red flags.  
Feel free to ask questions. The might be some nuances to the story that I'm not considering. ",Dry_Performance6885,3,1.0,4,1708587359,2024-02-22 07:35:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ax0p09/35m_mba_in_an_unpaid_internship_should_i_just/,2,2024

1awzbgu,Internship for career change or full-time staying in the same field ,"I’m 24 with some student loan debt and my background is in hard science (biology/chemistry) and all the jobs I’ve had doing science has been through staffing agencies. The contracts have been a year long with pay ranging 18-24/hr USD. Which is low compared to the 65k-75k full time employees in the company I was contracted to make.  I had a really hard time finding full-time science positions for the last 3 years or so. All the science positions are through staffing agencies in the area I’m in for some reason. It can also be super grueling being in your feet for 10 hours running around and doing experiments and no WFH options because your work needs to be in the lab. I’ve done 60 hour weeks because of experiments before and have come in Saturday and Sunday. Despite my manager saying that I’m a fantastic worker, them wanting to keep me, etc. They haven’t made much of an effort to try to hire me full-time and just want to renew my contact with them saying they’d hire me at the end of the next contract. 
I got fed up with that and wanted to go for a career change into marketing/advertising. I’ve still been applying to science positions because that’s what I feel like I’m most qualified for. I ended up getting an internship at a big media company (18/hr) that I was pretty excited for and literally started this week. Coincidentally today a full time science position that I interviewed for months ago extended an offer to me. 65k with a yearly bonus, benefits, etc. and would really help with paying back loans. So now I’m torn between staying at this internship because I’m definitely still interested in doing a career change and the experience would really help on my resume or accepting the full time offer and going back into the sciences that I wanted to leave. The FTE offer seems best compared to the internship, but it means that I’m probably burning a bridge by literally leaving the internship after a week and may not ever get to work for them ever again.

1awysy9,Need help ! Had an screening round with the HR ( Riyadh - Saudi Company ),"Hello everyone, so just a little background about myself I am a full stack dev working in a midsize org. I was actively looking for overseas opportunities. Somehow got shortlisted by a Saudi Company and had an introductory call by them yesterday evening. I was expecting this be an onsite role (hence more salary expectations) since the career page also mentioned the location as Saudi. Coming to the Introductory call, it was great everything went smooth until the point when she asked the salary expectations and broke the ice that this will be a remote role not an onsite role ! Even though its not an issue for me but the salary is now drastically less for the remote role. I just gave an average salary number(after doing some research earlier for a saudi company) to her which seems fair ! Also the career page stated the role is Mid (3-5 Years) but she tells that this would a junior role blah blah. So finally she tells that the number you gave is unrealistic we give that much to senior engineers and so on. She also explained we give Indian and Pak engineers in the range of 1000$ - 2000$. Since I had relevant experience for the role and I pretty much conveyed about my experience in the call I quoted for 2000$ ( Why not aim for higher limit ?) Also since the call went pretty well she mistakenly said that they are interviewing a lot of candidates and this wont be an urgent hire so now 

The main question I need regarding help is this -

“ Since I have quoted 2000$ as my salary expectations would I even be considered for further interviews? “


I just see this as they’re skimming through lot of candidates and just trying to get their best bang of buck ( Thats why hiring cheap labour from ind and pak )

Just a side note- Honestly it was too disappointing since prior to the call I had researched about the average salary which that company could offer(from other companies based in saudi) but after the call it was just a complete disappointment.",NaiveCoder786,1,1.0,0,1708580581,2024-02-22 05:43:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1awysy9/need_help_had_an_screening_round_with_the_hr/,2,2024

1awycdh,Be Greedy or Be Childish? An Amazing Offer in a City That I'd Hate Moving to,"I'm an engineer located in Denver and I recently received a job offer in Nashville for a position that would be a big step up in my career and income. I'd be going from $105k to $125k, which is equivalent to $137k in Denver (cost of living). I don't have anything against Nashville, but I'm just not crazy about the area and I really don't want to live there. Packing up my entire life into a moving pod, driving across the country, and setting up in a new city that I don't love where I don't know anybody makes my heart sink. For those who have never experienced this, it's extremely difficult to become established and make friends from scratch in a new, unfamiliar city. I moved to Denver three years ago and it took me a solid year before I was able to build a proper social circle. I really just don't want to do it again. Accepting this offer would also mean that I'd no longer be able to work remote, which my current employer allows.   
Despite that, the employees and management at the new company seem really great. I had the chance to visit the facility and meet a dozen or so people, and it seems like an awesome team/environment.   
This job would allow me to get my finances squared away in less than three years. I have a lot of debt (student loans, medical, car, etc.) and I'm going to need \~15k worth of dental work in the future (bad genetics). After scaling back my spending and committing to living frugally for the past year, I'm still just not able to pay my debt off as quickly as I'd like. This job would make my financial problems disappear. It would also be a substantial step up in my career. I'd be running a small team of engineers and managing portions of large projects. I think that it would otherwise take a few years (or more) for me to reach that point in my career.  
I currently work 50 hours per week, and the new job would be \~45 hours per week on average. While overtime is common, it's definitely had an impact on my social life, and with the number of open jobs available that don't require overtime, I think it would be totally possible (and preferred) to land a job that will allow me to work just 40 hours but I suspect that these jobs likely wouldn't pay as much.  
I'm a single guy in in early 30's. I know this sounds silly, but I'm concerned that the location (along with the extra hours) would impact my dating life. I wouldn't plan to stay in Tennessee long term, and because of this, I wouldn't date someone who wanted to stay in Tennessee (or the bible belt in general) long term. I imagine that this would likely shrink the dating pool. I'd really like to get married and have kids some day, and being in my early 30's, I sort of feel like I'm running out of time. Committing to a few years in Nashville could potentially set me back, but I don't know for sure. I could be making a big deal out of nothing. It just worries me.  
Pro's- Higher income, able to pay off debt quickly, great career move  
Con's- Located in a city that I don't particularly want to live in, I don't know anybody in town, overtime, could impact dating life and future life plans  
I'd love to hear from anybody who's had to make a similar career decision. Which option did you pick? Did you regret your decision?

1awxxjz,How do I establish professional credibility for myself at work? ,"I love my current job. It pays well; the benefits are good. 

There's just one problem. I'm very inexperienced compared to my coworkers and it's frustrating. I don't have any problems admitting where I fall short, and I'm willing to learn. The thing I see a problem with however, is there's been multiple instances now where I've been asked to change my approach or my understanding of something by someone, only to later be ""corrected"" back to my original idea by someone else (by the time which nobody remembers I was right in the first place). Which overall leads to me feeling like I'm being discredited for everything I do, right or wrong. If I try to stand behind my original ideas, it's often perceived as me being unable to take criticism. 

I feel like there's no malice behind this, but more so an instinctive habit of taking whatever the ""new employee"" does with a grain of salt. 

How does one go about establishing credibility in this situation so my coworkers can trust my judgement a bit more?

1awvtvv,Not sure about job security,"Hi! I am 25F and I've been working at my current job for just over a year, but I'm not sure where I stand in the company. Sometimes I feel like I might lose my job, but other times, I feel like my manager might be creating an opportunity for me to move up. 

My company is a start-up that's been around for a while. I took this job to gain more work experience because I was somewhat new to my career. Unfortunately, I didn't receive any training when I started, so I had to learn the role on my own. Due to this I would checked in with my manager every week to see if I'm meeting expectations and always received good feedback or tips on improvement. My manager left the company without warning and I was assigned to a new manager on a different team. 

When that change happened, I explained everything I was working on to my new manager. They said my workload was heavy, but otherwise, I was doing a good job when I asked for feedback. A couple of weeks later, I had my end-of-year review, and it terrible! They said I took too long to complete projects and made frequent mistakes in my internal emails and presentations that I shared within the company. They said my work quality was poor, and I wasn't timely. I was confused because I actively ask for feedback and provide it. We ended the meeting with a plan to have a 30-day review to check back in and see if things improved. At this point, my new manager had only been my manager for two months. 

Since my end-of-year review, they hired another person to do the same job as me. When I found out, I asked my manager what that would mean for me. They said they didn't have a clear plan, but they needed more support for the team than I could provide. They also mentioned that having less on my plate would give me room to improve myself and encourage me to apply for a different role in the company. I haven't received much clarity on what my role will look like with another person on the team. Today my manager told me that the new person would be taking over all of my major projects and would be the new point of contact for this role. 

I'm not sure what that means for me because those projects were my primary responsibilities. I still have projects I am working on but I am mainly involved as support. I am just a bit confused if they are quietly pushing me out or if this is their way of allowing me to get involved in the company in other ways.

Would appreciate any advice on this situation.

Thanks!",mushroom_warrior134,1,1.0,1,1708571166,2024-02-22 03:06:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1awvtvv/not_sure_about_job_security/,2,2024
1awvsmc,Which job should I take?,"I'm fortunate to have received two job offers recently and I'm trying to decide which I should take.

&#x200B;

Offer 1: Customer Success Manager (healthcare technology company)

Compensation: 85K with possibility for 10% annual bonus

Fully remote role

Pros: Remote position, good pay

Cons: I don't know if I want to manage relationships/work in this area long term.

&#x200B;

Offer 2: Project Coordinator - Construction department (local hospital system)

Compensation: 73k (currently waiting to see if then can provide more)

In person 4 days/week

Pros: Its work that I am more interested in, would qualify for public service loan forgiveness, long term opportunities seem better (potential to move to project manager position; during interview they said they want this person to grow into that)

Cons: Needing to commute about 35 minutes each way (less pay than offer 1 plus 'new gas bill' for commuting), would need  to move to a more affordable apartment due to it being lower pay than I had (possibly a studio or roommate with a friend; I was already thinking about doing one of these two anyways, but this would cement it).

I want offer 2 more I think as I feel that the long term potential can be good and I'd rather do more project management type work as opposed to trying to make outside customers happy with a product. Also it being on the construction side of a hospital seems promising. Its hard to ignore the better pay and annual bonus of offer 1 though, especially with it being fully remote that allows even more savings since I don't need to commute. I'm just wanting some outside opinions/thoughts as I really can't decide what would be best.",PenutButrJeliTime,2,1.0,1,1708571070,2024-02-22 03:04:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1awvsmc/which_job_should_i_take/,2,2024
1awvpxa,Workplace harrasment ,"Hey there, incredible Redditors,

I truly appreciate you taking the time to dive into my story and offer your insights. Your support means everything to me, and I'm here to share a tale that needs your attention.

So, picture this: I'm a 28-year-old woman, grinding away in the HR department of a startup. Sounds exciting, right? Well, let me tell you, it's been a rollercoaster ride of late nights, non-stop workweeks, and sacrificing my precious weekends for the grind. And guess what? My boss's favorite pastime seems to be shouting matches – public ones, mind you.

But hey, I'm not one to throw in the towel so easily. I thought, ""Maybe if I grow the team, things will change for the better."" So, that's exactly what I did. I hustled hard to expand our crew, believing that a larger team would bring a breath of fresh air into our toxic work environment. But guess what? It was all in vain. The new recruits? They were shown the door faster than you can say ""termination,"" with flimsy excuses to boot.

And then, like a punch to the gut, it happened to me. My health took a nosedive from the stress, and what did I get in return? My paycheck held hostage without so much as a conversation, and a demand to train my replacement without even acknowledging my resignation.

Can you believe it? Because frankly, I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around it. It's a downright disgrace, and I refuse to let it slide.

But here's the kicker – legal action isn't exactly wallet-friendly, and my financial situation isn't exactly swimming in surplus funds. So, that's where you come in, my fellow Redditors. I'm reaching out, not just for sympathy, but for your wisdom and guidance.

How can I reclaim what's rightfully mine? How can I untangle myself from this mess and move on to greener pastures? Your thoughts, your suggestions, your anecdotes – they all matter. Even the smallest piece of advice could be the key that unlocks the door to justice and freedom.

So, thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for being here, for listening, and for being the beacon of hope in my stormy sea of uncertainty.

With heartfelt gratitude,
Fellow reader.",pepe-for-you,1,1.0,1,1708570860,2024-02-22 03:01:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1awvpxa/workplace_harrasment/,2,2024
1awvn12,"Content creator looking to pivot to corporate job, what do I do?","Hello!

  
I'm 25 and currently an content creator on social media with over 3 million combined followers making high production value short comedic sketches reminiscent of Key & Peele. I'm making a good living doing this and have connected with many big name brands but I feel like I'm growing too old for it and if I'm being honest, the fact that I'm an influencer has been very embarrassing for me, especially with the edgy content I make. I also have constant anxiety because of how volatile this career is and my quarter life crisis hit me like a truck.

  
I want to transition into corporate work related to social media or video creation but I don't know where to go. The only technical skills I have are filmmaking/editing (made corporate videos and music videos for mid-tier companies and artists as a one man crew before I was an influencer so videography, lighting/gaffing, audio, editing, color grading) and social media growth but I haven't worked a corporate job since my video producer internship back when I was 20 so there's a 5 year gap in my professional resume. I have a B.A in Communication from a UC college if that's relevant.

  
What roles would fit for me and should I add a link to my social media pages in my resume? Again, my content is edgy so I'm not sure if it would be wise to do this.

  
To anyone working in a social media/videography role, what salary can I expect (Los Angeles) and what other technical skills would I need to have a better chance at getting an interview? I've never been one to look at data or study my audience or trends, I just base my content on intuition and managed to have good engagement from it but I wouldn't know anything if asked any analytical questions about social media. My manager did all the negotiations for me so I don't know anything about that as well. Would social media marketing bootcamps be a wise choice or a waste of time?

1awvm3j,What should I do?,"So, basically long story short I lost my job back January 17. I have been working professionally since shortly after graduating college and this has been the first time I have been involuntarily unemployed since I was 15 years old. I have picked up some side jobs and a restaurant job barely making ends meet.

I have been offered Job A which starts March 18. Annually it would pay me about $42k a year. I accepted the job offer already because I had no other choice. 

Today I got offered a job that starts April 8 and it will pay me $54k annually year, about $12k more than Job A. No brainer, I will have to accept that job. It is also more in line with my expertise prior to being let go. 

What should I do? Should I start Job A on March 18 and begin collecting a paycheck? If I turn in a notice or let them know I will be working the other Job starting April 8, I am sure they will let me go on the spot. Should I start Job A and only let them know about Job B right before starting Job B? I’ve never had two job offers like this back to back or had one with such substantially higher pay.

1awuw6n,Having a major career crisis...,"I am in my mid 20s and don't know what to do with my life... I am intelligent and hard working. I would like a job that I am passionate about with a reasonable salary (I don't need to be super rich). I just really want to do something I enjoy and is meaningful to me. 

I was on the PhD track and though I love science and research, grad school was not a great experience to me. My advisor was very unavaible and I got tired of feeling lost all of the time. I loved my project but the field work and time consuming measurements were too much for me. Money was also a big issue. So I decided to get my masters instead and I started an office job... way out of my field. I don't feel stressed at all there but sitting 8 hours 5 days a week in front of a computer on top of a 1h+ commute is so depressing as someone who studied plants and did field work. I'm struggling to adjust to the 9-5 as well, I would prefer a more flexible schedule. I don't know what to do. This job pays pretty well, but I don't see myself doing this long term.

1awu4jn,How to walk away from job satisfaction? ,"I am 25m, I dropped out of college in 2020 due to covid and struggling with online learning. Since then, I have had a child who is now 2 years old. I ended up falling into a job working essentially as a Commercial Loan Broker, it's something I fell in love with. I feel a ton of satisfaction in helping small businesses, I am proud of what I do and it pays very well. I broke 6 figures in 2021 and most of my colleagues are making 250-350k a year. I don't really have any skills except for sales. 

In January of 2022, I was laid off from my position due to rising interest rates and lenders not extending offers. After being laid off, I ended up finding a job selling commercial security systems. I was so depressed I could barely get myself out of bed and force myself to the job.

I got a job offer from a direct lender in the same industry I was working before but they wanted to fund A paper borrower's with B paper offers and we just weren't competitive. I didnt believe in the direction of the company and again became depressed.

I was offered a position at my old job doing something different than what I was laid off from. After a few months, I got my old position back. Around this same time the mother of my child left me and ive been incredibly depressed to the point where It's been about 4 or 5 months in the position and I just got put on a Performance Improvement Plan. I have to double my volume this month in the next 7 days or get laid off. I don't have the clay in my pipeline to do it. It may be possible to beat the PIP and I am trying to earn myself as much money as I can before I am let go. I spent today laying it all out on the table with as much effort as I could and I feel completely drained I don't have the energy after work to start looking for new jobs. 

This was something I had really fallen in love with and something i tried to give my all in. I wanted this to be my career, however being laid off from the job a second time in two years I think it's time for me to find something else. I've considered trying to do this same job on my own as an independent broker but it's a shady industry and every single person I kmow whose done it on their own has been screwed over to the tune of at least 5 figures. Due to some recent car issues I have about $2000 in the bank and my rent will be taking most of it, with a 2 year old daughter and a new child support payment, there's no way I could try to do it myself and risk a 5 figure loss. Most other employers in the industry are in new york and I am not. Most of them will require I be a 1099 contractor which I am just not comfortable with. 

Due to this, I am probably going to give up on making this industry my career and I am grieving a lot. My only skills are in sales and I hate sales. I had some lifestyle creep and I can't afford not to work in sales. At the very least the goal was to save as much as I can and use the money to go back to school but at this point I have no savings, no support system and I hate myself.

I'm going to file my taxes tonight and pray that my return will be enough to get me through March.
I just got done dumping a ton of money into my car which i love a lot and I am just a few months away from having it paid off but I'm probably going to have to list it for sale. 

Just looking for some advice or words of encouragement. I know I'm young but it feels like my life is over. I've spent the last few years trying to be conservative and take the safe route and still have nothing to show for it. I wish I could go back and take the risks I didn't and with my daughter I don't feel like i can take the risks now.",improving-myself243,1,1.0,3,1708566350,2024-02-22 01:45:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1awu4jn/how_to_walk_away_from_job_satisfaction/,2,2024
1awu0dq,Only part time experience but need to get a decent paying full-time job. What job titles and certifications should I be looking for?,"Hello everyone!
I apologize in advance for the long post, but there is a lot of context to understand with the question I have. 
I'll put this at the beginning but I ask that if you have the time, to please read the whole post for the full context. 

TL;DR:
I'm seeking advice on finding a job or career to support myself after my grandmother, who is on hospice and who I currently care for, leaves this world. I had to quit my part-time job to care for my grandmother full-time so I don't have the resources like income and paystubs to get an apartment when I eventually have to leave hers. I'm looking for certification or short courses (a few weeks max) to qualify for a decent job and recommendations for immediate employment. I have retail, food service, and some medical knowledge but would probably do really well in medical jobs. I want to be self-sufficient as soon as possible.

I'm looking for some guidance if you all can provide it. I am 26 and female and I am based in Orlando Florida. I'm looking for some assistance with finding a job or career that would allow me to get back on my feet. 
Here is a little back story before I get into what I'm looking for as it may help with the suggestions. First off I just want to say that I have a lot of brain power and drive and I'm a super super quick learner. I probably could have been an astrophysicist or something if I was interested in pursuing it earlier in life. 

I went to college and did not finish because life hit me hard and I ended up losing my mother and then my grandmother got sick and I became her full-time caregiver. I was never able to decide on a set path in college but the last thing I had started focusing on before quitting was communication sciences and disorders. I cared for my mother in her last two years of life which ended in 2020 and from then on I have been taking care of my grandmother even now. Taking care of her has been a full-time job and now that she is on hospice it is even more work and I have had to fully quit working. Now, I was only working two or three days a week at a small tea shop because I still needed to spend most of my time at home with her but since she got sicker I haven't been able to be away from her so I had to leave my job. I live with her and have lived with her for the last year and a half roughly. 

I don't want to be morbid but I also want to be very prepared for when her time comes and something in my gut is telling me that it won't be very long before it does. Since I am on her lease as a live-in-aid, if for any reason she is no longer living in the apartment I have to vacate immediately. Due to a breakup in 2021, I don't have an apartment to go back to, and I don't have any distant family to move in with. I don't want to fully move in with anyone anyway, I want to support myself again. I know I'm going to have to be on a friend's couch for a while until I am able to get a place of my own which I hope will not be long with the plan that I have curated. 

Since I'm unable to leave the house and I spend all of my time sitting in my grandmother's room with her, I want to start working on some sort of certification or course that would Make it possible for me to get a real, full-time job that isn't retail or food service or whatever when the time comes. I want to have credentials already even if they're small because once her time comes, I'm going to have to GRIND. I will have to make an income that would allow me to get a place here in Orlando which is pretty expensive. And I will have to make decent pay stubs because as we all know, apartments require a few consecutive pay stubs that show your income is sufficient. 

So basically:
Step one: get the credentials before she's gone
Step two: secure a job after she's gone but before the apartment complex makes me move out
Step three: stay with a friend for a little while and WORK MY BUTT OFF
Step 4: get a place of my own

I know this plan sounds kind of wild but with my current situation, it's the only way I can go about things. I can't start working until after she's gone, whenever that may be which I'm hoping is later rather than sooner. I just want to be ready so that I don't end up like the rest of my family, living on other people's couches and not at all trying to build a life for themselves. 

So basically, there are two things that I'm looking for and I will take guidance on either one of those things. I am looking for certificates I can earn or courses I could take that won't take long to get, that I could use to land a decent job that would allow me to get a place of my own. My grandma may have only weeks, or she may have months, but in case she only has weeks, I would prefer courses that wouldn't take me longer than a few weeks to complete. 

The second thing is the actual job. Even if it's a job that doesn't require certificates or anything like that, I will take any recommendations on job titles that pay decently well in Florida and would hire someone with only a general associates degree and no bachelors who has only worked retail and food service. 

Here are some of my skills: 
I am amazing at what I do in retail and was once a supervisor, so I have all of those skills and it was the exact same for food service. I'm a huge people person and I tend to be great at what I do and I don't mean to sound conceited. I just work really hard and always put my job first. I also have a little bit of background in learning medical stuff. Before I went to college I went to a medical technical school for a few months but ended up leaving because the school was a scam. During my time there I learned medical terminology, two levels of college anatomy and physiology along with the anatomy and physiology I learned in high school, I took some athletic training classes in high school as well because I really took an interest in medical stuff and that was the only thing my school had. Since being out of high school which is almost 10 years, I've learned a lot of things on my own. And while caring for both my mother and grandmother, I learned a lot more. The icing on the cake was October 2023 until January 2024 when my grandmother spent 2 months in the ICU and one month in PCU and I lived at the hospital with her because she didn't want to be alone. I watched, I learned, I even did some hands-on things because I would ask the nurses and patient care techs if they would allow me to step in and do the things that I was allowed to do. Y'know, things that didn't require needle sticking or medication handling. They taught me a lot and I got to experience a lot of the things that I learned about in books. I can have conversations with medical professionals using their jargon and If the topic isn't something that you have to go to med school for, I would usually understand it. Conversations about conditions, about symptoms, about testing, about treatment, etc. Back in the ICU some of the nurses would explain to me certain things that were happening and the steps they would have to take for those things and would give me examples based on patients without violating HIPAA laws. Here's the thing though. I don't want to be a nurse. I don't want to be a patient care tech. I don't want to be a CNA. I have had my fair share of caregiving and it's also the reason why I don't want kids right now. However I do feel like I would excel in a job in a medical field. I just don't want to do anything like nursing. And I can't do anything, at least right now, that would require extensive schooling. 

The job titles don't have to be medical. It could be anything that isn't labor intensive (I also have some health issues). I just wanna get to working as SOON as I'm able so that I could get on my feet in the quickest time possible.  I would appreciate any guidance! Thank you!

1awtsdb,What career is about changing attitudes in a creative way?,"Hi,

I’m almost done my bachelors in the arts. But I have recently realized that I should’ve pursued psychology.

I’m passionate about improving life by altering one’s attitude or mindset. One of the things I’d like to put out now is overcoming heartbreak addiction through the insights I discovered. Another thing I learned to solve is finding self worth.

I want to take people through a journey so they can see my insight. I want to do it in a compelling and creative way. (Not necessarily artistic because I have no passion in the actual process of any art medium)

I was considering therapy and counselling. But based on what I read online: they do not give advice. They guide you so you find your own life changing insights.

I’m not passionate about studying strategies that help others uncover their own insights. I want to share what I’ve got. So is going back to school for 6-7 more years even worth it? Im already like 22.

Therefore, what potential careers does this align with?

1awrpuh,Is there anyone else out there with a similar experience to me? (Being fired.),"I have been ""fired"" from every job I've held, one way or the other. Except the military. But they would have fired me if they could, and that's totally my fault. I was just not grown up yet and not cut out for the military. I barely made it, for mental health reasons.   


For context, now I am a ""professional"" in terms of skilled labor. I work on industrial computers/electronics/radars/robots. Every time I leave a job, my new job pays about $2/$4 more per hour. Starting at $30.  


1. The first time I got fired it was totally my fault. I violated (a bad) company policy. It was for a very good safety reason, but I won't make excuses. I did break an important rule.   
1 Year working there.
2. Second time I got fired, I had only been there a couple of weeks. I did what I was told the entire time, and the beginning of the third week of my training they just said ""in the best interest of the company we need to let you go"" Even though I had the middle score of the class. No clue why.   
2 Weeks working there.
3. The warehouse manager fired my boss and then was writing me up for anything. I got written up for taking lunch at the ""wrong time,"" even though there was no designated lunch time. Dude wrote me up for ""not doing"" my preventative maintenance, but I had clear evidence backed up personally by the CMMS Manager that my work was assigned to the wrong guy by accident in the system and I didn't see it when I checked in the software. They put me on 2 week suspension in preparation to have me let go, and I found a new job that paid $2/hr more in literally 4 days, and then I quit officially when HR called me to begin the investigation.   
2 years working there.
4. This new job did offer to pay me more, but it turns out, the entire thing was completely 100% dominated by a local family and the nepotism was outrageous. The organization was a good-old-boys club, and when my co-workers found out that I was being paid like $8 per hour more than they were and responsible for way ""easier"" work, they hated my guts. People would spy on me and tattle to the manager when they caught me doing anything they deemed unproductive. The second part of this is that during the interview, the manager told me I'd be an automation technician that is responsible for the robotics and PLC cabinets in their factory. But they refused to provide me the software I needed (Logix Studio 5000) and the proper credentials / necessary information to actually do my job. The entire thing was a circus, between the staff hating me and not understanding my job, and my own management totally mismanaging me, I knew I was in for some pain. They ended up firing me for ""spending too much time in the robotics room"" while I was literally fucking organizing their spare parts.   
2 Months working here.  


That leads me to today. I have a new job now that is paying 6 figures and I have both responsibilities and freedoms I've never had before, as well as incredible pay for my low-cost city in the midwest. I am doing my best here and kicking ass (I think) but there are whispers that some of the people I don't work with are complaining to the manager here that I'm ""spending all my time on the computer"" and ""not doing any work."" Which... is just retarded because 1.) I don't work for this company, I am a contractor and 2.) I am a manager myself, which means a lot of my work is spent on the computer, having Teams meetings, Teams conversations, looking at data and spreadsheets and instruction manuals to help out the maintenance crew. It's not my fault the customer won't give me an office, so I have to sit out here on display in front of everyone so they can look at me as I am ""not working"" on my computer all day.

1awpw89,Overwhelmed with Options and Uncertainty ,"Hey all,

I’m hoping to get some insight on what might be a good course of action to take with my current situation.

To preface these choices, I had an unexpected medical expense of $100,000 that I was able to manage - but has me in a bit of a financial pinch.

My current job (which I very much dislike) has an opportunity to take on a significant amount of work over the next two years that would correct the current financial situation and advance my career to a higher salary bracket. However, it has follow on impacts to other career options that I’m very much interested in.

The next job is a dream job. Very rarely does an opportunity like this come up in one’s life. I’d be working on very exciting projects that truly inspire me and are related to both my previous background in engineering, and my future studies in neuroscience. I am still in the interview phase of this job, but they have mentioned they are hiring a lot of engineers and so far they seem satisfied with my performance. If I do get offered this job, it would require me to move and I would take a pay reduction. This reduction would put me in a bad spot until I can take out some investments (6 months to 1 year to obtain money). I would likely need assistance from friends to make the transition to this position, but I would be able to pay off all debt and have money for the next option within one year.

The third thing I have happening is that I have grad school in neuroscience upcoming - and like the second option, I am very excited about it and I think the topic of study will be very beneficial to society. I’ve already spoke with my thesis advisor and the employers of the second job, and these two options are not only compatible - but align very well together and both parties are open to me doing both should I be hired.

My major issue with the Option 1 is that it would delay Option 3 by up to two years. Additionally, if I do not take Option 1 now it may not come again and I might be permanently career limited (assuming I don’t get the job offer with Option 2).

My major issue with Option 2 is that it will rely on financial support from friends to make the switch. I’ve already spoken to friends to discuss what return they’d want to earn on lending me money and everyone seems to be on board assuming I get the job.

So I guess what I’m asking is whether or not I should say Yes to Option 1, which can negatively impact Option 3. Or should I say no to Option 1, and wait until I know I have Option 2 available? That way Option 1 won’t cause a delay to Option 3 - but is it worth jeopardizing the available options for my current career (which I dislike)?

I haven’t had so many choices at once in my career previously so I feel like I’m struggling to come to a decision. I know my heart wants to turn down Option 1 because I really really really dislike my current job, but I don’t want to deal with the consequences of less earning power should Option 2 fall through.

Of note, I’m unable to pull my investments without leaving Option 1.",AstralVeritas,1,1.0,0,1708555520,2024-02-21 22:45:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1awpw89/overwhelmed_with_options_and_uncertainty/,2,2024

Again my apologies, im living a situation who is not easy and i just want improve my life.

1awoq6v,Are the standards too high or do I just suck at my job?,"It’s been six months I’ve been working in research administration at a prestigious private university (I’m basically a grant writer). I make 75k/yr in a big city. My last job paid more, but I had to leave due to health reasons. This job is technically a lateral move that pays $20k less. I took it because I needed work and because I might want to get a masters with their tuition reimbursement benefits. 

I’ve been at this job six months and the pressure feels way higher than my last job. I keep trying to be patient with myself, and my manager also tries to reassure me I’ll get to a place where I can manage my workload, but it’s been really stressful. So many faculty researchers rely on me to get their research funded and to make sure they are complaint on their existing research. I’ve never had so many concurrent deadlines. The consequence of missing a deadline is really bad (research funding applications are dead in the water), and the consequence of fucking up the financial administrative side of existing research is also really bad (projects getting unfunded or losing the university large sums of money). 

So many people rely on me and the job requires an enormous amount of learning. My position brings in so much revenue to the university, so it’s confusing why the office is minimally staffed and why I get paid less than my last job. I also feel guilty because a lot of Americans get paid substantially less for also stresssful work. 

I’m on multiple anti-anxiety meds. I drink every night. I’m in therapy. I struggle with perfectionism in general and know I have “imposter syndrome,” but this job seems to really aggravate my anxiety. But I’m in medical debt and I need to work. What should I do?

So long story short (but you can read more about it here), I left my job working with children because an anonymous employee was calling the state abuse hotline making accusations against her coworkers. When she came for me, I walked. The stress from the constant investigations plus working in a pandemic, I couldn't take it anymore. I was constantly physically ill because my stress level was so high. It was no long sustainable.  
I tried my hand at freelancing, but I'd like a PT W2 gig to supplement my income. This is where I ran into issues. I filled out a job application that asked me why I left my last position. It also asked me for three references, including one from my previous employer.  
I feel there are two courses of action:  
They say not to talk badly about your previous employer, so should I paint a picture of roses? The issue I see with that is that I can't use a single person there as a reference, and since I worked there over a decade, I don't have my previous references anymore. How do I explain that I worked somewhere for 10+ years without either telling the truth or looking like I don't work well with others? And won't fessing up after I painted roses look majorly dishonest?  
Or, I tell the truth, but then I'm basically talking shit about my previous employer. I also think it kind of makes me look guilty that they let me walk and kept the other girl, or at least not valuable enough to keep. I also am literally on file having been investigated by the state for child abuse, and while I was entirely cleared of the allegation, I don't know that's what you want to tell a recruiter that you are trying to win over.  
Please help me out. I feel like the advice that I'm getting from the people in my life is garbage (ranging from lie by any means necessary to my mother offering to use her maiden name as a pretend reference). I need a better perspective than they are providing.

1awm0io,How do I deal with telling my GFs dad that he needs to pay me more? ,"So I have been working for my gfs dad for around 6 or 7 years. I've done loads of things for his properties.

I've become pretty handy to where I can start my own business if I want but his work is convenient.so I'm like his personal handyman, carpenter, landscaper, builder, renovator.

He recently started paying me 30 an hour. Which a year ago I asked him to pay me that and he said ""go f yourself""... Anyways, today he said ""I'm going to give you a ten percent raise"" which is weird because he made me an independent contractor years back. I should be telling him how much I'm working for.

And he's rushing me to get it all done so I'm putting in so many hours this month. He got upset that I would even ask and said "" you know how that is perceived by me...?"" So I have little hope.

1awlx2a,Temporary Army Officer vs IT Career,"TL;DR: Become a temporary officer with a starting salary of 8K/month for 8 years or continue to invest in my IT studies?

Hello everyone, everything good? I would like to ask for your help in resolving a dilemma I am currently experiencing.

This is the situation:

Years ago, I took part in the army officer training course in my state. At the end of the program, I was unable to join the troops and continued my life normally. I finished law school, practiced law for a while but didn't identify with the area and decided to pursue a second degree in IT, the area in which I'm currently working.

I don't want to sound arrogant or anything like that, but I have a lot of confidence in my ability to learn. What I'm going to say next is so that you understand the context and my way of thinking about this situation.

My Law degree was issued by a top tier university and I’m also currently studying IT on a top tier university, which the job market in my country loves. 

Recently, the military command in my region opened a selection for temporary officers, specifically for the area in which I graduated in the officers program years ago. The process is not very demanding and I believe that competition not be high, plus I have a high score in the selection criteria, therefore, I believe I have a good chance of being approved.

Despite being simple, the selection process is quite extensive and requires a large amount of medical examinations and time commitment.

Once approved, the aspirant has a starting salary in the range of 8K, increasing depending on the rank promotion.

The point is that when I was in the military, I hated it. I hated the issue of hierarchy and excessive control over your life, even the haircut you might have. I currently work with technology and am dissatisfied with my company, but I work 100% remotely and with a calm workload. I receive in the range of 3K/month.

Recently I've been studying a lot and applying to other companies for internship positions as I don't have a degree in IT yet. Because of what I said before, I really believe in my ability to get a better job. Immediately,  not necessarily one that pays me better than I receive today, but with greater opportunities for growth.

I also think that if I joined the army, my focus on studying IT would be lost (even by stopping working with it) and I would be forced to do bureaucratic work that I have no interest in (not to mention the military discipline, psychological demands , etc).

Basically, I don't know if I would have the ability to move up in the IT career I have today. I would definitely not maintain the pace of studies I have been maintaining. On the other hand, it would be an absurd increase in my income, but for a limited period of a maximum of 8 years.

It's worth saying that my biggest dream and reason for studying IT is to immigrate.

About my background: my family is not rich, but we have a peaceful living situation. I currently live with my parents, but I want to live alone to fully experience adulthood. I don't need to work to help with house expenses, my salary is 100% for me. I turn 25 this year.

1awkplc,Do I give up everything I’ve worked for because of AI?,"I feel stuck in life at a crossroads and would really appreciate some advice. I am 22M and recently graduated film school this past year. I lived in LA and worked on starting a freelance visual effects agency in music videos as I have been in VFX for 10yrs. The agency did ok,  but wasn’t really enough to live off of especially in California and had crazy hours. 

My roommate went haywire, and I was forced to move back to the Midwest with my parents. I continued my agency, but got wisdom from people high up in the music video industry that it simply was not a profitable industry  anymore. They suggested that I rebrand to commercial production, but it is much harder to gain clients for work like in that field. Essentially at this point I’m stuck out here with my parents until I re-pivot to the point where I’m getting full-time income from whatever I start next.

At this point, I’m just not even sure if I should continue freelancing. I want to get a business under me that I can scale as I want to build true wealth, but given this economy and recent advancements in AI I’m just not even sure if it’s worthwhile endeavor. I’m almost complete with my pilots license and I’m not sure if I should just focus on getting a full-time job in my industry, do something unrelated, while I build my agency, or just full, send, creating my own commercial video agency because I’m only young once

1awk9b6,"Should I change career, finish my masters or work?","I’m 21 years old (f), and this year I’m going to graduate with honors in English/Literature. For most of my high school life I’ve done the sciences and did pretty well (bio, chem, physics), but I just couldn’t psyche myself up to do a science degree, so I chose this route.

When I was choosing the field I wanted to apply for, I was caught in the uncertainty of the pandemic as well as my mental situation. I salvaged a few scholarships and this degree was the one that was covered on both ends. I consulted my parents who were adamant that I needed to go to university and thus went my three years. When I suggested a gap year to work and figure myself out, they didn’t want me to.  My point was no reason to go into debt and I was uncertain about what I truly wanted to do.

Contrastingly, I developed other interests during college. Some of which were law, business (marketing), economics and math. I expressed the desire to pursue it and they gave me reassurance for the degree. I applied and got in to the law program, got another scholarship (covered 1/3) but my parents convinced me to not do it or business because I might be mediocre at it.

They gassed me up to become a professor instead, a long and strenuous path, or whatever. Now, time to leave university and most of my internships have been business related. I expressed to them late last year again, that I want to switch to law again or go into economics. But it will be 4-5 years. At first they seemed extra supportive. Now, they are encouraging me to get a job (which I have no problem with), in order to fund my degree (entirely). My father keeps telling me it’s too late to switch careers now ( he has no degree). 

Worse, my mother is adamant about me not doing a business degree, economics included because it would be boring. 

Now I feel real stupid. I’ve always had to mind my education since I was six, and they have a neat way of instilling doubt in me cause I’m (not getting any younger). Makes it even worse that my father keeps telling me that he just wants to see me make money and we should have X, Y and Z by now. Mind you, he’s fully paid for all eight years of my brothers’ what should be three year computer science degree (he kept failing 29 now). I don’t want to feel like a burden anymore.

1awjhkw,Do you have any advice for my new job burnout? ,"New Job Burnout 

Hello! Looking for some advice here. Last spring, I left my company of 7.5 years for a new job opportunity that was almost a $50,000 raise, a chance to manage a large team and is remote but the office is 10 minutes down the road from my house if needed to go in. During my interviews with the new company (three total) they talked about it being a creative and strategic role and the types of projects I would support. Eight months into the role, I feel catfished and burnt out. My manager is nice and super smart, but it’s not the work I thought I would be doing or am interested in. One of my direct reports applied for my job, did not get it, and resigned so I’m in a weird spot because I’m so burnt out with the volume and type of work I’m doing, but have an open role on my team that I have posted and will actively have to  interview candidates for, knowing I’m considering leaving. It does not make me feel good.

My previous company is in an industry I loved and the fun work was really fun. It was very stressful at times, so I’m not looking back with rose colored glasses only, but I miss what I was doing and my coworkers. We had a terrible executive Vice President and marketing leaders come in that really shook up everyone’s confidence, but those people are now gone. 

My previous manager and I spoke yesterday about me returning in a role on her team, and I would love to return but I can’t return at the same salary I was at and I’m worried that I haven’t been gone long enough and my new skills won’t be recognized because we will fall into our old pattern.

I don’t really know what to do. I’m miserable but also feel unprofessional leaving in the middle of an interview process and after only eight months.

Not a wet shart like full on diarrhea. I think okay this sucks but whatever I’ll just take a shower and change. So I shower and get dressed ready for the day and bam no warning completely shit myself in my nice work clothes. I am now sitting here on the toilet knowing I need to call in, but it’s my first day and I don’t really know what to say to my manager. I can’t shit myself day one on the job but I also feel horrible calling out my first day.

1awgzcf,Which program would be best for a career transitioner?,"I apologize that this question is really specific to my situation, but I'm hoping someone may have insight or can point me in the direction of reliable sources.  
  
I have a PhD in History and have been teaching for 13 years, all high school. I want out of education completely, so no curriculum design or ID work. Though I'm not fluent, I have a strong language background because of what I needed for my degree which I think would at least help in a corporate role. I'm basically trying to go back and think what alternate career path I could have taken fresh out of grad school and then adding the teaching experience as generic work experience on a resume. I'm looking at either corporate or potentially government work, though I'm leaning corporate at this point (mainly because I'm tired of being really poor) and focusing on international business/compliance/negotiations. I clearly can't step into any of those roles with the education and experience I have right now. So, here are the options I think I have for going back to school, which I think I need to get to where I want to be:  
  
1. Master of Studies in Law. From what I've seen, a lot of people think this is a fairly useless degree on its face. However, it's online, which means I can keep my current job while I do it and the programs I'm looking for come with specific certifications in areas like ""international business law,"" ""compliance,"" ""health care law,"" etc. I'm thinking those certifications and/or the connections at those places might be enough to get an entry-level position and then work my way up and these degrees only take 12-24 months. But, this might also be a cash grab and I'm also open to that criticism.  
  
2. Law school. I don't have any interest in passing the bar or being a trial attorney, but a JD would give you a leg up in being hired as an in-house attorney for overseeing contracts and negotiations. Cons are that I would have to do it part-time and all JD programs must be done in person, which means it would take a while (at least 4 years) and I don't think I would be able to get a job doing anything but teaching while I completed it. It also obviously costs a lot. On the other hand, JDs are obviously a more prestigious and recognized degree.  
  
3. MBA. The thought of business school genuinely makes me itchy because it sounds so painfully boring, though I do recognize it's a viable path to where I would want to go. The law programs sound infinitely more interesting, but I do recognize MBA programs are immediately useful and there are a lot that are online, many of which specialize in international business, which means I could complete them in two years or less.  
  
If anyone has any insight, I would be eternally grateful. I do not want to pick the wrong option again, nor do I want to be stuck with something that won't help me find a way out of teaching.",CapitalGrape4206,2,1.0,6,1708534471,2024-02-21 16:54:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1awgzcf/which_program_would_be_best_for_a_career/,2,2024

1awg858,30m dunno how to proceed with my fin. career,"Fellow reditors, asking for your advice in order to figure out how to proceed with my career.  
So I'm 30, was working since I was 18 in banking, my path looked like this:  
\- 18-22 Finance/Data handling in bank, got familiar with SQL, Delphi, tools from MS office package  
\- 22-24 - Worked in another bank in reporting, using sql to create managerial reports using pretty big datasets. Also worked a little bit with python, gain experience in power query.  
\- 24-27 - Transferred to retail risk management, launched a couple of credit products, made numerous changes in credit police, basically starting from hypothesis evaluation to testing changes, to calculation of financial impact on a product. So I was in very tight integration with SaS developers, CRM and Product owners, Collection, DS team etc.   
\- 27-29 - Did the same stuff but got promoted to head of division role, managing 3-5 people  
\- 29-30 - Relocated to another country, in EU, in big international bank' currently I received a promotion for an AVP year after I came. Here I do reporting as well, but for financial regulators.   
Also around 5 months of CRM experience; was a head of division with 2 people under my control, but came back to retail risks. Oh, and my bachelors is in production management.  
So now I feel like I'm just doing boring stuff slowly drifting to another promotion, which may come in 2 year. But there's no drive in this job and no big opportunities coming in my way. Also they have no retail related positions in this country, and I'm not into corporate business or derivatives.  
So my question is - what career path should I take and  what should I add to my list of skills/projects?  
I'm either thinking about adding more specific skills (like modeling which is always good for analyst/risk manager) or switching to something more fast paced, like a startup, as product owner/BA.

I actually want to end up in a career with good work-life balance and good salary after graduating ( min 70k ). 

I would love to pursue a degree with not advanced math because I haven't studied math for over 6-7 yrs. I am not sure how good I will be at it now, I was okay at math in school getting B/B+. 
My favorite subject was English and History. I liked reading and researching history, technology, Neuroscience and still do. 

I listen to podcasts related to it. I am fascinated by design of things like why something is made the way it is? How does it help everyone? How it could help city? How does it help people?
Why our brain is so complex? These thoughts and dreams? Why it resembles to universe so much? What if dig deep into our emotions and thoughts. Why our brain reacts to certain sounds differently than others. if we put two people through exactly same childhood - everything from parenting to toys to education to how and where they live they still grow up to be different why? how does it brain develop from daily experiences?

1awfkra,Should I quit the position or the conpany?,"I (30F) currently work as the Lead for my department. Smallish company with big dreams, making big moves.  I've never had a Lead position before and was offered this position after only 2 months of working there. Initially took the job wanting the experience and knowing how difficult it would be to find and train a new lead since our team is small and company money was a bit of concern at the time. New position granted me $1 more per hour ($20/hr), if that makes any difference here. 

Fast forward into the position and I feel like I'm going crazy. I slip up and make mistakes and I hate it.There was a lot on my plate with very little training: keeping up production, inventory and intake. After 1-2 months I talked to upper management and suggested we make inventory and intake a separate position as it was just too much for one person to do. Especially as we started making more products with various different packaging and huge orders were placed by upper management without proper plans for storage. 

Now they are making it a separate position and the company is growing so well that we are able to hire more ans more people for each department. I'm one of 2 people who ever pull OT when it is needed and actually shows up to do it. The times that we can't get huge customer orders out without the extra hours is usually around the holidays. Upper management will praise and thank us for the hard work, sometimes with pizza. 

I have noticed that some of my ideas my direct manager will take and use and are likely taking the credit since they have a review coming up. I had an another idea that was shot down and I was looked at like I was a moron, then the following week the manager that they made a new thing..it was my idea that I shared with her! 

They relentlessly praised an idea a coworker came up with and put it into use even tho it was severely unnecessary and added nothing but extra work for us to do. It's no longer being used. 

Since on boarding they tell me I have made things faster etc and wouldn't be able to do so much without me but I also feel it's bogus. Maybe I'm bogus idk. 
Honestly, I don't feel qualified for it. I don't have the skill levels that I think would be needed. I also know I deal with imposter syndrome from my religious upbringing ans severe anxiety among other issues. My fight or flight response always kicks in when work is involved no matter the job. What is wrong with me and this situation? 

Should I ask to go back to an associate position, stick the lead position out, or get a new job?

1awfbd8,Moving & transferring jobs. How do I figure out my availability?,"Me & my family are moving to a new city next week. Hubby has a great job secured and I am transferring to a different store for my job. We have found daycare for our child and their hours are 7am - 6pm, mon - fri.

My husband's work hours will be 6:30am - 4pm, mon - fri but on call every day. If he gets called out, he has to go & can't take our child with him. He also can't be late in the mornings. His jobsite is about a 10 minute drive from our home (depending on traffic conditions).

My job will be a 10 minute drive from our home as well, (again, traffic conditions in mind) however it is 15 minutes away from my husband's job site. 

The daycare center is also 10 minutes from our home, 15 minutes from hubby's worksite and 6 minutes from where my jobsite will be. 

I have a family member that lives 3 minutes away, literally just down the road. Since hubby has to work at 6:30am & daycare doesn't open til 7am, I don't see him being able to take us. So I might have to rely on my family member. She's an assistant manager & isn't on a consistent schedule & does rotating shifts, so I don't know what hours she works. I was thinking of messaging her & asking her what hours she works & if she would be able to take me & my child to daycare & work, & pay her gas money. However, I don't want to have her risk her job to pick us up every day. (We have one car & my husband needs the vehicle for work-related traveling.)

If we are able to get transportation figured out (without interfering too much with my family member's job), what hours would be ideal for my availability? I'll be working at a grocery store & I know they need people with open availability, but my hours are really dependant on my husband's. With my hubby being on call after work & on weekends (plus daycare closed) I don't want it to affect my ability to get hired too much.

1aweoqx,I got a promotion but it doesn’t seem like it? ,"Background: I’m in my 20s I live in the US and I graduated last May with a BS in IT. I got my first job doing compliance for a small software company right after graduation. 

In January I was offered a manager position that would put me in charge of a tool we sell. I accepted and was told by my uppers some formalities will be figured out in a week or so. Now they have told me they would like me to be in this role in a “hybrid style” so half the day I do compliance and the other half of the day I do my new manager role. I thought this was odd but I didn’t say anything. Now I’ve been doing this hybrid style work for a month and I still have not received any paper work about my new manger role or discussed any salary changes.

Side note: I would say our small company has fair pay, everyone is payed the lower range of what their job salary is. My current salary is low end for a compliance position and from my research the low end for the manager role I was offered is 15 grand more than my salary is now. 

Last week I started to ask my uppers about my hybrid role, why I haven’t had paperwork, when is this going to be official, etc. 

They got back to me yesterday. They told me they would like for me to continue my hybrid role and that there will be no formal paperwork or change in pay until this Summer. And that my pay increase will be 3 grand to my annual salary. 

So I guess I want to know if this is normal? Because to me it felt like they might as well have said “hey you’re going to do 2 jobs for the  low range pay of one job and in 4 months we’ll give you an extra $150 to your pay checks” 

Also, I wasn’t expecting to get paid the 15 grand more but I was definitely disappointed when they said 3 and acted like it should be life changing.

1awegtb,Aren't You guys afraid of AI taking away jobs ? There can be mass joblessness and maybe even civil war in India.,"Okay so reading at the title you may think a fool has written this but please i request you to read the entire post and think critically.  
  
Think again AI can work 24\*7\*365 days without taking a break . Without making excuse of sick leave , no insurance needed and will work at less cost than an average white collar employees salary forget about top tier ones.  
  
The development of AI is scary to say the least look at what open AI's SORA is capable of doing  
  
https://openai.com/sora  
  
And its just the beginning just imagine at the exponential rate of how its advancing what will it become after maybe 5 years.  
  
AI will take writers job, coding related jobs, graphic,transcription and image related jobs and now its after video production jobs as well. you may think well we are top tier grads and it will not effect us but the thing is AI will be expanded into MBA related fields and its use cases will expand in future so how do you think you will be safe in future against layoffs.  
  
Personally i think AI will cause end of humanity it will cause civil wars especially in highly populated countries like India where there is already joblessness. Like just give me list of some jobs which AI has been able to create in mass numbers. It creates one job and takes jobs of literally hundreds of people.  
  
Governments like always are in sleeping mode and will not take action to regulate AI until its too late to fix , maybe the only solution will be to ban AI by countries or levy heavy AI tax on companies using AI to layoff employees and provide UBI to its citizens.  
  
Companies are already laying off people in record number in the garb of recession and it will only worsen with time.  
  
Please think before taking huge loans to pursue MBA cause there will be no guarantee you will get a good paying job in upcoming years. The job landscape will change hugely in years to come. These huge disruptions wont take decades to occur it will likely happen in next 5 years or so.  
  
Also don't take huge loan for housing on inflated property markets like Mumbai and Bangalore . property prices will also crash if people don't have good paying jobs.Previously it was simple enough life study well get a job in IT or do MBA or start a business to get rich but these technological disruptions will change all that now only big corporations will get more rich and income inequality which is high already in India will skyrocket.

1awe9bf,"26M in a role I generally enjoy, should I take a lateral to get more experience even with no pay increase? ","
I’m in a job I generally enjoy. (Sales technology related field in a Fortune 500). 

I’ve been in role for just under 2 years. Recently we had a small reorganization that resulted in a new role being created on the team, which is essentially exactly what I do now, but for a different, more important customer. 

My boss’ boss reached out to me asking if I wanted it, and basically all but said it’s mine if I apply for it. (I would likely be the only candidate with experience in this particular technology space anyways). 

My manager gave me his blessing to apply for it as well. 

The way I see it, the pros would be: better exposure in the company due to working with a more important customer, and getting a much broader experience in my field. Also, this customer is going to lean in heavily on this technology in the coming year, giving me the chance to “save the day” with my experience so to speak. 

The cons would be: likely no pay increase since it’s a lateral, and I don’t really know who my new manager would be. I’ve met him and he seems like a good guy, however I have never actually worked with him before. He has also never managed people before, which can be a good thing in this technology space since we largely just work independently in this space. ( I like my current manager, although he is very long winded and meetings with him often run well past COB. He also tries to “reinvent the wheel” so to speak, however it’s because he likes having a good finished product, it’s just not always worth the hair splitting.) 

So basically it boils down to: stay in the job I like with a manager I’m okay with, or take a new job to get more experience for no pay increase, not having any idea how working for my new manager would be, or how different the work load would end up being.

I accepted the offer to discover later that everyone with an entry level position as tech even without knowledge gets over 48,000 dollars and a good raise after the first year. I did not say anything and was waiting for the first year to end and see if they will make an adjustment to my salary or give me a raise that I deserve. During that year, I worked really hard and contributed to many projects thinking this would help. When I got my first ""raise"" my income became 46k instead of  44k a year, and right after this happened, the manager left and I did not have any direct manager to talk to or ask about the raise. Few months later, a new manager was assigned to us, and finally I was able to speak to him and ask for an adjustment of my salary to be the same as the technician in my level not even a raise. Since then, he was ignoring me and try to not answer my questions about it. Currently, many technician left the company and my work load has doubled with more responsibilities. My coworker who started working just  3 year before me are getting paid 60k+ dollars a year, while I am doing the same amount and sometimes more work than they do. I was thinking recently that nothing would change whatever I do, and I was planning to give my two weeks and go to another job even if it pays me less. The amount of work and responsibilities I have now does not worth what I get paid because compared to salaries of others inside the company, my salary is too low.

Do you have any advice on whether should I quit due to my current situation?",JavaDev24,2,1.0,6,1708526576,2024-02-21 14:42:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1awdoty/should_i_quit_my_job/,2,2024
1awd728,Solicitor apprenticeship or law degree? (with RG uni/reputable law firm),"Hi all, 

I've never used Reddit before but I need some advice. 
I have just recently been offered a level 7 degree apprenticeship with Burges Salmon. I also hold law degree offers from the Universities of Nottingham and Exeter, still waiting on a few more including UCL which is my ideal choice. 
However, I'm seriously in two minds and leaning towards the solicitor apprenticeship route instead. I was selected as one of four, out of over 300 applicants. It just seems like a lot to turn down, but I am facing a dilemma because i don't want to throw away potentially amazing uni degrees- the provider with Burges Salmon's apprenticeship is BPP University in comparison. 
I'm also considering the prospects of my social life - if I take the apprenticeship I'll be living at home. I don't mind this one bit but I guess I'd have to make more of an effort to be social, like visiting friends at other unis. 
I guess my main question is whether it'd be worth it to be with a firm such Burges Salmon over a top uni degree. Any ideas? Is the firm's name enough to make me stand out as an applicant in the future for a position in a City firm, for example? 

Thank you! ",hidius23,1,1.0,0,1708525289,2024-02-21 14:21:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1awd728/solicitor_apprenticeship_or_law_degree_with_rg/,2,2024

1awcfln,What career is best for me?,"I’m 23[M] and have had somewhat of an unusual adulthood. **(TL:DR at bottom)**

During my first semester at (a top) university, a life tragedy occurred and I was practically forced to work full time and support my siblings. 

Throughout this time I have held various roles from customer service representative to car salesman to business operations manager to a field supervisor type role, which I still currently still hold. 

I am also back in school at the University of Maine at Presque Isle, degree in bachelor of science in business administration - concentration in accounting less than a year from graduation.

Throughout the last 7 years I have been *obsessed* with financial markets, constantly researching, creating content (about market news and my advice), gaining a solid following on several platforms. 

Which leads me to today and posting this, I’m unsure of where I want to head although I want to be in finance. I’m not much of a *number cruncher* though I am extremely analytical, I believe I have great sales and communication/interpersonal skills. My current *goal* is to get into financial planning and become a fiduciary, it aligns with my passion(s) and skills of helping people, sales, effective communication, etc. The issue I kind of have with financial planning is it’s somewhat of a “long road” until you get in that position and to when you’re making money. I don’t mind scaling up, but I don’t want to wait a great deal until I make 6 figures.

Things I look for in a career are money, solid work life balance (not extremely long work hours), honestly something around my passion/skillset. I’d love to have a career where I’m communicating, perhaps selling/deals/in finance. And lastly I want something that won’t be an extreme uphill battle (investment banking), I’m not discouraged by a battle, but want something thats pretty achievable.

1awaawy,Need advice please: Harassment / Spiritual Abuse,"Buckle up, because this gets a little nuts. 

I work at a mission-led social change organisation. A lot of our work is about championing non-Western healing practices (eg yoga, breathwork, spirituality, herbal medicine, embodiment) to help disadvantaged communities. Most employees are not white, including me and my boss. In our work we also challenge the violence of psychiatry practices and pathologization of non-white rituals and ways of being. 

I am the youngest at the organisation (26) and in the most junior in position. I have been at the organisation for 3.5 years. I work very closely with the founder and director, I'm closer than anyone else is and it's been this way for years. She is extremely charismatic and an excellent speaker, people are easily charmed by her. On our board and in similar organisations there are really wonderful people, human rights lawyers and activists. 

Over the years, I have revealed some personal information occasionally when needed (e.g. I was going through some family things about 2 years ago and disclosed to my boss). There are about 10 people in the organisation. Over the past year, 5 people have left, some because they felt the organisation was internally operating against its external mission, one person because they were bullied by my boss for giving feedback on a team call. My boss then refused to speak to this colleague till they left (4 months of no contact). 

After years, yesterday I finally told my boss I was leaving due to many reasons. Some of which are general unfulfilment/lack of stimulation and not enough career progression, also I have general discomfort around company culture - witnessing my colleague be bullied out, and another 2 colleagues leaving for similar reasons - all related to my boss. Also sometimes I feel she uses me as a bit of a page and I know I have more to give than this. The work is also very emotionally intense and we're expected to commit, e.g. working overtime. We are not unionised but I reckon the management would be very against it (which I know is probably normal but we're a social change org...)

My boss and I are both the same religion, and sometimes we speak about our spirituality. Yesterday, after I told her I was leaving, she told me she was able to channel the spirit (no lies). 

She started twitching her eyes and finger tips and she began to speak in a soft stuttering voice repeating some words twice in a row, as if it was not her speaking, but the spirit speaking through her. I know this sounds wild but please stay with me, it happened. She started referring to herself in 3rd person as if she was not the one speaking, she asked if it was okay that my boss hears this (as if it was not her speaking). She said she has these gifts and this access because she prays and practices, and that I can cultivate them too if I do the same. 

She said I could ask 3 questions. I went along with it partly out of shock and partly out of curiosity and wanting to humour her. I asked about staying committed to social justice, she spoke at length about my family, bringing up personal things I had disclosed (but not as herself - as the spirit). I asked about being on the right path, she said a bunch of spiritual stuff about the heart, the soul, the oppressors. She also predicted things e.g. that I will meet a man at the end of the year. She brought up things about my ancestors and my family - she said by grandma was cruel to my dad (untrue). She said I had 1 more question I could ask. I didn't really have anything to say. She then brought up my relationship with my father (which to be honest, most people in my life know is strained as we don't speak). She said he did not honour my rights, and that he is wrong. She started crying and wincing 'it's so painful' she said. I was kind of like ... what the hell is going on here. I didn't feel I could really say anything during the exchange and I was in shock. She has used spirituality in this way before and has 'spoken to spirits' but I thought she was just asking her intuition and excused it. This entire exchange went on for 1.5 hours - no small amount of time to be in a room alone with your boss. After it was over I left and sat alone for a while, freaked out. Some stuff she did know about my family was true (e.g. she asked me about my great grandfather on my mums side, I said he was a doctor and she said he wasn't - I checked after and he wasn't - my sister says this is just a lucky guess). 

Basically, I feel stupid, I feel violated - like I shared personal things with my boss in confidence over 3 years and she just used all of it against me because I said I was leaving and therefore not in her power anymore. I don't know if I should brush this off as something funny? Or if I should take it seriously as workplace harassment and even spiritual abuse. You have to understand, in the work I do, we do engage with notions of lineage and ancestry. Also people really do worship what my boss says, she's incredibly charismatic (like a cult leader). She's been through a huge amount of trauma in her life and she is genuinely amazing at helping oppressed people. My friends say she's unwell. I really don't want to be in the same room as her during my notice period. I can't tell anyone in management because everyone protects her (as they did when she bullied out my colleague). Should I just try and put this all behind me? I am leaving after all. I also feel a responsibility to the next person who comes in and any young person she works with. I told another colleague who also things it's wild, but agrees not much can be done as there is no accountability structures. Even the board is composed of people who protect and worship her. It's funny in a way because part of why I'm leaving is that this work is emotionally draining and here is a final example.

I moved country a few months ago, and I'm currently considering new opportunities and having interviews with multiple companies for a similar software engineering role. While doing that, I accidentally found myself in a hiring process for an associate solutions architect opportunity at a well-known cloud based NoSQL database provider company. This opportunity sounds very exciting to me since I consider myself a mix of both great technical skills and soft skills. In addition to that, I'm always eager to learn and pursue new, challenging opportunities. However, I'm still not sure if I should consider this career change and dump my software engineering career at this early stage for an opportunity that I'm still not familiar with. There are a lot of doubts that are going through my mind:

”In case I don't like this new career path, will I be able to easily convert back to software engineering?”

”The job market for software engineering opportunities is really bad right now, and it is already full of many skilled engineers. Maybe I really should consider this new career change.”

”If I pursue this new path, will I be able to grow into a solutions architect and senior solutions architect, or will my little software development experience play a role against me?”

”What does an associate solutions architect actually do, and why do solutions architects need an associate?”

”How beneficial will this new opportunity be, for me as an individual, and how will it expand my skills set?”

I'm facing a lot of dilemmas of whether to focus on this opportunity's hiring process or the other regular backend software engineering ones, and yet there is so little information about what associate solutions architects are, and what are their responsibilities?

What do I do in this job marke

Laid off after working 16 years straight in network engineer, cybersecurity and compliance roles. Went from engineer, to lead, to director with 6 years experience leading and managing customer support teams. Firewall company for 7 that sells EDR, MFA and WLAN security, and second company did NSPM, regulatory compliance, and SOAR where I was the director. Laid off in June, hired resume writer, tapped friends, tapped colleagues, some folks said they’d get me in front of hiring manager then it went dark. Others aren’t hiring. It’s true I haven’t added technician certs in a while, but I figured that’s not a big deal as a manager. Maybe I was wrong. I’m now applying for manager roles and also individual contributors roles. Not getting call backs or interviews. I was making $141,000 at my last role. 

What do I do here? I’m honestly scared I’m going to have to back to what I was making 7 years ago if I don’t get any responses. Is my experience worthless now? 

I feel like I’m not worth anything in this market. What was all of this for for the past 11 years? I’m in Seattle and I figured it wouldn’t be this hard. My chief customer officer and co director at my last role told me they have my back for referrals, but that’s worthless if I can’t get interviews. I’m trying to tailor my resume to each role.

1aw8ru6,Should I pursue CS degree as a person with Medical/Neuroscience doctorate?,"I try to paint a bigger picture for all of you. I am based in Eastern Europe I have a master degree in cognitive sciences, postgrad in data science and a Medical/Neuroscience doctorate degree - my research was mostly fMRI, psychology and psychiatry. During my MD I got fascinated by statistics and R programming and after finishing MD I got  a job of statistical programmer in a large CRO. I also know some python and SDL but I don't use these in my current work at all. After about a year in a current position I realized that I like programming more than I like stats. Secondly I do not have strong foundations in math - I sucked at it in high school.   


So I was wondering should I pursue a CS degree? I guess I will learn some math and also I will get more understanding of basic concepts of CS and programming, which I feel that I am also lacking. The statistical programmer role is not very satisfying to me, there is a lot of boring repeatable tasks, no-one reviews your code to give you advice how to improve, most of people do not use git. I was considering switching to data engineering or data science (less appealing) in healthcare/pharma.

I have this burning desire to dive into the world of data analysis or engineering, but despite my best efforts, I'm struggling to land any internships. It's incredibly frustrating because I know I have the hunger to learn and excel on the job—I actually thrive under pressure and love a good challenge.

I live in Chicago, Illinois, and I'm reaching out to see if anyone has any advice or suggestions on how to break into the industry here. My skill set includes Excel (power query, pivot tables, charts, Vlookup/Xlookup), a bit of Tableau, and SQL. I've basically taught myself these skills through YouTube and other online resources since my degree program didn't cover them.

I'm about to turn 25 and feeling the weight of not having a clear direction in life. My past work experience has mainly been in sales and retail—everything from insurance agency work to phone salesperson gigs, and stints at Office Depot and Sam's Club.

If anyone has been in a similar boat or has any insights into how I can turn things around and finally land my first role in data analysis or engineering, I'd be forever grateful for your input.

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!",ConfusedMale-,1,1.0,0,1708506219,2024-02-21 09:03:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aw7nc3/transitioning_to_data_analysisengineering_without/,2,2024
1aw7jpp,Performance Review - “Money Pot”,"I did “excellent work” in 2023 per my manager. But was told instead of a 5 on my performance review, I was given a 4. The ONLY reason being given is the team’s “money pot.” And how there needs to be room ($$) for everyone to get from the “money pot.” This caused me to have the lowest raise and the lowest performance payout I’ve ever received in my career. 

I find this reasoning…..bologna.

1aw5s1e,Not sure where I should go,"I graduated in 2020 with my BA in Mass Communications, then got my MS in Human Resources Development in 2022. While I was in undergrad, I used to work for a bank part-time as a teller. When I graduated, it took me 4 months to find a job. The market was shit due to the pandemic, ouldn’t find any Communications/PR roles (which is what I was going for) so I settled for a Call Center Rep position at a different bank. I was also doing my Masters at this time.

Well I finished my Masters and thought I wanted to go into HR (more specifically Learning & Development) so I got a job being a Corporate Trainer at an amusement park. Quickly realized that it wasn’t my thing but I kinda felt like I had to stick with it…then that job finished because it was seasonal, then I got a job as an HR Coordinator. 

I also didn’t like that job and now here we are. I got laid off the first week of January and I really don’t know where to go from here. I’ve been trying to go back into the Communications route and I’ve been getting denied because I “don’t have enough experience” which is wild because I’ve done 2 communications related internships and I’ve made sure to put on my resume that I have transferable skills (i.e content creation for monthly employee newsletter, using social media to market jobs, full-cycle recruitment, informing employees of upcoming changes in the organization, etc)

All of this to say, I feel super lost and I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t want to go back to HR and apparently I’m under qualified for Communications positions. I’m in the process of getting my resume professionally reviewed, but I still feel like I need some advice on what other jobs I can try to break into outside of those two fields.

1aw4epp,im really frustrated ,"im working for a company that does bonuses annually and it’s based on performance, i think what made it worse is that the comparison from another team who seems to not care about their work, comes in late leaves early - sure they get brand deals which is a multiplier for the pool but it’s the sales dept who’s getting all those. And the whole year based on numbers it looked like we were doing so much better in performance and came this week and told us that they had to adjust ours just so we get something and the other team was like 20% more than my team, and we did so good! everyone was talking about what we did last yr

i was so excited this year with new growth goals and now i feel devastated 

there was no sort of tracker to even help us with how we are getting our goals, it doesn’t feel right and im pretty upset. ",soofayeliselove,1,1.0,0,1708494189,2024-02-21 05:43:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aw4epp/im_really_frustrated/,2,2024
1aw4en0,Graduating soon with very few qualifications; how do I land a decent job?,"I’m 23 years old and graduating at the end of this semester with a bachelor’s degree in computer science (with a specialty in software engineering) and a minor in psychology. I’d like to get a stable job in the field of computer programming/software engineering. Doesn’t need to be anything impressive, even. I’d be happy just being a 9-to-5 code monkey.  
My resume has basically nothing going for it. My only work experience was doing retail for a summer. My grades are lackluster (I think like a 2.7 last I checked) and I’m graduating a year later than expected. I’ve not participated in any real extracurriculars or done any coding projects on my own time. I don’t have any professional connections and I have very few friends. I doubt my professors have much good to say about me because I’ve been a deeply lackluster student the past couple years with shitty attendance.  
I know I should have been a better student and I should have done more to build experience and connections. I went into college with big plans. Unfortunately bipolar disorder decided to rear its ugly head and so I’ve spent a majority of the last 3 or so years rotting in my apartment and repeatedly convincing myself not to just end it all. So yeah, not really impressive on paper. (Not really impressive in practice skills-wise either, I swear I couldn’t tell you most of what I’ve learned in the past few years, it’s just a grey cloud of lost memories and confusion at this point).  
After I graduate, I’ll be moving out of this small town to move to the city (where job opportunities are better) and be roommates with an old friend. I’ll have enough savings after graduating to coast along for like one or two months maximum, but I’m gonna need a job real soon after graduating or else I won’t be able to pay my half of the rent/bills or my student loans. Cost of living around these parts is low enough that if I really pinch pennies I could probably survive off of a minimum wage job for a while. But I don’t wanna be dirt poor in retail hell forever, and stocking shelves ain’t gonna do much to build my resume and get me out of the pit.   
How do I get a job with my trash qualifications? How do I build skills/qualifications to make me more hireable? And how would I go about that while still making money to survive?

1aw4dn4,How do I maximize my earning potential?,"Hello! Over the years I have done many things. I am currently a school administrator doing events and development work.

1aw3ycc,Is it in bad taste to leave right after coming back? ,"After several months of a downward spiral in my mental health, I got to the point of being complained about by coworkers, so my manager suggested that I take a leave of absence, (like a stress leave basically) which I agreed was the best course of action. I spent the time away getting a lot of counselling, my doctor and I switched the medication I was on, etc. I wanted to be away for longer but for a few reasons, that wasn't possible. Before I went on leave, I had been thinking it might be time for me to change careers, or even just company (I work retail and have limited schooling, so entry level regardless), but while away, the professionals I spoke to (therapist, doctor, etc) all suggested I wait until I got back to work to decide if quitting is a good plan.

I'm back at work now, and honestly, I'm feeling even more like it's time to go. My concern is that quitting after having been away for a month and just coming back, is it in bad taste to leave? Given the conditions of me going on the stress leave in the first place, I don't expect that I could use anyone at the company as a reference to apply for other jobs. But they're good people and it is a good company, so I don't want to be leaving on a bad note. 

Any thoughts? Suggestions? Advice?

1aw3hss,Help Needed! Not Sure How To Progress Career.,"Hello, everyone! I have been working for the same government contracting company for over 7 years now, since graduating college working as a project scheduler and more recently as a Schedule/Controls Analyst for the last 3 years now (Reviewing/Assessing Schedules for large Aerospace projects). To clarify, this is the Project Management field.  
  
I feel like I am too comfortable in my job and feel disheartened when I see limited job postings for Project Scheduling jobs in my large metro area (Baltimore/DC).

I have a degree in applied mathematics. I am currently considering ways to grow into a more formal Project Manager role with my experience as a scheduler or looking into ways to enter a career in data analysis which may give me more flexibility and mobility moving forward. 

**For those working in PM or data analysis - would i need additional credentials or experience to make the transition with my current experience?**

1aw2nod,Looking for advice,"I am struggling with deciding on choosing a career path:  


experience:  
2 years as an e-commerce business owner where I did a lot of PPC ads and learned about other core business and marketing aspects.

  
4 years as an operations coordinator for an airline, then got promoted to marketing coordinator where I mainly manage social media(I have been doing this for a year while away at college).   
I left my operations job at the airline full-time to pursue a college education in software or engineering but they offered me the social media managing position as a part-time thing while I am at college(they didnt have much of an online presence so this works for them) . I wanted to study computer science but recently I've been second-guessing my decision. I was looking at jobs in marketing and now I'm considering just going back to work full-time in marketing. I am by no means an expert but i know enough to get an entry-level position and it seems like the salaries in Canada are not so bad \~60-70k CAD (roughly 50k USD). I keep thinking to myself why would I do a college diploma or degree just to get a job in 2-4 years just to get a similar paying job then? why not start now in something which I already have experience in?

  
I am already 22 years old and honestly, I don't think I have it in me to do a full bachelor's degree for 4 years so that's why I said degree/diploma because I'd probably opt for a 2-year college diploma. even if I would go back to work, I'd probably do n online diploma at the same time.   
anyway, I guess my main question is, If I can find a decent-paying job, should I go for it? is there much room for growth like if someone starts as a marketing analyst or something do they usually do that their whole life or like is there a path to management/executive in there somewhere? Is the threat of ai a concern for marketers and if so is it a major or minor concern atm?

  
any advice would be appreciated, I know I'm not gonna get the key to all my problems with a post on Reddit but I'd like to get people's opinions and thoughts.

I have been working two completely different jobs for years (part-time in food service and full-time in accounting).  I recently quit my accounting job and am working full-time in the food job, and now have new opportunities in both fields.  In the food service job, I am in training to become a manager.  I also just received an accounting job offer.  I made a list of pros and cons for each but am still having a very hard time deciding!  Usually when I see postings like this, the jobs are in the same field, so this will be quite interesting.  How to compare?  I would greatly appreciate your honest thoughts!

  
Food service job

  
Pros: positive work environment; security; been working there a long time; flexible; being trained for management; get fed for free so save majorly on groceries; enjoy the work; very little stress; like my co-workers and bosses and customers; don't dread going to work every day; know how to do almost everything so am comfortable

  
Cons: harder on the body (feet took a while to adjust but are getting there; hands are still tingly); pays less (not sure how well I can swing it financially even with the promotion); no health insurance until promoted; not accounting related; does not look as good on a resume; not sure how long it will take to finish training (maybe a couple months)

  
Accounting job

  
Pros: looks good on a resume; pays more; continues the accounting career experience; closer to home; hour-long lunch so can go home; has a set schedule

  
Cons: involves some work in payroll tax compliance (do not like payroll); would require creating an ID.ME account (which makes me feel uncomfortable); they low-balled on the original offer before meeting me halfway; would have to work an extra day a month to complete month-end; not sure if the work environment will be toxic or not (was warned one person there cusses); not sure if work will be stressful or not; tend to get nauseous and throw up for the first week or two of a new job due to anxiety; do not always enjoy accounting because of how analytical you have to be; feel burnt out",Actual-Researcher-29,1,1.0,0,1708487542,2024-02-21 03:52:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aw2aly/help_me_decide_between_two_completely_different/,2,2024

Should I leave or stay for a bit?

I dont know what to do, got a network engineer job luckily around 4 months  ago. Pay is good, but the working hrs can go to an average of 10 to 11 hrs on a busy day. Sometimes I dont  eat just to get work done before a dead line and i am salaried at 40 hrs a week. Management and the communication is kinda in a bad spot especially with multiple projects to do at the same time. I was thinking about looking for a more relaxed job but the job market is pretty bad right now.

In the past 4 months, 2 of my coworkers left. One for work related reasons and the other is because of family. My other coworker will leave next week or in 2 weeks

. That will leave me - 4 months employed

Co-worker B - 3 weeks employed

Co-worker C - 1 week employed

In charge, I dont have that much experience yet in network engineering to do multiple projects at once to somehow meet unrealistic deadlines. I dont know if I can just quit this job, I have bills to pay and I also keep a emergency fund of 6 months just in case.


Should I just stay a bit longer and last for at least a year to 1.5 years?

1aw1l29,Building a Path to Senior Leadership | How would you do it?,"Throw away, for obvious reasons :P

I work as a people manager (cloud sales), and make about $250k with 3 years of management experience. With commissions, it has fluctuated +/- 20%. I have just over 6 years of IT sales/pre-sales resource experience overall. I don't really have a clear idea of how to take the next step up in my career/comp, and since I don't have a mentor or family member I can brainstorm with, Reddit it is :)

My current role is very stressful, and I have almost no work life balance. I have gotten pretty accustomed to it at this point though. That said, my team is awesome, and honestly they give me the energy to power through the stress. The other managers in my department are great too. I did apply for my director's position when he left last year, but they ended up hiring someone external with ~10 years of director experience. So that promotion path is likely closed for at least another year or two minimum.

My new director & I have a contentious relationship at times, but even then, when I've solicited coaching from him, he's repeatedly told me that he has no feedback to give. He talks about me being a ""wizard"" at what I do & his ""natural successor"" (which is slightly annoying since I applied for the director role in the first place..). He also doesn't want to get involved with my customers/business (doesn't join calls or want to be looped in on emails). My VP & I have a much better relationship though, since we worked together in the past, which helps. I can go to him whenever I need something.

So, while I'm very grateful to be where I am at 31 (much more successful than anyone in my extended family), I feel a bit at a crossroads. I started at this company with no experience, and have learned a tremendous amount since. And with the strong brand/relationships I have, I could probably keep doing this gig as long as I want. But as a FIRE proponent, I'd really like to make $400k, $500k next year & whether or not I actually retire early, I feel a desire to challenge myself more.

My technical knowledge & operational expertise are fairly niche, and not directly transferable to other roles/companies (except our competitors, who are smaller than us). My work ethic, sales & management skill sets are definitely transferable though. So, my questions:

If you were in my shoes, what advice would you give me?

Are there any good resources or books that helped you level-up your income/career?

Have you worked with a paid career/life coach that really helped you? (The few I've met in passing don't seem to add a ton of value.)

If you have a successful mentor, how did you find them? (If anyone reading this is open to mentorship, I'm actively looking for one. Ideally looking for someone with a senior business leadership/entrepreneurship background, since that's what I'm targeting.)

If you've read to the end, I'm very grateful! Any perspective or insight you can share would be sincerely appreciated :)",Longjumping-Ear-8146,1,1.0,2,1708485464,2024-02-21 03:17:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aw1l29/building_a_path_to_senior_leadership_how_would/,2,2024
1aw1h5o,I'm a freelancer: Should I keep working with terrible company for $ or leave for my mental health?,"I decided to become a freelancer last year. The first 8 months of my freelance journey was rough, with very few opportunities. After 8 months I got my first opportunity to a long-term (or at least i thought) freelance opportunity doing exactly what I dreamed of doing. The first red flag was the CEO of the company disappeared for two weeks after offering me the job. When we finally got connected again he wanted me to start 4 days later, which was really inconveniencing. I had to cancel shifts/gigs with some of my long-standing jobs to accommodate this short notice to request, but it was the exact work I became a freelancer for.... so I did it. I was given very little information before embarking on the gig, which required me to travel around independently. Upon taking the job I was told I would have no out of pocket expenses, but ended up having to spend over $1,000 of my own money within the first week of the job. I was reimbursed later, but it was very frustrating to have to spend that type of money (especially since I had very little work for 8 months). I also learned that I would have to rent a car and drive myself all over the country for the job, which I literally learned while I was already traveling. Just a lot of details were withheld which made for a stressful start to everything. Once I got a full picture of all the expectations, I thought I would be able to look past all the other red flags. I was told I did a great job, and we would discuss restarting work into January. This convo was supposed to happen in November, but when I followed up I heard nothing. I reached out in January to confirm if I would be continuing to work, and was texted by a staffer to ship my work items back to them (meaning that someone else would be finishing the assignment). No explanation, no discussion about future opportunities, no nothing. To be constantly promised things and then ghosted seems like a slap in the face. 

Fast forward to today, I was contacted randomly by the company to see if I would be interested in returning to cover a couple days of the assignment I used to manage.... after being practically ghosted for 4 months. 

This puts me in a tough spot as a struggling freelancer. In November, I was made to believe I'd be consistently working during this time, but since that didn't happen, I've only been able to secure a few gigs here and there. The inconsistent work has hit me hard financially and mentally to be quite honest. And it's honestly got me rethinking my freelance journey all together.

I don't want to work for a company that treats it's employees this way, but I also desperately want to do this work. And it's the only opportunity I've been given to do this type of work. But I feel like I'm sacrificing my my mental health and self respect to keep taking the scraps they throw my way. 

But at the same time, I also need consistent experience and money to build my career and stay afloat financially. 

So the question is:  Do I take the job or turn it down? I see it as a career and financial wellbeing vs. mental wellbeing decision.

Would appreciate any feedback on what you would do if you were in my shoes.

1aw1es5,First time getting into Sales. Where would a good place be to start? ,"Hello and good evening Reddit. I make this post today because I am in need of help. I want to get into sales as a career. I am currently 26 years old and haven’t really started a career or chose a direction. I’m used to hourly jobs and want to change it up a bit. I’m a bit nervous to start a sales job because I no longer will have hourly wages which are guaranteed so I might struggle to make ends meet at first. I am very interested in the tech industry, I was perhaps thinking of tech sales. If sales doesn’t work for me, I’m going to further develop my skills for software and cybersecurity and hopefully jump into that. What advice would you give someone starting in sales? Also what would be a good direction to go in as far as tech sales for a first time job? I currently do Solar Installs. Thanks in advance!

I’m 15 yrs old and I have a 3.3 gpa and I’m a sophomore and I can graduate late junior year and I’m wondering what should I do with the extra year if I take college classes or work full time or trade school pls help ",Interesting_Gain3387,1,1.0,0,1708484771,2024-02-21 03:06:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aw1caf/what_should_i_do/,2,2024
1aw16jr,How do I decide how to progress career in IT?,"Some context: I’m 31 years old. I have been working in IT in some capacity for about 8 years. I have an mostly unrelated bachelors but I got a masters in IT Management. 

Ironically haven’t landed a single management role since the one I had while attending college…

About my experiences: I have had a pretty weird set of roles overall, with each being in a very specific pocket of IT and never going beyond. 

I started with mostly hardware experience on both Apple and Windows computers. Then I was basically a sys Admin, but really only part of one…I managed primarily the Endpoint Manager/Intune portion of MDM for a school district. 

Then I spent a few months doing very basic level networking for a huge corporation as a contractor, and now I’m working at a Pharma company as a Computer Systems Engineer(which sounds cooler than it is. I reset passwords and act as a Sys Admin but without domain privileges and on computers anywhere from 3-15 years old running Win10 back to XP and troubleshooting these crappy scientific softwares and doing a shit load of paperwork). 

The problems I’m having are that I currently make more than any entry level role, and my wife and I are trying to start a family (we have been married for 10 years and have learned that expensive medical intervention is required) so I can’t afford to make less, but my experiences aren’t specialized enough to do much…

I also have some intermediate level Azure certs and have a CAPM (predecessor to PMP project manager cert) 

I just don’t know how to progress my career. The role at my current job has nowhere to move, and they’ve pretty much communicated theyre just going to keep piling on responsibility without raising my salary. 

I have no idea what to do. I have severe ADHD, and that certainly doesn’t make me crippled by any means (I did my masters program accelerated in 6 months while working full time, but I def don’t recommend that!) but what it does mean is that when my job is boring (it is) it makes it HORRIBLY draining and I have no energy when I get home to focus and learn more and get more certs…

Every company I have ever worked for has promised certain things—promoting to a new role in a year, or “upward mobility” etc but it has always been a lie. I hate it and I feel totally worthless to my current employer.

Not sure if anyone else has had something like this. If you made it this far, thanks. It’s been really hard the last several years (got my Masters in 2020) and I’ve been falling back into depression again (I am medicated/see a Dr regularly and am not self harming).

TLDR: weird job experiences have led me to higher than entry pay with seemingly nowhere to go",Tiny_Supermarket1301,2,1.0,2,1708484336,2024-02-21 02:58:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aw16jr/how_do_i_decide_how_to_progress_career_in_it/,2,2024
1aw14lc,Advice for approaching boss for a raise,"To give context, I am one of 4 traders at a fairly small local prop firm in Miami. I am currently paid $65k flat salary as well as 10% commission on P&L. I started this job in February of 2022 and as my two year anniversary is coming up, I thought it would serve as an appropriate time to approach my boss for a raise. I (26) have never negotiated a raise in my life before and I believe this to be an extremely important first experience and I would like to be as prepared as possible going into it.

To add further context, I netted 4.2 million dollars in 2023 profits which is more than all of my fellow coworkers combined. I am not trying to brag, but I think it is important to give context to show where I am approaching this from. As I work in a small operation, there is more of a family-cultured environment in the office and I want to make it clear that contrary to what many Redditors believe, my boss is not a predator, he is not taking advantage of me, I was merely an under-qualified kid he took a chance on two years ago and I just happened to be proficient at the position. I was offered a more than fair initial industry-standard compensation package and I love and devote my life to this job (willingly), and my boss is well aware of it. 

I am mostly posting here to ask for simple advice regarding the general negotiation structure and salary one might employ when approaching a raise from a leveraged position such as the one I find myself in. My goal is a 5% commission raise, however I would settle for 3%. I am unsure if I should state my case and take charge in the meeting, more or less ""demanding"" 5%, or if I should direct the meeting toward letting him offer a number first and then countering with what I think is fair. My fear with letting him state a number first is if he were to offer 2% or even a simple flat salary raise, my 5% would come off as much more aggressive and I am afraid I would lose leverage. If I were to take charge in the meeting, should I start with 7% so I have room to negotiate down to 5%? Is it traditional and/or advised to prepare documents/visualizations to help my case? 

I really feel lost with this and am getting more nervous by the day. Just a couple of years ago I was delivering pizza making $30k a year and now I find myself in a position where I am now asking the difference of what would mean being able to buy my parents a home within the next 2 years or the next 4, and it really means a lot to me. Again, I fully understand I am already making more money than anyone has the right to complain about, but my case is what it is and I would appreciate the same advice anyone else would get posting here. 

Any and all input is appreciated, thank you.",buttmcmunch,1,1.0,5,1708484174,2024-02-21 02:56:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aw14lc/advice_for_approaching_boss_for_a_raise/,2,2024
1aw13sz,Accept an open manager position at a grocery store?,"I’m going to preface this by providing background:

I’m 19 and entering my second year of community college full-time, majoring in Computer Science. I currently work at a grocery store making $16.60 which I’ve been at for 2 years and 8 months, doing online shopping, consisting of 37-40 hour work weeks. I don’t have my own car, so I use either of my parents’ and I drop off my siblings in the morning before I head to work.

Last September, upper management removed my department head out of it for unknown reasons. I served as her backup, being able to cover for her when she left for vacation and a competent #2. They offered her manager position to me because I know the ins-and-outs of online shopping and I have experience from working under her and her providing constructive criticism. I provided a letter open to their offer but had reasonable demands (a raise, additional hiring needs, working with my school schedule, etc.). I heard no response from management after a month, which left a bad impression, so I formally declined, assuming they would’ve found a department head somewhat instantly.

Fast forward to now and I’ve been the de facto “manager” ever since. It’s been a pain in the ass when things get hectic and I don’t have coverage. Upper management and my HR director asked me again a week ago if I wanted to take it up as a formality.

I haven’t taken up the position formally  because I’m currently just a “clerk”, meaning when my coworkers request off or have an extenuating circumstance, I don’t need to work around them, it’s left to my upper managers. I’ve been doing five classes in community college with A’s and B’s while working at work. I’m afraid even if my managers “say” they can accommodate me with school and being a department head, I don’t want to be fucked over and have them make me prioritize the company over my education. I stressed to them before my schooling is paramount and they’re lucky they have a college kid who’s capable of balancing two things.

1aw101r,"Choosing early career internship: to build skills, or build better resume?","TLDR: Having trouble deciding between a huge name (very fun and good for resume) vs a big name (virtual and many new skills). I'm in physics and CS. What could help me most for future intern application cycles?

Hi everyone! I'm a freshman in college majoring in physics and computer science/electrical engineering, but I'm also interested in fields like business analytics (minor) and economics. My strengths are very centered in physics research, and I have above-average CS skills as well as strong communication skills in the social sciences. Pretty well-rounded.

I'm weighing two options, both of which have opportunities that ensure I can continue work with them for months after the summer.

1. Build skills: at a huge name in the US for STEM, virtual. I'd be doing data analytics/statistics/ML in the intersection between the STEM projects the organization works on and the business+finance people. Projects are more mundane, but I know I'd learn a lot of hard skills to become much stronger in CS.
2. Big name to build resume: at an even bigger name internationally for physics, in person. I'd be doing a lot of physics, applying mainly CS I know -- prob wouldn't learn as much. Project is very interesting and looks cool to talk abt/put on resume, but less skills gained.

Pay is not a concern here.

I'm interested in academia, but also would consider a brief time in finance where I know these strong statistics/CS skills are important. I can also likely find positions at either of these institutions next year, just need to decide which one for year 1: build skills, or better resume for next year's applications?

1aw0ynk,Employers may be bypassing me because of short tenure history ,"In the last 4 years I've had 3 jobs (4 jobs total since 2017). I feel like I have legitimate reasons why, but its hard to explain it to an employer without an interview. I am a mechanical engineer with 7+ years of experience so I thought it wouldnt take me so long to find a job (its been 2 months now). I am now looking for a permanent position but I feel like it's scaring away employers since I'm not getting any interviews.  A recruiter confirmed it by telling me that I was not moving forward to an interview because the employer didn't like my short tenure history.

I listed below my work history along with the reason why I left.

Job 1: Hired as a contractor and the company ended the contract (2 years) 

Job 2: I got this job 2 months before the quarantine, I moved to another city since we were working remote and then the company was asking us to work in the office again, which I was not able to do. (1.5 years)

Job 3:  I enjoyed this job but I wanted to pursue a career in the aerospace field (1.5 years)

Job 4: Another contract job, which ended this past December. (1.5 years) 

On top of all this, I feel like the job market right now isn't doing too well and its a bit saturated, at least in my area. Any advice on what I can do to start getting interviews?

1aw00yq,How should I act with my boss after harassment? ,"My new boss joined my team a few months ago and has proven to be extremely incompetent and foolish over time. He can't do his job by himself and often call us 6 to 7 times a day so we can explain and help him on the same topic, over and over again. He has no leadership or strategical thinking and takes credit for the team's ideas to promote himself. In the first weeks, he repeateadly behaved inappropriately towards me (I am his only female employee). He would sit extremely close, like 5 inches from my face, constantly poking my arm while talking, eventually my thigh, and holding my wrist. Additionally, he called me via Teams one day during remote work and said he was doing so because he was feeling lonely and missed me, in a very improper tone. I brought up the situation to our manager, who talked to him, and the advances stopped. But my blood boils everytime I think about the audacity of this asshole who barely knew me and thought he could easily have his way with me, at our work place. I can't stand to hear his voice or look at his face during the day. He disgusts me for the harassment and lack of professionalism, I can't admire or respect him because he is incompetent and people are starting to notice how I feel (I avoid eye contact and only speak to him curtly when strictly necessary). I have a great relationship with the rest of the team. How should I act and treat him after above?

1avzorl,Really torn between Law Enforcement and Healthcare.,"So basically a little background, I (22m) am  absolutely torn between working in Law Enforcement or between working in Healthcare.

I have struggled with mental health and substance abuse in the past, and even got locked up for past attempted armed robberies with a deadly weapon when I was 15 (Occurred March 8, 2018 & it was 4 counts, happened all at once; long story) that had me facing 8 years, but the judge gave me a second chance at life if you will and sentenced me as a juvenile, where I did 5 months in Juvie then 9 months in an adolescent substance abuse facility where I have been doing okay since. In Feb of 2020 I had a situation where I got pulled over with a hemp bowl in my car and some booze so I got some petty charges (and by petty i mean low level misdemeanors as it wasn’t serious) but yeah.  the serious stuff is all sealed, and while I’m well aware that would come up A because they know about it/can get record of it and B because I would have to be transparent about it anyways,  it’s on my juvenile record and it’s been sealed, so the guy I spoke with said they wouldn’t even go off of that like that fr. And, on top of that, when speaking to the Indiana State Police recruiter, even with knowing ALL of that, he said I would likely/definitely be eligible especially because even the petty stuff itself will be expunged by then, (and by then i mean when i finish college, just started my 1st year)  and if i can prove I’ve really turned my life around by then “they don’t see what the problem is.” Idk if they’re just desperate or what, but the recruiter was really nice on the phone and offered good benefits, and said that they don’t even care if I’ve been smoking weed in the recent past; just that I need at least 1 full year off of it, that’s IT. 

I’ve struggled with heavy suicidal ideation since age 14, and survived a recent attempt (Occurred in June of 2023) where I slit my wrist so deep I actually severed my ulnar and median nerve in my left arm. (about 1 inch deep, i think a lil more), and also OD’d on Clonidine and Alcohol.

Since then I’ve taken my mental health very very seriously and see a therapist 2 times a week. One therapist does DBT with me, & the other does more mindfulness and meditation/holistic therapies. I’m under psychiatric care now as well and am now finally medicated as well; something I wasn’t at the time of the incident. (the wrist & OD one) 

I have been pretty stable for only a couple months now despite my down days, but overall much improvement. I have a baby on the way though in September, so I have to do school part time A for income reasons and B for my employer based Tuition Reimbursement.

Currently, I work as a Medical Assistant in the Immediate Care Center at a large outpatient medical facility, and I love it. Before then I was a MedSurge CNA, and before that, a Mental Health Technician on a hospital psych ward and also floated as a CNA to the dementia unit at that same hospital. So, so far, my current job is my 3rd job in healthcare. I genuinely love to help people and the sense of fulfillment that jobs like that bring me really help me when I feel depressed, or not even, even. It even makes the good days better.

However, that being said, the state of healthcare in the US is REALLY something to be desired and it’s starting to literally turn into an uber-capitalist, corporate, dystopian, greed-hole system, that quite frankly, I don’t know if I want to be a part of; and or don’t know if it’s sustainable to be a part of long term. At the hospitals, the corporate greed really affected patient care and the providers’ ability to provide quality care. The Doctor in the ICC (Immediate Care Center) today told me flat out, it’s unfortunately a bad time to be a provider and I wouldn’t want to stop at being a nurse with my BSN… If I’m doing healthcare I want to help in the most consequential way, and imo I can only and would ONLY want to do that as a psych NP or a Psychiatrist, preferably running a private practice with psych NP’s working under me so we could take more patients, but I would be happy working at a state run hospital or a private one. 
That aside, even though I love helping people, and appreciate my ability to tap into the ability to be gentle and empathetic in regards to working in healthcare and using that as an asset, I feel I could have a much more profound impact as a LEO, as they often are the first people to respond to people having a mental health crisis. I mean hell, I could be the difference on whether this suicidal guy is deescalated and sent to get help, or turned into a meat crayon. I think with my mental health knowledge, it could actually be a “superpower” if you will, on the force. If you guys could lmk what you think I would really appreciate it.

1avzgpe,Owner asked me what I’m worth,"Had an interview today that went very well for a production management job at a small manufacturing company. I’ve been a shift supervisor at a machine shop and am in training as an operations support position for a large manufacturer. I interviewed with the #1 and #3 and I would be #4, reporting to #1. It was very informal from the get-go. They were very honest about their business and its current state. They know the company I currently work for so I was open about my current pay and benefits (65k, $3500 HSA contribution, 7.5% 401k match, etc). At the end, the owner told me to think about how I view my own worth and to send him a number in a few days. I’m completely lost since I’ve been union and/or hourly until like a week ago. My last few career moves have been backwards. I’ve been with my current company 8 years but I’m worried I’m too new in my current position to leverage an offer into a raise.

1avzcdb,Basketball coach screaming at kids at my place of work.,"So to preface I work at a Park District as a custodian.  I was working one evening at one of the parks facilities which I oversee. Setting up events, Opening the building, closing, cleaning, helping sport rec attendants with whatever, rental setup, maintenance. 

So one evening I was sitting in the maintenance office and heard loud yelling. Coming from the boys bathroom which is next the otherside of the cinder block wall from the maintenance office.

I go out and went into the boys bathroom where the yelling was coming from. The coach was having a speech with the kids basketball team in the locker area, pretty much berating them during halftime, no swearing, just yelling how they are losing, it was like a drill sargent. Mind you these kids are like 10. One child was crying.

Btw, the coach doesnt work at the park district.

 I stared him down with my arms crossed, he sees me and walks out, smirks and pats me on the back. 

Should I have told him to stop? 

I don't know if its any of my buisness, i just hated his behavior and seeing that one boy cry.

1avz3ua,How do I figure out what I want to be when I grow up?,"Ok so technically I am grown up. I’m 38 and married with 2 kids, one’s in college and the other’s in HS. 

I was unable to complete college right out of HS (2003) and with 2 young kids by 24, I struggled finding a career path for a long time. Most of my early jobs were in chemical plants, until 2015 when I found a job as an admin at a B2B reseller (my department mostly working with the government). I moved up quickly and became department manager where I was full cycle management of accounts- seeking bid opportunities, sourcing products, customer support, and renewals - everything except AP/AR. For most part, I really enjoyed the job and I stayed on for 6 years. In the meantime, I finished my associates in Biology (hoping to go into healthcare but that didn’t pan out). 

When the office environment became too toxic and I had reached my cap salary/growth potential, I left that job (in 2021) for a position as a procurement associate in state government with a lower salary but (I thought) more potential. I loathed it, so I left in mid 2023 without another position lined up. I was jobless and stressed for 5 months, but recently started as a buyer for local government. 

I don’t hate it entirely, but by no means would I be happy doing this forever. I want more. I want a more interesting job, more salary, flexibility, etc. I am a relatively intelligent person, and this is not stimulating enough. I plan on staying here for a year or two while I figure out where to go. 

So how do I figure that out? I love numbers and spreadsheets and analytics, but also being around people and forging relationships. I don’t want to live to work, but I didn’t inherit millions of dollars. If I’ve got to work, I’d at least like to not hate what I do 40(+) hours a week.

1avz15b,Is it realistic?,"I currently possess a Russian citizenship. I personally dislike this country and the regime and I want to move out, but as I’ve heard, you can’t move anywhere without a job offer, aka a “job offer letter(especially if you’re Russian). So, basically, I have to get this offer. But I chose to be a psychologist, and it feels like no one will be too excited to hire me as an immigrant and solve all of my visa problems or prefer me over some candidate for a job who has English C999 or smth and doesn’t need a visa to work. Is it realistic for me to immigrate somewhere, for example, Singapour, Australia, Canada etc. as a psychologist? 

I don’t have any degree right now, and I’m just thinking on what bachelor to choose, bc…

Previously I was planning to opt for an another career path, Architecture, but then I realised how actually boring architecture is for me. So yes, now there is such a dilemma that I can’t choose between a financially secure job and my dream job. But since I really want to become independent as soon as possible and I feel like architects’ job market is way better then psychologists’ I think like it would be a more rational option for me… So I can get a job offer, work and get a new citizenship and my parents will be proud and all. Psychology degree scares me a bit because it gives me “oh I left this diploma in the box years ago and now I’m unemployed loser” vibes tbh. But I kind of have a passion for Psychology(not saying that I’m a gifted kid who studies it for hours a day) and it sucks.

I would be really glad to hear that there actually are perspectives in Psychology for me abroad. I’m waiting for your answers. Tell me the harsh truth. Or not harsh. Just truth.

1avy2k1,Am I being unreasonable/asshole,"I've been with this company for roughly 5 1/2 years, almost a year and a half ago, the person that I worked under ""Bob"" left the company for a new job. Essentially I was/still am currently the only person capable of doing his job which is maintaining thousands of customers and their equipment while managing day-to-day operations and support for our workers.  So before he left, myself and Bob split the responsibility of the entire system. Since that date, I was faced with a ""Promotion"" because there was no one else that could handle this. This part didn't really bother me too much, and the 3 dollar raise was okay, nothing too much changed other than everything was my responsibility, and learning more about the projects that he monitored and controlled.

What bothered me now, is that around the 8 months to a year mark of me being in my new ""promotion"", Bob reached out to our company for us to subcontract for his employer's company, so we could complete work and meet their project deadlines. That was fine, we all took on the extra work to help and complete their deadlines. We were a ""clean-up crew"" to fix all the messes that were left by their previous subcontractors(fun I know). We ended up doing a great job and meeting their funding deadlines. Then came the part where we started doing more on replacing Bob's employer's existing day-to-day subcontractors. Which low and behold Bob's employer does the same thing as our company just not as many customers as us right now, but pretty close to the same size of infrastructure(A business competitor). From 6 or so months ago, I got told to create the full RFP Bid for their replacement subcontractors. which we won. I told my boss that It's too much maintenance work for myself to monitor, maintain, schedule, and support their entire system, on top of our existing and operating business.

Response ""What do we have to do; Hire more personnel?""

I said Im not sure, but I can't handle our entire system, as well as another business's system on top. While I have maintained support and everything other than billing for our existing system.

Then it stopped from there, I stopped being as much involved in the maintenance side/support, I would still help our workers if they were stuck, or needed help troubleshooting. The boss hired a few more people. They're not really qualified to maintain and monitor Bob's employer's system, but they can keep it afloat and have been doing alright. I will try to help them out. But this isn't the problem

Recently:

A few weeks ago, I get an email Friday afternoon from Bob, stating that I have to do an investigation on some equipment and report back to him. My Boss is also informed. Im already busy out preparing some of our own equipment, so I didn't respond.  Next Day, Im off its the weekend(Monday to Friday, unless there is an equipment issue then I would get called in). He sends the following email stating that he wants the report on the equipment and customers affected, do a diagnostic, and reach out to vendors, and customers. In my head I said I was off, I already informed my boss months ago that I didn't have time for this project, my boss is also CC'ed. I am relaxing it is the weekend, so I didn't respond. All of my sites and customers are doing good.

Monday.... Boss, did you see the emails being sent, Why didn't you respond to them? In our contract, we have to update those issues the same day...

Me ""I said I don't have time for this project. ""

Boss ""He told me well what do you get paid $27/hr? 

Me "" What is your incentive to look after this whole project let alone mine? Why would you take on this extra work/entire business/system?""

Boss ""It's my job!!! What will it take to get you to look after this.""

Me ""I Don't know, I haven't thought about that. I'm busy still looking after our equipment & customers""

Boss "" What do we have to do? Hire more people!""

Me "" I don't know exactly but you will have to split that responsibility up""

boss ""it's a good thing that we got this. We have the new highers because of it, and it's a good thing that we have them.""

Then he tries to tell me along the lines that I should care more because the new hire jobs depend on this contract.

Then he told me to write a job ad so they can hire another person

After that comment ""New hire jobs depend on this contract"", I kinda feel bad and wanted to apologize to Bob for not responding on the weekend. 

Am I the asshole? Should I feel bad? What would you do?

In the initial Signwell app, they said to schedule an interview between 2 dates (one is the next morning from when they sent the email, the other one was last month). Very long instruction with enter this user (all digits) and this code etc using Signwell app.

1avxexl,Should I Get Out of Sales or Stay?,"TLDR: Early twenties with a bachelors in liberal arts. 2 years medical sales, 2 years car sales. Successful but not sure I want to stay. 

Hey all, 

I am early twenties and currently working in medical sales. I work at a small company. I made 45k last year even though I was 113% to goal. Manager basically lied to me, said I would make 60k last year. I got promoted and I will likely make 70-80k this year with same performance.

I got a liberal arts degree because I thought I wanted to be a lawyer. I wouldn’t mind doing that still but I’ve heard bad things about the field. I did medical device because it’s a field that pays well with only a bachelors and I managed to get in. It’s relatively stable and hard to get into. I’m just worried I won’t step it up from there I’m at which makes me consider moving into another field. 

I’m interviewing for a med sales job that will likely pay 200k, interviewed for the same role in a different city and they went internal. Worried it will happen again. 

I like sales, I know I can do it. I’ve decided to put up with all the bad parts to make good money as I’m very money motivated. But I always have the thought in the back of my mind I should just go do something else. 

I don’t know what to transition into. I want to make 200k+ but I’m okay with working up to it. The lifestyle I want means I need that much if not more. 

Is there something out there I can transition into that will eventually (maybe next 5-10 years) pay that well? I don’t mind going back to school to do law or get my MBA but I feel like maybe there’s something out there I’m just not thinking of that I can do. 

I also want something stable. Don’t mind working a lot, just want the income to back it up. 

The sales Reddit never really helps much so I wanted to see if the advice is better here. ",Adonischaddington,3,0.8100000023841858,11,1708474140,2024-02-21 00:09:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1avxexl/should_i_get_out_of_sales_or_stay/,2,2024

I'm in my third year of a CS bachelor's degree in Brazil, and I'm pondering what to do after completing the degree.

1. Moving abroad to a country where I'll pursue a master's degree and settle down, aiming for a good life there. Which countries would be the best for this?
2. Staying in Brazil and seeking remote work outside of the country, leveraging the 5:1 exchange ratio for USD, for example.

1avwble,How to Stop Feeling Like a Failure,"Hey everyone,

Recently I started a job at a really nice medium sized marketing agency. I’ve worked in marketing for about 6-7 years and have bounced around all the different specialties. I consider and market myself as a full-stack marketer.

At this job I was originally applying for an SEO specific role but due to the volume of work they had at the time - they didn’t think they’d have enough to sustain me full time, but they still wanted to hire me. So I onboarded as a marketing strategist with them.

My job is now heavily organizational, making sure that all of the creative projects we have ongoing are on schedule and provided the proper support. I’ll say though - this is a field that I’ve never really excelled in because my organizational/priortization skills have not always been my best attribute. 

But I love helping people and I love helping the company succeed, so I keep pushing forward to try to learn through the challenge.

Lately though, I’ve been making mistakes back to back and it’s really starting to eat away at my confidence to perform the job to the level it should be done at.

For example, we needed custom packing tape for our new merch drop this year and what should’ve been such a simple process turned into a mess because I tried to handle everything instead of a designer. A $200 mistake. My boss was very confused with this whole situation,

Or I accidentally ordered an extra set of shoes for our conference team despite the fact that I had already ordered everyone a pair. Another $200 mistake.

I also tried to help out with a design recently because I used to do Graphic Design at a previous job, but my boss didn’t know it was me who designed it because I didn’t communicate that - leaving him confused yet again.

They’re asking me questions like “are you okay?” Because I used to really help them out where needed but now I can tell I’m starting to be an energy drain.

It’s to the point where I’ve thought about quitting multiple times just because I keep messing up so much and can’t keep making mistake after mistake. 

What do I do? How do I bounce back from back to back to back mistakes? I’m 100% trying to learn from them, but I know they’ll only tolerate so much and I don’t want to lose such a good agency. 

Do you have any stories about mistakes you’ve made in your career? How did you bounce back? What was the following 3-6 months like afterwards.

This was 100% vent sesh but I appreciate any outside feedback because my brain has been constantly beating myself down more and more after every mess up.",Interesting_Hand_354,1,1.0,0,1708471441,2024-02-20 23:24:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1avwble/how_to_stop_feeling_like_a_failure/,2,2024

1avusoj,Internal career mobility ,"I am currently an engineering manager for a little over 2 years and recently a new role opened up in my department but this is for a senior engineering manager role. I talked to the head of our department and he told me that since I was not already a senior that I could apply but I would have to move laterally. I have good performance reviews and supposedly the reason I didn’t get to promoted is because my team size was not big until recently.

I told the head of our department that it doesn’t make sense since I’m a high performer and that this is how we lose good managers when we put limitations on this. He actually originally told me that it was company policy to just move laterally but in an company Q&A the head of HR said that it’s not the case to just have people move laterally.

I am wondering if I should still apply internally and see what the HM for the position thinks of me.

1avudb2,Do you have any advice about changing career at 28?,"I am thinking of making a career change. I am 28 years old and I am a graphic designer in Australia. I want this change because usually the salary of a graphic designer varies between 60-90k AUD. I don't get a salary from the top bar, but even if I get a salary of 90k AUD a year, I don't think it is a salary that will be enough for the future when I consider these increasing living costs.  
  
That's why I want to make a career change. But even as a designer, I hate working 9-5 in the office, sitting in that chair for 8 hours. I feel like time never passes. As a first option, I am thinking about the Software Tester job, which has a lot of job opportunities in the last periods and for the future and has a high salary, but I am aware that it will be very difficult because I will start from scratch and I am also aware that I will probably spend my day sitting in an office in a 9-5 job.  
  
The second option is that I already have the possibility of moving to China in the next 2-3 years if I want to, regardless of my work. But whether I move to China or not, being in business is my second option.

1avt5eq,feeling betrayed by supervisor,"



Hello Reddit, I need your advice on a situation I'm currently facing at work. I recently started a training program at another company's office, as my company had outsourced me there for a month with the possibility of joining their department if my performance was good. However, I'm now feeling incredibly uncertain and betrayed by my supervisor, and I'd like to know if anyone has experienced something similar or has any insights to share.

Initially, the person in charge from my company assured me that my performance was excellent and that I would likely be joining the department. She would joke that we could handle projects really well since I was going to join while showing me the yearly project plan(which was packed with projects)

 However, just today, with only one week left in my training, she abruptly told me that there aren't enough projects to keep me and I shouldn't hope to join the department. This came as a complete shock to me, especially considering that the position I was training for has been consistently filled for over 15 years.

What's bothering me the most is that my supervisor, who was initially supportive, has suddenly stopped providing guidance when I face difficulties. Instead of helping me solve problems, she simply switches me to another task if I get stuck or encounter an issue. This change in behavior has left me feeling unsure about my performance and whether I've been underperforming all along.

To add to my concerns, my supervisor mentioned that she sets large deadlines for herself, allocating three days for a task that would only take her 30 minutes. Additionally, she frequently uses her phone for texting every 15-20 minutes, but sometimes, when I ask her a question, she acts as if I'm disturbing her and seems irritated by the interruption.

Also the project manager is joining the office next week and she will decide if I will stay on or not. However the odds seem unlikely now.

All these factors combined have left me feeling betrayed and confused. I can't help but wonder if my supervisor has been misleading me and doesn't actually want me to join the department. I had developed a good rapport with her, so this sudden change in attitude is disheartening.

I would greatly appreciate any insights, advice, or similar experiences you could share. Do you think my performance was poor and my supervisor was just being overly kind? Or could there be another reason for her behavior? I feel lost and would like some guidance on how to navigate this situation.

Thank you in advance for your help!",Few_Newt9375,2,1.0,0,1708463843,2024-02-20 21:17:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1avt5eq/feeling_betrayed_by_supervisor/,2,2024

1avsxdk,I Think I Speak Up Too Much ,"I'm pretty passionate about my job. It's not corporate, it's client centered. And I really like to advocate for people who can't speak up for themselves and just genuinely never had a fair shot at a good, normal life. I can relate to them.

So I do advocate for them. I try to explain things to my bosses and coworkers when they don't seem to understand our clients, judge them, or think that they've fully analyzed them after only spending part of a shift with them. I also speak up during meetings when we're problem solving or we're asked for opinions or ideas. I'm pretty much the only person who does.

But I don't think it's appreciated. My ideas always get shot down and my opinions get treated as if I'm uninformed on the topic. To be specific, I normally advocate for clients with intellectual/developmental disorders. They're the minority of our clients, and most of my experience is with people with similar conditions.

My direct supervisor appreciates my passion more than others, but still not much. Sometimes she shoots down my ideas or perspectives and then seems to forget, but uses them later. I really don't want to believe that she does this intentionally; she seems really naive and often thinks she knows things better than she does. But even naive people can be snakes.

So I always come out of these situations feeling hopeless and ready to just cry. It's starting to kill my passion. It's the main reason I want to go from working with a team to just having an office with distant management and my own responsibilities. I'm young and I have been shut down before just based off age, even if I do know what I'm talking about.",Human-Cauliflower-85,3,1.0,2,1708463307,2024-02-20 21:08:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1avsxdk/i_think_i_speak_up_too_much/,2,2024

1avsfou,At a disadvantage in the current job market for my field and I don’t like web-related development. I’m a little lost and not sure what to do.,"I’m in a bit of a pickle as I just finished my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I focused too much on my grades and never did any side projects or internships. The reason for this is because I wanted an exceptional GPA to get into a good graduate school program. My original intention for getting my Master’s degree was that I wanted to teach, but I’ve since changed my mind about that. I’m kind of done with academia and want to start working now (a lot of it also has to do with money and my current age).

With nothing to really put down on my resume except some mediocre course projects, I’m at a significant disadvantage in the current job market. Unsurprisingly, a lot of software development jobs require knowledge in web technologies. I don’t have much. I’ve been trying to learn some (e.g., Spring Boot, React) by working on projects, but I can never finish them. I find web-related work so incredibly boring and I always want to work on something that excites/motivates me instead. I’m just wasting my time while I job search doing this crap for a resume that I never finish anyways.

But what jobs should I even consider? Preferably, what are some where I can leverage my educational performance over relevant experience? Ideally, I would like a job that involves programming, but this isn’t a deal breaker as long as I’m putting my degree to use. Other IT jobs require certifications that cost hundreds of dollars or experience in things I know nothing about. So far I’ve applied to defense contractors and military civilian roles. With my GPA, I’ve also considered talking to an Air Force or Navy recruiter about going the commissioned officer route (not yet sure what roles they do though). I’m just incredibly lost right now.

1avsaft,My boss wants to take a vacation and I'm looking for a new job. How to handle the backlash?,"&#x200B;

I work for a small office of 10 employees. I have officially worked there for a year and its been a really shitty year. When I first got the job I was excited and looking forward to it, now I dread spending 8 hours browsing reddit and not having any work to do because my boss has admitted to training me half assed. She said shes all trained out and she doesn't want to train anymore. I don't blame her, shes been there for 30 years. Shes had a ton of office assistants over the years. I got tired of training in Food Service and thats why I left.

&#x200B;

My boss (65f) hasn't had a vacation since her mother and mother in law passed away in 2019. She apparently takes them ever year but with the death and COVID and training, she hasn't taken one in 4-5 years. When I first got the job.  She would complain about not being able to take a vacation because of training me. She STILL DOES tell customers ""I cant take a vacation, I'm to busy training the new employee"". Yet here we are a year later and I know the same amount of information I learned the first month of working there.  I spoke to the owners of the business and told them that she needs to stop using me as an excuse to customers of why she hasnt taken an vacation. It made me feel bad originally but now I'm more annoyed with it because its her choice to take a vacation, its not my problem she made this job her life. I've wanted to leave the job since she started using me as an excuse of why she cant go on vacation its such a red flag to me. She'll blame me for anything if she could. 

Remember the half ass trained part? Yeah, that comes into play. I have another person over me who is a technician (54m) and in charge installing alarm system in peoples homes. I get the message and really just forward over them to him. Well If I get anything wrong, number, name address, etc. Instead of coming to me to figure it out, he goes to the owners and gets them all worked up about it. I have also wanted to quit over this. The guy does not have the balls to speak to me about any issues he has with me. He has to go and taddle tell on me and try to get me in trouble. The owners wont do anything about him taddling either. They just say to ignore it and continue  with my job. This is a red flag to me because they refuse to even actually speak to him in fear of losing him because he has also worked for the company for 30 years. I make mistakes because I am half ass trained and I have asked questions and it is not ever enough. If I ask questions they expect me to already know the answer, if I don't ask questions, they ask why I didnt ask questions. Its a lose lose. 

I have a ton of complains about the job. I like the work life balance but I made the mistake of letting it slip that my mom had passed away  a couple of years ago and ever since then My boss (65f) has tried to step up and play the part as ""mommy"". I have told her I do not need another mother, I am almost 30 and have handled myself fine. She insist on messaging me off hours. I have put her on ignore and let the messages sit there. Then she'll call me and I will ignore it and then she confronts me at work and tells me ""I was just checking in on you"" Ive told her I'm fine, I dont like to message coworkers and she got offended that I called her a coworker. Ive come to terms that I cannot say anything about my life outside of work because it will either be used against me, or shell tell the rest of the office about it. shes extremely noisy. 

Im in the process of looking for a new job. I need advice on how to handle the backlash I am going to get when I get the chance to turn my two weeks in. I want to leave a two weeks if possible, I dont wanna burn a bridge. The owners have been fantastic to me, other people not so much. But I can already hear the backlash of ""You were suppose to take over my job, why are you leaving??"" or her saying something snarky like ""Well there goes my vacation..."" I just want to know the most best way I can handle this. This place is toxic enough and I think me leaving is gonna be a slap in the face to my boss.

1avs8zi,Has anyone successfully come out of a PIP,"So I (40M) was put on a PIP or written up, a few weeks ago. Long story short I’ve been here a year after being laid off a year ago at another company. I had some anxiety my first year here, long term shit I always had plus the “ptsd” from being laid off. (Im exaggerating a bit, I just didn’t know what other term to use) In January I started getting help, talking to a therapist, on meds for anxiety and now ADHD. I had lost other jobs in the past for the same reason but was too stubborn to do anything about it. I’m finally now dealing with it. But 2 weeks ago I was put on a PIP for inaccuracy issue and not getting things done timely. I believe they planned on doing this before Christmas but waited until now I guess to not ruin my holidays. I can feel like I’m already improving, I believe I can get better at this job, I like this job and I like this company. I want to step here. But I’m afraid opinions of me have already been decided but most of my colleagues and from what I’ve experienced and read about in the past that once they put you on PIP they are actively trying to “manage you out” and I should just start looking for another job. TBH if I’m just going to of a lateral move I’d rather stay here. Also in sure 3 jobs in 2 years doesn’t look good anyway. 

TLDR: So my question is has anyone ever actually been written up / put on a PIP at work and come off of it? Not just come off but become a valuable employee after that? Or should I cut my losses now and start a serious job search?

1avrjhq,Career advice please,"Don’t come at me I’m a hot mess.

26F. A semester away from getting my associates in Pre K-3rd grade education. I work in the ABA field in a Early Intervention/Head Start program. (This is relevant.)
My plan was to go into Special Ed teaching with young children. Special Ed makes more money, especially if you have English-As-A-Second-Language Certifications and know things like ASL in my state. 
I am continuing with my education degree because it is practical and I am sure I could go anywhere in the country (although my state pays teachers pretty well, better than most other states). But after working with the population and basically teaching them, I don’t think this is what I want to do with my life. It’s a good fall back and I could find a job almost anywhere I believe, but I’m really over it and I haven’t even started yet. It’s A.) stressful/fast paced. B.) incredibly demanding C.) aggravating and D.) somewhat dangerous. I have already gotten hurt at my center by a 2 YEAR OLD and had to get knee surgery!!! My husband works in the field with slightly older kids and is 27 and got a disc/spinal injury. I’m not about it. 


I love things like wildlife conservation, animals, nature, etc. I was thinking maybe when I go on to get my bachelors, continue with education with a focus on biology, maybe get a masters in biology. That way if we were to move out of state, I could find a teaching job anywhere, but also have the option to do something else with my biology degree (I don’t really know what that is yet—but something).

I have no idea what I’m doing. I wish it was feasible/practice to work somewhere like a conservatory/wild life refuge, but I know it’s not as practice as teaching. Does this plan sound solid/legitimate? What could someone do with a biology degree? Please help I’m so lost.

I have previously worked at McDonald's for 2 years, while I was in college doing a plumbing course up till Level 2. I was planning to become a firefighter in the LFB but I have a family and would like to continue to grow it and would love to support my partner in her own career, therefore, recently made the decision to not pursue it. 

I would love to change my career path and I would like to start climbing the corporate ladder but, unfortunately, I do not have the appropriate education or experience. I would really like to enter the motor industry, working in the insurance branches potentially, to then working for actual car manufacturers.

1avns9g,Got a promotion I didn’t ask for and don’t want,"This company is my first marketing job out of college. And even though I like the company, I was questioning why I went into this field because I don’t find the work that enjoyable. 

Then in a huge restructure I was moved to events for the parent company. Even though it was stressful at first, I found it to be a good fit and counted myself lucky. Others hated the restructure and quit, including my old boss. Because of this, I’ve been told I will be taking on his role at the old company.

This is being presented as a positive for me, partly because it’s a return to more traditional marketing work, but to be honest I’ve never aspired to my old boss’s job. I don’t want that weight on my shoulders especially when I don’t even enjoy that type of work.

To be fair, I will be keeping a portion of the events. But that almost just adds to the stress of the new workload. I was happy where I was before, but I don’t think it’s smart to turn down a promotion and whatever pay raise that will come with. Honestly I don’t even think I have the option to turn it down.

1avmkir,"Recruiter/HM ""making changes to the role/responsibilities"" - what does this mean?","Hey all - 

I have been interviewing for a role that I would be pretty excited about, and think I am heading into the endgame as the front runner but am starting to get a bit anxious/weirded out? Brief timeline below:

\-1/24ish apply to job on company website

\-2/1 Recruiter from company calls, asks \~10min of questions

\-2/2 Recruiter calls back and asks to schedule a call with the Hiring Manager

\-2/5 \~30min call with HM, behavioral/theoretical case study type stuff and some fit questions. Seems like a very nice guy and I think I do well.

\-2/6 Recruiter sends me technical case study to complete, due 2/9. I return it later that day 2/6 (and am anxious that this was the wrong move lol)

\-2/7 Recruiter calls and asks if we can set up on-site day for final interviews on 2/12

\-2/12 I go on-site for 3/4 hours - meetings with HM's boss, technical, panel with other department heads, and HM. I think I do well but you can never really tell right?

\-2/14 HM calls and says feedback was phenomenal and everyone was very excited, and that they hope to call me in the coming few days for a more exciting call. I interpret this as ""this is not the offer but the offer is coming""

\-2/20 Recruiter calls and says basically that the HM should be calling me today or tomorrow, and that they are ""making some changes to the role/responsibilities""

This is where I am starting to get anxious (that's a lie I've been anxious the whole time lol) - what does this mean? I know I can just wait for them to call but I'm cooking up worst-case scenarios in my head. In your estimation what are the odds that these changes are a good thing (some combination of more responsibility, title, $, etc) vs. a bad thing (juniorizing the role) ??

1avlslx,Considering a career change fresh out of college,"Greetings!   
I graduated 8 months ago, from a Mech Engineering school in Europe. I landed a job the week before graduating and I have been working at that company ever since then. Unfortunately, I feel zero motivation to continue this path, I am starting to have the same experience I had in both my previous internships. (2 years and a half in two different companies as a part time mechanical engineer intern)... Once the projects reach a certain level of maturity, the tasks become extreeeemely repetitive, they fail to excite me intellectually... In my opinion, someone without a degree could perform them perfectly. On top of that, where I live, all mech eng related jobs are outside the city, don't offer a chance to work from home and the salary/progression rate is much lower than other fields.  
That's why I was looking to transition into a new field and wanted to ask your opinions regarding my position. My main goals with the transition are:  
\- Get a greater change of Working from home, spend less time commuting.    
\- Be able to ascend faster and gain seniority faster  
\- Enter into a camp that is in constant change so that I have to keep learning constantly to perform  
\- Keep me mentally/intellectually satisfied  
\- Give me the ability to practice/improve on my own (yes I am a workaholic) to be better at work but also allow me to build my own business/go the entrepreneur route in the future if the opportunity arises.  
\- Avoid falling into very repetitive/low leverage tasks in the future.  
\- Increase my salary exponentially in the long run + Give me the chance to transition into managerial roles down the path.  
That's why I considered the following two paths based on my interests and skills:  
Full Stack Web Developer or Data Scientist.  
\- Full stack: I would consider myself someone that really enjoys creating stuff, I like coding and I have some experience programming websites with HTML, CSS and Typescript (react). And webdev would allow me to create stuff at work. At the same time, it is a carreer path where I can go home and keep practising and keep getting better which is something I am looking for (I am a workaholic and I'm fine with it).   
\- Data Scientist: Although I am not as interested, I have a strong basis in statistics, I know the basics of ML in python, have many friends in the industry and also it is WFH friendly, will allow me to keep working on my free time, etc...  
Thus, I am giving myself 4-5 months to dive into one topic and practice, study, build a portfolio to start looking for a job in one of these fields. That's why I would like to know your opinion, what is your opinion regarding my position, which option would you choose? Why? Which one is more future proof? Which one will offer a higher salary and better conditions in the future? Which job is more entertaining, etc?

1avlojs,Advise on how to handle my current situation. ,"For some background, I have only held positions with two companies since graduating college in 2008. I was taught being loyal to a company was the way to be to advance your career and your pay along the way. 

I've been with my current company for 8 years, working on 9. 

When I left my previous job  to go to my current one, it was set up by a friend of mine who thought I'd be a good fit. (Which I was/am.) 

There were a couple years here at my current employer that were pretty sketchy... I was looking for a job then. Since then we have had great years, and the owners children have taken to the business and it feels like there is a future here. I was given a new position with a pretty decent pay raise and I really like what I do. 

I just had a former coworker from my current company reach out from his new job, he told me they are looking for folks in my field, and the pay is great. (It would be 35k more a year with the rest of the compensation package being comparable.) 

I have gone thru 3 interviews with the new prospective employer with what looks to be one more on the docket. Things look promising here. 

Now comes the question, should I consider letting my current employer know what's going on, in hopes they would offer me something to keep me before getting a 100% definit offer....

Should I just give my standard two week notice and not expect a counter offer? 

I guess I just don't know the best way to handle my current employer. I want to keep the bridges free from fire should things go south in the future and I need a place to go back too....


Any advise would be great. Thanks!

I'm still conflicted on whether or not this is something I want to pursue partially because I have a feeling programming is very introverted and that is something about my self I'd like to change. I also don't know if in general computer science is something I want to pursue. I've spent around 1-2 months self learning python and feel very lost alot of the time especially with practice projects and haven't solved one yet without looking up the majority of the answer.  
  
I have questions regarding computer science and becoming a software developer. Is this career line something where I can start off as a programmer and through years of experience I can leverage it into other jobs that aren't as programming focused? I think it could be a cool career for a few years but I don't think it's something I could see my self doing my entire life or even half of my life.  
  
A possible career path option that I'm hoping is possible would be that I work as a programmer for a number of years then transition that into creating my own company or taking on a more business side approach in a tech related industry. Is this something possible with a undergrad in CS focusing on software development? I also think if I am more interested in the business side of how a company works I can always go back and get my MBA and have a good foundation with a CS undergraduate.",ZerOTechnique,1,1.0,0,1708444607,2024-02-20 15:56:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1avl0d4/question_about_programming_and_python_as_a_career/,2,2024
1avky5h,Time to Quit?,"I am in my late 20s and have been in consulting for 7+ years. But my job is absolutely killing me. I basically only sleep on Friday and Saturday nights, otherwise I’m just staring at my eyelids from 12:00a - 7:00a every night. Then in the mornings I feel so sick and anxious all day I’m unable to eat without puking it up.

I really expected 7 years in that this would all go away, but it’s only gotten worse. Part of that is due to the fact that I keep “failing upwards” (at least in my mind) and am now very well compensated. But this only adds to my stress and anxiety even more as it adds to my imposter syndrome. 

I am drowning in meetings every day and am always leading calls and because I’m so anxious about them, all I can think about between meetings is my next meeting. Because of this, I never get any “real” work done during regular working hours so find myself working late every single night. 

Fortunately, because I have been compensated well, and my wife is also well compensated, I could step away from work for a decent amount of time. I am strongly considering walking away without an exit strategy as this stress and anxiety has begun to deeply affecting me personally. I’ve always tried to separate work and personal life, but my work life consumes me so much that when I look back on the last 7 years of my life, there’s only a handful of memories that I have been able to make and cherish. I envy those that are able to manage this stress, as I know I am not some special snowflake and everyone has hard jobs, but I just can’t take this anymore. The worse of it is, is that my confidence is completely killed from all of this, that I wouldn’t even know where to start applying for other jobs as I want to be as far away from what I’m currently doing as possible. At this point, I really do not mind having to “restart” my career. 

How bad of an idea is it to quit with nothing lined up?",dacapatainve,1,1.0,1,1708444459,2024-02-20 15:54:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1avky5h/time_to_quit/,2,2024

I’am in my senior year of highschool and currently choosing a career to pursue. Aside from living expenses, college is free in my country, and my parents will be helping me financially.  
  
I got thru highschool with nice grades and did relatively well in all my classes, at first I thought I wanted to study medicine, but decided againts it this year. This means I’am back to square one and about to start sending out application forms, I have already applied to some med schools and preparing to take the exams (just in case), and a fallback school next to my hometown, so in the case I dont choose anything, I can commute from home and be relatively inexpensive to my parents. (The program there being industrial automization)  
  
Aside from a few unmarketable and unremarkable interests I posses, there really isnt anything I would really prefer to do, otherwise I wouldnt be asking for help.  
  
All in all, my questions to all of you would be:  
  
What career paths would you recommend? Some good experiences with them?  
  
What career paths should I avoid?

1avkqd1,Not sure how to handle wanting to leave,"Hey all,

So I’ve been working in new unfamiliar role for the past year. I came from engineering and am now in an adjacent role with another company because I thought I would really like it. 

As you can guess I’m not a fan of the job and am looking to leave and go back to an engineering position again. Now the things I love about this job are genuinely the people. My co workers and my manager and honestly the best and such a breath of fresh air from the last company I was in. 

This isn’t making me want to stay tho as at the end of the day I feel like I have to move into another position to benefit my future endeavors. That being said I have no idea how to tell my boss I am looking to leave. They constantly shower me with praise (which I don’t feel I deserve) and put a lot of faith in me. They treat me with a lot of respect and always work with me when I’m running into an issue. 

If any of you were in my position how would you handle this? Would you tell me to suck it up? Is there any professional and courteous way I can break the news to them?

Any guidance would be appreciated!",BengalFan85,1,1.0,5,1708443918,2024-02-20 15:45:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1avkqd1/not_sure_how_to_handle_wanting_to_leave/,2,2024
1avk6ji,"What is ATS, and why are job seekers so stressed about it?","Ensuring your resume is ATS (Applicant Tracking System)-friendly is the safest way to prevent your #jobapplication from getting lost in the digital abyss. ATS is an HR computer software programmed to streamline the recruitment process.  
Even if you are the perfect candidate, failing to optimize your resume for ATS can result in your application being dismissed.  
To make your #resume ATS-friendly, you should:  
✅ Use relevant keywords.  
✅ Keep your layout simple.  
✅ Avoid two-column structures.  
✅ Avoid using graphs, photos, infographics, etc.  
✅ Use standard fonts.  
✅ Save your resume in a format that ATS software can read.  
Now that you understand why it's crucial to optimize your resume for ATS, is there a way to ensure your resume will pass through ATS?  
It's important to mention that there are hundreds of different #ATS systems, each scanning our resumes a little differently. Therefore, you can never be 100% sure that your resume will pass the ATS scan. However, there are a couple of great ATS resume checkers that can scan your resume and provide tips for improvement.

1avk66f,Should I be making more? I don’t really know how to approach this,"Hi all, 29M working at a major hospital in a relatively HCOL area. Rent is around 1700-2200 for a single bedroom. Luckily I live with my mom still, womp womp. 

I make $30/hr with some built in OT that comes out to about 62+k annually. 

I was hired 6 months ago. My role oversees a bunch of different departments to accomplish one goal. I was hired because of my paramedic background to assist the non-clinical employees in the department I immediately work in/with. 

Those employees are a small piece of the overall puzzle I manage, but I have to know their job in and out in order to smoothly accomplish my roles goal, so I kind of “oversee” them and my boss wants me to be a “leader” for them.

They’ve been in these roles for many years before me, and my role is new (my boss made it up), so they’re not entirely responding positively to a new “leader”, but we get along and I’ve learned we make pretty much the same amount. Some of them more than me, some the same. 

I believe I should be at least making a little more than them, because not only am I to “oversee” them, but I always step in and help them when they are short staffed. I also oversee numerous other aspects of the hospital for things to move smoothly. My boss is a director, and his goal is to have me act as an extension of him. What I say to someone is with the authority my boss has granted me, I can often speak on his behalf, within reason. And these situations are growing with time and trust as my boss starts to see that I can think the same way he does in certain situations. 

I feel like this is should easily a salaried role between 70-90k. But I don’t know how to go about that. 

I’m working on my associates degree, the only formal education I have after HS is some college and my paramedic certificate. 

I know I may be very lucky to have this role given my lack of formal education, especially considering it as a jumping point to another administration role elsewhere. But I’d like to make the most of it and see if I can get what I think I deserve. 

Thanks in advance for any advice. ",DiamondBowelz,1,1.0,3,1708442516,2024-02-20 15:21:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1avk66f/should_i_be_making_more_i_dont_really_know_how_to/,2,2024

1avjran,Does Gen Z actually care about social media addiction?,"I’m asking because my chosen entrepreneurial career path depends directly on my generation caring about this problem.

First, let me preface this - let’s not argue whether you think it’s an “addiction” or not - I think most of us agree that we all spend too much time scrolling social media on our phones.

I’m older Gen Z (25M). Does most of my generation actually care? Online, I see people worrying about screen time all the time, whether it's in the news, on Reddit, or on social media itself (ironically). “Gen Z is buying flip phones again!!” Are we? Really? I don’t see it in my own life. I see phone zombies everywhere.

So do we, as a generation, actually care enough to do anything to change it? Or have we basically accepted our fate to become more and more integrated with technology, to the point where the lines between online and offline life are almost indistinguishable?

I'm asking because I built an app called [BePresent](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bepresent-screen-time-tracker/id1644737181) to help you develop a healthy and intentional relationship with your phone. Over the years, I found that I wanted to spend less time on my phone, but it was actually really really hard. And it was affecting my mental health a lot. I also found that time limits and app blockers never worked for me because they were too easy to bypass, and I ended up just disabling them because they became frustrating when I actually wanted to use my phone. So I took a more Duolingo-like approach, using gamification to promote the healthy habit of lowering screen time. You can also use it with your friends and shame each other if you have high screen time, which really works for me.

But what I’m wondering is this: Is Gen Z looking for solutions like this, or are they actually okay with the amount that they use social media?",chazwins,2,0.5699999928474426,3,1708441476,2024-02-20 15:04:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1avjran/does_gen_z_actually_care_about_social_media/,2,2024

Unfortunately, 3/6 of my colleagues (including my manager) in the marketing department have been laid off a month after I joined so now there are plenty of things that are being handed over to the rest of us.

I'm fine with taking a challenge and learn the things I'm being handed over as they align with my future career goal and I get to learn on the job which is something I'm fine with *at the moment*. My issue is that I'm only one month in, therefore on probation, and I am being given plenty of things which aren't in my job description such as fully taking care of Facebook, Instagram, and Linked In as well as Google Search and Display ads.

- it's a very good opportunity for me to learnvon the job things which align with my long terms goals instead of just doing adminstrative things
- the company is well known in my area

1avhp57,Feel like I made a mistake getting a job while doing school.,"First off here's a little backstory, I'm currently a Junior studying IT at my local university.  I have a great GPA and a ton of certs through my schooling. I recently accepted a job working at a Managed Service Provider. I'm coming up on a month of being there, but I feel like I should quit.

I didn't necessarily need to get a job when I applied, I was just pretty Gung ho on having the absolute best possible resume when I graduate. I feel like I spread myself way too thin and now every part of my life is starting to suffer, from my grades, my personal life, and my sleep. I'm constantly stressed and feeling like I'll never be able to finish everything I need to.

Anyone have any advice on how to approach this? I feel like I'm growing trying to manage full time school and full time work, especially when I don't need the job.",evon1254,1,1.0,2,1708435883,2024-02-20 13:31:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1avhp57/feel_like_i_made_a_mistake_getting_a_job_while/,2,2024

1avh7ze,Is my work trying to make me redundant?,"I'm starting to get anxious that my employment is at stakes. Out of everyone on my team, I've been there the longest and I am the only one trained to work across all areas. The way our team work load is distributed (set by management) inherently gives me less work to do, because the area i look after is smaller compared to the others. I'm also good at my job and manage my time well so my turn around time is quick. However i wonder if it looks bad - if youre going by ""numbers"" my coworkers look busier than me. I have spoken to my manager about it, I've been filling my time by helping them with side projects here and there and recently, had more of a strategic task pop up rather than my usual, transactional work activity. My manager speaks about how the department could be getting restructured and there might be a new role being created in a different department that i could be considered for. My manager couldnt give me much details about the role as its still early days but apparently its a step up in responsibility. This is all just words at the moment. I dont know if they're just trying to string me along or of my manager is legit. I think im a valuable employee due to being trained in all areas and I've already proven I can manage the workload of my whole team without breaking a sweat (I had to do this for 2 months when two of my coworkers quit on the same day lmao).

1avh22k,How to address coworker issue without sounding whiney?,"So, I have this issue at work. There is a coworker of mine, let's call them M. I've worked with M for the last couple of months since I began working here and I've developed an... Let's say annoyance with them. Our basic duties at our job is to do basic office duties, as well as some specific tasks related to our job, and to answer the phones. Well, my coworker has been lacking on the front of doing some of their duties, such as answering the phone to the point where when I come in to relieve them, I have over 50+ missed calls to deal with, as well as sometimes multiple voice mails I either have to answer, forward to the right person, or do whatever with. 

&#x200B;

I've also come across an issue with them where they continuously tell me things I'm doing wrong even though I've actually been doing them correctly, and leave me little notes about it to come to work to, like how I didn't print something correctly even though I did, how I didn't put something away correctly even though I did, and fussing about it either over text or in the notes they leave me.

&#x200B;

How do I talk to my manager about this without sounding whiney about it or... I don't know, hostile? I don't want to seem like a pain in the butt, it's just, it's gotten so annoying lately to come to work and find little notes of stuff I ""didn't do"" yet I did do it, as well as come to work to 50+ missed calls, and some voice mails I come across, are people angry we didn't answer the phone in the first place. I get that my coworker can sometimes get busy but I've watched the cameras before and they aren't as busy as they claim they are, I've watched them sit on their butt for over 2+ hours, so it's like, what the hell are they doing where they cannot answer a phone call?

1avfmhu,should I change career paths at 19?,"so, i was in 12th grade and decided i didn't want to do engineering because i wanted to be different. i live in India. whilst all my friends prepared for JEE (engineering exam of high prestige) I was preparing for IPMAT (entry into top B schools for a management course). i was performing very well and was confident. in this exam, only about 120 indians were selected all over India. even though i worked hard i couldn't crack the interview round, i got past the written round. i had not prepared seriously in the last one month for IPMAT because i got stirred and thought engineering exams would be easier to crack (the intake is a lot higher than 120), so i started preparing for them. (regret, major) because i was preparing for 2 very separate and tough exams at the same time, i didn't make it through either. today, i am in a tier 3 engineering college, the average package here is about 5-6 lakhs (CS) . i do not think i enjoy coding, i don't hate it but i think it's not my cup of tea. i could do it but the fact that the job pays so less, i don't know. i am in my second year of college with 2 years remaining. i have two options - give up tech and start preparing for CAT (for MBA but it is a very difficult and competitive exam for management ) OR continue tech and try cracking off campus (veryyyy difficult and at the end of the day i will do MBA, be it after 2 years of getting a tech job and having some experience or right after college) everyone around me is preparing for tech jobs, doing hackathons, doing projects. and if i am preparing for MBA whilst trying to keep up with my GPA. i will have nothing on my CV. i am scared AND  the thing is if i start preparing for CAT, i will leave DSA and web development. meaning i won't be able to sit for tech jobs on campus placements at all",Flaky_Deer_7774,2,1.0,4,1708429091,2024-02-20 11:38:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1avfmhu/should_i_change_career_paths_at_19/,2,2024
1avfl1x,How can I deal with a co-worker who is not pulling their weight?,"We hired last June a new fundraising coordinator, whose role is to coordinate and lead all fundraising efforts in our small ngo. We only have five people working, so all employees need to have strong leadership, and a sense of ownership of their work, they really need to be self-directed and not rely on a ""boss"" to tell them what to do. 

* They stood out in an application process with more than 500 applicants. We read all the CVs, and it took us a long time to review the applications.
* They joined around 8 months ago, and since then, they have only managed to fundraise around 5 thousand USD. LOT of money. As someone who would not need to be directed and would be able to do the job. 
* They were chosen instead of another strong candidate because they appeared to be more experienced and came off as more skilled during the selection process.
* They also seem to be very slow with task delivery 
* Their salary is very high for the location they are based at.

They joined around 8 months ago, and since then, they only managed to fundraise around 5 thousand USD.

Beyond the actual amounts:

* Working with them made me realise that they are not able to coordinate with other peopleout how to do simple coordination or fundraising tasks (such as finding grants to apply to, and nurturing relationships), and at the same time, when doing so, they feel micro-managed
* Working with them made me realise that they are not able to coordinate their work with other people
* They seem to work better as a ""lone wolf"", and have had problems leaving openings for support or communicating their needs so we could help
* When asked about their tasks and what they do, they say they are strategising, and they seem to be stuck on a ""planning"" phase
* After eight months, they still seem a bit lost on our mission
* We do not have any lead for fundraising, any donor, foundation, or corporation at the moment 

Concretely, they are very communicative, kind, and charismatic, so they do have the potential of being good fundraisers.

The problem is that our funding is running out in May, which means all staff will be laid off by then if we do not fundraise. It is very stressful, and very pressuring for them, but also it is the nature of this job.

I want to have a meeting with them and direct the conversation towards productive outcomes (them delivering on fundraising) rather than causing more stress, but I feel clueless about how I can do that.

Any thoughts, suggestions or advice?

1avfgvc,Software Engineering without any degree,"Hi all,  
  
Not sure if this is the right sub for this but I am looking for advice. I would like to get into software engineering without any prior experience and without any degree (related or unrelated to CS).  
  
I was planning to take a long bootcamp course to do this. Now what I would like to know is... is the investment worth it? If I put in the money and time to learn from scratch and I am passionate and I become good, will I be able to get a job or will I only find slammed doors in my face because I have no degree?  
  
  
I won't lie, I have no intention of going to university for computer sciences or any other degree. I want to understand whether getting a job is feasible with a bootcamp anyway or if I would just be wasting money/time.  
  
I have no unrealistic expectations, I understand I would need to get an entry level job or possibly even an apprenticeship to get my foot through the door and I am perfectly happy to work my way up.

1avd2oe,Super Late Bloomer - Too Little Too Late?,"I’m gonna keep it short and sweet, please don’t ask about further details about my life unless it is TRULY necessary. This is stressful enough.

I (30M) graduated 3 years ago with an electrical engineering degree (nontrad student). I wasn’t proactive about looking for a job while in school, which only became harder when school went remote for the pandemic. What followed was a gap year doing under-the-table work for a wealthy friend, another year of a depression episode, and finally a third year working a “I need to eat” warehouse job. 

I had a few semesters of research (but it was paid, so technically an internship?), but most of my genuine strength is in my personal project portfolio, demonstrating a wide variety of skills used in the field. I also have a ham radio license. I also graduated with a 3.9x GPA (I forget the hundredths place atm).

So here’s where I’m at: My last “professional” engineering work was three years ago, while I was still in school. While in school, and after graduating, I’ve been churning out personal electronics projects, but have struggled to find a job in the field. I have a two year absolute job gap, and a three year engineering job gap (I’ve been at the warehouse for a year and am currently full time employed there).

 I’ve gotten my resume to a point where I can get interviews with recruiters but I don’t think I’ve managed to get an interview with any actual companies yet. I’m leaning on my personal projects really hard on LinkedIn, with lots of pictures, but I worry that focusing so much on my hobby work comes off as childish, but it’s also where my skills are demonstrated so I don’t know what else to do!

I know I haven’t made the best choices, a lot of it was anxiety manifesting as avoidance (and probably undiagnosed ADHD), but I’m ready now. But it feels like the world doesn’t want to give me a chance now. I need brutally honest advice, because I know I can’t do this physically demanding job indefinitely, but I also need to know if I’ve managed to turn a good degree into just a piece of paper and if only now trying to get a job with it is me barking up the wrong tree? Do I even have a viable path toward any kind of EE career in this life at this point?

Founder is very fickle, that is the problem. I created a social media plan which he constantly okay-ed, we even went as far as posting 3x a week for a solid month now and only getting the feedback now that we should change it completely because of X Y Z. Things that could have been prevented when I initially had a discussion with him. Or idk, when I was asking for approvals in the first place????

He’s constantly cutting me out on convos. I work remote. He calls me to say something that can be in the form of email. Won’t let me talk.

He changes his mind constantly, bumping the timeline on projects when a new thing comes up, and worst, he would even ask me to copy my old company’s social media posting and aesthetic — the latter is fine but the posting time? We market towards a different country so it does not make sense ☠️

There’s little project organization (quite literally too), and even if I try to reinforce them, he wouldn’t budge.

Schedule is super easy and convenient time off is almost never an issue the team I work with is nice, and overall it’s pretty easy going.

It is a smaller company I also know she wouldn’t pay me more than the senior person above me.

1avaplr,Dropped out of grad school today. Looking to pursue marketing (or other jobs) but don’t know where to start.,"I (23 f) just dropped out of my doctorate program for audiology today and I am not sure where to go from here. I am open to any career path, but I am hoping to pursue something where I can be both social and creative. Ideally, I am hoping to not return to school. I have found that academia is just not for me, although I do well, it just sucks the life out of me. I made it through about a semester and 1/4 and have hated it basically since the first day. I think I was putting a lot of pressure on myself to be something I wasn’t meant to be and ultimately reached my breaking point this past week. 

I have done a lot of thinking and I feel like marketing could be the field for me but I am nervous about getting started considering my undergrad degree is in Speech Language and Hearing Sciences which is hyperspecific to speech and language pathology and audiology. I have no experience in marketing but I consider my self to not only be quick learner, but also eager to learn.

What would you recommend for getting started in the marketing field? Should I go back to school? Are there certifications I should get? People or companies I can reach out to? Everything just seems very daunting at the moment because I have no experience with marketing and the last 5 or so years of my life have been dedicated to audiology. I am not opposed to things that aren’t marketing though. I just want a job that I don’t hate and I am able to make a livable wage off of (hopefully 50k+ if that’s realistic). I would love to wake up every day and be excited about what I do, I just don’t know how to get there. Any recommendations/advice would be greatly appreciated.

1avanma,Advice moving out of the business/corporate field?,"I graduated in 2016 with a BS in Business Management. I've been working as an administrative assistant ever since. The pay is low and even though it isn't difficult, I don't like it. Thinking long-term in terms of climbing up, I'll only be able to move up towards supervisor/manager/executive roles. These are extremely not suited to my personality and even just reading it alone makes me uncomfortable.

I've considered going for another BS in Accounting because it seems like without it, no one will be willing to hire me even a basic accounting clerk role. 

I also thought about a CS degree since I briefly messed around with HTML and it seems fine. However, it seems like it's difficult, there's a lot of hard mental work that comes along the job, you always need to learn, imposter syndrome is common, and the job market is competitive and difficult.

I'm seeking a job that isn't dealing so much with business matters, something that isn't super corporate, and something in which I can work independently without tight supervision. Preferably alone. Preferably remote although that's competitive, too.

1av9pza,How to follow up on pay raise request?,"So I’ve been at my company for 7.5 years, and for the last 3 years I’ve been in my current position 

I recently discussed (end of January) during my performance review of going to the next salary band/grade as I’ve been in the same salary band/grade since I’ve started in this position. Keep in mind I’m about a year out from finishing my degree in the same area. My performance review was ranked as just about 4 on a 5 scale rating system. The company states 3 is doing your job and 4 is exceptional. So I mentioned to my boss how and what I need to do to get to that next level. She had mentioned that she was looking into that as the previous year I had also mentioned I’m at the top of my pay scale. It’s been awhile and I’m wondering how to follow up on this? Our company is quite large but our department is small… we’ve seen some people leave in the past few months and have been spread thin. I was also the first to be trained under my manager and have trained the others who have left… I just feel I’m doing a lot more than what I’m being compensated for",Agitated-Fun-6669,2,1.0,0,1708406361,2024-02-20 05:19:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1av9pza/how_to_follow_up_on_pay_raise_request/,2,2024
1av96g3,Switching jobs,"I feel pretty iffy about the situation I put myself in… I’m leaving a job because there’s not many opportunities and I don’t like what I do. I feel like the company doesn’t pay anyone a living wage and asking for one is asking to be turned down. 

In my current position I am helping with personal care all day and not teaching, which is my passion. We have a daycare at my current job which I do when the other worker is not available.. I love teaching the kids but not going to lie, no breaks for 6 hours is a lot for me. I shouldn’t have to feel guilty about using the bathroom lol. Usually they have moms work here and that’s not a problem for them.. I’m not really given an opportunity to show my skills, unless it’s unpaid work to benefit the company. I applied to this job because it’s an art/dance education program but my lack of a bachelors degree keeps me in this assistant role. Plus it’s only 25-28 hours a week.. 

so I applied to a daycare job a few minutes from my home. I did all the paperwork and I get paid a dollar more an hour & full time. They will help me expand my education. Although I enjoy working with pre k children the most, I accepted a job for a toddler teacher assistant. Sounds great. 

The only issue is… I saw the room and I literally CANNOT believe they have 10 toddlers in a room that small.. I’ve worked / seen other daycares and centers but I’m just really concerned now… I wish I was better at math so I could describe the length of this room maybe 25 by 10 ft!? I have to put in my two weeks tomorrow … 
Im so stressed. I just want to make a decent living and find a place I can stay forever and be respected. Please tell me what to do..

Management in dept A felt bad for me since they saw how hard I tried and the portion that I failed is one of the portions most people do if they don’t pass, so they gave me a different job in dept A that I never would have applied for and didn’t want. However, I was in shock from falling, and a bunch of other factors, including the fact I only had 12 hours after finding out I failed the course to decide if I wanted this new job and had to start the next day, I accepted against my better judgment.

1av6hk7,Why is it so hard to get promoted?,"This is mostly for ranting but I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or tips on moving on the corporate ladder. TLDR: I worked hard but got  peanuts so I’m whining.

I begun my career with a Fortune 100 company straight out of college, fortunate to have a manager who was supportive, fun, and caring. Throughout my first year, I dedicated 50-60 hours weekly to my work. However, during my end-of-year review, I received a disappointing 3 out of 5. It seemed that achieving a 4 required performing at a senior level as a new graduate, or contributing to saving/making the company $9 million annually for a perfect score of 5—goals that appeared nearly unattainable given my role in a cost center. Despite this, my manager reassured me I was on the right path and expressed a desire to promote me if possible.

In my second year, as all senior and lead dev  in my team either left or terminated, I saw an opportunity for advancement. However, I was told these positions were being outsourced overseas as a cost-saving measure. My manager promoted two developers abroad, promising me a future promotion in April. Yet, when April 2023 arrived, talks of promotion ceased due to reorganization and budget constraints, even as my workload increased to take on the scope of the senior devs. 

The promotion of the two senior developers abroad was, to put it mildly, perplexing. One struggled with basic understanding of our applications and seldom communicated effectively in meetings. His catch phrase is “Sorry my speaker is not working” especially during stand ups when asked what he was working on. The other, though somewhat more proactive, frequently needed guidance on elementary tasks such as how to use git, where to find a file, unable to use VSC or connect to DB etc . Despite these glaring inadequacies, my manager regarded them as overachievers. This scenario left me feeling undervalued, with limited prospects for professional growth or challenge.

By November, after yet another review rated me at 3 without any mention of promotion—despite having outlined a clear plan for advancement. I was also informed  I might have to comepete with over a hundred other developers for a senior promotion if I were to be put on the promotion list. This revelation was the final straw, prompting me to seek new opportunities. I am glad that after 500 applications and 10 interviews, I secured an offer with a 50% increase in total compensation and improved benefits.

The funny thing is, on my last day, I had to work on an emergency ticket before my access revoked. Apparently, the two seniors on the team were “too busy” to respond to the ticket despite stakeholder emailed them directly.  On the next day, a friend of mine announced that he was promoted to the senior position and he revealed that there was only 10% increase in TC. 

Looking back ,despite  my manager was very supportive,there was too many factors affecting the promotion. Now I understand that hard work alone does not guarantee career progression. Networking and pursuing personal interests might have been more fruitful. If I didn’t fixated  on that senior promotion and spend time on my own growth and building projects, I might have yielded greater result.",West-Philosopher-503,5,0.75,12,1708396403,2024-02-20 02:33:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1av6hk7/why_is_it_so_hard_to_get_promoted/,2,2024

1av6btg,Tips for dealing with aggravating coworker?,"I have a coworker that gets under my skin. I know she shouldn't but it is something I have been struggling with for years. Most quirks other coworkers have I can ignore but she is vindictive (my pay checks are always wrong I believe this is intentional since it doesn't happen to anyone else), manipulative (crys to my boss about everything in her life), and every chance she gets brings up her very out of touch views (like anyone can get and afford a loan for a million dollar house, I get paid less than $65k a year). 

I don't engage with her unless I have to but it is hard to ignore her when our office is so small. She likes to hover over my shoulder to see what I'm doing. 

Yes I am obviously looking for another job but it is tough right now. I can't just quit I don't have enough in savings. I had savings but then my husband and I both had unexpected surguries 4 days apart at the end of last year and there went 10k just to deductibles not including all the missed work we didn't get paid for. 

Here are the things I cannot do: 
- Talk to my boss about this issue. I have brought it up in the past with solutions. His exact words were ""I absolutely am not getting in the middle of this and you need to drop it."" I swear he is a good boss except for this issue. 
- Move desks - I work for a small company there is only 3 desks. Mine, hers and the owner's. 
- Wear headphones - If I don't pick up the landline phone by the second ring she chews me out. Also no there is no headphone jack for the phone or voicemail base. I asked if we could buy different phones and got shut down. I offered to pay for new phones out of my own pocket and got shut down. 
- Work remotely - my boss is afraid of wifi, when I asked if I could work from home after surgery he lost his shit thinking it wasn't secure. 
- ETA: She is our accountant and HR so there is no HR for me to talk to about this. 

Any advice or ideas to cope until I find another job?

1av62l9,Trying to start my own business but taking Maternity Leave next Fall with my current company.,"I’m [27F] currently a manager with a large company. I worked very hard to get myself into this position in my career. In the last year I’ve grown increasingly frustrated with my company and I feel overworked and frankly taken advantage of. Demands to cut labor and budget cuts while expecting higher customer satisfaction and profit is making me so done.

Around Christmas I talked it over with my spouse and I’ve decided to start my own business. Basically doing my current profession but for myself on a freelance basis. Eventually as I get more and more work, expanding my range of operations and hiring people. We agreed that I take the next year to get the business established and if I am getting at minimum 1 contract a month, I can quit my job and pursue more work for the business. My state also has this incredible FREE small business development program that I enrolled in. My advisor and I meet for our first 1:1 mid March. I feel really good about this and I’m excited.

Well, 2 weeks after this and 1 week before my introduction class for the small business program, I found out I was pregnant with our first. We’re super excited. We were trying but knew it could take couples month to conceive so I was planning my life as if not pregnant until I actually was. 

My current job gives me 12 weeks paid leave. But when I was reading my employee handbook about leave it mentioned that you cannot engage in self employment while on paid parental leave. The exception being that you’ve had said self employment for at minimum 6 months prior to leave, you cannot engage in self employment during hours you would normally be at the company job and all things needs to be disclosed to the Hr director and approved prior to leave. I’m due in late September, truthfully I’m not going to have clients by next month to hit the 6th month mark before leave. I don’t want this to hinder my business growth though. My initial thought was take parental leave, then come back work 2-3 months then quit. 

Healthcare isn’t a concern. We currently get insurance through my job but my husband started a very secure government job in the last 6m that offers that same medical insurance. His pay alone can cover most of our bills, my pay goes towards groceries, car insurance, and anything “extra” (tickets, night out, emergencies, ect). 

What would you do? Quit the corporate job while pregnant or stay and put the personal business on hold? Somewhere in between?",garden_muse,1,1.0,0,1708395262,2024-02-20 02:14:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1av62l9/trying_to_start_my_own_business_but_taking/,2,2024
1av5urs,Struggling to pivot from psychology/medical research background,"So I completed a Psych degree (with honours) 8 years ago, and initially pursued Health Psychology research at a local diabetes centre, but realised quickly that grant proposals and the instability of funding wasn't what I wanted. Then moved into recruitment at a clinical trials centre, and eventually got a research assistant role there before taking a project specialist role at another clinical trials centre.

I have project management, recruitment, academic writing, archiving, patient interaction, and data entry/management skills, but I dont have much interest in doing a science related job since I always felt out of my depth and the work itself was boring even if the studies weren't. I just kept moving laterally, hoping a different role would fit me better but realised I was spinning my wheels.

I would love to pursue something that actually makes me happy, and is related to my passions (e.g., writing, reading, basketball, gaming, media). I love writing novels as a hobby but not sure that is viable as a career. I looked at being a librarian, and working in the publishing industry. 

I dont mind studying part time, but I do have bills so I have to do something. 

Any advice on potential jobs/fields I could transition to? Or any study you would reccomend to undertake in Aus?

1av5myh,Work But Not Working,"Hello Everyone,  
I'm creating this thread because I feel frustrated and bored with my current job. I work as a Technical Assistant to the Head of a Central Government Institution based in the Province.  
For reference, I'm M(25) from Indonesia, a graduate of Vocational High School in Building Design and Civil Engineering. I have quite a few achievements in this field because I enjoy operating CAD and BIM tools, and in May 2023, I was fortunate to get this job.  
The problem is there's no real work I have to do in this job. I spend days doing nothing; only once a month I'm tasked with collecting project progress data, and I was once assigned to design staff housing and a new building, which I completed in less than a month. I feel very bored because there's no work I have to do every day, and as of today, I've been working for about 9 months, with more than 85% of it being idle time, just sitting around.  
What I usually do in this free time is watch training videos, buy online courses, play games, watch YouTube, and do other non-productive things. I actually want to use this free time to study the courses I bought, but honestly, the environment doesn't seem conducive because I sit with the correspondence department and near the reception desk, which makes it hard for me to focus due to the constant flow of people.  
I'm planning to switch careers to a job that utilizes and develops my potential and abilities. I'm considering Data Science, Programming perhaps, or sticking with Civil Engineering with a focus on BIM. I'm actually getting tired of the civil engineering field because I'm not skilled in conceptualizing buildings and prefer operating programs. As you may know, civil engineering is often equated with architecture by the layperson, so during my studies, I always did all the projects solo, from Architectural drawings, Engineering, and MEP to Bill of Quantities.

1av4zxk,"As someone who’s an introverted and is interested in healthcare but doesn’t want to work bedside, what should I major in?","I’m 17F and soon I’ll need to figure out what colleges to apply to, and what major I’m going pursue. Some of the majors I’ve been considering are: Computer Science, Data Science, Nursing, Pharmacy, Neuroscience, and Biomedical Engineering. 

Here’s the issues I’m seeing with each of these careers:

- The problem with CS is while I enjoy coding, I’m still fairly new at it and with my stats and EC’s plus considering the fact that CS is very impacted at most schools, it’s unlikely I’ll be able to get into a good uni right out of high school and even if I do go to CC then transfer the job market is very unpredictable. Another issue is that AI seems to be decreasing the amount of jobs needed for CS, and since it’ll be very difficult to land internships let alone a job out of college in the next few years, it doesn’t seem worth it anymore. I enjoy math and coding but I feel like majoring in it would make me end up hating it honestly. Data Science might be easier to get into but even harder to land a job in.

- My mom does nursing, and she makes a lot of money despite only having a bachelors degree. The thing is, I don’t think I have nearly as much patience for people as she does and even then she complains to me a lot about her job. Working 12–16 hour night shifts plus having to deal with incompetent co-workers and patients doesn’t sound too fun. The pro is if I did major in Nursing and worked hard enough to get through it, I’d probably have good job security.

- Pharmacy sounds really interesting, but after hearing about the decline of this job and the lack of demand + how competitive it is to get into a program, I’m probably not going to consider this further. 

- I love the subject of Neuroscience and learning about the brain in general but I’m pretty sure I need to get a doctorate to actually get anywhere with this degree. Same goes for Psychology which I’m definitely not considering. 

- Biomedical Engineering probably has some job openings but again I don’t know how I feel about being an engineer in general.

I’m very lost here on what to do. My mom is pressuring me to decide and it’s very frustrating not knowing what to do. I don’t want to be the person in college who goes undeclared and ends up switching their major 5 times so if anyone has any input or advice, please lmk.",gwenkm323,1,1.0,3,1708392300,2024-02-20 01:25:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1av4zxk/as_someone_whos_an_introverted_and_is_interested/,2,2024

1av3df6,How do I go about renegotiating pay in my year review? ,"I am 24 in the NY area. Making 60k as a project coordinator. 

Over the past year I took on a lot more responsibilities in my company moving more into management of the saftey department ( only me) and going into estimating along with operating a special scanner because I’m a bit more tech savvy than others there. 

None of which was in my contract and no raise was given. Going into this year it was basically been said I’m going to be an estimator full time while also doing the saftey aspect and scanning when needed. My year review is in 2 weeks. 


I look up salary’s and entry level  saftey managers make about 75k and estimators make about 72k. The scanning was previously subbed to another company for 2-2.5k a day. 

My new ask this year was going to be 78k plus a additional week of pto. 

This is from 60k and 1 week pto. 

I am going to back up my data into a document to give to them. Showing all of this. I also had a breakdown of if they hired 3 separate people for these rolls which was about $175k a year then showed my desired salary and the savings they would have. 

My only issue is should I be asking for more initially to give more room to negotiate? Or go in with what I want and hope they fold to it? 

For example. I found out my head HR lady and operations manager make 85-90k. And my head estimator makes $130k. Only 10 office staff and 30 ish field staff  in the company.

1av1chk,"Spent 6 months building the sales & marketing strategy for a startup that can’t fund my expected C-suite position, where do I go from here?","
Greetings, /careeradvice! Appreciate all insights in advance. 

In the past 24 months, I’ve been laid off from two high level strategic sales roles. I’ll spare you the details, both happened for the same reasons we see posted on here daily. It is what it is. 

After my most recent layoff in August, I was approached by a colleague looking to hire someone to fully redesign his cybersecurity and IT management startup. I renamed the business, created a GTM sales and marketing strategy from the ground up, wrote all of the copy for the website, hired industry professionals to design my vision for their website and new branding, built out a basic marketing framework, wrote a basic sales script and presentation deck - the list goes on. To say this project has been my baby is an understatement, I’m genuinely proud of what I’ve been able to accomplish these past months. 

All sounds great, right? Wrong. 

I learned last week that the owner of this business wasn’t 100% truthful about their funding. I had been getting paid hourly for my work previously, operating under the assumption that when the business was ready to launch that I’d have the option of assuming a full time C-suite role. Because of this, I haven’t been hounding this person for the money they already owe me - I looked at it as an investment in my future that would payoff long term. I’m now no longer convinced it will, at least not within the initial timeframe I had mentally mapped out for myself. 

I’m at a bit of a crossroads for what to do moving forward. 

- It’s clear that I need to get back out on the job market, but how do I best describe what I’ve spent the past 6 months building?
- Part of the initial “launch” plan was going to include announcing the business to my network (including my title) and doing some strategic outreach from my LinkedIn. I’ve already vetted and mapped leads, but this seems to be an absolute ‘no-go’ if I need to start applying for more stable positions again. I’m at a loss for what to do here. 
- Instability has plagued my career the past few years and the job market is a nightmare. I knew getting involved in a fledgling business was a gamble, but being at the helm gave me a false sense of security. That’s now gone. Assuming I start applying for jobs today, how can I frame this experience to best combat the two short layoff stints (8 & 13 months) prior?
- The owner of the company has told me I can list whatever title I want for this role, what’s the best title I could use to encourage recruiters to reach out while I continue to weigh my options moving forward?

I worked with that population for 4 years, and my hours total up to 2 years of full time experience. I'm currently working in mental health and I only enjoy it when we get intellectually disabled adults. I know how to communicate and work with them, but I struggle with all of our other clients.

It's impossible for me to get a degree right now and those jobs seem to cap out at $15/hour. The only positions I've been able to find are in group homes and then we have one service in town that does occupational training. I didn't like working with them at job sites; I was in the day service part where we helped them build janitorial skills, basic math and reading, sometimes budgeting, etc. And a lot of work with behaviors. A big part of my job was just helping them learn to be around people they don't like and just generally engaging with them.

Is there a job that exists that pays a decent wage? I currently make about $35,000/year before taxes. I'm not too ambitious money wise, so I'm just looking to get up to maybe $50,000-$60,000 within the next few years.

I'm also open to ideas on jobs that would provide mental health services to that particular population, but I'd need to find a way to explain the need for it to my company and pretty much just find a way to get that service incorporated into the company. It's a nonprofit so funding is a concern, but they have been expanding the services.

When I say 'adults with intellectual disabilities', I mean some of the diagnoses listed below. These are just ones that I have previously worked with. I feel that it doesn't sound good to call them ""adults with intellectual disabilities""; does anyone have advice on how to word that in a more professional manner? Both jobs I had used that wording, but I feel like my current bosses and coworkers judge me for saying it that way.

•Cerebal Palsy

•Traumatic brain injuries were pretty common, but most of my clients had an ""unspecified developmental disorder"" from birth

•Downs syndrome

1auz0w9,How to explain Career Break/Tenure.,"Hi All - I need some advice regarding the gaps in my resume. Any feedback is much appreciated! 

**Job # 1 out of college** \- Discovered that the CFO was embezzling money. Whistleblower. Left company after 2 years. **Level: Director**  

**Job #**2 - Outside sales. Car accident. Took remote Tech job. 1 year. No manager on site. **Level: Enterprise Rep**

**Job #3** \- Woman raped at company retreat. Multiple women, including myself sexually harassed. Settled outside of court. 1 year Also, they completely lied about OTE. It went from $180k to $80k. They scaled too quickly. **Level: Strat**

**Job #4** \- 3 months. Placed on DE&I team. Manager clearly is an alcoholic. 4 hour morning meetings. Sometimes he wouldn't show for work. Team Mentor, also noticed that manager seemed to lack basic understanding of products, training, etc. (Tech space) -- Left for better opportunity. $15/hr + 15k bonuses vs Opportunity $90k base with $160k OTE. **Level: Mid-Market**

**Job #5** \- 4 months -- in the thick of BLM, my manager kept letting me know she is Blue Lives Matter. Peers reached out to HR to have me switched to another team. She actively isolated me. Mind you, I'm Biracial female - Grew up with what people would describe as ""The Patriarchy"" -- I ignored her, given that I wasn't going to feed into her immaturity. Left company after she continued to try and humiliate me on every team call. So much so that one of our teammates (her friend), started advocating for me.  **Level: Strat**

**Job #6** \- 1 year. Whistleblower. Managers were instructing reps on how to steal, and manipulate contracts. Which obviously, OTE would not be as expressed. If the numbers are manipulated that means we scaled too quickly, layoffs were bound, etc. My forecast was correct. Majority of my team was laid off.  **Level: Enterprise**

I've taken sabbaticals in between. Previously my boyfriend White Male in tech, thought I was the issue until I started working remote. We worked at the same company and had totally different experiences. I've mentored and coached my boyfriend, he earns $300k/year and my top earnings have been $170k. I don't whine and complain about identity politics - It's not what I came to work for, and quite frankly I don't appreciate having these issues shoved down my throat. I deactivated IG, Fbook, etc about 7 years ago. So....as you can imagine, I would prefer to manage my thoughts and feelings without someone else telling me how I SHOULD feel about said topic. Especially at work. 

I really don't know what to say about the shit show that is Tech, but I need to get back to work. Any advice would be great! 

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Whistleblower + DE&I shit show. Sabbatical needed for recovery. Please help me explain gaps in resume without getting into the details**. **I'm frustrated because I continue to get placed on DE&I teams for developing reps. Despite my experience, awards I've won, etc. I've won 2 Sales awards in my career, named influential person to know at company, etc.** ",FemmesNoires,1,1.0,0,1708377585,2024-02-19 21:19:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1auz0w9/how_to_explain_career_breaktenure/,2,2024
1auyym0,Medical Technologist Careers,"I am 50 years old and a former elementary teacher. I stopped teaching to provide full time caregiving to my mom with dementia.  I have massive caregiver burnout after spending most of my life taking care of people and now being the only family member caring for my mom. Since my life is basically on pause, I’d like to go back to school to prepare me to reenter the workforce in a different career when I’m able to do so. I have tons of time but have to stay near my mom’s house to attend classes (Western South Dakota). 

I’m thinking about medical technology jobs, because I’ve always been interested in biology and medical sciences. I also like being able to sit and examine things and think I’d be good at a job where I work on the back end in medicine, examining and helping with logistics.  I’m good with technology and understanding science pretty deeply. I’m very much a natural literacy thinker and math is harder for me to learn. What is the outlook for jobs like radiology tech or lab tech anyone have tips on getting the best training and getting a job in these areas? Are there other similar career paths you’d recommend?

1auwzz8,How do I address being expected to apply internally for a position I'm extremely over-qualified for?,"I have been working at a mid-sized nonprofit for almost 5 years, and have almost 7 years of relevant experience. Over the last three years, I've been denied title increases or promotions because there wasn't an existing role for me to promote into and they haven't been creating new roles/titles because of budget freezes. (l'm familiar with our budgets because of my current position, and I know that this is completely legitimate.) That said, my performance reviews are always outstanding, and I always receive the highest annual raise available.

My manager recently left, and there has been a very clear expectation that I would apply for that position once it’s officially open. (I've already been looped in to department leadership meetings, asked to make larger scale decisions and generally take on the senior manager role in the interim.)

They listed the position on Friday, but it's a lower position than expected (manager rather than senior manager), and the qualifications required are less than what was required for my CURRENT position five years ago.

I've stuck it out here for so long without a promotion because it was easy to make excuses for them - and I unfortunately buy in to the ""it's a calling"" line that nonprofits love to use disturbingly easily, especially because I really do care deeply about the work we do. I'd like to stay at this organization, but I am, frankly, insulted. (Why in the world do they think I should waste my time and energy going through and entire application process to apply for an internal ""promotion"" that I'm so over-qualified for when I could use marginally more effort to just get a better job elsewhere?)

To be clear: they are doing away with an existing position and replacing it with a lower title and salary, while also apparently expecting all of the responsibilities to stay the same.

How can I address this? I want to give them a chance to correct what I see as an unforced error, but I'm also officially looking for employment elsewhere now because fuck this shit lol",blaarth,1,1.0,1,1708372931,2024-02-19 20:02:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1auwzz8/how_do_i_address_being_expected_to_apply/,2,2024

For instance:

I worked in a warehouse setting. I did multiple things, but sometimes I operated a forklift. Should I just say forklift operator? Or  should I list “operated forklift, did minor maintenance of warehouse, unloaded pallets, etc….”?

1auw0qh,Accepting two job offers (contingent on background check) at the same time because of criminal record?," Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this. Anyways, about 1.5 yrs ago, I was arrested for DWAI (similar to DUI but slightly lesser charge as I was just below .08 BAC). I live in a state that considers this a criminal misdemeanor and is not able to ever be sealed or expunged. I took probation seriously and got off early in 08/2023. I should also mention that I thankfully never lost my drivers license so transportation is not an issue.

This is my first time job hunting since I was arrested and charged, and have two non-driving related job offers that are contingent on background checks. My first choice job  knows about my DWAI since I told the HR person for the sake of transparency while I was signing the background check forms and she said that DWAI should not be a problem. I'm currently waiting for my background check to clear for that job, but I kind of want to start onboarding process for 2nd choice job since I'm becoming increasingly anxious that first job offer will fall for some reason. I'm not even sure why I'm anxious about it but I am. I just don't feel comfortable turning down the 2nd choice job without an official job offer and start date from first job if that makes sense. I'm also nervous about what to say to 2nd choice job when I've started onboarding process for them but then get official job offer for 1st choice job?

1auu97o,"25, Please help future me","Hello first post in here. 25 years old, just looking for some advice moving forward for my future. Sorry for the long post! 

Background

• Decent sized town in Ohio so I don’t have access to corporate America like a big city does. 

• I was a smart kid in high-school and I have completed some college but it wasn't for me and I don't plan on ever going back. Nothing against it but I paid off my student loans and I'm moving on.

• While at school my (now wife) girlfriend and I put together a plan. Both get jols and start saving as much as we can so we can put together a big down payment on a house as a head start for a home.

• I have worked at a local car dealership in finance for the past 5 years, I knew this wasn't going to be my forever job but it was the best option for me to make a good amount of money at my age with out a degree. My wife got a remote managing job.

• We stuck to our plan, saved a lot of money, traveled a lot, and most importantly got married! We were lucky enough that my grandparents let us live with them so we haven't had any bills but car payments and small stuff (Netflix, etc.)


Today

• We have 150k in savings, 15k in 401k, no debt, no credit cards (both have established great credit with past car loans) no car payments either (we purchased nice but used vehicles cash, as long as it's safe we don't really care what we drive)

• I make around 90-110k a year (100% commission so it fluctuates) and my wife makes 40k salary.

• We are building a new home that is going to be an around 450k and we are planning on putting 100k down and keeping 50k in savings. 

Financial Advice

• I know the smart thing to do would be to buy a rental property or 2 and live in one, I know some people rent half and live with roommates, etc. The problem is we lived with parents for 5 years now and we really want to start our life. A nice home is something that is important to us so there is really no negotiating that. We were lucky enough to purchase a piece of land in our dream neighborhood that is in between both parents.

Career

• I have always been an entrepreneur at heart. I knew when I started this job it's way too risky for me long term. I don't  want to raise a family off of a strictly commission only job. I love people but I don't love my job, I really want to start a career that I am proud of, and build something on my own. 

• I know my options without a degree are limited but after some research l've stumbled upon the Insurance industry. I looked into being an agent under a company or starting your own independent agency. I like the idea of being an agent and having the backing a big company (ex. Statefarm). It seems like a good fit, I can be my own boss, manage a team, make great money, and most importantly stay involved with my community and town.

• I have been studying every night for my 2 Licenses that I need in order to pursue an opportunity. Again, the main thing is that I am enjoying learning about insurance.

Advice 

• Am I on the right track? What careers should I be considering? I don’t mind working from home but I also like a brick and mortar job. Again, I’m just looking for something that is safer and something I will enjoy. 

• Does anyone in here work in the insurance field and do they recommend?

I am not bragging in anyway, I know I’m a very small fish in a very big pond. It was cringy enough to post this but from what I’ve read on here people give pretty good advice.",zoeytheseal,1,1.0,2,1708366596,2024-02-19 18:16:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1auu97o/25_please_help_future_me/,2,2024
1auu8i7,How to apply internally at your company without burning bridges?,"So I've been at my current position just over a year. I'm in a medium sized company (1000+) at which I like my salary, benefits, work life balance etc, but some of the people in my team are straight up toxic and/or enablers. So I've been looking at either leaving the company or making a lateral move.

The recruiter for a position I found internally is actually the same I had for my current position. He probably doesn't remember me, but I'm sure it being internal would help my chances, especially since this position has been reposted time and again. I guess my main worry is if my manager and/or team caught wind of this. Should I let my manager know I'm applying to other internal positions? Or keep it under wraps, only communicating to those the new position is tied to? I don't want to burn any bridges, I just know the current team I'm on isn't my ""dream job"", whereas if I stayed in my current industry I feel the new position would align with me better.

This job has provided me with a stable income and I have managed to help my parents out. I’m just wondering if I quit this job will my mental health spiral out of control or should I stay here and just try to force myself to manage it?

I look around and see how the people are so much older than me and I can’t believe they have worked here for years and I’m struggling just one year in. Is it a GEN Z thing i don’t even know? I feel like I’m waisting my life.

My company is basically dancing around my request and has been for weeks now. I can’t get a straight answer and it’s pretty obvious that it’s likely a no. They keep saying that it is “in discussion” but it’s been almost a month…

It sucks because I truly love what I do and who I work with, but I am severely underpaid. Should I keep talking to them about it, or just start to look elsewhere?

I asked why he called from a blocked number, he said it’s because he gets threats. I kept questioning him, he then said he went out to my address already, but this address is one I haven’t lived at for over 10 years. My address is updated on my voter registration and I have filed taxes under my current address. He would have the correct address if he was legit right? He also said he would go out to a family member’s address, he then proceeded to name the name of my grandfather’s brother. I told him I didn’t know who that was and hung up.

Of course like a typical other university students I applied for this role to grow my career by starting to network. I am not the brightest in my cohort, my grades are just at the average mark so I know to get a good grad role I need to build experiences, extra-circulars and networking.   


I wanted to ask for those who have experience in the corporate world and in particular banking - how to network within the bank. Like is it weird to find people on linkedin in teams or positions I am interested with and ask for advice online or over a coffee? Also is it okay to let my manager know I am looking to grow my career within the bank and looking for roles that suit my degree better. The bank I work at is known to invest and upskill their employees - I have heard that they let univeristy students students shadow positions they are interested in, is this true? and if so can I let my manager know that I am interested in such arrangements. Also if there are positions open within the bank and I wish to apply, do I let my manager know and what should I say?   


I wanted to ask that if I want to apply to internships and other roles, should I message the hiring manager trying to reach out and introduce myself? Also, is it odd if as a university student with no connections that I messaged people in roles/industries/companies I want to join asking for advice on how to get into the role they currently have?",ur_sweetpotato,1,1.0,0,1708358348,2024-02-19 15:59:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1auqowf/how_to_growth_my_career_by_networking_please_give/,2,2024
1auppsn,How badly does staying with an employer for a short time look?,"Aspiring accountant currently working in a bank's call centre here.

I only started the job in October last year, and as of this week I have been trained to do more complex calls than I did before (not to say my new role is hard, my last role began and ended at greeting the customer and then transferring them to the right department). I won't lie I am not enjoying the job at all, each shift is 5-8 hours of stress coursing through me, but the small amount of hours per week plus the option to do most shifts from home makes it fit around my uni timetable nicely.

However, I might be looking at an opportunity to get employed by an accountancy firm. I don't know all the details of the role yet, and for all I know I might not be able to do it alongside uni, but I wanted to set my expectations nice and early. I reckon I would prefer this job to my current one, as it is both more relevant to what I want to do in the future and doesn't involve sitting in my bedroom all day getting yelled at by strangers (I am one of those weirdos that prefers to come into the office, but my new office is over an hour away so I won't be able to make it most days). 

But I can't shake the idea that it will look bad to leave after just 5 months and almost immediately after I got trained/accredited to perform my new role.

1auobdw,"""Better Jobs"" Program in Ontario (formerly Second Career)","Hello,

I am eligible for a funding program in my province called Better Jobs. This funds a one year certificate (or similar certification) for people who need a career change.

I am 35 and female. I have a varied work history. Ive done some preliminary research/reading on some of my options. But I did not finish a degree so there is a part of me that is very skeptical that a one year certificate is really worth while. 

Anyway if anyone can tell me if any of the following one yr (or apprenticeships) will actually get me a good paying job? I have a feeling that I will be competing with people who have degrees and diplomas so it isnt worth the time or energy.

1yr college certificates:
-Digital marketing
-Travel and tourism
-Graphic design
-Web development - full stack?
-App development
-UX design
-Book keeping

-Realtor
-Payroll admin
-Events mgmt
-Business admin
-DevOps
-Information technology
-Dental asistant
-Tax preparation
-HR manager

And some of the trades I would consider:
Automotive repair, plumbing, welding, electrician.

The first list are more to my preference/interests. The second list seems more practical and the 3rd lists are trades that I could probably do but wouldn't stay in forever, they would just be a means to an end.

1aunork,Salary dispute (do I have a case??),"I work for a rather large company. I (27F) worked for the company in an assistant position for a year and a half before I was promoted to being a manager. At the same time, my counterpart (male, same age range) was hired at the same management level, same job description, same responsibilities, same market. Exact same job. We work closely together every day. When the company hired me, they offered me a specific salary and I was elated, because I was going from making $15 an hour to a very good salary. I accepted and was very glad they recognized my competence and trusted me with the job.
Soon after we were hired, my counterpart emailed me a lot of his onboarding paperwork so I could print it for him so he could scan it and send it in (he didn't have a printer in his office yet). So I did so and didn't bother to open or look at any of it. Months later, I was looking through my inbox to find something to talk unrelated when I found his offer letter that he had emailed to me. I opened it and saw that they offered him $5,000 more than me starting out.
He and I don't have any difference in education and skill. I have management experience but in a different industry, he just has more experience in our general industry. Not in the specific area we are both in. (we are in sales). Shortly thereatter, he asked me to help him with filling out his bonus sheet where you have to input your salary. He asked me when he was doing it, ""We make the same salary, right?"" He asked thinking they might pay me more since I had been at the company longer. I lied and said yes to avoid an uncomfortable conversation. After this, l emailed our direct superior and requested a salary match.
I laid out the numbers for her regarding my (excellent) performance and she denied the request, stating that she would reevaluate it on my one year anniversary. That evaluation never happened. This past January, we WE required to complete self assessments and we did so and sent them off to our superior. I was made to recomplete mine 3 times because I submitted it in the incorrect format, but hilariously was never told what format to submit in. Submitted it in person handwritten and it was accepted by her, then she emailed me a week later to tell me it needed to be digital so l sent it as a PDF, then several days later she emailed me to say it needed to be in Word. So I resubmitted it 3 different times. My counterpart got his evaluation back pretty quickly, complete with glowing commentary from our superior, multiple comments about what a great employee he is, how well he manages his clients, etc etc. and he was offered a substantial increase. (Almost the max of what the company offers)
Much later, I received about a 3 sentence email from our superior that offered me the lowest increase that the company offers, and that was it. I didn't receive my assessment back. I didn't receive any commentary. l received no evaluation whatsoever. Keep in mind that my counterpart and I performed relatively equally. I doubled or tripled my monthly goals every month. I knocked it out of the park. And I wasn't even worth an evaluation to her.
She has called my counterpart to tell him that she misses him and how well he's doing, she has told him he's already being considered for a position at the new location we're building in the city he and I work in, and he received a glowing evaluation of his performance even though my performance was excellent as well. But I literally never even received an evaluation before I was offered the lowest increase possible and basically told to shut up and go away.
I sent a formal letter back (attached to email) stating that this was unsatisfactory based on multiple factors, both of being hired at the same time and same management level first and foremost, and the increase they offered me not being reflective of a merit increase at all. I stated that this would now be my second official request for a salary match to my counterpart, and also a merit increase.
I received an email back that basically stated ""we have a diverse workforce. Your counterpart was hired based on experience. We will revise and see if there is anything we can do""
I emailed back stating again that we were hired at the same management level with the same responsibilities, roles, and expectations, so we should be paid equally as we are expected to do the same work. I made a point to mention in both emails that I never received an evaluation, yet my counterpart received his with detailed commentary. I want her to realize her error and how inappropriate it was that I didn't even get evaluated.
I haven't received a reply to that. They gave me a date that I'll hear back, so I am waiting now.
She said she will need to discuss with my property level manager, so l emailed him another letter. In this I detailed the exact same information, but added that I believe our superior is acting with preferential treatment and that I am prepared to escalate the situation to HR if our pay disparity isn't resolved. He hasn't forwarded this letter on to my superior yet, at my request. I want to give them chance to resolve it before I burn any bridges with the HR avenue.
Mv question is this: do I have a case here??? If more details are needed I can provide. I'll just say this - I brought in almost 40% of our total revenue for the year.
And for some reason I wasn't worth an evaluation, I'm not worth being paid equally, and I'm not worth a merit increase. Yet my counterpart is being treated entirely differently.

1aumw4s,How do I talk to my manager about my irregular shifts affecting my sleep and life quality?,"As much as ""crazy shifts"" does not sound very corporate, a weekly excuse sounding like ""Sorry about that, we will soon bring somebody new'"", etc is very common as they say we don't have enough employees and somebody needs to do all kinds of shifts and thats me, even though that is not what was agreed in the interviews. Basically I started this job in November and it's a good job with decent pay and I work from home. From the beginning though, I was told I'll just need to take some of the late shifts and then when we hire more people everything will adjust. In my work interview I said I prefer not to do night shifts.

All my life I've been trying to escape the horrible cycle of night shift life, I've worked at bars and all my life I am struggling with sleep and insomnia. The first month or two I was ""taking one for the team"" meaning lets say I work from 6pm do 3am Monday till Wednesday, I'm off Thursday Friday and then I work night shift Saturday and Sunday. Then, lets say next week I do Monday and Tuesday off, Wednesday I work 3pm-11pm and then Thursday I am 9-5 and then I do night shifts again Saturday and Sunday and so on. 

The possibilities are endless. The issue is that it is not a constant pattern I can follow and I am starting to feel really bad and I am again struggling a lot with my sleep, my sleep pattern is basically non existent and it is also taking a toll on my mental health. I am starting to really struggle to fall asleep and wake up, I have a constant headache and I cannot have a rejime like a regular person. 

Unfortunately they keep telling me ""this is temporary"". Obviously I'm a new employee, and even though I am doing a good job I feel like it's too early for me to complain if that makes sense. This week they gave me my new schedule 3 hours before my assigned shift and did not say anything. 

Please give me a smart and corporate way to say that I AM willing to take one for the team but unfortunately it's been 3 months at this point of erratic shifts and I would like my shifts to allow me a healthy sleep pattern and to function like a normal human being without sounding like I complain, I just want to make a simple request (my company literally works with health and wellness, make it make sense).

Wish me luck guys that I can soon have more regular and normal shifts and please give your suggestions down below.

1aumpjm,"I cannot stand office jobs / being a ""wagie""","Hello everyone,

I am turning 24 this year and I am working since the age of 16. To clarify, I am **not** lazy or someone who ""doesn't want to work"" - I simply wanna find a job that makes me happy and that I still can have atleast some savings after paying rent.

When I finished school, I really wanted to do a traineeship (= literally translated) and my parents accepted it at some point even if they were strongly against it - but they literally forced me to become an office clerk since they did not like my plans for my own future (*""Office jobs are the best paying - and the future""*). My dream was to attend a vocational school in a dual education system that combines apprenticeships as a salesman in a company and vocational education, with the final goal to open my own store one day. So basically, I have a qualification that I never wanted and that prevents me to work jobs I would like.

Since 2016 I have worked various jobs in various countries, at different companies in the most different shifts and after all I have to say: I even prefer the hardest physical only-nightshift job I worked back in 2022 than an any office job!

I am not born to work in offices, office jobs are far away from my interests and actual skills. I cannot identify myself with the ""office culture"" and the mentality of people within the business. Don't get me wrong, my co-workers are really nice and all, but it just isn't my world and it is giving me the feeling that I am worthless. This morning I felt so miserable and horribly frustrated that I got a headache and had to call in sick. I am planning to see a doctor today. Working 9 to 5 (as Americans would say) in an office feels to me like modern slavery, since I totally have no time for myself and I spend all day at a place I do not like, doing something that makes me unhappy only to be able to afford rent.

Since I have to pay rent, I cannot simply choose any job - since the salaries in my countries are a joke - so this is literally the only reason why I am not quitting.

What should I do? I consider myself a very happy person, but if I continue doing jobs like this, I will go insane at some point.",SibirskiZec,1,0.4300000071525574,3,1708347593,2024-02-19 12:59:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aumpjm/i_cannot_stand_office_jobs_being_a_wagie/,2,2024

1aum02o,Dilemma between two similar jobs - travel or no travel - which is better ? ,"I work in a regional role that requires me to stay in hotels anywhere between 12-20 days. Additionally, I am traveling 80 hours per month. Due to all of this, my health has worsened and I have absolutely no social life, and being away from family so much makes me question my life. However, I have spent 14 months at this organisation and they really gave me a good opportunity when they offered me this role. Professional development has been good and I learnt a lot of technical stuff, but most importantly I learnt behavioural skills like persuasion and people management, which will surely help me in life. Overall the culture is good and friendly. My manager is also nice. 

However, I have a new job offer that pays more and does not require me to travel at all. I will be able to rent a place at walking distance, and will have enough time to socialise, exercise, eat home-cooked food and bunch of other activities essential for a healthy life. It will be a role of responsibility and the organisation has a better standing in the industry. It will be good for my career for sure. 

I know the second job is better, but I have a feeling of a moral dilemma. I knew before joining this current role that I would be required to travel 10-14 days, and I have given my best in the past 14 months, really pushed myself to the limit, but is it still a good reason to leave? My health and personal life have taken a backseat, and I don’t want to wake up one day regretting my choices. More importantly, I am close with my team and I don’t want it to come across as a stab in the back, that I decided to leave within 15 months. 

Should I stay or should I take up the new role ?

1aulw8g,Golden handcuffs and family dependance keep me locked in ,"I'm an expecting father and breadwinner in my home. My wife is pregnant with what will be my first child, and currently supplements our income with a solid work from home job. We live fairly comfortably, pulled OT and buckled down on expenses and paid off mountains of debt. Now we only have a mortgage to worry about. I understand there are people in worse scenarios than me.

My issue is I hate my job, and I realize slowly that I hate my career... but I am extremely good at what I do. I have been promoted, keep getting accolades and bonuses, and more and more responsibility. This is slowly piling on so much stress that I find my self losing my temper and snapping at even a tiny inconvenience, everytime someone addresses me or says my name my first thought is ""oh god wtf now???"". My job is a an entire dump, with hundreds of dumpster fires all happening at once, and three poorly trained people to manage it all. Management keeps piling on more tasks with fewer people every week and are never satisfied. With every failure comes more paperwork about said failure, which removes me from being able to work on the things that are failing, meaning more things fail and require more paperwork. Somehow I have perfected a way I of managing the chaos and thriving in it, which is why I am liked by management in my company.

I want desperately to do the childhood dream of pursuing passion projects or careers in a different field, but where I am at now ANY job move would be a huge blow to our income, and with a wife soon going stay-at-home mom and a child on the way I cant afford to throw away everything for just my own happiness. I truly understand the meaning of golden handcuffs now, when I was younger I really thought good paying careers would solve so many problems.

I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice, and I know this sounds like a ""oh poor me getting a stable income, boo hoo""... but I was wondering if anyone else has had or is having a similar situation, and how was it affecting them.

TLDR: hate my job, want to quit, family depends on me, no other job opportunities",Metallicis,4,0.8399999737739563,3,1708344886,2024-02-19 12:14:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aulw8g/golden_handcuffs_and_family_dependance_keep_me/,2,2024

1auklx9,Very depressed and anxious at new job ,"I worked at the same job in a family office for 5 years and couldn’t do it anymore so I got a job in a new industry. I was pretty frustrated and told myself literally everyday that I was done and needed to move. 

The first two days were great and this is something I’ve waited like years to get into. I was really into it and had a great mindset. However, day 3 I started having somewhat panic attacks at the job and was making rash decisions (along the lines of writing a text to my manager saying I’m done, but not sending it) 

Now I came home for the weekend and relaxed and the whole time I’m thinking I got this, this is a great new job and I love telling people about it. 

But I still have this sinking feeling in my stomach sometimes and it gets worse at work. I am trying to do the 54321 grounding method. But are there any other practices that can help clear my mind and get through the work day without running out? 

At the end of the day I really like this job. But my brain has been hardwired into working with my family the last 5 years, and this new culture of the job is triggering a lot of anxiety and panic throughout my day. Even though it’s something I can completely handle.  

I have downloaded a bunch of podcasts to listen too while working so hopefully that helps. ",AdCurious7134,1,0.5,1,1708340079,2024-02-19 10:54:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1auklx9/very_depressed_and_anxious_at_new_job/,2,2024

1auj5f5,Desperate need of advice,"Background: 
I 22 (M) have been in love with technology and building things since I was a kid. I loved taking things apart and trying to put them back together, granted I didn't do a well job because I was a kid but I liked the concepts. Since middle school I was part of STEM programs because I loved challenging myself and the technology and building part of it fascinated me. 
Fast forward, during my senior year of high school I had to make a decision of what I wanted my major to be. My parents never have let me explore anything else and told me to study so I can get into a good school. I got accepted to multiple UCs and CSUs but when it came to picking them, my parents said I couldn't go to any of them and had to go to a community college. I was upset and decided to go to UC Berkeley as a biomedical engineer regardless.
I left after one semester because I felt lost and it was the beginning of the pandemic so everything was so complicated. It was a very hard major specially for someone with no biology background aside from basic chemistry. I went to a community college to try to find out what I wanted to do but my parents weren't okay with that. My dad stopped talking to me for months and my mom kept telling me ""I told you so"" because I struggled because I went against her word. 
I found business interesting at the time and started studying it but I didn't really like studying it but more so the concept of being independent. I felt like I made a mistake leaving engineering but out of fear of my parent's getting upset at me if I tried again but a different type of engineering I decided to explore a bit more and try to find something else. I landed on nursing.
Now: Nursing seemed like a promising career to make good money while also helping people. The money part mattered more because it would be easier to convince my parents to be okay with it. I do like helping people and I liked the classes of physiology, anatomy, and microbiology. Now being in nursing school I don't really like it anymore. I understand the material and although very complicated, I know that I could probably do better in my classes but I have no sense of drive to keep going. 
Throughout my entire nursing journey I kept feeling like I'm just doing it for my parents and not for myself. I constantly find myself watching videos of tech/engineering YouTubers and I just wish I could be making projects and building things. I'm scared of my parents because they have mentally abused me by controlling all aspects of my decision making. I am in my twenties and my curfew is 8pm and I am not allowed to go out more than once a week.
I don't have a clear mindset of what it is I really want to do because the only thing I can think of is what would my parents say or do if I switch and actually explore engineering or computer science? I feel biased making a decision so I feel lost but I really don't want to go through nursing. I would like to help people but I just don't think nursing might be the right choice seeing as to how my mental health has depleted rapidly since I started. I have been feeling very depressed every day and one of my classes literally is solely based on how to treat patients with depression and other mental health problems. I don't really have many people to confide in aside from my girlfriend but out of respect for my family she doesn't want to get too involved either.
I know this was long but could someone please provide me with some insight on how I could go about this?",Aggravating_Force275,1,1.0,0,1708334153,2024-02-19 09:15:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1auj5f5/desperate_need_of_advice/,2,2024

1auivmp,Where Do I Go From Here?,"I’m 22 years old as of 3 days ago, i’ve always had the dream of living lavish (as have most of us) but i dropped out of college my second year and picked up a job at a country club bartending..
I’ve managed to save about $25-26k in about 2 years of working there. I threw the majority of it into my apple high yield savings account which earns 4.50%. I plan to work at the country club for atleast another year, maybe two. I would like to have about $40-50k in my savings at that time.
I feel i do take a lot for granted though because i have most of my bills paid for by my father, and i live with my mother still. My total expenses in bills a month is roughly $250-300 per month. I have no idea how much longer i plan on living at home (especially because inflation) but i’d like to be out at 24-25. So my question now is, where do i go from here??

1auitu4,"How to unf*ck my life? Please share some wisdom, I need it so much","Me (21M) begging for your advice. I came to USA almost 3 years ago by myself (legally). I was studying at college for Computer Science, then I quit it and did 6 month Bootcamp. After finishing bootcamp I was applying for Frontend Developer jobs for 1 year. I had 500+ applications and 3 interviews and didn’t get an offer. While studying I was working delivering food Uber Eats - DoorDash. For almost 2 years I hadn’t spent time with my friends or family, I am alone in this country. All I did was studying and working 8+ hours every day.

After 1 year I decided to stop studying cause I was spending too much time, and decided to work more to pay debt that owe to my friends. Now delivery job is soo bad that I am barely making a living, also I am so tired after working every day for more than 2 years. After paying rent and food I am left with nothing. 

I decided to change something so I went to Indeed and looked at jobs. But all normal jobs required degrees. I applied for sales positions, got door to door sale job. I was doing good even sold some contracts on my first day, but since it is commission based I could not continue cause my bills were rising. Right now I am still doing a delivery full day everyday and barely making a living. I can’t go to college cause I won’t be able to pay now. I can’t even afford going out to interact with people cause I need to work everyday. Loneliness is killing me. Months are going by without me talking to single person except customers.

I never thought I would end up in this situation. I always imagined myself wearing good looking suits , wearing luxury watches , working with great people, working in Finance or Management or Investing , making decent money, and having beautiful family, traveling the world. But now I am on the edge of my life. I don’t know what am I doing or where am I going. If I will continue doing this , I may end up being homeless. I am depressed and having su*cidal thoughts. 

Please Reddit community share some piece of advice for my life. I want to take some direction and make a great career out of it. I am not afraid of working or studying. I can work 100+ hours per week if necessary. 
People say if you want to be successful ask advice from successful people, so I am asking you WHAT SHOULD I DO? Is there any chance that I can be successful, rich, have a wife and kids, and eventually happy? If yes HOW CAN I DO THAT?

1augw0f,Feeling Lost: From Doctor to Dreamer,"Hello Everyone,

I'm (M29) a Doctor (MBBS) and I just received a one-month notice period from my company.

I did my MBBS from Bengaluru and worked in hospitals for 2 years. It was tiring, and I felt like I was in a cage. Despite saving lives and contributing to society, I felt my own life was pretty hollow.

I have always been interested in filmmaking, acting, and creative writing. So, four years ago, I took a step and found a corporate healthcare firm in Mumbai that offered me a night shift job. I moved here to pursue my dreams. I did auditions in the morning, booked a few ads and some episodic serials, but work wasn't consistent. So, I started putting my films/content up on social media, and I got quite a good response. People started noticing me, but a year ago, my company shifted me to a day shift in a company Occupational Health Center (OHC).

I have a general shift (9-6), and it's far, so it completely drains me by the time I get back home, and I'm not able to create anything.

I'm aging, and I don't make enough money to provide for my family. My parents are confused and disappointed why I don't pursue higher education. I've been associated with a corporate healthcare firm for four years now, and I still work on contract. They don't give me health insurance, sick days, bonus, nothing. If I'm absent for one day, even for my sickness, I'll be docked pay. It's not just my company, but
doctors (MBBS) are being used and abused this way. This is the salary of a doctor in the present times. It's a noble profession and all that, but no, we'll give you respect but not money. Not just in corporate, even in hospitals, it's 7-8 LPA for a good MBBS doctor with 5+ years of experience. There's no growth. Not that I expect it. In my case, I just need it to sustain myself so I can make my films and act in my plays.
I even thought of setting up a clinic, but it's overcrowded with so many BAMS Doctors, and running a clinic needs a lot of time and effort because it's nothing less than a startup. 

I moved from the hospital to corporate because it's less stressful, and I'll get time to pursue my passion, but now it's all falling apart. Again I'm back to square one, feeling helpless and forced into circumstances. My parents are getting older, and although they don't say it, they do wonder why their son isn't pursuing higher education and devoting himself to the medical field

I'm from a middle-class family. I pay my bills, there are people dependent on me, and my salary has been stagnant at 7 LPA for six years, with 10-12 hours of working every day. I took up MBBS thinking I'd be able to provide a better lifestyle for my family, but I make less than an average corporate employee with one year of experience.

In all this, my dream to be an actor and filmmaker weeps in the corner.

In sharing my story, I hope to connect with others who may be facing similar struggles.
Thank you for taking the time to read my story. Your support and encouragement mean the world to me as I navigate this uncertain terrain.

1augsw5,Internal transfer 9 months at company? First job,"I'm currently at a company that I really want to continue to stay at, and this is my first job out of college. I interned here and came back full time and have been working for around 7 months. While I enjoy my job, it's really not at all in the sector that I'm interested in and I really doubt that long-term I will be able to grow in this sector, both because of the extreme stress inherent in it (average employee tenure is 1 year 6 months no joke) but also because my specific role is one that historically has been pretty stagnant as the company really doesn't value it as much as they do my coworkers roles. 

Now, I work adjacent to an employee in a department in my company that I am super interested in and it's ultimately what I wanted to do. She recently told me that she's moving to a different position, and that her team is looking to backfill her current position. I think I have a good shot at this position, but I'm really hesitant as to the timing of taking this. The role would begin in May, so I would be about 10 months of full-time work, 3 months internship experience at my current position. It's not a very big team, so the odds of another position opening in the next year are pretty low. From a stress point of view, it's much more manageable and I wouldn't be working 60+ hour weeks(weekends 3-4 hours a day and then weekdays 10 hour days) like I currently do. I want to do this job because it's a great precursor to a professional degree I'm interested in and would help me solidify my interest in that and gain experience before I go into crazy debt. And it would give me a bit of breathing room to start seriously looking at studying and applying for graduate school, which I really have no time to do right now.

I want to bring this up to my manager and explain that, while I really do enjoy my job, this opportunity has presented itself and I want to pursue it as an opportunity to stay with the company and contribute but be a part of a sector that I think is best for my growth. My concern is that it's too early, and that if I push on this, while I believe he'd be supportive, I'd either be letting people down in my old job or if I didn't get the position, I'd be coming back and it would look like I tried to jump ship too early. 

Do you have any advice here? What would you say to your manager?",Ok_Associate3212,2,1.0,0,1708324860,2024-02-19 06:41:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1augsw5/internal_transfer_9_months_at_company_first_job/,2,2024

I am a 20 year old about to transfer from community college to a university, pursuing a bachelors in business.

1aubhy8,"Kiss-Up Coworker Trying to Sabatoge Me with Our Boss, What Should I Do?","I posted this on another subreddit, but hoping I get some more comments on this one. (Using a throwaway account)

I started working at this company about 4 years  ago. When I started, I was working under a completely different boss who was there for the interim. After a few months, the official new boss (let's call him Moe) was hired and he started wanting to grow the team. I screened and interviewed this coworker (let's call him James) for Moe and he was hired. Moe didn't originally understand the work I used to do, and I was the SME for that subject area so no one ever went directly to Moe about any problems or concerns - they would come directly to me. Moe understood the work of James very well, though. 

After a couple more months, it became very clear to Moe that my contributions have been significant, and exceed James's. The team continued to grow and I think the dynamic of the team got more stable over time. We happily reported to Moe for the next 2 years until he recently left the company.

James and I were promoted and a replacement for Moe was not sought. James and I both now report to a different boss (let's call him Ross). Ever since the promotion, it feels like James has been trying to undermine/trivialize my work in front of the boss and other teams, particular when he thinks I am not present. Also, recently, the company decided against working from home. I have still been working from home more frequently than other peers because it is far more convenient for me. I understand that this is my mistake - I should be going to the office more regularly (i still go in at least 3 days a week, just not all 5 days), however, this has not resulted in any reduction in my work output, which still far exceeds James's. Ross recently stated in a staff meeting that everyone needs to come to work and stated one of the leaders in the team does not come in regularly enough (I am certain this is referring to me, though Ross has never lrovided this feedback to me directly before). Ross works at a different site, so someone would have to tell him I am not regularly coming into the office. I am certain none of my internal customers have complained about this to Ross, and I highly suspect it was James.

James spends most of his time in meetings that he doesn't lead, and doesn't have much that he can take full credit for. He seems to have taken his spare time to trying to diminish the perception of my contributions (for example, he recently failed to express the significance/importance of one of my team's key metrics to Ross when asked, despite James knowing the importance and me re-explaining it to James - Ross was led to believe that the metric is not important and we don't need to track it; I had to re-explain to Ross, after which Ross changed his mind and stated the metric, and the work my team does associated with it, is valuable).

Furthermore, James is a huge brown-noser. He volunteers for administrative tasks that no one else has time for, he purposely sucks up to Ross and arranges additional time to get his advice and input on things that he could figure out himself, etc. Ross seems to be responding positively and appears to hold James in high regard.

James and I were on friendly terms when we were under Moe, but it seems the dynamic has changed and he feels the only way to look better with Ross is to make me look worse...

1auaqq1,Thriving but sad,"I’m posting this out of a genuine need for advice despite feeling this will receive nothing but negativity. 

I got promoted last year. I only half wanted it - I didn’t realize how much responsibility it meant but felt pressure to advance or be irrelevant at my age (40). I manage a large team, but I just want to be an engineer with no direct reports. Although I’m not a great engineer. 

After being with this company for a few years, my RSUs are all vested and I’m hitting a cliff this year. 

My boss is climbing up the latter and has put me up for promotion - I have no idea if it will get me back to the total comp I’ve been living off of.

The company is a big one but in a downward spell and lots of problems are being uncovered. I could be the person who found the problems and fixed it, or the one who disappeared.

I’ve been interviewing with mixed success. The most promising prospect seems ok but they’re return to office and I’m remote only. 

What I really want to do is start my own company but I’ve tried (half heartedly) and failed. Plus I don’t have an idea that’s both good enough and realistic enough that I can execute on my own.

1aua3kv,Should I stay at my current job? What should I do?,"For context, I (28M) work as a Maintenance Service Technician for a Semiconductor production company in Austin TX. I've been in this position for almost two years. I'm not good with these kinds of posts so if it sounds rambly I'm sorry. 

I graduated college in 2018 with a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. My first job was toxic and I left after a year, ended up in the semiconductor industry soon after. I was on contract with one job for 18 months as a test technician before coming to my current company full time. I worked as an associate for roughly 14 months before interviewing for maintenance positions. I've been working in my current role for 2 years in June. 

The long and short of it is that lately I've been making a lot of mistakes. Enough to where people on days are saying that I shouldn't be working on toolsets anymore because of something that happened yesterday. I wasn't focused and I ended up breaking a fairly expensive part and possibly damaging another. I get that it's part of the job and things like this happen on occasion, but then I forgot an oring in an assembly later and that was also brought up. 

This is what happened recently. For the past couple months nothing major has really happened, but near the end of last year I ended up tripping two tools within 20 seconds of each other... I was lucky and nothing was scrapped but people did ask about it. It's enough to where people on other shifts are asking why I'm still here if I don't know how to do anything.

Someone from the team recently got laid off because he just refused to do anything. I already talked with my team about this, but I don't know what else to do. It's been a part of my whole life, I can't seem to understand and be consistent with small things. It's not that the small things are bad, but collectively it's adding up. I was having a good streak up until now, but I'm asking myself the question whether or not it's a good idea to stay here. I know how to do my job, and the best way I learn is when making mistakes. But here... I don't really know. I wanted to get promoted early on, now I just want to keep my head down to avoid criticism. Just do the job, keep my nose clean, and come in the next day. It started off as me wanting to learn and wanting to progress, now I just don't want to feel like I'm going to lose my job. It's a good job, great pay and benefits, but I don't know if I have the right mentality. 

Do I change industries? Do I look for a new job? What do I do? I like it here, and I know as long as I don't unnecessarily stick my neck out I'll be fine.

1au9obu,Is my boss trying to get rid of me?,"Hi everyone,  
I'm keen to hear your thoughts on the dynamics between my boss and me. My team has been one of the few standout performers across the organization over the last two years. We've successfully delivered some of the key strategic initiatives (projects and programs) with high ROI, which is a difficult thing to do in a large and complex environment.  
Up until a couple of months ago, my relationship with the boss had been great. However, that changed after I had a discussion with him regarding challenges and roadblocks that my team is currently struggling with. Some of these challenges are related to the political dynamics between our team and another. My intention was to unblock these issues by discussing them with him. This was part of a normal committee check-in process, and it certainly wasn't the first time I've had similar discussions with him in the past to help us unblock and move forward. It's a very common escalation process/pathway in the organization.  
Since that conversation, the vibe has changed drastically, and it feels very deliberate and shocking. He has embarrassed me, ridiculed some of my proposals and propositions forcefully in a number of meetings and forums. Additionally, he has downplayed the accomplishments of our team and has suddenly attempted to micromanage the team and me. Recently, I found out that he has tried to raise a job requisition for a similar role to mine and downgraded the budget for a role that I am hiring for.  
I am completely baffled by this sudden change in dynamics due to a single and perfectly normal conversation. I feel like his constant downplaying and ridicule could potentially damage my reputation in the organization in the long term and in the eyes of the C-Level.  


What do you think is happening here? If I decided to stay on, am I risking my reputations in the organisation? Is it better of I move on from this?

That big boom of tons of tech jobs seems done, but people still recommend it… Why? Is no one noticing it’s becoming less streamlined and less likely to actually be able to do anything with it?

I don’t want to do nursing, I know there’s lots of openings but the medical field isn’t for me unless it was psychology related and I notice that degrees in psychology don’t do anything anymore from over-saturation as well.

1au32bg,Work-life balance vs work-life interest? Potential career path change,"

I have been contemplating my job for a while now but not sure if I am just young and naive. It preface, I’m only 22 y/o and just graduated from college about a year ago. I studied finance and real estate.

I ended up getting an internship last summer and now work full time as an underwriter for an insurance company. I get paid well with a $60K salary. They have great benefits and great PTO / work-life balance ideology. Going in I was unsure about how I would like the job. I studied finance because I like money and I am good with numbers. However, the office is not not really the scene for me I don’t think. I don’t like small talk, I get bored at my desk, and everyday feels the same. My job involves a ton of emails and phone calls to external partners - which is not my strong suit nor my favorite. 

I tried hard in school and I try at work as well. I do good and am recognized for my work. I do not like to fail. I think this has led to some burnout. I have a social life and hobbies. I live with my long time s/o and am happy with that situation. We have simple dreams of privacy and peace. We are not materialistic - not any more than the average American lol. At the same time I am constantly stressing about the work that is waiting for me upon my return to work.

I just feel unfulfilled in a way. My job feels boring and does not seem to match my personality well. I am relative pessimistic. This is mainly because while in college I began to understand that the US really is a “system”. This led to no interest in the corporate ladder and a desire to not be a part of the problem. The happy go lucky business man is not the person I want to be. 

In a nutshell, I have been thinking about a job change to something completely different. I want to work w my hands more and have some passion for my work. This would likely come w a pay decrease, which I can accept and afford. However, this would likely alter my career path significantly. In addition, I don’t want my 20s to be lived like I’m 40. I want to be young while I can and live a little more freely. My main fear is 10 years down the road I could be stuck on a dead end job but have the desire for growth. 

There is no direct question really but looking for any advice. Am I just young and thinking in the moment? Is this selfish? Has anyone had similar experiences and how did you handled them? What was the long term effects?",obiwanboloni,2,1.0,1,1708286054,2024-02-18 19:54:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1au32bg/worklife_balance_vs_worklife_interest_potential/,2,2024

1au2kf8,Nervous about potential contract positions,"Throwaway as I've had bad experiences with posting on Reddit about potential job directions.  
  
Anyways, I'm thirty and currently employed as an assistant editor at a relatively well known entertainment company, making $44k a year in a high COL city *after* my company did an internal wage audit. My company is in a really bad financial state. Aside from the layoffs in the entertainment industry in general, there's been high anxiety because our parent company has been laying off tons of people in a tangentially related industry to us. It's turned into a very high stress situation where we're underpaid and overworked (though of course, that's not particularly uncommon). However, I've decided that I need to get out of dodge because the financial desperation in my company is getting extra worrisome and I fear we'll be closing soon. Extra info: have an M.A. in English, am miraculously debt-free, and currently have about a low N3 in Japanese.  
  
I'm rather confident I'll be getting two job offers. Both, unfortunately, contract positions.  
  
**Job A:** Big resume booster with editoral at a major game company--pretty cool, tbh. Pay's still not great for the area, around $28/hr for an eleven month contract where I'll have to take two months off. Certainly better than what I'm making, but that two months off and the current state of the video game industry is rather nerve wracking. However, like I mentioned--it's a big company, and I feel like putting it on my resume *could* open doors *if* I get to stick around for a couple contracts. This company also does hire from their contractors rather often.  
  
**Job B:** JET Program. Pay's relatively shit (especially with the yen), but depending on where I am, COL is way better (for reference, I was accepted previously and had to turn it down after placement due to some family health issues and my rent was going to be 50,000 yen). Contracts are up to five years and are notoriously hard to get fired from, and I plan to take that time to try and get my Japanese to an N1. This *could* open up some more doors in editorial and bilingual editors tend to make more, but also given my MA, I can try to also enter the (also competitive) university job market in Japan and make more money. However, JET's still a dead-end job with a set end date.  
  
Both job ideas sound cool, but I'm in such a rut at the moment that I don't know which is smarter to take, or if taking neither would be the best option. I've been applying far and wide, but there's just no other bites. I feel lucky that I *have* a job despite being miserable, but I need to get out.",Winter_Stick7458,1,1.0,0,1708284818,2024-02-18 19:33:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1au2kf8/nervous_about_potential_contract_positions/,2,2024
1au2anb,Seeking Advice on Balancing Vacation Plans and New Job Transition,"Hi,

I am seeking advice regarding a situation I find myself in. Recently, I received a verbal job offer, and after a round of negotiations, I have accepted it. A condition of this offer is that I am required to start right when I had a pre-planned vacation scheduled, and unfortunately, this was non-negotiable.  
  
Now, I'm faced with a dilemma. I have the option to change my vacation dates, but doing so would incur an additional cost of $1,500 to change my flights. Moreover, I would need to offboard from my current company during my vacation, potentially adding stress to an otherwise relaxing time. This decision poses a trade-off between having a more relaxed pre-job transition period and the added expense and stress of altering my vacation plans.  
  
On one hand, I am contemplating giving up my vacation plans to ensure a smoother and less hectic transition into the new role. On the other hand, I'm considering embracing the opportunity to YOLO a bit, spend the extra money to travel and enjoy a break before diving into my new job. The catch is that this might make my vacation a bit frenzied, given the need to offboard from my current company during that time.

Additionally, I am thinking that the extra money spent on changing my vacation plans could contribute to my savings goals, particularly towards buying a home. Furthermore, I am considering the possibility of postponing personal travel for a year and using that time to travel with my parents instead.   
  
Considering these additional circumstances, I would appreciate your insights and advice on whether it makes more sense to prioritize a more relaxed pre-job period and save money, or to seize the opportunity to travel now, knowing that it might be a while before I can do so again (at least six months to a year). 

  
Thank you in advance for taking the time to share your thoughts. ",kdizzles84,1,1.0,0,1708284180,2024-02-18 19:23:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1au2anb/seeking_advice_on_balancing_vacation_plans_and/,2,2024
1au250d,Traveling for work as an Interpreter,"Hi!

I'm (23,F) working as an in-house interpreter for almost a year now. 

Recently, my company has launched a program to regularly send some employees to the headquarter (in another country, 6-hour-flight) for a week. The goal of this business trip is to strengthen the relationship between headquarter employees and the local employees. They will send some employees  + an interpreter since it's more convenient for both side if there's someone translating for them.
 
My concern is, as an interpreter, when participating in these business trips, I feel extremely exhausted. Beside translating in meetings in my 9-5, I also have to translate at my lunch time and after work when they go out for dinner and drinking for the whole week. Even though there is business trip fee, I don't really think it's worth my health both physically and mentally.

I wonder if any interpreter has the same concern as me and how you guys deal with it. Is it OK to refuse going these trips (not stated in my contract)?

Currently my girlfriend and I are living with my parents, but due to my dad losing his job they are selling the house. Up until the beginning of the year I was in school. My mom is a professor and I got free tuition, but she had to switch jobs, so I have to quit. Now I'm going back into the job world and am struggling to find a job.  
I could use help in a couple ways:  
1. Where should I apply? I've been using indeed and other sites like it to find jobs. If I can find the company email or website I apply there instead of indeed. I've gotten past the phone interview to the in person interview at some places, but haven't got any offers.  
   2. Resume help. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/wiBgc6e) is my resume. Does it look okay? Is there another sub that I should be posting in instead?  
Another problem my girlfriend and I have is we only have one car. We live in rural Minnesota, about an hour west of the cities, so there's very few places within walking or biking distance. Is there any places you guys think would hire us both? If we can carpool we can save a lot. We've also been recommended instacart, but would it be worth it with one car? Is there any advantage to having two people doing it at once?

1au0t85,[UPDATE] Feeling guilty resigning just well within a year with a nice company,"Hey guys! So almost a couple of weeks ago, I have made a [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/s/9f0mTw12xt) asking for advice in considering to quit after a year at which I think is already the best and most flexible company I’ve worked for which it does make me feel guilty about it. 

Figured I should post an update since the comments and DMs have all been so insightful and definitely would help people in the same situation as me. 

[UPDATE] After carefully considering, I’ve decided to tell my CEO about the situation. He asked me if I am open for a counter offer which i said “Sure, I am open as I do want to stay in the company. It’s just that the financial offer of this other company is hard to pass.” So he asked me to send him the current offer (the exact offer letter mind you..) and he’ll discuss with the other partners. 

At the moment I didn’t find it weird actually, I said I will send it right after I get the copy again from but I realised it will be a mistake to share the details as it is confidential and will open an opportunity to “sabotage” my offer. 

So I went back to him and said I won’t share the details and will only provide you the numbers of the offer which I did. It took him a while to respond back but ultimately just stated that it seems I have already made a decision and won’t provide a counteroffer and will just discuss the off boarding with me this coming week. 

I found it weird with the sudden change of mind but I didn’t bother. I feel no regrets after the confrontation. So in the end, I’ve accepted the offer and signed the contract with the new company. Already preparing a transition plan with my colleagues and clients as I do want to make sure I will leave everything smoothly.

Financially and professionally, I do think this is a smart move for me.

So that’s it I guess, I wanted to say thank you all for the people here who gave such insightful views on both sides and indeed helped me come up with a decision. 

TL;DR - I’ve decided to take the offer (well almost 70% increase). Discussed the opportunity with my CEO. He wanted to provide a counteroffer and soon right after I gave him the numbers, he stated only “It seems that you have made a decision already. Let’s discuss the offboarding next week.”",AnnualJobHopper,3,1.0,3,1708280592,2024-02-18 18:23:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1au0t85/update_feeling_guilty_resigning_just_well_within/,2,2024

My portfolio is catered for EU companies and the US recruiters informed me of all the changes I need to make. Nothing major but definitely a few months of work. I feel incredibly lost and defeated. Not only are there much less design jobs in the US but they also do not value the creativity I was taught here in the EU. They just want to monetize it and strip it of anything interesting. I worked all throughout university as a freelancer and product consultant and have completed internships at top tier companies but now that I apply for jobs in the US they seem to not care. They just want to see I can do the most basic and rudimentary tasks. For example I saw the portfolio of someone who was given a job over myself after we both had three interviews. Her history and portfolio were a completely slap to my face (because they are not advanced at all) but I see why they hired her. She is like a robot who knows the commercial things and that’s that..

1atzdfb,Underqualified for job - feel the pressure to perform or get fired in the near future,"Hello,

  I took a a new job a couple months ago and am feel vastly underqualified and unable to perform my job.

I was a supply chain coordination manager for a large company for a few years and was highly successful in my role.  I was able to do purchasing, cost analysis, inventory coordination, etc. and valued by many people and teams in a large company.  I liked my job but felt I could make more elsewhere.

One of my old bosses, who I like a lot and is a very nice person, went on to a much smaller company.  They let me know it was going great and that there may be a potential opening.  I was excited as it sounded like it aligned with what I had been doing and would pay more money.  The interview went well, I started, the senior managers were all very excited for my potential to contribute.

Flash forward a few weeks later and I am beyond overwhelmed and absolutely sick to my stomach.  I am not able to perform the way I did at my old job because we completely lack software that would get me visibility into inventory, pricing, analytics, etc.  I have been told to ""figure it out"" and ""don't fuck up"".  We don't have an IT team or engineering team or anything to provide me with assistance with software or information.  I have no tools to succeed and the smaller company has been managing most of their processes through ""feel"" and some rudimentary spreadsheets.  I am getting put into meetings with senior managers where they are asking for my advice and I basically shrug and look like an absolute fool multiple times a day.  I can tell they are disappointed in me as a hire.

I have an onboarding plan but it is massively ambitious.  I need to pull complex processes out of thin air and I have absolutely no clue how I would even go about it.  Everywhere I have ever worked before this has had some degree or structure or plan or software.

I am sick to my stomach and want to quit and try to find something quickly to just smooth this over on my resume and leave it off.  I cannot envision a path where I am able to succeed here.  My spouse advised that I talk to my boss who hired me.  I can express my concerns but even if they are nice about it and tell me ""take your time to learn"" the senior managers about my boss have already expressed displeasure in my performance and, as someone who has witnessed hundreds of people be fired in my life, I feel like the writing is on the wall.

I am going to talk to my boss but I am afraid they are going to tell me to execute the onboarding plan and if I can't I should resign or face termination.

Obviously there is some wisdom in just showing up for another couple months until I get terminated and then I could collect unemployment but the idea of having to do this everyday makes me sick to my stomach.

1atythz,Help with Getting Interviews,"Hi!

I, like many of you, am in the grueling process of job hunting. I am having a hell of a time getting any footing with my resume (I'm talking 2 interviews out of 200+ applications). I have paid 3 separate career advisors to help me figure out what I'm doing wrong, but they've all given me the same advice and it just isn't working. 

I'll give some details below, but if you don't want to read a novel, my main question is this: *who do I need to speak with to help me get interview offers?* It seems like career advisors are not the right call. 

My background consists of a pretty eclectic mix of experience. I have a communications degree and worked in localization for a big corporate television company before it was bought by a bigger corporate television company. 

When the announcement came that our office would be disbanded, I made a somewhat hasty decision to switch industries because I felt that there was no growth in the field I was in (this, of course, was a mistake - I should have *asked* about what a career path looked like before bailing). I was accepted to an ultrasound school, graduated, and worked in the field for about a year and a half before finally admitting that the healthcare industry is *not* and never was for me. 

I quit and got a freelance position editing audio, which is great but doesn't net enough to cover any bill  but the phone. I desperately want a *career,* and even though I took a couple years' break from the communications field, I figured I'd be able to jump back in. 

And here we are. 

I'd love to go back to the television industry I started in. However, it seems that they way my office delegated localization work was vastly different than what is typical. It's like my office separated the typical localization responsibilities into 3 separate teams, and since I was only on one of those teams, I only ever meet a third of the requirements that posted localization roles need. Due to that, I have stopped looking for localization roles and am instead searching for coordinator or CRM roles, which I believe my experience helps prepare me to do. I'm trying my best to word my experiences in a way that helps potential employers see that, but I must not be doing that well enough. 

For the positions I'm applying to, I *know* I can learn what I need to, and quickly. Just about any applicant is going to say that in an interview, but I do think my success in ultrasound helps prove it. I'm just never getting any traction and I'd love to see what's worked for you guys. I mostly use LinkedIn, and I try to reach out to recruiters after submitting applications, but that honestly feels overreaching and I'm not surprised that they never read my InMail. 

If you read this far, thank you. I'm getting desperate and would greatly appreciate any tidbits you'd like to share.",liebteimmer,2,0.75,1,1708275738,2024-02-18 17:02:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1atythz/help_with_getting_interviews/,2,2024
1atxysv,How do you ask for feedback on soft skills at a skip-level (no 1:1 with direct supervisor)? What are the actual words you use?,"I work as an engineer at a small company of 12 people. Everyone at this company joined immediately following their PhD so we all have about the same level of experience, including CEO and CTO. 

My biannual 1:1 with the CTO is coming up and I want some feedback. My technical skills are great but I really want to work on my soft skills. I recently was put on a project where I work semi-independently and want to work on:

* synthesizing information from different teams and turning that information into a decision for next steps
* compromising with other people who don't agree
* being decisive without being too aggressive (do I ""set a plan"" too early in the discussion?)
* &#x200B;

Things of this nature. I love this part of my job but am mildly autistic and have issues determining whether my approach to these things is appropriate or not. 

Importantly, I do not have 1:1 meetings with my team lead (I try, but I just get ""everything's fine!"") so this biannual 1:1 is the only chance I have for feedback. Our CTO does work with me directly sort of, but also has ten million other things to keep track of, so I feel as though it's possible to be ""too specific"" with my request for feedback. Just trying to figure out how to best approach this.

1atx0h7,Job offer same company,"I received an unsolicited job offer (meaning I did not apply for it) with the same company but for a job the Texas facility. My background is engineering and this new role would require me to dust off this skillset as I really have not been using them in my current role. It will be more design than what I thought I wanted to do but it sounds like the role would give me a lot of visibility and came with a 2 year commitment before they would relocate me to where I wanted to be. However, my work life balance in my current position is the best it’s ever been and I enjoy living in the state so much that I told my friend at the beginning of the year “I don’t think I’m ever going to leave.” If I stay in my current role I still have visibility but in a lesser way and it is a potential that my boss leaves soon with me being his successor. Question boils down to do I follow strictly logic or get influenced by my emotions.

Relocate to Texas
-lateral move but pay bump and relocation. After taxes end up making $30K more the first year and $10K more than current the 2nd year due to no state income taxes (did factor in higher property taxes and housing costs) 
-more of a technical role with design work which is not something I’m used to, but would help me develop tool kit more
-Individual contributor role
-New role will have exposure to C-suite level execs
-2 year commitment then will get help to go wherever I want to, but also means two years that I can’t apply for supervisor roles 
-Gulf coast prone to hurricanes, had already relocated away from Louisiana for that reason 

Stay in current role
-No relocation but might end up leaving anyways as I’ve been gearing up to apply for a supervisor position 
-Potential that boss leaves and I could succeed him in the role, but nothing is guaranteed as they will have to post his job 
-Love the house I bought here and the quality of life 
-“Easy” option - less unknowns than moving to a new state 
-There’s a lot of movement in the company I’ve been advised to “stay the course, wait for the chess pieces to fall for a supervisor role to open”",Educated_Idiot45,1,1.0,2,1708271188,2024-02-18 15:46:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1atx0h7/job_offer_same_company/,2,2024

I don't know if this is the correct place to ask, but what might my odds be of getting into graduate school at Cornell (for the professional Master of Food Science program) after attending graduate school at Texas Woman's University?

1atvwx2,"Feeling Used and Betrayed: My Experience as the Sole SME on a 20-Year-Old Software Project, and Being Excluded from the New Development Team","I work as a DevOps engineer/software engineer for a company with a software project that's been running for 20 years. Over time, I've become one of the few subject matter experts (SMEs) who truly understands the intricacies of the codebase. For the past four years, I've poured my heart and soul into keeping this legacy software operational.  
  
Last year, the company decided it was time to develop a replacement software. They formed a team comprising three-quarters of the remaining staff who know about the software—except for me. Initially, they assured me I could join the team in due course, although no formal commitment was made (a mistake on my part for not getting this in writing).  
  
As months passed, I noticed I wasn't invited to all the team meetings, especially those related to development. Despite my requests to be included, I found myself sidelined, excluded from crucial discussions about the new project. When they did assign me development tasks, it was only after persistent reminders, and often in areas only I could handle efficiently.  
  
A few months ago, they offered me the chance to become a full software engineer, albeit with a catch. I would be tasked with maintaining the old system, performing data entry, and only occasionally contributing to the new project—if there was no other work for me. This felt like a slap in the face, given my dedication and expertise.  
  
Recently, during a goals meeting, it hit me: I've been used and betrayed. I feel as though they've stripped away something I've nurtured for years, leaving me feeling broken and undervalued. It's become clear they view me as a contractor, utilizing my expertise while keeping me at arm's length from the new project.  
  
I'm torn about how to proceed. Part of me wants to demand a place on the new team or threaten to withdraw my support altogether. But I fear such actions could backfire and worsen the situation.  
  
Given my passion for the old system, I don't believe I can continue in this role without my mental health suffering further. It feels like they're exploiting my willingness to transition into full software development, while keeping me tethered to tasks that don't align with my career goals.  
  
I'm seeking advice on how best to address this with my manager. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",redditersofni,1,0.6700000166893005,9,1708268264,2024-02-18 14:57:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1atvwx2/feeling_used_and_betrayed_my_experience_as_the/,2,2024

Many of my peers were seasoned management consultants with MBAs from top universities. I had no real concept of how one did strategy. It was a baptism of fire. I worked on high profile projects for board directors, prepared company slides that were presented to city analysts and tracked the company’s progress against competitors. The work was intense and I learnt more than at any other time in my life. It was also great fun. Then one day, it was all over. Along with many colleagues, I was made redundant.

# Build connections

>Similarities matter most when they’re rare. We bond when we share uncommon commonalities which allow us to feel that we fit in and stand out at the same time. - Adam Grant

Whenever I meet someone new, in person or online, I invite them to connect on LinkedIn. I explore the background of those I do not know well. In my invite, I suggest subjects of common interest and share related resources, e.g. a blog post, video or on-line tool. I try to share valuable content on LinkedIn every day; this has c.210,000 views per year. During job search, the importance of my contacts became apparent. I had 12,000 connections, spanning multiple industries, which I could reach out to. Whenever I approached someone in relation to a possible role, I personalised the message and explained how I could help their organisation. I reasoned that if I wanted 15 mins of someone’s time then I had to demonstrate that I had invested at least that myself.

# Demonstrate value

>Try not to become successful, rather deliver value. - Albert Einstein

Having been through the process of job searching a few times, I know how easy it is to become very self-centred. I felt sorry for myself. Why didn’t prospective employers appreciate how much effort I was putting in? I came to the realisation that I needed to flip the perspective. Not so much, what employers could do for me as what value could I offer them? In his book Choose Yourself, James Altucher describes how he approached businesses with specific improvement suggestions. It led to many opportunities and transformed his life. I used this approach when supporting my younger daughter find a job. It worked.

# Develop personal brand

>Your personal brand is what people say about you when you are not in the room. - Jeff Bezos

Building an online presence is a key part of Branding Ourselves. This can have a profound impact on our prospects of securing a good job. It raises our profile, establishes credibility and enables recruiters to find us. We can do this in various ways, including optimising our LinkedIn profile, writing a blog and establishing a personal website.

1atq19v,Looking to break into diving in Australia (as a kiwi).,"Hello there everyone!

Hope everyone's day/night is going well. I was hoping someone could help me progress my diving career a little bit.

I'm looking into breaking into the Aussie diving industry, mainly the Aquacultre/fishing diving area, but I'm finding it difficult so far. Most of the jobs that have presented themselves on Indeed, Seek and etc. have either:

A: Required ADAS qualifications. Which I do not have.

B: INSIST on the applicants being already local, which is a problem because I'm currently living in New Zealand.

I would love to earn more than I currently am ($60,000NZD) but honestly not by much, as I'm more looking for a change of scenery than anything else.

A bit about me, just to shed light on what I bring to the table:

-I'm a fish farmer that also partakes in Aquacultre Diving duties on the farm.

-I have Level 4 NZQA Credits in Aquacultre Diving.

-My CoC (Certificate of Competence) in Aquacultre Diving.

-A current dive medical.

-PADI Rescue Diver Qualification with five specialities which are:
Night Diver
Deep Diver
Wreck
Emergency Oxygen 
Navigation 

-A current First Aid Cert, VHF MMROC certification with a boatmasters certification as well.

My main two reasons for deciding to look elsewhere are:

-As stated before, a change in scenery. I'd love to branch out and learn new things about this industry.

-I simply do not do enough diving in my current employment. I love dive work more than anything else, however my current employment seems to try its hardest not to utilize me for the diving jobs around the farm.    So that certain employees that are buddy buddy with upper management can dive all day, while I have to take up the slack of all the other duties a farm requires.

Any advice is much appreciated!

1atmtpt,Do I stick it out or part ways asap?,"Hello all.

I'm currently stuck in a dilemma of keeping this new job or leaving. Found out recently I wasn't getting paid for any training I did and although it's only been 2 days, I'm already having second thoughts about proceeding with it any further. I'm going to get more clarifications and determine the next course of action, but I can see it going 2 ways.

1) Ask the boss how long I'm expected to train for, if they say 2 more weeks then end it and bow out. Two weeks may not be all that bad but in this economy, I cannot afford to not be paid like that. I understood full well that training would be involved, it just wasn't made clear to me it would be unpaid. They never stated it- not in the job description or interviews.

2) Boss says yes there will be some more training but it will be paid ( they started asking for some employment docs) soon. Ok, great. I'm getting paid which is what I'm expecting but after seeing everything, I'm not sure I'm up to task for it all by myself. I would be the only person working that role,  there are no lunch breaks, hours are not 100% solid, and there are a lot of details involved in every aspect. I'm concerned about there not being a backup or another person if emergencies were to arise and I can't come in.

It already sounds like I made up my mind but if #2 happens, then I would have little to no choice because getting a job in this market is difficult. I do have my old job to fall back on but even I don't want to be stuck in that position forever.

1atkwzp,Feeling stuck in a routine but intensive job. How to plan for a career change?,"I have a PhD in physics and I work as an associate editor for a scientific publishing company in condensed matter physics. I've been in this role for two years, and I handle the peer review and editorial process for original research papers. I also liaise with other editors and experts in the international scientific community. 

I'm a bit done with my job because it's routine, and though related to my research experience, it is not particularly high paying. I don't feel challenged or interested in my field anymore. I've been looking for other jobs in publishing and research, but I haven't gotten any responses.

Earlier, I was hoping to get into data science, but with the current high bar to get even an entry level role, I aborted plans to shift to that career path. 

Right now, I am not very attached to my research field or scientific background and want a better salary and more intellectually intensive work. I don't have any referrals or connections in other fields. 

I want to change careers and do something more intellectually stimulating and financially rewarding. I'm thinking of doing an MBA and becoming a consultant, but I'm worried that I'm too old and inexperienced for that. 

I am 35, need some advice on how to plan my career and find a different job. Do you think an MBA is a good idea? Are there any other options for me? Considering that I will be in the current role for next year, what steps can I take to figure out a career plan for me?

I had already discussed a new position before my leave and my work agreed to do it after my leave which where I live is for one year. At the beginning it was great, I was very confident and excited. But I’ve been really struggling.

Some of our team feel better approaching her than me about issues or questions. I’ve been feeling so intimidated and scared of disappointing my boss and my team.

I love my job and I love my close team. My question is how do I move past this feeling? How do I overcome the low confidence? How do I assume the “boss” role with people that I used to be on the same level with? How do I find my voice within the managers group?

I’ve done a lot of paid social media as well as Google PPC/Pmax and other smaller channels like Snapchat, email campaigns etc. It feels like there is a cap when it comes to growing and i’ve been itching to advance my skill set but I cannot put a finger down on what. 

I am thinking product marketing (PMM) or maybe going the data route? Or MBA? 

What route would you recommend and what kind of skills would be most valuable to attain? Where and in what direction could I grow in my career after having the experience I have in growth marketing? 

PS, I have a masters in marketing (digital ‘marketing as the specialization) and i’m a senior performance marketer (experience with marketing DTC e-commerce products, subscription services etc)

I’d appreciate all and any advice as I’m hating the feeling of being stagnant in this field!

1atgpae,Better leader vs better project,"TLDR:
Need to choose between two teams: A / B
A: 
People manager that will nurture youngsters, will give a lot of support, opportunities and guidance. Also the job content interests me slightly more.

B:
Can involve in flagship project which is a good chance to learn a lot & meet a lot of people. The exposure will be great, applicable in the future and will be a great foundation for my career. Still rotating here and enjoying the work & can feel the personal growth.


I am in a Graduate a.k.a Management Associate Program in the bank under technology dept and it would soon come to an end, so I would need to choose which team I would pick to commit to after all the rotations. After some consideration, I have shortlisted two final choices but I still struggle to get a final decision.

Team A(People Manager & personal interest)
- The manager is very nice and really care about you. I will get lots of support and guidance if i follow him
- Will think of you when there are opp. and is likely to highlight your achievements to the management, so more chance to be known by the seniors
- Personally more interested in the job content

Negative:
- Missed out the opp. to work on the biggest project, project with that scale rarely happens
- dependant on the manager? What if the manager leaves the bank?


Team B(Flagship project & learning opp.)
- In charge of the biggest project( modernising the whole backend systems) Involves almost every part of the bank and end to end study of business flow, systems etc. 
- can involve in end to end delivery of the project that last for years and will gain huge exposure
- will force you to grow learn from the project
- the manager used to be a CIO somewhere else, So very experienced but less caring type. 
- still rotating here, also enjoying the job here and can feel my growth
- you can learn what is needed in team A but not vice versa 

Negative:
- less attention to teammates. Need to grow on your own
- more tough cuz very challenging project (but i like how it sounds haha)

My thought is since im still in a very early stage of my career, as much as i like Team A more( just slightly) more like enjoying both, it might be best for me to experience bigger projects so i can learn more and have a good foundation to move forward.

1atenyx,27 years old stuck in between white collar or blue collar,"Long story short I became a mortgage loan processor at age 22. Company shut down due to the interest rates and I got laid off at age 26.

1atdmkv,Leave Job or Not?,"Hello, this is a bit of a lengthy post. Please bear with me on this. TLDR at the end.

&#x200B;

I (28M) am an engineer that was recently laid off from my last job in August of 2023. I was at that company for 3.5 yrs and was one of the hardworking ""veterans"" there. This company was a startup and was paying me below industry average by the time I was laid off. When I was laid off, fortunately I had a 2-month severance pay and benefits.

After some searching, I was able to land a job that was willing to pay me $30k more. This job required my wife, toddler, and I to move 800 miles to another state. The only risk with this job is that it is another startup. My wife questioned this and I assured her that all will be fine even if the worst case scenario that I was at risk of being laid off again. The job market in our new state is MUCH better than in our last state, so I assured her that finding a new job that is local would be LOADS easier than the first time. We moved and have since love the area and me loving my new job. 

ONE MONTH after I started employment, the company announced a major layoff of over 100 people (20%) and rescinded a few offers for new employees that were supposed to start -- thankfully I was spared and didn't lose my job. The severance they got was a laughable 2-weeks. Some of the senior guys on my team applied elsewhere and jumped ship because this was the first time ever experiencing that at this company. They were afraid of losing their jobs in the future and have families to take care of. Management has addressed the massive exodus of people by saying ""we financially are good for the year. Don't worry about any more layoffs because we won't have any ever again"". 

Out of my own fear, I applied for a few jobs as well and managed to go through the interview process with one of them. A few weeks later I was offered a 100% remote position that offers a $15k increase in salary. They told me that I need to wait 2-4 weeks to get a security clearance approval before ""officially"" being offered the job, but they still gave me a ""pre-offer"" letter to sign if I want the job. This job is at a consultancy company that has a project scheduled to last between 3-6 years. Even if that project falls through, then I was told that there were other projects within the company to get involved with. 

For the past month I've been talking to my boss (behind closed doors) about me looking and he said that he doesn't blame me. After the layoff fiasco, he told me that he lost all respect for management and told the HR department ""I can't convince my guys to stay. The future of this company is unknown and I can't blame them for looking out for their families"". He told me that I should accept the pre-offer and wait for the security clearance to go through. If I'm approved, then I can ""officially"" let him know and he can talk with management to try and match my increased salary. 

My conscious is eating at me from all sides:

1.) I feel shitty for trying to lead this potentially new employer on and screw them with a ""never mind"" if my current employer matches the higher salary being offered to me. 

2.) I REALLY LOVE where I work now. Everyone is chill and the work is exciting. I hate to disappoint and break relationships (albeit these relationships are only 6-months old). Everyone here keeps telling me that I'm an asset to this company and I am severely needed. My boss says that there is a strong chance that upper management will side with me getting a salary match.

3.) My wife tells me that she supports whatever I decide, just as long as I'm happy. However, she did say that at the end of the day corporations are shitty to people and I could get thrown aside like I did with my last employer. She does NOT want to go through another layoff. This is especially true since we want to purchase our first house sometime next year. 

4.) Even if my current employer matches the increased salary, the future of the company is still uncertain. Sure I might get paid more, but it won't matter if I get laid off a few months later. At that point I would be applying to jobs again out of desperation and would take anything that comes my way, even though it'll take roughly a month to get a new offer. 

5.) My boss told me that if we don't hear any good and CONCRETE NEWS (i.e., ""we just got millions of money in investment"")  in the next month then he will start looking at jumping ship himself. 

6.) New boss and job environment is a gamble and could potentially be bad. My current boss has been one of the best ever in my career. I could hate my new job and regret leaving. This one is a multinational corporation but has some pretty good reviews on Glassdoor.

7.) I am still fairly early career and in an engineering field that involves some hands on work from time to time. Going to a 100% remote setting (with the occasional international travel) could potentially hurt my chance at getting new skill sets/experience.

I know what makes sense logically and that is to take the job with more money and security. However, I am internally guilty about screwing the people at my current place of employment. They are very nice to me, respect me, and value me as an asset to the company.

&#x200B;

TLDR

New job with mo' money, remote, and in a larger company, or risk staying at current startup and losing my job again after being laid off from a previous startup?

Recently, an absurdly larger company gave me an offer with a massive increase in salary, far better title (which even shocked my former colleague), closer to a place of worship (gotta do a divine veneration once  a week), more holidays (imagine being off on Presidents' Day) and a great name in the resume.

1atcmli,"My “perfect” life has to change, and I’m struggling with it….","So let me put this out there first: 
I WANT TO WORK and help my fiancée , I just never have. Not over the table anyhow.

I had mental illnesses at a young age from chronic abuse and was put on SSI in my early 20s when I had a severe nervous breakdown and dropped out of college-(SSI paid around 700 back then and my family took all of that) I started a side business at 24 selling antiques pretty successfully ($10k-30k a year) part time to support my sister’s children she abandoned (side note: I was not supposed to do this, I know, it is not allowed under SSI- but I made the choice to help give those children what they needed and I don’t regret it. The money was not for me- and it helped them- I have no regrets)- escaped my abusive home life at 26- fell in love at 28, moved in, got engaged and THEN had another nervous break down. Actually 3 in 2 years (long story)

Selling things online became stressful and triggering. I’d literally start shaking violently having to engage with ppl online to sale things. Theoretically, I was getting better. I escaped my family. They no longer took all my money. I was able to build a small saftey net savings. I didn’t have to care for other ppls children every min of every day. In love, engaged, happy. But I’m not ENTIRELY well. 

Why-I was raised pretty much in a cult environment with very mentally ill, manipulative, emotionally and often physically abusive ppl. Drugs, crime, violence, that’s what I was used to. Violence was gloried- hurting ppl was encouraged- assault was no big deal. I was considered weak in my family for not being an aggressive violent person. At one point I was a complete shut-in with severe ptsd who couldn’t look a stranger in the face without bursting into tears. It was actually a real shock to me when I learned at 30 not EVERYONE in the world was a dangerous threat out to abuse me. It’s been a culture shock to say the very least. So adapting to normal life has been a challenge 

I am lucky. I know that. I’m relatively attractive in a conventional way and I’m a nice person, I think lol. My fiancée is handsome, hardworking and the very best person in the world. The very, very best. At first he didn’t understand why mental illness would prevent me from working. Not many ppl do, honestly. And most ppl who find out I don’t work are not quiet about their opinions of me- (even though I have forced myself to continue to sell things occasionally over the last few years to help our savings and have made about as much money as my fiancée- it’s hard for ppl to understand that) people who find out I’m on SSI look down on me and shame me. This is because I’m a pretty young woman and the idea of someone who looks like me being sick seems almost laughable. Side note: My therapist knows I sale things and thinks it’s a wonderful way to cope with my MI (before I get a lot of hate let me quote my doctor here: “being able to sale 5-6items a month doesn’t mean you’re capable of holding down a 9-5 job. That’s not anything alike. You have a skill but you also have mental illness. Thinking otherwise is delusional. SSI is for ppl who are too sick to hold down regular employment. It’s there for ppl like you who have issues so they can work through those issues. You might be there one day but ———long convo——— not yet”) and I have no work experience on paper- I’ve just been a small time hobby business myself. 

So, at first my S/O didn’t understand. He wanted a full 50/50 partner. I respect and understand that. Then I got sick again. Mental breakdowns are no joke- and when my mind breaks (usually if I fell threatened and very very scared) I am not “right” for months after. I become a “not a person”, I’m not me and it’s a bit unrecognizeable. I regret very much that he ever saw me that way, I know it was very very hard on him. It did, however, give him a very clear picture of my mental health. Afterwards, he told me he understood and was perfectly okay with me never working if it was something that would stress me out and make me sick again. He became incredibly supportive of protecting my mental health and supported me h quitting sales and taking a break. 

So I did. And Covid skyrocketed bills to the moon. 
We are doing alright. We have a little more money at the end of our month and continue to save. But I’m not delusional enough to not know having a partner that doesn’t work is a financial burden. SSI now pays me 900 a month and free health care for treatment (I also have physical issues from the abuse). I want to work- I want to feel “normal” and have something I’m good at. I want to own a home (was homeless as a child) and I know that won’t happen without 2 incomes. After my last breakdowns my doctor and therapist suggested I try volunteering but give up on ever working. They think it’s stupid to give up the safety net of SSI and that if I get sick again I’d just feel like more of a burden. My doctor told me to go live a simple pleasant life and pursue hobbies-be a hermit. I honestly wish I could.

Currently I live a very simple but somewhat boring life of a stay at home soon to be wife. We plan to try to adopt children a decade or so in the future but all of my life is mostly reading books and household chores. I have time to go to the gym or on walks and I’m learning to do hobbies. But my S/O and I decided I should try working if nothing more than to grow as a person and acclimate to the real world. So I’m 2 years into a 4 year degree. And honestly I’m just scared shitless. It seems so silly, but most everyone who losses SSI never gets it back (that’s 1k and free health insurance every month) and I’ve never had a job- and been sick most of my life or in a semicult environment. I picked a career program that requires 1600hrs of hands on training to help transition into the work force, and the positive is if I fail my student loans SHOULD be forgivable.m because I’m still “disable” as of now. The problem is in reality I might always be disabled, just ina way ppl can’t see or understand. As of now my life is simple. I know it HAS to become more complicated. I’m not an idiot or a child- you want nice things or luxury you have to work. I get it. But leaving the saftey net behind forever scares the shit out of me. Work scares the shit out of me. Having to be there every day and overcoming the anxiety of dealing with ppl for the rest of my life scares the shit out of me. What if I get sick again, what if I’m not capable, what if I can’t adapt? What if my life gets worse because I get a job. Advice of how to feel more confident about this choice so I dread it less?

1atb55g,Saw a job ad from my job for my role. What to do next?,"Throwaway as I would like to keep this private and on mobile. 

Very recently, I received an email alert and saw that the job advertised was for my role at what I am pretty much 99.99% certain is from the current company I work for. 

Here's how I know:

- The recruitment company that posted the job is the same one that I used to to get this job. 

- The ad itself is pretty much identical to the one that they used previously when I applied a few months ago. 

- The ad mentions company perks, software and sector that match my current role 

- This seems to be a recurring pattern; from what I have been told previously, most of the people who have held my role were only at the company for a few months before they were let go, and this seems to match their timeline. 

I will, of course, start applying for new roles, but I would like to keep this one for as long as possible due to the fact that I like the team I work with and enjoy the perks they offer, such as being remote. 

Things it is unlikely to be:

- someone to help/join the team and not a replacement - I highly doubt this as it's a smaller company, and it's very unlikely this would happen. 

- a promotion, again very unlikely, I've only been at the company for a few months from talking to poeple that have been at the company for a 2-4 years there isnt a culture of promoting people. 

My question is, how do I approach this to try and keep this job? I wouldn't like to lose it, especially in this job market. I like the people I work with and haven't had any major complaints, so how do I approach this: do I speak to the owner of the company - we have regular meetings every two weeks to a month about a project I'm working on, or do I approach this with the senior department leader? I don't have a manager at the moment as they are on leave for a few months. 

Any advice from anyone who has dealt with this and can give me some next steps would be appreciated.",throw123488,3,1.0,18,1708200874,2024-02-17 20:14:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1atb55g/saw_a_job_ad_from_my_job_for_my_role_what_to_do/,2,2024

1at5zyh,I have no idea what I want to do - looking for other perspectives,"I'm at a bit of a crossroads in my career. Here's some background:

* PhD in STEM field
* Worked for around 10 years in finance/tech as a data scientist/developper/quant
* Coding is...fine but I don't have ""side projects"" or anything like that. I like math a lot more. I'm not really a tech guy at all. It was always a means to an end. It's fun to build stuff, but I don't get excited about new releases of Python for example.

I just don't know what I want to do anymore. I'm not burnt out I don't think, more just bored. I am bilingual but I am not sure that opens up any actual doors. Maybe working in government could be interesting?

I have thought about:

* Giving a few half-baked startup ideas I have an honest try
* Just sucking it up and continue to be a dev (good money, good work like balance, honestly on paper nothing to really complain about other than the complete and utter purposelessness of it all)
* Big 180 and open a bakery or gym or some passion project and see how that goes (I have enough saved to go maybe a year or two without income with no issue, after that it would get a bit hairy, so if there's no path to profitability after than I'd just shut things down I guess)

1at3xwz,Emotional Boss. How do I deal with him?,"
I am on a team with 4 other people. We all have a boss that we report to that is in a VP position. He isn’t respected by any other departments and likes to tell the president of the company on people that disagree or challenge him. The president of the company no longer wants anyone in the company to come to him to complain about my boss but allows my boss to complain about everyone else (not sure why he has special privilege)

He is always calling me on teams messenger to tell me that he’s tired of the bullshit and the internal/external drama (even though he creates it because he treats everyone like shit). He would call me daily for hours just to vent about the lack of respect in the office and how he has personal issues with people. I use to say to him “you should have conversations with these people direct with your feelings” and he’d reply “there is no point”.  One time I counted 6.5 hours in 1 week spent on him venting to me about his problems. 

Lately I’ve been distancing myself from him because I don’t want anything to do with his negativity anymore. I’m a sales person,  not a daily therapist. 

 Since I started, I’ve been big on creating team strategy templates and business development plans to help us reach our team goals. My boss told me “thanks for the effort but we will never use these. It’s too much effort and we can’t train people to utilize these tools” so I took my files off of share point. He yelled at me to put them back on sharepoint a few days later because a meeting with the investors was coming up and he didn’t have time to create a strategy.

I put the files back on sharepoint. 

Yesterday he told me he was going to promote me to Sales Director soon.

 Today he told me that he’s going to hire a “powerhouse” as the sales director instead and when I asked “why?” He replied word for word (I have it in teams writing) “ He is a personal friend and someone that I know will not be influenced by the internal/external bullshit. Someone willing to take on a challenge. Invest in a time and effort and order put together the best action plan strategy” 

I can’t help but feel like he intentionally got my hopes up just to upset me because that is the type of person he is. 

Do I have a right to be upset? I’m not sure if there is any action I could take against him.",FinalDevelopment3592,3,1.0,1,1708182202,2024-02-17 15:03:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1at3xwz/emotional_boss_how_do_i_deal_with_him/,2,2024
1at2cy1,"Is it common to underperform at menial jobs, but then do well in more complicated roles?","From the moment I entered the workforce as a barista it was made obvious to me that I was kind of a fuck up. I was criticized for everything from how I cleaned and mopped to how I made sandwiches to how I labeled coffee grounds. 

Then I worked at a youth hostel, and although my coworkers and managers liked me, the owner thought I had some sort of performance issue and fired me. 

Then I worked at another coffee shop and the owner practically threw me out the door after placing me on an honest to god PIP after 5 weeks. Yep, a PIP. At a coffee shop. I had to sign the paperwork and everything. 

A few years later I got an entry level corporate job, and excelled initially, but something changed in management and I felt I was essentially constructively discharged. The director told me she would not have hired me if she had known me better, and suggested I switch careers. She criticized me for my performance in basic tasks, and when I pointed out more complicated work I had completed, her response was that she found it confusing that I could do those things but not basic ones. I made more and more mistakes as my anxiety escalated, and the director ended up putting me on a pip with moving goalposts (you need to work on task A. Oh you did that? Well the real measure of your success will be how you perform at task B. That went ok? Well let’s see how you do at task C.). I wasn’t fired, but I felt bullied and left. 

At this point, I was basically feeling like I was a huge idiot. Because I was really trying. I was doing my best, and my best obvious sucked. I saw everyone around me figuring it out and I couldn’t, even though the tasks were simple and I thought I was reasonably capable on a base level. 

After that, I was hired into another role in the same industry at a higher level. A lot more leadership, a lot more solutioning, very client facing, way more challenging in every way. It’s been over a year, and I’ve done pretty well. My manager loves me, I’ve been promoted, sent through additional certifications to support my growth, my profile is full of positive feedback from my superiors and support. I have received constructive feedback as well, but never related to the same things I was PIPd for in my last role. All in all, I’ve been told from several different directions that I’m a high performer, and they’ve started giving more and more challenging projects. 

It all feels arbitrary to me. Like if I wasn’t good enough to copy and paste 1600 addresses line by line why am I good enough to architect projects? Either it’s all subjective or maybe I do legitimately better in more challenging tasks. It’s made my very very hesitant to label anyone as a low performer, because I think, like, maybe they’re just me 18 months ago. Maybe I’m the evil boss. I also keep waiting for the ball to drop. How long can I convince everyone I’m good at this before they find out?

At the end of the day- do others feel it’s possible to just require the right challenge level and ownership before you start doing well? Or is this a fluke?",cocomaple91,14,0.7599999904632568,13,1708177666,2024-02-17 13:47:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1at2cy1/is_it_common_to_underperform_at_menial_jobs_but/,2,2024

1at22pc,Interest in food safety and potentially a PCQI and/or HACCP cert. Where do I start?,"
I started working on my associate's degree but had to drop after about 2.5-3 semesters due to financial reasons. I was self supporting before I turned 18, so it wasnt by choice. Grandmother had set a few thousand aside for me for a community college, then it ran out. Fast forward to now, I'm 25 and itching for a real career instead of bouncing around entry-level gigs.

I did pretty well in school. But I'm struggling to figure out what exactly I want to do. Lately, I've been eyeing certifications like PCQI and HACCP in food safety. Thing is, it seems like most jobs in that field want people with bachelor's or master's degrees, or at least an associate's in a related science field. Anybody here got insights on whether just having certifications is enough to break into food safety, or should I go back to school first? I’m not opposed to just sticking with an associates, but I’m not gonna be able to afford a bachelors or masters, until I get started somewhere that’s not entry level pay. So my goal is right now to get the associates, get the certifications, and get started somewhere so I can fund getting a better degree. 

Also, I've got experience in copywriting, project management, customer service, and a bit of marketing. But without formal degrees or certificates, I feel a bit stuck. Nobody is going to hire me on that marketing experience if I am not up-to-date on market standards, or have degree proof of my linguistic skills. Plus I kind of hated marketing. 

So, Should I bite the bullet and go for a bachelor's or master's, or is there another way to stick with an associates and some certificates?

I would also like to hear from other people in the food and medical safety field on their experiences. Is it a high pressure job? Whats a realistic salary expectation? What kind of environment are you in most often? Do you travel a lot for work? I’ve done some research on Google, but I get mixed answers from all of these college websites About these questions and would like a real person’s input.

My mindset is more on the practical side of choosing a career—aiming for stability and enough income to chase my passions outside of work. If I can get the money, I can actually pursue the things I really love and want to do. 
I enjoy learning and have done well in subjects like science, agriculture, and business. Everything I have really out my mind to, I know I can do really well at it. 

I applied for FASFA but I doubt its going to get me anything. I love school, I did well when i was there, but have never been able to nail down one thing that I can pursue - I just want to work towards something and keep that discipline going so I’m not 30 to 40 and still as aimless as I feel now. I know I’m still young but I need to be disciplined now, so I can worry less later. 

After I quit my marketing job, I had to resort to low paying grocery store shifts and it’s simply not cutting it. Im willing to dedicate real effort into a career, as long as i find it even mildly interesting.

I spoke to my boss and he said i was almost ready and it would happen very soon, i just needed experience in xyz. But i got told over again that I have talent, that i perform better than my colleagues/superiors in certain areas. i do lack confidence but they've never raised that as an issue.

But one of the colleagues who got promoted did not have experience in xyz either, and our boss told us once that he admired that she 'fights for what she wants' which is why she pushed for her promotion. That colleague comes from a rich family. I know i sound bitter but i felt it was really unfair, and have tried to up my game at work however i havent had much opportunity to do so. I am looking for another job where i feel my growth route is clear. but i do like my job and would rather stay if i could.

But all of my other peers from uni are at the next stage to me whilst i am behind. it feels shitty and i feel stuck like a failure despite feeling ive grown a lot in my job and am really good at what i do.

1at1og4,Promoted but didn't get announced,"My boss offered me a promotion in a one-on-one meeting about 2 weeks ago. He said it was solely because of my performance and hard work over the past year and he was going to announce it to the rest of the team soon and that I could go ahead and change my title on Slack and elsewhere. But there's been no word from him since and he's been very active on the team channel giving us tasks etc. I changed my title like he asked me to but now I just feel stupid and slightly disrespected. I'm not sure what to make of it.  Should I change my title back to what it was to make a point? I don't feel like I want to remind him to announce it because I really shouldn't have to. In the meantime, 2 other people on different teams who have the same new title as me have been congratulated publicly by their bosses.   
It's been a crap start to what I'd hoped would be a wonderful new beginning and I would love some insight into this. ",Prudent-Bug7083,1,0.6700000166893005,9,1708175579,2024-02-17 13:12:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1at1og4/promoted_but_didnt_get_announced/,2,2024
1at1nwk,"Junior UI/UX Designer With Zero Luck, Apparently","Hey all,

I graduated in October and took a short break. Now it's been a couple months since I started the job search and I am extremely miserable. I have a BSc in product design and recently got my MSc in interactive digital media from a well-renowned college. I live in Germany and I have been applying mostly in Berlin. 

I have a strong portfolio with three projects I did during college, outlining my processes etc. I will take anything I can get at this point and have even looked at internships. 

I can't get internships because I'm not currently enrolled in college. I can't get entry level jobs because they all ask for three years experience. 

I really wanted a traineeship type role from a big company where they absorb recent graduates and train them, and had applied to one at Deutsche Bank, I passed the first round and completed a test, and then they rejected me. I don't know what to do at this point and my mental health is on a decline. 

Unfortunately I don't have a network. I have reached out to many design agencies, cold-calling, with no luck, and have cold-called a lot of people on LinkedIn with no luck either. 

Honestly it's hard not to get angrier and sadder every day that recent graduates like myself with a decent skills are unable to get anything. I don't know what to do any more. I would love some advice. ",_Dip_,2,1.0,0,1708175533,2024-02-17 13:12:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1at1nwk/junior_uiux_designer_with_zero_luck_apparently/,2,2024

1aszoqb,Career change advice? ,"ey guys! So I’ve been in the sub for about a year. I really enjoy the conversation here too! 

I’m having a hard time with a major career decision. 

I currently work for a large corporation in the industrial supply space. I am a full cycle AE. Top performer, 180% to quota. But, I am burnt out on internal issues when it comes to keeping my customers happy and losing them before bonus. 

So right now I make a base of 45k. Plus commissions and bonus. OTE 75k also get $500/mo car allowance and a gas card. My current company is offering me a strategic sales position that would double my base, and OTE but, I would travel on the east coast for meetings, etc. Essentially my territory would be the east coast instead of just half of the state I live in. Lots of travel, higher base, plus commissions, no bonus. Also this role is in a space that my company is not super versed in. We don’t have nearly as much to offer as our competitors. With that being said. 

I also have an offer from a privately owned company is a completely different space. They have bent over backwards to compete with my current offer to get me on board. I would be their first sales rep that was not contracted in-house. They are well established. But, this role is a local role, non strategic space. Though there is no cap on account size. Base is around 72k. Plus 400/mo car allowance. No gas card or mileage. OTE 125k. Management seems super cool and chill. They also offer good health insurance for my family. 

I am at a crossroads here. I’ve got a family. I need to have more $$ coming in. My current company has its negatives and positives. They also have fought hard to keep me from leaving. But the other company has a lot of things I like as a person. No travel, local territory. But no gas card and less car allowance. Also lower base and OTE, but they have the products to actually service what they sell. 

Please any advice would be helpful. Money is a big factor but not the only factor!

1asznol,Feeling that my dream job isn’t the right fit for me - should I quit? ,"TL;DR: Started dream job, but struggling with complex logistics, verbal communication style, and workload organisation. Constantly anxious due to making mistakes and low support. Manager criticises mistakes openly, raising concerns about competence. Seeking advice on whether to stick it out or consider if it's not the right fit.


Hi guys,

I’d really appreciate if I received any advice/tips about this situation that I’m about to explain. It’s been running through my mind non-stop and I’m even finding it hard to sleep because of it. 

I started a brand new job around a month ago - very, very exciting for me! The job was in an industry that I’ve always dreamt of working in, the work culture sounded absolutely amazing during the screening stage, I believed that it’ll be a good skill fit, and ultimately this job would give me a good step forward to my future career goals. Okay, perfect stuff!

Once I started working in my brand new job, that’s when everything just began to fall in disarray for me. The baseline logistics and systems of the job are very intricate, not simple at all, therefore I keep on making mistakes and errors as I’m simultaneously using the logistics/systems for my work, as well as trying to retain them into my head. The communication style of the job is not what I’m really used to (super verbal rather than written comms), so my notes/guidelines often miss out bits of info and leads me to making more mistakes whenever I use them as a point of reference for my work. Organising my workload has never been an issue for me in past jobs, but since this job is particularly unique and extremely fast-paced in nature, I still have yet to build a solid organisational system that personally fits my workstyle as well as the industry’s culture, which once again leads to me making mistakes again!

As a result of this, I just constantly feel so anxious and jittery about work that I’m even too scared to deliver my tasks at all. Within all of this, my manager ALWAYS mentions every single mistake that I make out loud in front of my colleagues/CEO and this makes me feel demoralised and small. I’ve also have begun to stop asking any questions to my more experienced colleagues. Even though getting their help will support me a lot, in the past they have judged me for my question, have been told to “just use my common sense” for an industry-specific problem, sometimes stated that they’re too busy to clarify logistics/steps, or that I “should” be capable of solving a unique problem myself. I understand that the job is meant to be autonomous, but honestly after those circumstances and the general lack of support I feel like I get compared to my past jobs, I’m finding it even harder to navigate my way around what exactly I’m meant to do.

What especially worries me the most is that I had my first month probation meeting this week with my manager and CEO, which was majorly negative, and within this they’ve flagged my repeated mistakes as a problem and they feel concerned that I’m not competent enough for the role. I did take their feedback as constructively, but I also couldn’t help but feel down and demotivated too.

I just wanted to ask what would you all do if you was in my position? I’m honestly trying so hard to perform well in this job, but I just feel like a failure. I’m worried about my future and if they’d fire me if I continue to muck up. So far, I’m not thinking of quitting at all, but if I’m already facing these issues when I haven’t even faced half of the workload that I’d be intended to manage in the future, then does that mean that this job isn’t the right fit for me at all? Should I give up now?

1aszgyf,New Job / Counter Offer Question,"I found a few similar posts, but nothing relating to my exact situation. So here it goes.

What would Reddit do?!

I started looking for a new job last year. Shortly after, my boss resigned and left Company A. After leaving, he asked if I would like to join him at Company B in a similar role. 
(Longer commute by a few miles, similar hours, similar industry)

I have received an offer from Company B now. The offer is 25% more than I currently make at Company A. There are talks of commission as well, but that is being fine-tuned and was not specified in the offer letter currently. They are restructuring the commissions structure currently. I accepted the offer in writing very quickly and turned in my resignation.

Company A came back and countered with an almost 50% increase. (New president has only been in the building for 3 weeks, counter came from him. He is my acting supervisor. I expected to be walked out before end of day, never expected a counter.)

What would be the best way to handle this? I don’t want to stay at Company A, but 6 figures does get my attention. I would like to call my old boss who is taking me to Company B and let him know that I have no intention of accepting the counter, but to open that line of communication. See where he goes with it vs me leading that I would like a counter-counter offer. 

Or do I just suck it up, take the 25% increase and be happy with that? (Plus the potential of commissions once the structure is sorted out.)

(I do have a great relationship with the boss taking me to Company B. He was brought into Company B as the President there. And I know he wants me with him. He had the details of the offer ready to email to HR before I showed up to the interview.)",elle_tee16,1,1.0,0,1708167714,2024-02-17 11:01:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aszgyf/new_job_counter_offer_question/,2,2024

Dalhart Police Department said I had 175k street value (I would’ve took my jet back if that were true) The deliver/manufacture was dropped and the possession is getting dropped when I finish probation in September 2024. Im having trouble in understanding if explaining that I had 30k invested into every reup every two weeks with 20+ people working for me is a good thing or bad thing. Ticket order would look like 10+ Lbs, 500 - 1000 carts, 2lbs wax, 500 - 1000 edibles. Usually lows, mids, high grade product. Another 5 - 10k for some of the fancier connoisseurs. (Newest Phenos, Hash Rosin, etc) I saved 100k and lived off that for the last 3 years. I’ve lost everything i own at this point from stepping down and can barely pay my Court Fees.

1asy7ye,Seeking Advice - Ambitious Young Professional in a Tough Spot,"I’m 27M. Started career out in public accounting at PwC. Hours were very brutal but was good starting point for prestige / opportunities. Obtained CPA license and also graduated #1 in my class with an MS in accounting and dual BS in finance and accounting so between experience and educational background I was a very attractive candidate for corporate finance / strategy jobs and got a ton of attention from firms where I applied.

Fast forward two years and I start my job at a F100 company as an analyst doing strategic finance for a $15B portfolio of customers. The group is me, a manager and a director. I’m doing great and picking things up quick. Fantastic feedback and lots of praise. All of a sudden, 9 months into the job, the manager and director in my group leave for greener pastures and I am the sole subject matter expert. Extremely stressful because there’s a ton of responsibility attached to managing the $15B portfolio with respect the ensuring profitability / structuring deals with customers and I am essentially a one man show. Literally billion dollar deals at a time and if I don’t get things right in the models that I’m working in there are huge, very visible (going up to c-suite) consequences. Our group is known to have highly complex deals and is strategically important to the company due to relatively high margins. 

I was shocked and deeply disappointed that I was left alone to do essentially all the heavy lifting and it was a huge struggle but I’ve made it through and after a ton of tough times and I  am managing things pretty well now. 

New boss is a senior manager and was picked by her new boss, a VP, primarily because they’re buddies and she has ridden his coat tails wherever he’s gone in his career. Both are relatively new to these roles and aren’t highly technically competent (they came from an adjacent business function). I’m actually shocked many times with the questions they ask me and guidance they provide because it’s so blatantly lacks understanding and competence and makes my job 10x harder. Oh well, I grin and bear and still produce top tier work because that’s what you got to do. 

Fast forward a year (+) and they still are useless to me as far as being able to share in the heavy lifting and are still providing strategic guidance that clearly points to a lack of understanding of the customers and their business. My immediate boss takes most of my work and then does everything she can to present it as hers to her boss and more senior leadership. She’s a total “glory hog” if you’ve heard the term, and I’ve done what I can to push back and say I want to own my work but it’s a hard thing to navigate. She will do what she can to extract my ideas and then share them with senior leadership and not invite me to the discussion. She recently took a deck I put together with my hard work and original ideas and presented to senior management getting tons of praise and literally said she put it together quick on her plane ride WHILE I WAS THERE ON THE CALL. That deck was a summary of about a week of hard work I did and included insights she would never have thought of independently. Very frustrating because I sometimes feel invisible while simultaneously busting my ass to carry the team.

On top of this I am supposed to train the new analyst they’ve hired (reporting to her) because “she doesn’t have the time in her calendar”. Unbelievable because I’m sure she’ll try to take credit for this too.

~3 months ago I hinted that my responsibilities vastly exceed my pay/title (Sr. Analyst) and I would like to get to the manager position by end of year. There was initially some hesitancy but I think she understands now that I will be unhappy and leave if this ask is not met and that would be really bad for her because she has no idea how to do what I do and if I left things would crumble. 

Hoping to get some good advice here, any insights  on how to navigate going forward highly appreciated. I’d like to at least get promoted before I leave (since my responsibilities are way beyond even the position I’d get promoted to next) but at the same time this situation is terrible for my mental health and there’s a chance my career may be stagnant for longer than I’d like if I stick around. I can’t say I’m really happy with my level of advancement at this stage in my career.

1aswq9w,Better interest/ manager vs learning opp. ,"TLDR:
Need to choose between two teams: A / B
A: 
People manager that will nurture youngsters, will give a lot of support, opportunities and guidance. Also the job content interests me slightly more.

B:
Can involve in flagship project which is a good chance to learn a lot & meet a lot of people. The exposure will be great, applicable in the future and will be a great foundation for my career. Still rotating here and enjoying the work & can feel the personal growth


I am in a Graduate a.k.a Management Associate Program in the bank under technology dept and it would soon come to an end, so I would need to choose which team I would pick to commit to after all the rotations. After some consideration, I have shortlisted two final choices but I still struggle to get a final decision.

Team A(People Manager & personal interest)
- The manager is very nice and really care about you. I will get lots of support and guidance if i follow him
- Will think of you when there are opp. and is likely to highlight your achievements to the management, so more chance to be known by the seniors
- Personally more interested in the job content

Negative:
- Missed out the opp. to work on the biggest project, project with that scale rarely happens
- dependant on the manager? What if the manager leaves the bank?


Team B(Flagship project & learning opp.)
- In charge of the biggest project( modernising the whole backend systems) Involves almost every part of the bank and end to end study of business flow, systems etc. 
- can involve in end to end delivery of the project that last for years and will gain huge exposure
- will force you to grow learn from the project
- the manager used to be a CIO somewhere else, So very experienced but less caring type. 
- still rotating here, also enjoying the job here and can feel my growth
- you can learn what is needed in team A but not vice versa 

Negative:
- less attention to teammates. Need to grow on your own
- more tough cuz very challenging project (but i like how it sounds haha)

My thought is since im still in a very early stage of my career, as much as i like Team A more( just slightly) more like enjoying both, it might be best for me to experience bigger projects so i can learn more and have a good foundation to move forward.

1aspddx,I think I partially lied on my resume??,"So where I am from and the career I chose only one company can hire us unless you work in a private owned company which is very rare! The company came into my class before  our practicum and told us that as soon as we start our first day of practicum we can start applying to the company. Cool! So i started applying but on the application I put “still in progress” for school. My pracitcum is done now and I only have two assignments left for school which I could finish this weekend but technically everything is due next week which is the last day of classes. I started applying again but now I put that I completed school and that my certification is done. I got a call today from the company and I got an interview which I am very excited about!! But now I am paranoid that I might’ve lied? Technically I will be done everything before the interview, and I passed all my compentancies during practicum. But im not sure if this is a big factor or not that my classes aren’t technically done until next week. Am I just being paranoid or did I make a mistake?? Thanks! 
Btw they do hire students who are not done practicum because a couple of people in my classes got job offers while on practicum. My other classmate secured a job with the company with them knowing she has a couple of assignments left.

Mine is in sociology. I applied for a bunch of school teacher and counselor jobs didn’t expect them to call on this one. I actually didn’t pass geometry in high school or college lol but I enjoyed algebra and other math. 

My question is: is it worth it to go to the interview anyway for experience/networking/possible other teaching/counseling/school positions open up and to get my foot in the door/know people? 

Or should I call and cancel the interview and let them know I’m looking for other teaching jobs in other subjects/ counseling jobs? 

I hear school jobs are nice. (Summers, holidays, weekends off) so that’s what got me applying to these jobs.

Or the slim chance I somehow can grasp how to teach geometry. I remember formula for area of triangle lol.

1asol5w,First serious look for a job since pre-covid,"Hi everyone,

yer so in recent days ive finally bit the bullet and gone for a job interview that i might have felt worried about in the past due to low confidence and time constrictions.

current boss is constantly negative and all the put downs hence the lack of confidence. also doesnt seem to be able to manage any of my teammates properly but still gets at me for pointless silly things that arent an really issue with comparisons to what teammates do or ex teammates did. 

it got my down big time with mental health last year and finally i stuck up for myself in a robust way recently im too tired of all the comments dragging me down when my colleagues arent even turning up and using the companies time to do whatever they like while i bust my nuts off actually doing work and doing it well.

ive just had enough and found myself in a position to look.

it feels really weird though ive sort of checked out already although i could still not get the job ive interviewed for, I just know my time is done.

everything has seemed weird the last couple of days i feel like a totally new person and like the last 4/5 years never happened. 

feels so strange, can anyone relate in the times we have been though lately?

i guess i stuck out the job through the pandemic, cost of living crisis and dragged myself through the last year because i had a promotion. Just seems the whole while ive been just holding on for various reasons when in normal times i wouldn't of stayed at all.

also an ex sort of strongly urged me to take the role then promptly left just before the pandemic, guess if i find a new place, i move on from a lot of negative thoughts/feelings.

I would greatly appreciate any advice. I'm a slightly burnt-out chemical engineer working as a maintenance manager at a food production facility (Company A) for 2.5 years. I've been fortunate to score the highest annual review scores at our facility and seemingly have a promising career at Company A. Around 5 months ago, I asked for a raise as everyone except me working at or below my management level received an automatic 20% base salary raise; I was exempted from this automatic raise as I was told I already made more than the average manager because of merit bonuses I had received from my annual reviews. I was able to get an 8% raise to my salary (not base) off this notion by getting an offer from Company B. 5 months later, I've been feeling more and more burnt out as my boss and a number of coworkers have left. Accordingly, I reapplied for Company B and I'm stuck between the following:  
  
As a side note, I recently bought a house where I've been renting 2 out of my 4 rooms; I don't believe I would have a problem getting another renter to further cover the mortgage. In this instance, if I left Company A I would turn my house more into a rental property.

  
  
Company A:  
  
\- Salary: $93k/ year, the average bonus each year is around 9k-13k before taxes  
  
\- Schedule: 5 days x 10 hours on paper but the typical average day is 11- 12 hours. I'm also on call 24/7 for any facility needs which means I can be called in almost every day out of the week. I also work every 1/5 weekends.  
  
\- Location: Bakersfield, CA  
  


Company B:  
  
\- Offer: 115k salary/ year, 24k sign-on bonus, 20k bonus in Year 2, numerous restricted stock units  
  
\- Schedule: 4 days x 12 hours, rotating

1asm0bw,Seeking advice,"Need some help navigating this. I recently applied for a Head of Marketing position. I fulfilled about 90% of the criteria except that I haven’t held this exact position before. 

I really liked what the company did, so I went out of my way and made short report sharing how my values aligned with the company, my passion for EdTech, some of their good marketing initiatives and areas of improvement and ended it with my previous experience.

They responded with a single line stating that my experience was too light for the role.

2-3 days later, I reached out for a feedback since I had invested so much time on the report.

This is the feedback I received from the CEO:

Presentation is too generic.  We have serious traffic/operations - and your points are so high level they could apply to any company.  You don't present that you see the real strengths and weaknesses of <Company X>.

Cover letter is too generic - looks like the core of it has gone to other employers (as with the presentation too).  That shows a lack of depth of thinking... 

I don't care about your stories of your experience - you write too much - it is almost like you have something to confess!  Or that you are still gripped by regret on what happened.  I and other employers don't want to know. 

You did say one thing that captured my eye - our webinars.  Yes, they have not been revised for a long time - we need to upgrade our approach here big time. 

IF you want me to take a closer look, spend a little time on our Webinars and write me a short report on what you would change to present/promote/market them better.

Honestly, I have lost interest in the company now because I definitely don’t want to work with someone who behaves like this. 

But I’d still like to send a response.

1asjgrx,How to talk to manipulative boss?,"First off, even manipulation? Seems like manipulation and gaslighting. 

To keep the story shorter.. I’m a 1099 not even a regular employee. Realtor to be specific.  
My “boss” likes people to work in the office (boomer culture) not necessarily at all in my line of work. He likes people there at 8 AM. 
I go to office 2-4 days a week at 9 AM just to appease him. 

Well the other day he sat me down to say I don’t work enough and my business is falling apart. When I asked how he just says “I can see it” no specifics. He really talked down to me for about an hour until I said I’ll come in at 8 AM. (Took an hour just to confirm that’s what he wants). He thinks you aren’t working if he doesn’t see you. 


The next day I sat him down to tell him not to talk to me like that. He said I’m being emotional and I miss interpret everything. And he’s just trying to “help” me cause I have the most potential. I put my calendar in his face to show him all of my accomplished work and how him saying I’m not productive is un-factual. He basically said we are obviously on two different pages. 
Key phrases:
- you miss interpret everything 
- I’m trying to help you 
- I can’t coach you like this anymore (we have never had an issue in 2 years)
- you’re so emotional (I did say I feel unappreciated that you don’t see the work I accomplish - I meant that you say I’m doing no work and in fact I am doing well. Didn’t come out exactly that way)

1asj718,Deciding between two job offers,"Hi, long time lurker, first time poster. My current company is going through layoffs/restructuring and a such I'm interviewing for roles outside my company. I'm very seasoned in my career, but still only an individual contributor (although highly compensated). I currently make $117K with no bonus.

**Company A - Big bracket consulting firm. Prestigious, looks great on a resume**

Once a week in office, all other days remote allowed

$120K + 10% bonus + profit sharing

Same title as one I have now

Big bracket consulting firm. Prestigious, looks great on a resume

Great benefits, PTO, etc

My one concern is the interviewer asked if I was OK working 50 hours a week. He said this was about what he expected in order to progress at the firm.

**Company B - Healthcare nonprofit**

Remote but must reside in area for occasional meetings. (Can probably sneak off to Florida for a week or two)

Associate Director of Finance title - big plus

$130K + 3% bonus

Work life balance seems to be a priority

4 weeks PTO

My one concern is how this title will translate in the real world, and how nonprofit will be viewed. Shouldn't make a difference right?

**Conclusion**

What would you do? I'm 40 years old, just went through a divorce (no kids), and I'm not sure I have the energy/want to work 50+ hours. But friends say it might be worth it for the company name.

I'm leaning B, or option C. Stay and see what happens..

1asikz6,Losing my mind from organizing my role at work,"Looking for support: I’m 1.5 years in to a role at an organization that provides business education with a focus on social enterprise. I’m responsible for managing program alumni (1K entrepreneurs) and advisors (600 volunteers). Since the role is so new to the organization there isn’t much structure around success metrics. Does anyone have any tips about turning these two groups into self-sustaining communities where alumni can share resources and advisors can develop their professional network? My 90-day action plan gets more confusing the deeper I dive into this. I want to create events that help people explore social enterprise but not sure what topics to prioritize and our alumni pool ranges in stage of business (which means different needs) since we work with people at the earliest stage to ready to raise SEED funding. 

Factors:
-Not sure of my budget for 2024
-I manage incoming request through my inbox which doesn’t give me a clear record of requests
-we run 3 business development programs 2x a year
-we’re nonprofit with restricted funding 
-we use Salesforce as CRM
-we’re currently in the discovery phase of implementing a knowledge sharing platform

My supervisor created a group chat in team with me, her and the CEO of the company where she was been basically insulting me. Saying I need to be spoon fed, I’m too slow etc. It’s been a horrible experience and it’s too late to fix because I can’t just ask to go over things again after I’ve already been trained. I have the bare responsibilities of the job down pat but there’s a lot of miscellaneous tasks that I make mistakes in.

Hello everyone, I am last year ECON student with minor in MATHEMATICS. My gpa is quite high. However, compared to my peers, I'm falling behind when it comes to internships and experience. I have 2 internships ( financial analyst and business development intern ).  

I'm having hard time choosing career right for me. Masters degree applications are coming up but I don't even know which route I should take. I feel so confused. I don't know what each job does. My dad advises me to work in finance ( I have no clue about it , the internship didn't teach me much ) . But I myself want to work in Data related areas since it's high in demand. But I 'm not qualified for it since I don't have CS degree. I hate econ degree so much, I feel like drowning because of vagueness. 

Everyone around me seem to find their path except me. All I did was study hard and maintain high gpa, but learnt nothing about real life and jobs. 

I don't think my econ&math degree will assist me getting DS masters since all of the programs require cs or statistics diploma. I'm so lost. I just want to find my path and work towards it. I am ready to self-study and work hard. I am just so lost, don't know where to put my energy. My family is pressuring me to enroll into masters degree program so taking a gap year isn't an option.

I’m tired of working with people that I don’t have anything at all in common with for 8 hours a day, it’s honestly tiring and stressing me out having to engage in pointless conversation, small talk and childish work politics. I’m only turning up for the money while I figure a way to start making my own. everyday I’m stressing thinking of how I can cover what i make here but on my own, doing my own thing

so I need something working on my own, or ideally from home online, I don’t have any uni degrees or major qualifications so jobs that require them are kind of out the question.

I’ve worked a very physical job for 6 years I’m very hard working and hands on, my main priority is making sure who ever the job is for, is done correctly and they’re left happy. 

This isn’t a post on how can I retire at 23 and never work again I will work harder than the majority of people in my generation and I want to feel proud and say I worked hard for my money.

So Please let me know of any suggestions or paths that I can look into. 
Any services I can provide? 
Sub contract work?
Companies that hire people to complete tasks for them on a self employed basis?

Or even if theres anyone serious and has any business ideas let me know.

Please only comment if you have valuable suggestions respectfully🙏🏼

1asg30l,Stick with the promotion I just got…. Or take a different higher-stress but bigger payout offer?,"I have worked for a call center company for over a year and a half and finally got a promotion. I was one of the agents and three weeks ago got moved up to the role of Workforce Management Real-time Analyst.

But I’m conflicted. Here’s the backstory to why.

I was excited. Not that this is a career path I considered before taking the job, but it got me out of the role that gets treated poorly. Now I have status at my workplace. And it’s an overall easy job. It’s a lot of repetitive Excel work that’s just copy and pasting. It pays me $19 an hour. A dollar raise. But this company only gives out 25 cent raises a year. With no progression ahead of my role. But it’s a relaxed team and an easy job. Plus, workforce management jobs are plentiful and a lot of them are remote. I like the idea of gaining skills here to move onto a higher paying wfh job in this field one day. Plus, for now, this is a very tight-knit small team that is really awesome to work with.

But I also have loved the idea of getting into tech support. I have always wanted to go into the tech field. A position opened up at my dad’s company that I really wanted. And I just had the interview and was offered the job. It’s $20 an hour with a clear path to progression. They want this tier 1 support rep to be trained on a specific application, then move on to tier 2, and then when they expand further they plan to make that rep the application administrator for that specific technology. And they pay for college, have better raises, and have better benefits. But it would be high stress on the phones almost all day helping their workers in their stores with this application.

I’m an autistic person with a lot of social anxiety. I have never done tech support. I’ve done lots of other things. But not tech support. Except for T-Mobile customer service for two months but I gave up because it was too high stress. It would be less intimidating because this job wouldn’t be dealing with the public, but rather the company’s own employees.

So I’m conflicted on what would be best for me. I could stay at this easy promotion with less pay and progression, or I could make more money and be at a place with a lot more opportunity within the company.

What is your advice?

I am trying to develop a skill so that I can support my university education. I'm in asia. Part-times don't exist where I am. Honestly just looking for anything I could be able to do or develop that isn't something that wrecks my soul.

Got tasked with preparing a project brief for a new product line. Tons of holes in the ideas, getting stonewalled by VPs who don't have time for meetings or to respond to emails. Deadline to get the brief done was last Friday so I did what I could and pulled together a 40 slide brief and presented it to six directors, one SVP, and the CTO. Literally my first work for this company. My boss never raised any issues along the way but also wasn't super involved and didn't seem to know exactly what format they even should use to get this off the ground.

Today I get an email from my boss, senior director who tells me that my work didn't meet expectations and it sounds like the cto ripped him a new one over it. So I'm getting thrown under the buss despite being brand new to the team. What is this shit? Are they just trying to see how I respond to criticism? They can't possibly be actually relying on a 2 month new PM for something important, can they?

Now I get to spend months proving that I am not incompetent. So dumb.

1asezp3,Data related jobs salary expectation / saturation in the field,"I had posted this on a different sub-reddit, specifically on a Maltese one since I live in Malta. So the subsequent information when it comes to universities may not be familiar to all of you, especially when it comes to actual salary conversations since it differs so highly for every country. Nonetheless, I would still like to get as opinion from as many people on it as I can. 

&#x200B;

I am a 20 year old software development student doing my Bachelor's at Mcast (Malta college of art sciences and technologies). I will graduate in 2025 and plan on focusing highly on Data engineering / Data science / Data architect / Machine learning Engineering.  
  
I will do my Masters at UOM (University of Malta) on either AI or Data science(or both) and even plan on going into managerial roles in the future, perhaps with an MBA plus doing my PHD(But these are too distant to plan them thoroughly at the moment).  
  
I already have made plenty of research on the aforementioned positions and have been spending all my free time on further increasing my knowledge on the different tools and technicalities of each field. This will obviously take me months if not over a whole year to go through most things and more importantly understand and integrate them into my projects.(Including learning other important technologies such as OOP/ Git/Github/ Docker/ DSA and much more which are highly valuable to companies and to myself)  
  
I am aware as to how highly ambitious this all sounds and the consistency it requires so I may be called crazy. But I am genuinely this eager on trying to gain such a competitive edge in mastering data related tools so that I can be worth a high value in the data world and in return reap the rewards. Of course, one step at a time.  
  
To change this paragraph a bit and add on more detail. Since posting this 3 weeks ago I have actually managed to grab myself an internship while also adding on 2 more decent projects to my github since January, so progress has been quite good. My question is what type of salaries could data engineers expect  especially in the Igaming industry when starting out? Especially when a candidate has such good education (Having also done the erasmus exchange) , experience (Apprenticeship and internship) and portfolio? Is a salary of 40-45k which can maybe be negotiated to 36k for example unrealistic provided I keep working hard to stay at the front? 

&#x200B;

I have also been hearing a lot that the data science field has become highly saturated yet at the same time most people lack most of the skills, does this mean if you really prove your worth and know what your doing that you can get a high paying job? What are your thoughts on this? Moreover, I don't mind going into machine learning engineering either as I am sure it is also highly rewarding aswell as fascinating. So I would love to hear about that aswell!

&#x200B;

If you read all this I highly appreciate it and would love to hear your input, positive or critical :)

1asdz7c,How to transition to a non-creative role?,"For the majority of my career I (35) was a freelance graphic designer, illustrator and animator so the way I found work was by sending out my portfolio. My CV was always secondary to keeping my portfolio filled and up to date. I worked mostly with agencies in advertising, editorial and social media.

Anyway, like most people I had a rough time of it during COVID and after some pretty serious mental health struggles I took some less demanding jobs and have most recently worked in a book shop and a bar. Now I'm looking at getting back to full time work but I'm realising I have basically no idea how to apply for non-creative jobs. 

My portfolio is no longer online since I stopped paying the hosting fee. I can switch it back on, but the latest work is from 2019 so I don't even know how useful/relevant that would be. I don't really want to go back into the same industry since it broke my brain last time, plus it's so much more competitive now, especially since AI has replaced much of the work I used to do. I'm not opposed to working as a designer for a charity or something so I imagine I'd need my portfolio for that.

So does anyone have any advice/experience with changing fields from creative to... non-creative?

I have no idea what industry I'd like to work in, I'm open to just about anything as long as it's not advertising.

1asdb5o,Unsure how to proceed with hostile(?) director,"For some background, I am on a relatively large team. I used to report to a man who we will call Bob, but then he hired someone who is now my manager, Greg. So Bob is now my boss’s boss, not sure how to refer to him, but he is a director now.

Anyway, I recently came back from mat leave and I had my review shortly after coming back. During my review, I was honest and direct (but professional/polite) about my goal of being promoted in the next year or so. I’ve always been passive about my career progression and I think it has not been in my favor, but Bob has always complimented me on being the “easy child” on our team while promoting the more “difficult children” and not me.

So I came back and was like, “I really want to be promoted this year and would like to outline a clear plan for a year to know what types of things can get me to a promotion.” Well Bob reacted very negatively, but Greg later told me that I did a great job clearly communicating my goals and asking to work together and develop a plan.

Now Bob has been extremely standoffish to me. I have also been told by several people (including my peers on our team) that Bob has been speaking negatively about me and my career goals. It is clear to me that a promotion is not coming, but also the environment feels hostile now (and I mean hostile in a personal sense, not the legal definition). 

I am actively looking for another job, but not getting much traction (which is unusual for me, I think the market is just tough for my role atm). But I am applying every day. Besides that, how should I proceed? I don’t feel that going to HR would work in my favor… I feel like maybe I should just drop the promotion talk, keep my head down, and push on until I get a new job?",cakeit-tilyoumakeit,2,1.0,5,1708102173,2024-02-16 16:49:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1asdb5o/unsure_how_to_proceed_with_hostile_director/,2,2024

1asb0ht,I recently graduated architecture and feel like I know nothing. How do I become better at my field?,"I'm a recently graduated architect who feels like they know nothing. How can I improve myself?

Hi. I graduated architecture and urbanism in one of the best schools in Brazil (at least I've been told so) but I feel like I have not learned anything useful, due to a mixture of the course not being aligned with my interests and simply me not being a great student. I'm overflown with regret most days.

I had 2 internships and one job in which I made very little money, so I ended up quitting and only working small projects that came my way via a couple clients. Nothing interesting, nothing worthy of being placed in a portfolio. I just started an MBA focusing on BIM, but have had no classes yet so I have no idea where that's going.

I feel like I lack basic stuff and know nothing besides autocad and revit. I have no idea how to design anything and don't know how to acquire that knowledge. How can I bring my skills and knowledge to a level in which I'd be confident in calling myself an architect? 

Also work is very hard to find where I live and pretty much 99% of jobs are internships paying nothing (which I've been through). Architecture in Brazil is famous for being a field for those with family already in it, so suckers like me who only found that out after enrolling have a hard time finding qork that pays above minimum wage.

I know it's probably an unrealistic expectation, but I wanted to find work outside of my country, is there a chance for me? Which countries should I be looking at? What should I focus on?

I know it may be hard, but if it's possible I'd be willing to put in the work. I have to at least compensate for what I didn't learn at school.

It took me almost 10 years to finish my education because I did all kinds of random things in my 20s. Life experience was more important for me at a young age, but now I have no savings.

I feel that me being 30 and still having no direction is a problem for recruiters. What would your advice be? I have been applying to starting positions and keep getting rejected at different stages. I constantly have to do tests and cases and it's been almost 6 months. I feel like process consulting isn't me leading to anything and not salary-wise. I want to transition to more lucrative opportunities in IT consulting, (IT) strategy consulting, or management consulting.  
Now I have 3 opportunities, which would be best for my long-term career?  
I got 3 offers in:  
**- IT consulting in public sector;**  
Long projects not a lot of diversity in clients in a short time.  
Very experienced colleagues and opportunity to get TOGAF certified etc  
No private sector experience, exit opportunities are unclear for me to be honest  
**- Consultant in digital strategy & transformation**  
Diverse projects and clients  
Learning opportunities are unclear because my current certifications are relevant  
Exit opportunity would be IT strategy consulting  
**- Traineeship as a junior freight trader**  
International professional work experience and specialization  
High pay (72-96k) I currently make 42k a year.  
High workload, plus steep learning curve (I have zero knowledge)  
i'd have to relocate to geneva and completely different from my current experience  
Exit opportunities are unclear  
I have the feeling the traineeship will be very valuable experience even if i did not pursue moving a job later in freight trading.  But I'd have to move to Singapore eventually.

1asaf8y,Advice on Switching Jobs Right After Starting a New One,"I recently took a new position at a Chamber of Commerce after nearly five years working in government. While the job has its benefits - my boss is the opposite of micromanaging, hybrid schedule, pay is good - I have not been enjoying other parts and I'm thinking of leaving only three months in.

I was brought on to do advocacy and grassroots work as a government relations professional but I essentially have become an event planner for the four committees I oversee (which meet monthly) and the eight events I have during the year. I spend more time thinking about what speakers I need and what topics my events should cover than I do focusing on advocacy efforts for the organization. Additionally, the committees I oversee have board members on it who think they are my boss - I understand respecting the board but they are expecting me to essentially do whatever they think is the best way to do something. 

I also have the smallest budget of any department, the only senior leadership position without anyone under me (the others have at least three staff members under them) and we don't even have an advocacy platform for me to push out action alerts on our priority items, which makes me feel they aren't particularly interested in investing in the government relations department despite claiming they want to beef up the department when I was hired. I have talked to my boss about getting help to help take the event administrative stuff off my plate but they claim there isn't enough money in the budget.

Which brings me to today - I was offered a job doing PR and grassroots advocacy for roughly the same salary at a really small PR firm. The job would be fully remote and there would be no event work. While I still need to do pros and cons of each, what would you say to my current boss should I decide to take this new offer? I don't want to necessarily burn too many bridges, though I'm not an idiot and know they will feel some type of way about me leaving. Would I just tell them I felt that the role was not exactly what I was expecting and there is a lack of investment in my department compared to others?",Noleman990,3,1.0,1,1708095072,2024-02-16 14:51:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1asaf8y/advice_on_switching_jobs_right_after_starting_a/,2,2024

1asa6wd,"Employee Doing Too Much ""Professional Development""","I have an employee who is pretty good at her job, but has been in my ear about using work hours to participate in professional development opportunities. Things like conferences, workshops, panels, joining organizations, etc. The thing is, a lot of these ""development"" opportunities do not directly relate to her actual job, but are great at developing her character, general skills, and for networking.

In the past, we've told employees that if we weren't directly sponsoring or promoting a professional development opportunity, that our staff would need to take time off to participate. She doesn't think this is fair and feels we are stifling her growth. How do I have this conversation that, during work hours, you need to be doing things related to your role or things we've already approved?

Also to add - this person does a LOT of ""professional development"". I can't have employees spending 50% of their time at conferences, workshops, etc. while the rest of my team is picking up her slack and staffing the office. I feel like ""forcing"" her to use her time off is the only method to deter this excessive time away from her actual day-to-day responsibilities.

Lastly - any concerns readers have about her using PTO, we work for the state, which dictates our time off policies (I don't have any control over PTO). Staff have 22 **days** of vacation/year, 5 personal **days**, 10 paid holidays, and accrue 1 ""sick day"" every month (which never expire).

I graduated in Accounting and have experience with payroll/accounts payable jobs. I live in a really LCOL area where wages suck, and recently found a job 7 min near my home (which is perfect!). It pays $15. They wanted me so bad that even said theyll give me $15/hour plus $1000 sign in bonus (went up from the original $10/hour posting). They also said they give employees free lunches daily (I guess they do this for tax write offs).  
  
It's been two weeks and this has happened:  
  
No sign in bonus yet. And I'm kind of scared to ask because the manager scares me and I'm kinda shy.  
  
First day they said I'm not included in the free lunch thing (to cut down costs). There's 11 employees in the main office and I'm the only one that has to bring lunch from home.  
  
They don't pay overtime. They strictly want people to clock in at 9 and leave at 6. So at 8:50 am there's already a line of people waiting 10 minutes to clock in.  
  
They barely implemented vacations this year. Before you had to ask for time off and hope it got accepted. But now they're expanding and stuff.

I work half a day in this company and very little work because I already built a BI flow to update all the stuff daily.  
  
The second company is a not-for-profit company, which mostly does events to raise awareness to protect the environment and species.

Both companies are startups, so I can only use Google Sheets (for tracking databases) and PBI (create Dash to track daily metrics - descriptive data).

1as7cnv,"My boss is quitting, should I be worried about management’s coverage plan?","My current supervisor’s last day is tomorrow, she is quitting due to her manager micro-managing her and claiming she doesn’t do any work (which is not true to my knowledge). I am currently a “level 2” and have some overseeing responsibilities, we do not have a “level 3” person on our team to take on the supervisor’s duties. The manager put a transition plan into place last minute including: 
-a supervisor from a different department will be overseeing our team and acting as the “administrative supervisor”, which she knows nothing about the daily reports and duties of our team and what she needs to do as a supervisor (no one has initiated any trainings for her)
-a level 3 from the same department the supervisor is coming from will become our “team lead” and be the point of contact for questions, process clarifications, assistance with problems, etc 

I asked why I was not chosen for the team lead role as I already know many of the ongoing daily activities and processes of our team, and was told I am only a level 2 and they need a level 3 to take over even though she isn’t familiar with our department. So I can understand that view point to an extent. 

I am very worried that because the administrative supervisor and new team lead are so unfamiliar with everything in our department, I will need to train both of them and educate them on everything while also doing my usual work and training the new hires I’ve been working with. There was no planning once the old supervisor put in her resignation and everything is being handled last minute. If I am unable or simply do not have the time to get both administrative supervisor and team lead caught up on everything they need to know, could the blame be placed on me for problems arising?

1as7aci,Employer is trying to put my husband on a performance plan but says it’s mainly to protect company in case another employee sues them…wtf???,"My husband just started at this company. Hasn’t even completed his onboarding or knows what his goals are.

A female employee who has consistently caused problems with other staff, was causing problems with him since he started. His boss was supposed to be addressing it with her.

His boss left on leave and all hell broke loose.

She is claiming his work has “gross” inaccuracies, called his work high-school level, etc. she’s claiming he’s violating policy by missing deadlines, having typos, etc. 

She invokes mental and physical health issues frequently and has to “step away.” This happens when there’s something my husband is doing that she doesn’t agree with. 

She claimed that she doesn’t feel like he respects her and is dismissive of her. 

This is so effing bonkers. 

During an HR meeting where they were supposed to come to a resolution, she brought a folder of examples and underlined in the handbook each policy that she thought he was violating.

She was interrogating him like he had committed a crime.

She was asked why she didn’t address these with him before now and she claims she feels “uncomfortable.”

Let’s go back to his 2nd day where this lady tried adding him on Facebook. He doesn’t add anyone from work. He has two friends from work who he was connected with before joining. I feel like this is the cause of what she’s doing. I feel she has a personal vendetta against him. 

I feel like his employer gave this chick the keys to do a performance review on him - she’s a subordinate!

When that wasn’t good enough, she accused him of sexism for assigning her a project. When in fact, it was his boss and another female employee who did this.

And he has to deal with missed deadlines, typos, etc all of the time. He addresses it directly with his reporters instead of running to HR like a crazy person.

Now, they’re wanting to put him on a performance plan. How can that be when he’s not even been informed of these issues previously and it’s being based off what another employee is saying?

What’s really messed up about this is that they’re telling him it’s only because they want to protect the company against this crazy person in case she “goes off the deep end.”

What I’m seeing is a lady who is targeting my husband. Everyone misses deadlines and makes errors now and then. But for some reason, she’s only collecting info on him instead of everyone else’s work that she edits.

Is this enough for my husband to file a grievance? Can we take legal action against her and or the company?

1as75ej,How to find new jobs when all my experience is in creative fields?,"For the majority of my career I (35) was a freelance graphic designer, illustrator and animator so the way I found work was by sending out my portfolio. My CV was always secondary to keeping my portfolio filled and up to date. I worked mostly with agencies in advertising, editorial and social media.  
Anyway, like most people I had a rough time of it during COVID and after some pretty serious mental health struggles I took some less demanding jobs and have most recently worked in a book shop and a bar. Now I'm looking at getting back to full time work but I'm realising I have basically no idea how to apply for non-creative jobs. 

My portfolio is no longer online since I stopped paying the hosting fee. I can switch it back on, but the latest work is from 2019 so I don't even know how useful/relevant that would be. I don't really want to go back into the same industry since it broke my brain last time, plus it's so much more competitive now, especially since AI has replaced much of the work I used to do. I'm not opposed to working as a designer for a charity or something so I imagine I'd need my portfolio for that.

So does anyone have any advice/experience with changing fields from creative to... non-creative?  
I have no idea what industry I'd like to work in, I'm open to just about anything as long as it's not advertising.

1as4toq,Have I made a bad decision? ,"
I currently earn £25K a year in my first marketing role. 

Living at home, position is WFH so I pay no rent and me and my partner are saving to purchase home. 

Looking for a new position now after two years. 

Company I had an interview for was offering £32K. However it is office based, in quite a remote spot. 

This would involve renting a place in the nearest city, a 50 minute drive away in order to take the job. Renting closer is not a possibility. 

I turned the offer down, despite their good reputation and salary increase, as I felt it would not be financially sound spending £1K per month to rent / bills while still having nearly two hours of driving on top of that daily.

Would this have been worth it for the good position or have I made a smart choice? I have been receiving plenty of interest in places I have applied, having only started applying for places in past two weeks, so thinking is to hold out for a similar role without the commute.

I'm in my mid-30s (f) and have been at my current job for four years. At first, I really looked up to my boss and appreciated the chance he gave me.

I've worked hard and gained my boss’s trust over the years. But a recent project that got canceled left me feeling exhausted and angry at my boss. I realized during this project that he's not a good manager.

Now that the project's over, there's no work for our team. I'm stuck at the office from 9 to 6 every day, not doing much. It's really discouraging. HR checks staff movement and I can’t even go outside without feeling anxious. 

I'm thinking about quitting or taking time off, but I can't because of visa issues. I've also been applying for other jobs, but I'm feeling tired and not as excited as before. I'm considering switching to fields like tech or sustainability for better opportunities, but I don't have much experience there.

I've been studying for so long (bachelor’s and masters degree) and have always been working during these years, never taking a break. Now I wonder if taking a break might help. But deep down I’m also afraid that I won’t come back, especially if I have children in a few years.

Im a senior working towards my bachelors in computer science and will be graduating in may. Since July I've been working at a some what large steel company which i will leave unnamed. my official title was an inventory specialist , but about a month in the plant manager found out what i was doing in college and asked if i would be capable of doing this small project for him in regards to creating quotes for our customers, while i wasn't too sure , i still agreed to take it on. Fast forward to today, I am no longer an inventory specialist and I'm working on this project full time while also handling all of their IT related tasks at the plant whether that be hardware or network issues. This project , which started as a simple quoting system to auto calculate and track quotes , has now turned into a web based, multi department/multi-location utility management system for tracking quoting, maintenance management, Expense Reporting, Training , and accident reporting. I've invested hundreds of hours creating this system on my own and teaching myself multiple languages that college has not taught me .  
  
While I'm confident that this guarantees me a job out of college ( which i know many people don't have the luxury of) , I am worried that my work is going to be extremely under valued. I've asked for a raise a few times and was told that im already being paid generously at $23/hr, which is what ive been at since i started here. I have gotten constant praise from my boss, as well as the directors above him as well as other plant managers about how this is going to ""Completely change the way we do things in this company"".  
  
At the end of the day, im a broke college student afraid for what comes after college and i was just wondering what your guys' approach to this would be?

I feel seriously terrified at the thought. ,"For context, I’ve been working at my job as an accountant for a little under two years. In that time, I’ve been moved around a lot but found stability in the past year under my current boss. I initially was assigned to work under her due to her workload being too much for her to handle alone.

We’ve been working together for a little under a year now. I’ve worked on most of her projects, but she did a lot of the difficult portions of them (such as forecasting or particularly difficult subcontract coordination).

She’s found a better job and seems to be leaning towards taking it. I totally understand her position and I’m genuinely happy for her, because she works hard and deserves the promotion she wasn’t getting through our company.

However, I’m terrified of taking on all her work. She thinks it’s a great way for me to get promoted and grow within the company, which I agree with. But I feel like I’m not ready.

But also, the world won’t wait until I’m ready to give me opportunities for growth. 

I’m just very terrified. There’s so much I feel like I don’t know. Of course, I know I can ask our other colleagues for help. But most of them have their own ways of doing things, and I’m not sure how much they could help me.

1arzwdo,How to find the right career advisor,"I'm a scientist who has had a bit of a hybrid employment history between self-employment / consulting and working in physical labs, and have generally had the financial freedom to work for someone else pretty much whenever I felt like it / whenever it benefitted me.

I'm newly in my 40s and the experience I've had searching for roles is different than it was in my 30s. For the first time, I'm getting comments that they want to see more time in previous roles, I went to an interview and noticed that one manager had actually calculated in the margins my time between traditional employment roles on my resume.

I have a lot of really impressive accomplishments behind me, and while showing off like a star candidate worked in my 30s, that seems to matter less now mattering less than looking like a flight risk (or worse, having people assume that there's something wrong with me because of the gaps in working for ""someone else""). I'm not sure how much of it is the current career market, how much of it is me entering a new age bracket, and how much of it is just bad salesmanship in my resume. But I definitely think I'm struggling with branding and how to package it.

I've been interviewing for senior and management roles and usually get shortlisted but frequently treated like a silver medalist. I've had frequent comments to the effect that they'd ""like to see more tenure in previous positions"". Honestly, I like variety and change, and am completely happy working somewhere for a short time, solving a really hard problem that everyone else banged their heads against, and then moving on to something new. And I have the history to prove that's exactly what I do best. But most of the places I've interviewed recently have preferred the resumes of more mediocre folks with no noteworthy accomplishments, but who had their butt in the same seat for the past 8 years. I've found this to be true even for 6 month contract roles.

But I'm not generally very good at ""creative writing"" in a resume, but I've learned that complete honesty on a resume isn't necessarily the best policy when it comes to portraying yourself as the strongest candidate. So my impression is that I need to find a career advisor who has experience with non-traditional employment and can can help me package my experience in a better way - ideally someone a little south of Polyanna but somewhere north of Saul Goodman. I don't need to portray skills I don't have, just package it in a more compelling way.",Uthgaard,2,1.0,2,1708057942,2024-02-16 04:32:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1arzwdo/how_to_find_the_right_career_advisor/,2,2024

1arwgor,Applying elsewhere after 3.5 months. How bad is it?,"I wasn’t really looking for a new job, but I received a message from a recruiter for a finance opening at a company that my husband works for. I don’t mind the job I currently have, although my boss drives me nuts at times. There are no annual bonuses where I work currently and I’m pretty sure the pay raises will be minimal. Promotion won’t be for another 4-5 years. 

At this new company that I’m thinking about applying to, it would be a $10,000 pay increase as well as a sign-on bonus, although I’m not sure how much it would be. Really the only reason I can think about leaving my current company is the pay difference and bonus potential. I also have a small concern of being laid off at my current company due to the history of the company laying off employees.

1arw8u5,Applying to be a manager feels weird now…,"So, as a little background, I work on a small team in a big company and I’ve been in my role as one of the SMEs under my manager for five years now. My manager recently accepted another role and his spot is open.

I have been talking to the hiring manager (my boss’s boss) about the open spot and expressed interest in learning different parts of the job outside of what my manager’s role with my team involves. He managed a few different things that I don’t have experience in but I feel like I could learn them. My coworkers were both on board with me applying. I specifically asked them before I made any moves because I wanted to avoid anyone feeling weird about me possibly stepping into a role as their manager. All of my coworkers were fine with it.

Today, a week after I started looking into the role, one of my coworkers told me that they are also discussing applying for the job with the hiring manager. I’m not… mad… it’s a free country and I trust the hiring manager’s judgement to pick the best person for the spot. I still genuinely like the person I work with and think highly of them. I also think that we both have skills that could lend well to the job.

But now this feels yicky, for lack of a better word. I have been on the team for five years, compared to their one year, and I’m the colleague that trained them (and several other colleagues before them). I have always been a kind of leader on the team in every sense but my literal job title and I was clear in my intentions to apply for the job. Now it feels like there’s a poaching attempt…

I really appreciate them being forward and telling me that they are going for it but now I’m feeling all the awkwardness that I had wanted to avoid when I asked if they were okay with me applying! What the heck am I supposed to do here?",KimbersKimbos,1,1.0,1,1708046810,2024-02-16 01:26:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1arw8u5/applying_to_be_a_manager_feels_weird_now/,2,2024
1arvomd,I reported a sexual assault at work and now there is an investigation.,"As you can see from the title I reported a sexual assault from an employee at work. 

This employee and I were in a romantic relationship in 2022 and during it, at home, I took an edible and was vastly incoherent and could not walk or talk and I could barely walk straight. I was talking to him as he was coming out of the shower and I remember laying on the bed and I don’t remember much. Then next thing I know he is inside of me and I am afraid and just let him finish. I pretended to be fine but internally I was freaking out. Then afterwards we carried on with our day at the pumpkin patch and I was questioning everything saying, “What just happened?” And he said that I wanted to have sex. I just said, “okay.” I did not. For months after the event I was not okay. Eventually he broke up with me after I self harmed and forced to move out of the home we shared.

Work was incredibly difficult for the following year and in February or March of 2023 I opened up to a coworker about the situation. She and I were mutual friends. I thought I could confide in her and she told me she would no longer we be friends with Corey. And so she texts me in March that she no longer is and we are no longer talking anymore at work. So it is quite awkward and tense. Then I notice her changes and she talks to him again.

I feel extremely tense and miserable at work and I report the situation in confidence to HR, but tell her I do not want to inform the larger bosses about the matter and am afraid of getting others in trouble but just wanted to inform her of his behavior so to keep an eye on him.

This year on February 13, I texted the ex-friendafter work essentially saying, “Hey,
Just wanted to let you know I spoke with (his name) last week and let him know he raped me and everything and he still was not a good person about it and tried to gaslight me but he knows everything now. HR also knows as well yet nothing was done. So it looks like we are still working with someone who does that to people under the influence.

I am not sure why you still chose to befriend a rapist after like 4 months of not contacting them, instead of someone who was clearly hurting from the situation. I really am sorry for opening up to you, I thought you could be a friend in that time and it was hurtful how you chose to befriend him instead. Especially considering how you said you went through something similar.” 
And I just wanted to say my piece because it was hurtful for her betrayal.

Then yesterday on 2/14 I am called in with HR and bigger boss about the situation saying they are looking into the situation and will investigate. I was crying and telling them I do not want to be fired based on this. And how I do not want anyone in trouble. They understand, meeting ended, they relay what I said in an email.

I responded this morning saying, “I appreciate this; however, I don’t think there’s really anything to investigate. I didn't go to the police afterwards and just keep things bottled up. I spoke with him last week and he didn’t say anything regarding that situation. I don’t want this situation affecting my work environment at all, so I just want everything to be normal again. 

I am unsure if any coworkers who know somewhat of the situation came forward on my behalf but what I said in September still rings true: I don’t really want (bosses) involved in this. I just want everything to be normal. I understand me coming forward is quite shocking and difficult news as he has worked here for a long time and at the time I was unsure if this is a pattern of behavior, so I just wanted to notify you to protect others in the office.

I really appreciate the sentiment and concern for my safety; however, I think it is best that we move past this situation. This is extremely uncomfortable as is and I don’t want to be terminated based on coming forward about someone else’s actions.” 
(I spoke with the man who raped me last week saying everything and how it affected me. I reiterated it in text as well. No response from him except to chime and say that’s not how it went.)

And HR responds with “I’m obligated to report this and investigate and of course you won’t be terminated for coming forward about a concern.” And I don’t know what to say or do.
I called the RAINN hotline and scheduled an appointment with a local rape victim office to speak with attorneys and I’m just scared. I don’t want to be fired. I don’t know if speaking up was even right to do. I’m scared and I need help. I’ve been looking for other jobs for 7 months and no luck whatsoever. I don’t want to have to start over from nothing for coming forward.",throwaway48681,1,0.3199999928474426,9,1708045196,2024-02-16 00:59:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1arvomd/i_reported_a_sexual_assault_at_work_and_now_there/,2,2024

My parents recently lost tenants in their property out of state. After some discussion the topic came up and an offer was made to purchase the property. 

I have worked at my job for a year now. The role is in analytics/ computer science . As a new employee I am automatically enrolled in a two program requiring travel and for the role to be hybrid and not fully remote. Other people are able to work remote as the decision ultimately falls on to the managers. I know people who have almost entirely remote arrangements but haven’t seen that for entry level employees. 

I am able to request an ADA accommodation meanwhile I’m on the fence as the property is out of state and there is a general requirement from my manager to be in person- I have met the requirements for a year. 

As the house is closer to family. I can also make the argument that I want to be closer to my family. 

The role is in a very niche and distinguishing field. Making it difficult to find similar roles in city the property is located.

I am being asked to document every single task I work on throughout the day and how long it takes to get done, I am being asked to step up and work overtime with no extra pay, and at the end of the day this person tells me I haven't done enough.

This person made it clear I would be put on a performance review, I tried speaking to HR but that didn't help either and I am left feeling helpless. 

It almost feels like I've been put in a toxic relationship with no way out. This person has told me no one would hire me despite me having years of experience and being easy going and task-driven in previous jobs. I have never heard this person, or anyone else complain about me or the work I put out until recently. My only suspicion is this person has someone else in mind they'd like to hire.

1arsv3t,Is it realistic to get a job locked down before I have finished my degree?,"A little background:

I am currently a master’s student in an advanced data analytics program. This is my last semester of regular classes and then I have one more capstone course that I will take this summer which will complete my masters degree. I am also completing two professional certificates, one in Data Science and the other in Full Stack Development, which I should be finished with by the time I graduate. 

At this point in the degree program, I have already completed all of the core classes and have a sound understanding of the analytics life cycle and processes. Additionally many of my classes focused on Data Science and machine learning. In addition to the theoretical knowledge, I’ve done multiple projects and case studies that are using current data and various current industry topics. 

I have been applying to jobs and internships of all sorts for quite a while now. So far I have only heard back from a handful, and only had an interview with 2. I’ve been trying to build up my network as well, however most of this is online through things like LinkedIn and other career boards. I don’t really know the best way to go about this in person since my degree program is online so I don’t have access to something like an in person career fair. 
Are there networking opportunities/in person career fairs I can pursue that aren’t necessarily hosted by a university)
During undergrad, I knew LOTS of people who had a full time job offer already before they had graduated, some of whom had completed an internship with that company, but also others who had just applied and got an offer. 




Is there something I am not doing/should be doing to be able to accomplish this? I’m currently just working a sales job while I finish school to pay the bills, but I would much prefer to be doing something that is more relevant to my degree. Or is it unrealistic to want to get a job lined up before I’ve completely finished my degree? 

Everything I’ve read so far just talks about how difficult it is to get a job right now, and how I’m competing with other skilled applicants.

1arsug8,Tips on switching industries but same job?,"Hi all,

I’ve been working in higher education marketing for a while now. It all started when I was a student, hustling with multiple part-time gigs around campus. Landing a job in university just kinda fell into my lap.

Working at a university is pretty chill. I get 40 days of vacation plus three weeks off during school closure, the stress levels are low, and decent pay. But here’s the thing - no matter how fancy the university is (I work at a global T10 university), promotions are pretty much reserved for professors. So, I’ve been hopping from one job to another to climb the ladder, but it’s becoming quite tiresome. 

Lately, I’ve been thinking about making a switch to an industry with big multinational companies, like in finance and banking. To be fair, before I graduated, I wanted to work in a “corporate” environment anyway. Last year, I even had four final round interviews with major banks around early 2023. But since then, my luck seems to have run dry. No interview invites for the rest of the year.

Any thoughts, experiences, or tips on navigating this industry change?

Thank you!

The company I am working at now is nice and the pay is decent but I am feeling very bored , unsatisfied, and wanting a change . We use a very old tech stack that is not really being used anywhere else besides this company and there is no communication between the developers so it feels like I am working all by myself every single day. This is a remote position by the way. I feel like I am still kind of young and want the feeling of being in a collaborative environment with working with people in person. But then I think to myself if I have an in person job I will miss remote work immediately. I also want to prove to myself that I can change jobs if I desire to.

I do have an issue with not trying to get more interviews because I don't think I am ready for it, so I just go in a circle of that process. I also make an excuse of not wanting to live more actual life because I think to myself I need to find another job and I need to work on side projects but don't take on many interviews because I think I am not ready yet. It's been this cycle for years and feel like I am just going in circles. When I do do some interviews it makes want to just focus on working on side projects more because of not getting it so I won't try to do interviews for like months after that.  
  
I want to break out of this cycle and find a new position that is something new to continue to progress my career with a change of environment. I feel like I'm feeling like this is affecting my performance at my current job and my mental health.

1arrr39,How to get hired for lower roles coming from a higher role? ,"Tried searching in this sub but I'm possibly not using the right keywords and gave up. Long post ahead.

TL;DR - Single parent desperate for a source of income and practically homeless

To my question above, I have 10+ years of experience and was recently in a senior management position but it has been a real struggle to find a job.

I've applied for middle positions so the salary cut is still a reasonable amount (enough to survive and save for a rented home) and I've kept my recent work history. If I edit my resume to tone it down to my past middle roles, the gap in years is hard to explain or to put it simply I have no idea what to say really. 

I get interviews and questions about why I'm stepping down or am I going to be happy with this much salary or why I should be a good fit since I'm mostly overqualified. 

My answers range from:

- Better work-life balance and more attention for my family with the responsibilities in the job post

- I don't mind the pay cut if the responsibilities match the compensation (for example non of the senior management duties and also connecting this to more time for childcare)
 
- Joining a company that fits me (theirs) and I don't mind starting from the position they have an opening for as I'm confident I can deliver good work and promotions can potentially follow

While the above are true, the unsaid reality is I really, really need the income. And they know this and that I possibly won't stay long if or when I get a better-paying job. 

I've applied to roles relevant to my previous position too but even with series of interviews I've not gotten a job offer yet. Thankfully these were all virtual so far cause I have nowhere to leave my son if I'm heading out for an interview. 

My challenge is that I don't have and cannot afford a personal laptop to do remote work. I only have a cheap smartphone. I sold my former phone long ago to tide us. I also sold any extra possessions that doesn't fit in 2 backpacks. The money didn't last long. I can't get a larger loan that would afford me a serviceable laptop.

I tried applying to customer service roles and whatever is in demand but again I've had no job offers even after interviews and daycare is too expensive to keep that going while I'm looking for better-paying jobs.

I've done all I can for us to survive and this mostly is relying on charity. I cry almost every night but I have to keep strong for my child. 

How do I get hired?

1aroukt,How to advance towards HR? SHRM Certificate?,"Howdy, I've had an on and off career in communication design for the past 5 years via contract assignments with different agencies/industries. However, after two years of recent experience communicating with and assisting clients as an administrative assistant I want to pursue an HR career instead as I think I would enjoy and do well in it. I'm not sure what education experience, if any, I need to enter HR effectively though.  
  
I have a bachelors in Design and a minor in Business Administration; I'm just not sure if going back to college is necessary or if a certificate would be the better route? I don't want to waste time or money, so I am also wondering if I should just buckle in and use the recent experience I've gained to keep applying to new jobs.  
  
My recent experience is as follows:  
  
temp worker| Benefits Consultant and Talent Acquisitions Specialist for a leading early childhood education agency (5months)  
  
temp worker| Civil Servant for the state of Washington's unemployment claims (4months)  
  
(current) part time| Administrative Assistant for a high level federal training agency (1 yr 4 months)

So for that reason and because I don't have employer covered medical insurance I am anxious daily about my future.  
  
Does anyone have recommendations for how I can pivot my career towards HR or continue developing as an administrative assistant? I love working to coordinate activities and resources to connect people.

1aroopd,Need advice on how to handle a situation with the owner.,"So im a home inspector and I work for another inspector who's also the owner. I quick my other job 3 and a half years ago to go work with this owner as much as possible (he didn't say I had to or anything I just decided to take the risk and go for it). Anyways one important thing about my industry is that generally inspectors aren't just given inspections from the company. They also have to go out and get the work as well by talking to realtors and alike. For context the owner is 68 and doesnt wanna do the actual inspections anymore he wants me to do all of them so he can just focus on running the business. This obviously works for me. The business isnt very big. Like we might get 20 inspections a month for our busiest month. So i can easily handle that. So anyways things were going pretty smooth for about 3 years. He was giving me inspections and I was building up some of my own. I only make about 30k a year which isn't a whole lot but again I'm building my client base up and have even brought more inspections in than the owner a few months. But one day the owner decided that he wanted to hire another person with no experience in the industry. I protested alot cause now that would mean we'd have to split up some inspections. After all the effort in years I put into this it was obviously I worry of mine. The owner told me that it wasn't going to effect me cause this new guy is from a different culture and he's only going to be hitting that market. So hey no skin off my back. But a week ago I seen the owner book and inspection with the new guy with a realtor I've been building up a relationship with. So I call him up and the owner tell me that apparently the new guy ""needs the money"" so he's going to try and give him an inspection once a week. Which means I'll be potentially loosing somewhere between 1000 to 1500 a month off the new guy. And if I'm only making 30k a year that obviously is going to take a nice chunk outta my income. When I confronted the owner about this he said I just need to go talk to more realtors. I work my butt off for this business and put in alot of hours just talking to realtors and all the other stuff already. And it's very frustrating cause he's essentially telling me to fix a mistake he told me he wouldn't make in the first place. So my question is what should I do? I can't afford to go off on my own and now I'm worried I won't be able to make ends meat cause of something the owner said he wouldn't do.",SkyrimDragongt,1,1.0,1,1708027440,2024-02-15 20:04:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aroopd/need_advice_on_how_to_handle_a_situation_with_the/,2,2024

I'm a senior undergraduate mechanical engineering student with a minor in computer programming,  and have maintained a good GPA and several mechatronics projects under my belt. With about a year of internship industry experience, I'm on track to complete my degree in May or possibly over the summer. Currently, I'm in the final interview round for a full time position with the team I interned with as a quality engineer.   
  
My internship for the same team focused more on data engineering than quality engineering, but I'm worried that my full-time role will be strictly quality-related, which doesn't resonate with me and I don't feel like I want to work in quality. I'm not interested in manufacturing anymore, but my past experiences have all been in this area. Apart from quality, I have worked as a mechanical engineering intern and also as a process engineering intern. 

I feel like my passion lies in design, be it mechanical or product, as well as mechatronics, just because it's fun, hands on and I have enjoyed designing stuff in the past. 

I also have some experience with data engineering/machine learning, which I could consider pursuing in future, though mainly for a good salary. I don't really enjoy much of it but the pay will be nice. 

Just because I am an international student will student loan I am thinking to take the role as a quality engineer if offered and maybe get a masters later on or switch teams accordingly. Or maybe even get in Management. 

But rn I am so confused as to what to really do in my life and feel pressurized as I don't have a fixed goal in mind. And a big part of me is worried that if I get in quality full time I will never be able to get out of it and make my way to design, R&D and the only path left would be management.

I am wondering if that is a good direction because ideally I was thinking of working in human resources, and the bachelor's degree I have in mind right now is Strategic Leadership because I can get it relatively quickly and inexpensively.  However, I worry that I might have trouble finding a job and wonder if it's worth it to pursue something STEM-related like Computer Science or Data Science, because it might be worth it financially in the long run.  But I worry about that as well because aside from taking a few basic courses I haven't been very educated on computers although I believe I would enjoy learning about them.  I just hope it's not too late, and that makes me think I should stick with what I'm already doing.  I am considering something like engineering, however, I worry it may be too difficult and it might set me back a lot of time and money.  I have worked in sales pretty much my whole life, but not currently.

I accepted an amazing new role Monday last week. Signed offer letter, finished reference checks, background check and right to work check on Thursday. This is where questions came up about my right to work. I am an American citizen in the UK on a spouse visa ( FLR M) my visa renews is June this year. So when I sent my share code I explained it says until June 2024 because that is when my visa renews and that I’d be renewing early in June so there is no lapse in my right to work. 

Friday I get an email asking more questions about my right to work. It seems from their questions they didn’t understand that when you marry a British citizen you aren’t automatically a citizen ( more common then you’d expect). This is an early stage start up so they have never hired someone on a visa before. I answered all their questions and explained the process in detail, provided home office guidance for reference etc. I got a response “thank you, that makes sense”. 

I haven’t heard a thing since. I had to put my notice in on Thursday last week because I have a one month notice and my start date was a month away. The silence is terrifying me. I am not skirting any laws or anything and I take my visa renewals seriously and start planning 7 months in advance. There will be no lapse in my right to work, but my fear is that they don’t understand and think I’m a risk to hire. 

I emailed today with a short email asking for a timeline on next steps. No response. I dunno what to do. My current job was livid that I was leaving and I doubt they’d take me back based on how they acted ( like I personally attacked them by improving my career). What should I do to reach out to this company? I don’t know how contracts normally work in the Uk the longest I’ve waited for one was 4 business days.

My current job is like the movie ""Office Space"" - I literally work in a gray cubicle at an insurance company, surrounded by uninspiring, boring people. I know I need a change, but I have no idea what I should explore. 

I started my career as a recruiter and did that for a number of years. The pay was pretty decent, but I was laid off a few times due to COVID and company downturns. I eventually enrolled in a UX Design bootcamp to try and pivot my career. Once I finished the program, however, a lot of tech companies decided to go through more layoffs and the market for UX Designers became heavily saturated; finding a junior-level job now is quite difficult since companies are prioritizing hiring senior talent, and there are laid-off candidates from companies like Google who now are my competition. 

In order to keep paying my bills, I got a data entry job at my current company and have been here for about a year. After \~10 miserable years in the rat race I ended up taking steps backwards in my career and pay grade, and I am growing increasingly frustrated with the soul-sucking nature of corporate culture. Yet corporate is the only thing I know, and I am conscious of the fact that there are other much more labor-intensive jobs out there which are even more miserable and pay even less. 

If someone out there has had a similar experience and could provide some suggestions on alternative career paths or industries, I'd really appreciate it.

1arm6at,Butchered a Client Dinner ,"
I had a dinner with a client and I think I may have butchered it. This client is a former client from a company I was recently laid off from. She heard from my former company that I was no longer there and said we should meet for drinks . I’m also a woman for context. We finally met a few nights ago, and I have since been offered a new job at a new company. I have not started at the new company yet, so I didn’t feel comfortable talking shop during our meet up . I thought it would casual, but she started asking me in depth questions about my new company and I felt like a deer in headlights. She’s at a high level position at her company so I felt embarrassed that I didn’t have good answers. I let her know that I would follow up after I start in a  few weeks but I still feel like an asshole. Then as the check came I offered to split, and now in hindsight I think they may have been the wrong move, but I really could not afford to pick up a bar/ food tab coming off of a month of being laid off. I usually pay for clients, but I don’t have a corporate card to expense it to. The client kind of looked like she expected me to pay, so I’m beating myself over this now. Am I over thinking this? How should I work on rebuilding this relationship if I effed this up?

1arlypt,Boss not letting me finish my internship?,"So a little bit of backstory. Me (22) finished my degree and have been interning at a very small marketing agency. The pay isn’t great (250 euros a month) and I do feel like I haven’t done much of what I was promised or brought in originally for (video editing and have instead just been working strategy). While the experience has been great I really don’t see myself working in marketing long term and would rather work in the cultural sector. I’ve been offered a conversation and possibly internship opportunity in the film sector as a critic and organizing film festivals which is more in the style of what I’d like to do. I brought this up to my boss that I didn’t see myself working in the marketing world in the future and that I wouldn’t be continuing with the internship past the 6 months on the contract. Let’s just say he didn’t take to well. He feels like I should have been more open about these feelings earlier and took me saying I was enjoying the internship as me wanting to stay on. The thing he’s pointing to as evidence is when he asked me how the internship was going and if I was enjoying the work I said yes which he took as me wanting to stay on. This was a month before the contract ended and he’s been consistently asking me for a plan on how I’m going to stay on and every time I’ve brought up that I really don’t want to continue or extend my contract he’s kinda ignored it. It’s even got to the point where he’s told me “I’ll find a way or you to stay” right after I told him I wasn’t. It all peaked today when he said that there was no transition plan in place and that he would need 3 months of me continuing to maintain a proper transition to the next intern (it’s a very small agency, like just me and him in the office while the rest of the work is done remotely by others). Feel very exploited overall and very confused on what to do since I would really like to leave with good standing and a good job reference for my time in the company. Any advice? Anyone been in a similar situation? Last official day or work in a shoot this Saturday and I don’t exactly know what to do.

A talent acquisition called me to inform the job offer after 3 rounds of interviews (health care jobs). He listed some benefits and said there will be no written offer sent to email. I will need to accept the offer verbally. Questions:

1. Is it normal to not have written offer? Could I request a letter with purpose like mortgage application? What are the catches?

2. He told me all salary matter is managed by the Talent Acquisition team, not my direct manager. He said my offer is the max of the budget. How likely is it true? Chances to negotiate more? (Ask for 10k more for counter 5k increase)?

3. What is the actual annual raise and performance bonus chances? He said they are non-guaranteed. I understand the 10% performance bonus is varied but is it really no guaranteed annual raise?

My job is honestly great, friendly people, good management, amazing benefits, and decent pay. The expectations are reasonable and I’ve done my job fairly well since I’ve been there. 

The problem is that I don’t see myself enjoying the work I’m doing for 1 or 2 more years. I see my seniors and I just don’t want to be them. The work is boring to me and I don’t envy learning the ins and outs of programming that it seems like I’ll need to come to know.

That being said, my current plan is to acquire an MBA (my company pays for it completely so why not) and get a few years experience and then move onto something else that I would enjoy more. 

-I’ve considered project management but figure that I’ll need more experience to even be considered for that role.

-I’ve also considered various sales positions such as sales engineer or account executive etc

1ark879,Is Workday sabotaging my career?,"(34M) 4+ years in software engineering. Is the global HR company Workday sabotaging my career?

  
I interviewed with Workday last summer, four rounds of interviews that went really well until the 4th technical interview which went less well but wasn't terrible. The interviewer could have done a better job frankly because I hit a snag on something rather trivial and instead of moving on to see what else I did/did not know, the interviewer kept me stuck on the trivial snag for about 10 minutes.

  
Since then every company that I have applied to that uses Workday HR has dismissed my application very quickly (within \~48 hours), and most surprisingly and recently of all one company dismissed my application within 12 hours (the email was sent at 2:30AM).

  
Is workday responsible for some sort of automated resume/application review process that is dismissing my application (and are they weighing my internal interview with them in the review process)? I've had a good career and the jobs that I am applying to are not beyond my reach (far from any sort of FAANG company).

  
In the past and with 4+ years of experience I was getting at least initial interviews rather easily (like at Workday for example).

- if she's ever on a computer and any window comes up with a warning she gets nervous and never just clicks 'ok'. Like, she'll research what the message is for over 30 minutes before proceeding

- every email she sends she request a 'read receipt' message so that she knows someone read her email

- she thinks everyone at work should have a signature on their email stating information about the employee like location and phone number

- she keeps a history log of pretty much everything she does basically. So like, say she reviews a report for 3 hours. What she'll do is keep an Excel file that contains information of her doing that. Then she'll spend about 10 minutes writing details.

- I would say Everytime she has any type of issue she generally escalates it to the highest priority.

1ari6cg,Career Advice,"Hello first post in here. 25 years old, just looking for some advice moving forward for my future.

Background

- I was a smart kid in high-school and I have completed some college but it wasn’t for me and I don’t plan on ever going back. Nothing against it but I paid off my student loans and I’m moving on. 

- While at school my (now wife) girlfriend and I put together a plan. Both get jobs and start saving as much as we can so we can put together a big down payment on a house as a head start for a home. 

- I have worked at a local car dealership in finance for the past 5 years, I knew this wasn’t going to be my forever job but it was the best option for me to make a good amount of money at my age with out a degree. My wife got a remote managing job. 

- We stuck to our plan, saved a lot of money, traveled a lot, and most importantly got married! We were lucky enough that my parents let us live with them so we haven’t had any bills but car payments and small stuff (Netflix, etc.) 

Today 

- We have 150k in savings, 15k in 401k, no debt, no credit cards (both have established great credit with past car loans) no car payments either (we purchased nice but used vehicles cash, as long as it’s safe we don’t really care what we drive) 

- I make around 90-110k a year (100% commission so it fluctuates) and my wife makes 40k salary. 

-  We are building a new home that is going to be an around 450k and we are planning on putting 100k down and keeping 50k in savings. 

Financial Advice 

- I know the smart thing to do would be to buy a rental property or 2 and live in one, I know some people rent half and live with roommates, etc. The problem is we lived with parents for 5 years now and we really want to start our life. A nice home is something that is important to us so there is really no negotiating that. We were lucky enough to purchase a piece of land in our dream neighborhood that is in between both parents. 

Career 

- I have always been an entrepreneur at heart. I knew when I started this job it’s way too risky for me long term. I don’t want to raise a family off of a 100% commission job. I love people but I don’t love my job, I really want to start a career that I am proud of. 

- I know my options without a degree are limited but after some research I’ve stumbled upon the Insurance industry. I looked into being an agent under a company or starting your own independent agency. I like the idea of being an agent and having the backing a big company (ex. Statefarm). It seems like a good fit, I can be my own boss, manage a team, make great money, and most importantly stay involved with my community and town. 

- I have been studying every night for my 2 Licenses that I need in order to pursue an opportunity. Again, the main thing is that I am enjoying learning about insurance. 

❓Am I on the right track? Is there a better route than insurance? 

I’m just looking for advice, a pat on the back, some guidance, whatever it may be.

Note* Please don’t take this as bragging in anyway,  I know this was cringey to post in the first place but I haven’t had any success connecting with anyone in the insurance field.",zoeytheseal,1,1.0,0,1708011361,2024-02-15 15:36:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ari6cg/career_advice/,2,2024
1arhxpb,Should I quit my job 1.5 months in to focus on my job search?,"I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering this December and hate the job I’ve been working. It’s a small company which I thought would be fun but nah. The owner has asked me to work 12 hour shifts the day before 3 times already. Really nice being told to be at work at 5:30am the next day. Among other things, like the location being a small rural town which is absolutely NOT my thing, not knowing anyone here, not particularly liking my coworkers, and pay that’s less than satisfactory.

I accepted this over a much better job offer to return to the company I interned at that I enjoyed which paid more in a better location because I was scared. I was afraid to be very far away from my friends and family, I was afraid to have more responsibility, and I was afraid of the commitment it would be (it would have me sign a 4 year contract in exchange for training which I now know I REALLY want for my next job). I decided yesterday to email them and let them know that I’m interested again and if they have any openings, but they haven’t responded yet and I know there’s a very real chance that ship has sailed. 

I’ve been on the job search since the beginning of the month and at this point I feel so emotionally drained that it’s difficult to prepare for interviews. On top of the job shit, I already have pretty bad mental health issues, my dog that I’ve had since I was 8 died about a week ago, I don’t know anyone here, and I haven’t seen my therapist since starting the job since she’s so far away and there are no autism specialists for me to see here which I’ve found are the only helpful ones for me. It’s so bad I got blackout drunk at a party this weekend with full intention of getting fucked up. That’s never happened before and I’m still disgusted for getting to that point. 

My parents said I can stay at home as long as I focus my attention on getting a job. Given my situation, is it worth doing or do I stick it out here while I look for a new job, at the risk of the search lasting longer? I have $32,000 of savings in a LCOL area so I think I can afford the ordeal.",megafireguy6,1,0.5,2,1708010749,2024-02-15 15:25:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1arhxpb/should_i_quit_my_job_15_months_in_to_focus_on_my/,2,2024

My group was newly formed in a major corporation and will expand over time, but I am struggling. It’s only been three months but I’m finding it hard to stay motivated and engaged in my work. My performance is dropping and I know my boss has noticed. I procrastinate and do little work most days. That’s not normal for me. I am the type of person to bust their ass all day, every day and be a top performer. 

I’ve reflected on it and I think I’m just flat out lonely and thrive more in an environment where I can collaborate with team members. In my previous job I managed a team of seven and we were in constant contact all day. 

Some days now I don’t interact with a single person. Or what interactions I do have are unfriendly/combative (type of work I’m in). My boss and I have separate projects so we only connect once a week. 

I exercise and get out after work but I don’t have any local friends. Work is my only real social interactions outside my SO. 

I need to push through this period until we hire more people. Maybe 3-6 more months. How do I learn how to work alone and keep myself motivated?

1arhczd,Feeling stuck in a routine but intensive job. Can't figure out the career plan.,"I have a PhD in physics and I work as an associate editor for a scientific publishing company in condensed matter physics. I've been in this role for two years, and I handle the peer review and editorial process for original research papers. I also liaise with other editors and experts in the international scientific community. 

I'm a bit done with my job because it's routine, and though related to my research experience, it is not particularly high paying. I don't feel challenged or interested in my field anymore. I've been looking for other jobs in publishing and research, but I haven't gotten any responses.

Earlier, I was hoping to get into data science, but with the current high bar to get even an entry level role, I aborted plans to shift to that career path. 

Right now, I am not very attached to my research field or scientific background and want a better salary and more intellectually intensive work. I don't have any referrals or connections in other fields. 

I want to change careers and do something more intellectually stimulating and financially rewarding. I'm thinking of doing an MBA and becoming a consultant, but I'm worried that I'm too old and inexperienced for that. 

I am 35, need some advice on how to plan my career and find a different job. Do you think an MBA is a good idea? Are there any other options for me?

Good Morning,

I'm currently looking over my career plan to pre-empt the next 2 years and have considered going into PE Teaching. I currently hold an undergraduate degree and I'm completing a Masters degree, both related to sport coaching. 

I suppose my main idea with this is that it's very hard to get paid full-time coaching roles and I could coach on evenings but would need to obviously find a role through the day. I've considered other 'necessary evil' jobs but feel PE Teaching would be logical and something I'd enjoy as I love helping kids enjoy sport.

Two questions, I suppose:
1. There are a few routes into PE Teaching/Teaching in general. What is generally the best and why?
2. Are there any teachers or PE teachers that could give me their experiences or thoughts?

1are6l1,I feel like my boss is taking a power trip with me.,"I've been put in a situation at work where our policy mandates being in the office two days a week while allowing remote work for the remainder. WFH days are acceptable but need a reasonable excuse. However, whenever I request to work remotely on an office day (which is very infrequent- there are a lot more people wfh more than me), I'm instructed to compensate by coming in an additional day the following week, which is completely fine by me but this requirement doesn't seem to apply to anyone else in the office. I'm in most days compared to everyone and I've never seen anyone in to ""make up"" their days. 

Additionally, I recently took a sick day along with a WFH day because I haven't been too well, and now I'm being compelled to come in for the *entire week* to ""make up"" for it. Does this seem reasonable? It seems counterintuitive given the nature of a sick day. My manager is usually really nice to everyone in the office but she seems to have a major power trip when it comes to me. I don't see a reason as to why because my EOY review was great and no real issues were brought up. Is my intuition correct or am I just overthinking?

1are4sr,Should I stay in my country to gain more work experience or prepare to study abroad first?,"Hey all, I graduated from university about half a year ago and have always dreamed of studying and living abroad. After assessing my financial status and identifying my preferred culture/environment, I decided to go to Australia.

By the way, I have internship experience from before I graduated from university, but it’s irrelevant to my major. The internship is related to civil engineering, which I want to pursue rather than working in my major.

I need to consider two situations:

1.Go to work for a few years, gaining some experience. It might be helpful when applying for jobs in Australia, but I'm not quite sure.

2.Study abroad (get a master's degree) and then try to find a job there.

I know that having local experience is key to applying for jobs in Aus, so I would intend to find an internship first if I study there in the future.

Now I'm worried that my resume may not be good enough for applying to internships or even jobs once I arrive there.

1ardpyu,Do I give my manager a second chance (with or without HR involved) or try to move on?,"Throwaway because I don't want this identifiable to my main account. 

  
I'll start by saying I'm not in the US, but my manager and teams I work with are in the US. I understand that HR in the US may have a different meaning. HR, in my country, is more people-focused and I trust and feel safe with our HR partners. However, our teams work across both the US and outside of US, and it would be helpful to understand the implications of my actions.

  
I apologise that this is very long. Everyone in my life is advising that I escalate and change teams. I would love objective advice. 

  
**Background:**

  
I've been at my company for a few years. We all work remote. My manager started last year. I only recently started reporting to them. I could immediately tell we had very different communication styles.

  
I've tried giving feedback to them a couple of times to understand how we can work better together, as I know new teams take time to form and learn how to collaborate. A lot of this revolves around feedback - they deliver a lot of critical feedback, which can feel overwhelming, and almost only critical feedback, not positive. 

  
**The conflict:** 

  
Our most recent meeting escalated. I communicated that it was starting to feel demotivating to only receive critical feedback and was making it difficult to know what I was doing well and should continue to do. It would be helpful to understand what my perceived strengths are, as it was starting to feel like I had none.

  
They responded by saying that they weren't going to sugar coat things and the amount of feedback showed they cared about my development. And our department and teams are terrible performers, and the bar is high and people will need to get used to hearing critical feedback. I don't know if this was them trying to tell me that I was a terrible performer but it didn't feel great. 

  
I tried to give an example: We recently had a workshop where we needed to list our brainstormed ideas. I had a lot of ideas. I didn't follow the format correctly when documenting. This was in part because they have given me regular feedback that I am not communicating clearly or not explaining things enough. So I aimed to get my ideas written clearly first. I let them know that I was working on the formatting but wanted first to have all my ideas in. When we reviewed the ideas, they focused on how important following the format was. I acknowledged and agreed I needed to improve my format and I was trying to improve on my clarity first as per their other feedback points to me. I said it would be helpful if we could talk about the strength and value of my ideas as well, in addition to improving the format.

  
Their response was heated. They said they found me disrespectful for not following the format, that it was clear I had looked at the rules and said ""Fuck it, I don't care"" and showed clear disregard for their instructions. 

  
I was very caught off-guard. I have never been called disrespectful in my career. I have managed teams in the past and prided myself on a professional, respectful communication. I had to turn my camera off because I started crying. I'm not proud of that, but I was very upset. 

  
I tried to explain that I was not trying to show disrespect, if anything I was trying to improve based on past feedback from them. The conversation pretty much ended soon after that.

  
**After:** 

  
I spent a few days feeling like a failure. I do struggle with rejection sensitivity and low self-worth. I wasn't sure, and am still not sure, if I am overreacting. 

  
It's been difficult to work. It was already feeling challenging with the overwhelming critical feedback, and I often felt paralysed at work, unsure if I was doing anything right. It's only become worse since our meeting. 

  
At the same time, I recognise that I was not spoken to professionally. I don't believe this is how a good manager leads.

  
My manager wrote me an apology a business day later. The apology is more of a ""Sorry you felt upset, I had good intentions"" vs apologising for any of their own actions. I don't know if that matters. It's an apology, right? 

  
I consulted my HR business partner. They were empathetic. Nothing ""official"" has happened yet. They reached out to the US HR business partners to understand what options are available. They are:

  
\- Make it ""official"" and speak to my manager's boss (US based) and let them know this has happened. I'm not sure what happens from here, but I'm wary of making the situation worse for myself.  
\- Speak to my manager directly on my behalf. Again, this is making it ""official"" and it's hard for me to predict what happens.   
\- Apply internally for a similar role on a different team

  
In the meantime, my manager asked if we could discuss what happened and find a way to work things out. They're not aware of any conversations with HR. I told them I wasn't ready at the time but would be open to it soon. We're still in meetings together. It's awkward. I can tell they are trying to be considerate and adjust their feedback approach, in the ways they know how.

  
**Thoughts:** 

  
I'm just not sure where to go from there. It's positive to see my manager trying, but I'm very skeptical of how well we can work together moving forward. It has already been a difficult month of trying to figure this out. I'm personally demotivated after being spoken to so negatively and maybe it's just my pride speaking, but I feel like I'm telling myself it's okay to be mistreated if I just push past it. But again, is that my ego?

  
Interpersonal issues aside, I think they're smart and have the best intentions. They speak often of wanting to improve our company and change things for the better. Maybe sticking with them will be an amazing learning opportunity for me. 

  
What happens if I move forward with making it ""official"" with HR? Am I going to pushed out of the company in the long run, labelled a troublemaker?

1arcas7,Feeling stagnant and like I'm butting my head against a wall. What should I do?,"I spent about two years at a big4 firm doing something extremely niche before coming to this new company to do something loosely related. I've been in the new position for about a year and a half, but I've been trying get out and find a new job for over a year at this point.  
From very early on I could tell the leadership in the new job had no idea what was going on, I feel like I was very oversold on the position in the interview process, which I partially blame myself (due diligence). The organization has seemed to only get worse over time, with constant re-orgs, a few layoffs, and political brawls, my impact has been quite limited, and I feel like I'm not growing in my career which worries me for the future.  
While I've been constantly pushing my leaders for clarification on existing items and new work to do, they seem to be even more clueless than me when it comes to what is going on. I have had 4 different ""leaders"" in the last year. In the last 7 or so months I've only worked for around 5-10 hours per week.  
Some would say my work-life balance is great in terms of how little I ""work"" but I'm finding that my work-related stress levels have actually increased as I have more and more anxiety around how sustainable my position is and how I'm developing my skills for the future of my career.  
The problems I'm running into in my attempt to switch jobs:

* My skills are in a pretty niche area, I'm finding it hard to continue in this line of work with my level of experience in the current job market. I'm starting to question if I even want to stay in the area. Almost all the roles I see getting posted are pretty senior.
*  I feel my lack of impact in my current role is showing a bit in my resume, despite working really hard and spending countless hours trying to quantify achievements, there's only so much I can do.
* I'm finding it hard to find jobs that would pay me the same in other areas I'm interested in, since I'd typically have to be starting back at entry level or close to it. Usually the salaries are 20-50% below what I'm currently making.
* I'm currently working 100% remote and almost every job I see is hybrid or on site in a city I don't live in.  
So I'm just wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and how you approached it? Should I try to stick it out for another 1-2 years and keep pressing for impact, so I don't look like a job hopper? Is this when people go back to night school to make a career change or start back at entry level in a different role? I know beggars can't be choosers and I need to compromise on something most likely, but my gut is telling me relocating at my own expense + up to 50% less pay + having to work on site just to change my job isn't worth it? Should I just count my blessings and suck it up?",SassyWoodPigeon,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1707992008,2024-02-15 10:13:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1arcas7/feeling_stagnant_and_like_im_butting_my_head/,2,2024
1arcan3,Feeling lost in career,"Hi everyone. 
I’ve been working as a DevOps Engineer for the past 5 years now. I realised last year that I am not actually interested in technical/coding anymore and have had conversations with my manager about this. Since then, I’ve effectively been acting as a manager for the team (I do line manager stuff, he’s technical. It kinda works). I still do some code but a lot less. I’ve not technically been promoted, waiting on Human Resources for the past 5 months. 

I’ve worked for the past years in finance, because that’s what my area mostly does. I don’t enjoy it. I find it very “cold”, very lonely and uncreative. But let’s be honest, it pays well. 
The more time passes, the more I feel like a tool and that my work/opinion doesn’t ultimately matter.

1arat9v,Signs of getting fired or lay off? What do you think?,"My background is IT Portfolio Management (Project/Portfolio Management 15 yrs experience). My 1:1s with manager fell off calendar since couple weeks. Last week I sent her a note asking if she will be scheduling or I should. This whole week she has not re-established the series, usually she is the one scheduling with her direct reports. Tis week I heard from my colleagues that their 1:1s got redirected for year end reviews. I received my year end related invite for next week. Still no 1:1s on calendar.

In the past year, I have received very little support. Infact, Manager told my colleagues to not help me / give any information they have on complicated tasks outside of job responsibilities that were asked from me during Q4. I ended up surviving and worked almost 12 hrs most of Q4 to meet unrealistic deadlines but never felt appreciated or accomplished. In the past, on my 1:1s when I brought up Processes and the issues with operationalizing them she would get very upset and tell me that I am responsible for end to end implementation and its not the process problem.

I have worked in big financial companies and always been a top contributor. Past 1.5 years with this company  I feel like I am always on the edge, completely off track - anytime they will get rid of me and I am not being able to add value because of the culture and politics. Feeling insecure, not satisfied with my work, voice not heard/ignored and now possibly loser when they get rid of me.

Please advice what questions I should ask for each scenario if I get laid off  or fired. If there is a checklist anyone has come across please share for both scenarios and how to move forward from this. Has anyone experienced being fired and still being able to find a good job?

1arasx3,Should I take a job that pays more but requires travel? ,"I got offered a job to work 5 days a week (Monday - Friday) out of the home and home on the weekends. This would also include a “three weeks on, one week off” schedule. 

I currently work a remote job that requires I travel an hour or two away to a job site and then return home in the evening, all drive time paid. The current position I have only pays $24/hour with basic benefits and not guaranteed full time work. I am also in a company that I don’t see much growth in. The new position would be $35/hour with a company vehicle and a standard per diem rate for most of the cost of hotel and food. This new company has more promise for growth later on but I am unsure if I can reasonably commit to that schedule. 

I am more of a homebody and I am prone to depression and anxiety when alone a lot. I live with my husband (who also works full time Monday - Friday locally) and my two dogs. Being away from home for 5 out of 7 days does not sound appealing to me mentally, but the raise in pay and option for full time/ overtime definitely would help us right now.

I understand that the job could potentially be temporary if I cannot adjust but I am afraid to take the chance and leave my current position.

Remote work and travel is not something I really considered before and my gut tells me I won’t like it. Should I take the position and try to make it work if I’m having doubts from the beginning? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

1ara9tg,Sustainability Role in Engineering ,"Hi

I am a project manager and I have been working with the sustainability director for near a year helping out with managing some small tasks. There will be a new sustainability role that will be offered to me. This will be a higher role than I am in. My concern is, the company themselves don’t really see value in it as they are chasing getting orders out the door and maybe the funding for this to implement things won’t be great. 

has anyone done a role like this within Engineering? How can I get things implemented and even what are the key things I can target. The companies have many products and it’s a fast pace company, but lacks some controls and it’s just chaos sometimes, so my fear is this role won’t get the attention and me at risk if there are any cuts.

1ar9y4q,Should I quit my job? I hate it.,"     IF YOU DONT WANT TO READ HERE ARE BULLET POINTS
•get paid a few dollars under minimum wage 
•won’t let me leave at the agreed upon time 
•reimbursed everyone but me for gas 
•won’t let me design and only gives me the dirty jobs no one wants 
Pros
•good hours 
•close to home 

 Okay so I work at a product design shop (not going into detail for anonymity). At my shop, I get paid $10 an hour. This is a few dollars under minimum wage in my state. When I applied they asked for my desired salary and I said minimum wage. One of my other coworkers gets paid 12 and does the same amount of work as me. 
     For the holiday I was delivering product. This is fine when I drive the work vehicle. But sometimes I have to drive my personal one when others are delivering as well. They have never offered to reimburse me for gas. Like literally ever. I told one of the senior employees this and she was shocked. She said EVERYONE ELSE IS REINBURSED FOR GAS WHEN THEY DRIVE. 
    This isn’t even the most frustrating part. The reason I took this job is because I am very creative and wanted to be a designer. They knew this when I signed on. They don’t even let me design. I’ve done it maybe twice in the past two months. I was sitting around waiting to deliver today and the other designers treated me like shit. One lady was like hey. You should take out our trashes since they’re full. And I went to get her trash and she’s like where’s the new bag? I spent like 30 minutes doing the trash work no one else wanted to do. Another girl signed on around the same time as me for an unpaid internship. She GETS TO DESIGN EVERY DAY. like she has never had to drive never had to do trash or anything. I don’t know why I don’t get too. I try so hard to help out and be an excellenct employee. 
      Also for the same recent holiday I needed to leave early. We (boss and I) discussed this the week prior and when I brought it up today she was like maybe u can leave. Who knows and shrugged. She didn’t care at all. 
I was almost in tears I was so tired and so frustrated. Another employee who was higher in authority to me ended up just telling me to leave and she would cover it for me. 
  Last week I needed to leave early to pick my sibling up from work and that was also approved. They didn’t let me leave until AN HOUR AND A HALF AFTER IWAS SUPPOSED TOO. 
Am I being over dramatic? This job does have hours that work well with my schedule. And it’s close. But I am started a new job that doubles in pay in three months.

1ar9ci2,Reaching out to employer who offered a package but refused,"So back in November I went through with the recruitment process with another company for the same role I currently have. I was chosen and given an offer. However I tried to negotiate nicely and asked them its a generous offer but if they can match it, I would leave. At that point I wasn’t fed up with current work yet and was hopeful things were changing (since I joined the current company 3 years ago, we have gone through 3 CEOs and a full replacement of c level). I have never taken sick leave here as I don’t get sick enough to be in bed and I’m very adaptable and remain strong in the face of constant changes. However everyman has his limit and today I can’t face going to work as I’ve been snapping at everyone and everything.

Anyway I still see the post being advertised on linkedin daily and at this point I’d consider taking the hit if need be. This job is exactly the same , and more importantly, fully remote (which you can’t take for granted anymore) and the culture matches with my expectations.

I was just a truck driver for a year and while I liked the solitude, I prefer working with people. I'm 24 and want the ability to meet more people through my career.

From hearing other nurse's experience, I know they don't get treated the best and I really feel like my mental health would take a toll from that treatment.

1ar8g48,I need help deciding on which job to take if my end goal is unclear?,"I’m currently interviewing for 2 jobs, one is a typical administrative assistant role and the other is a program ram assistant role for a nonprofit. 

The administrative role pays a fair salary that I can survive on but the nonprofit role does not. But I am more passionate about supporting nonprofits and giving back to the community. But the nonprofit one pays low, and has limited opportunities for growth, and has a 1 year contract that may or may not be renewed based on some factors (my performance and if they can continue to afford me I am assuming). But the nonprofit job is at a University so I would be able to continue my education for free but then again idk what I would want to study anyways and the 1 year contract kinda effects that so idk if that’s really an advantage. Also, I am not sure what the growth opportunities look like for the admin role but its most likely a better path than the nonprofit one. 

I am not someone who wants to climb the corporate ladder. I just want to be compensated fairly for the work that I do and make a liveable wage while doing work that I don’t hate and in a healthy work environment and having the job security aswell and staying with one company for as long as possible if it is sustainable.

The next job I take, I want it to be a stepping stone to what I want and I don’t want to keep
job hopping (I want to stay for at least 3-5 years before leaving if necessary). But between the 2 jobs I mentioned I am interviewing for, its hard to determine which one aligns with my goals the most when my goals are unclear/vague.

1ar8eh2,Employer is paying colleague under the table,"I'm the star player where I work. Have been there 8 months and have been the most reliable employee they've ever had (this is their own words). Recently my new co-worker informed me that the owners agreed to pay him under the table while he was on paternity leave. Supposedly the reason is so that he can collect 90% of the pay from his other job via the state but still work this one without it impacting the $$$ he's collecting.

Today I informed the owners that he told me. I asked them to confirm if what he was saying was true. They did. I told them I had no idea under the table pay was even an option (they had previously told me they would never consider doing this for anyone due to the trouble they could get in). They told me they would only do it for him given the scenario.

My issue is that this guy was hired to work all the easiest shifts, gets schedule flexibility thanks to his other job, got the job despite being underqualified, and now leapfrogs me with takehome pay considering it's tax-free. It seems unfair to sit back and accept this given that I have more responsibilities than he does, very little schedule flexibility, I work all the more difficult shifts, and I am not given the option to have under the table pay.

Pro-parent crowd seems to be of the notion that I should shut my mouth and understand he's going through fatherhood. Others have sided with me saying it's wrong and illegal for the company to pay under the table and for him to accept money under the table.

1ar840n,"I'm so lost on a decision to make between ""dream jobs""","I was accepted for a role with Americorps through ACE, and the offer is to be based in a place I love. $320 a week, housing, food, etc. I would start soon doing all sorts of conservation work and being outside, which is my dream, and I would learn many skills, including carpentry and how to use various tools, and would be able to make connections for future jobs.

However, I recently got offered a job as an environmental scientist, which was also a long-standing dream of mine, but this is at home in a city I hate, and I'm a little suspicious of the company because online the reviews are terrible. 
The thought of being an envr scientist is cool, but towards the end of my degree I learned I prefer ecology and conservation work and being outdoors working with plants and animals, but I followed through on earth science because it's still fascinating.

I am stuck between wanting to do something I love, and something that would likely make me more successful, and MAYBE I would actually enjoy the work, but I'm unsure of that and have a very hard time being in my hometown.

So some pros and cons:
Working in my hometown, free rent with parents, making pretty decent money, getting my foot in the door with a career with benefits. Downside: this city kinda depresses me, living with parents can be rough despite a huge love for them, only one friend and a lack of social time that would drive me nuts, and this company is known for a terrible work-life balance. Lots of overworking with no free time.
It's more so negative emotionally to me to be honest and being worried this is not a super trustworthy company.

Going back to desirable city: fulfilling work, work that makes a huge difference to me and the world, meeting likeminded folk, being surrounded by all my friends, being in the mountains which is my happy place, would pretty easily make connections to many other career paths of great interest, especially ones in desirable areas.

I have been thinking so hard on it for weeks and there are still more intricacies but I'm so lost rn and have little time left for a decision. I fear that if I were to choose the mountains, I may lose out on a great opportunity to make money and advance my career. But if I choose the work in my hometown, I might lock myself down to a career that's less accessible to the places I love and I might regret not going to the mountains with Americorps, which I hear 95% good things about. 

I feel like the ""smart decision"" is the career and building money, but also I'm 22 and feel like this is the time to take risks, but idk if that justifies it. There are pros and cons to each side and I'm just lost. Maybe I'm naive, but I want to be in the mountains where I hike and camp for work and am surrounded by friends as opposed to making good money in a city I don't like.

Ps, some context: I studied environmental science with a concentration in earth science but like ecology more, so the career is ""making more use"" of my degree. And I spent 7 months after graduation looking for an envr job, and got both basically at the same time. I'm thinking not just what to do right now, but which works for the time that comes after.

1ar81h3,Got hired a year ago for a role I'm not sure is necessary anymore. They want to keep me but there is nothing for me to do.,"Background: I am only a couple years out of school, and I got hired for a job working for a large defense contractor about a year ago. They made me a ridiculously large offer after a single 30 minute zoom interview, and i felt I couldn't refuse. I was largely dissatisfied with my old job anyways. I was hired to be an engineer for a very niche research and development project on a contract with the government. 

A few months after being hired, there was a funding issue and the whole project had to be rescoped. Most of the work I had done was washed out. I found ways to stay productive after that, but then there was another fundamental shift brought about by funding issues and dissonance over on the governments side of the house. Now, it feels as if the role that I was brought in to do is non existent, yet here I am. No one has acknowledged this, and the contract is still around for at least a few more years. 

My manager will occasionally ask me to do some quick research about something, but other than that, i have no larger projects to work on or goals to work towards. I feel like I am just existing, yet my manager and the government customer both seem happy with my existence and don't seem to view me as deadweight (even though I really feel that I am, especially making as much as I do). The roles of everyone else on my team (small team of less than 10 people) don't seem as affected, and they are all plugging along as usual. 

I feel as if my only options are:
1.) Adapt by learning a whole new discipline of engineering so i can provide value to the team. This doesnt seem ideal bc the learning curve would probably be large since i'd have to teach myself about something i know basically nothing about.

2.) Find a new job. I'm very worried I'd be taking a large paycut since I make way too much money currently. Also slightly worried that leaving after only a year will look bad.

3.) Continue as is, and keep collecting a paycheck. I do what is asked of me. I try to be as helpful as I can and offer my assistance where I can. I just feel kind of depressed since I am not doing anything most of the time. I also feel constant worry that someone will come to the realization that I am pure deadweight and they will fire me.",Carbon1273,1,0.5,3,1707974455,2024-02-15 05:20:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ar81h3/got_hired_a_year_ago_for_a_role_im_not_sure_is/,2,2024

My current bosses are in a different hospitality industry and they act like I'm telling them I was a dishwasher.

I'm currently at my 8-month mark and doing things the Director would be doing. On top of taking on daily work tasks for 3 other positions within the same department. 

They started giving me overtime and access to admin abilities but then deny that it means anything. They act very supportive and then later clueless or like they don't care at all. I refined so many of their processes and trained so many people who have been doing things wrong for many years (only as requested and this includes the manager's process). I accumulated great relationships with everyone and was voted employee of the month several times they stopped giving it to me (good someone else should earn it). Everyone greets me with a big smile and cheerful attitude to match mine.

Suddenly one of the managers puts in their 2 weeks and I get to submit my application with a powerpoint. They act like I am so fresh and new, clueless that I would want a manager position when I have told them in many discussions before. They said I could not present the power point and I feel in my bones they will not give me a chance, that they think the interview would be a waste of time for them. 

I told them specific ways to reach the goals that no manager is doing right now, how the restaurant experience connects to this, and am already doing **almost** everything the manager did (who is leaving). They act like what I do means nothing. I have a feeling they want to hire someone fresh and shiny, for more fun in the office with the new person.

The thing is, my coworkers are often HOURS late. It’s a startup, with a very chill culture, so people come and go as they please. one of my coworkers who also lives 90 minutes away comes in around noon so that he misses rush hour traffic in the morning, another shows up around 10 because he decided to wfh the first hour to again, beat traffic. the guy with a corner office comes in about 30-45 minutes late every day. no one seems to care. unless it’s me. there’s only 8 of us - what do i do? this particular role (sales) has apparently the highest turnover of any role, and I feel like i’m the latest victim but i simply don’t have the money to quit. the final straw was that I got an email (therefore, it’s in writing) saying I need to be in office 9 to 5ish, I sent back an email saying I expect a similar email to be sent to my male coworkers as well. 

aside from this, the job is lovely. my coworkers (who I asked before I used their schedules as examples when talking to management) are all amazing.

There are absolutely no work instructions or test instructions in our data bases if there are other places to look I have not been informed of them. I have to piece meal different work instructions about deconstruction of components to figure out how to test this feature. Then figure out how to run the test on then machine. Look up the data needed to be gathered from this test through you tube. Come up with comprehensive statics and dynamics plan for what I am looking for. I cannot ask engineer for help or explanations, I am on the overnight shift and I am given 1-2 days to have these tests done.

Any sort of guidance would be helpful. Also, I'm not used to using Reddit so I might've posted this question on the wrong place. So, if you can let me know that as well, like where I could post my question that would give me the answers that I'm looking for.

1ar6t0k,Am I the problem? How should this be handled?,"Am I the problem! Or am I being nitpicky?

I work for a smaller company that is part of a world renowed hotel chain.  

I have a position that I love.  I had it previously but had to go on medical leave and my position did not hold..  It was given to the boss's friend.  Yes I know. 

A part time position came up and I jumped on it.  Hey, some is better than none.

A recent firing at another location frees a full time position.  I have been working part time at that location to help keep things running and try to organize things.i have had recognition from the direct supervisor to the entire management company's director. 

3 of us internal candidates applied.  Me with 9 months rxperiénce who gets raves from the supervisor at this location..  I am the only one with experience.  

Only issue is someone that has been with the manager wants the job.  She has 3 months in a position.But has worked with him for a few years. 

Now this person I have been told to show her how to do things. So I figured she is the managers pick as he likes to promote from within.  I am being sent emails from her or Ccéd on emails that had been between me and the direct supervisor. 

So my issue is this job is a ton of work.. You don't get off right at à certain time.  when the direct supervisor and manager left for the day she was done.. It was time to play.  I had a pile of contracts that needed to get done.  I keep showing her what to do, but she isn't paying attention. She would go and chat or walk off.  I asked her to do one thing while I took. 5 min break as I worked thru lunch.  I came back and she was off gossiping with others. 

At 415 she started gathering her stuff to leave.  Now I was on a tech call to fix an issue we both had.  She said that she had to watch her hours.  I said but we have this pile to do and she shrugged and left.  She expected me to stay and finish it alone. Well it would have been done if I could have done it and not wait on her.. 

She is beautiful, real eye candy.  Very nice but also very ditzy.  I keep catching her mistakes that would cause the hotel to be oversold on rooms. And she keeps doing this. I tell her that she needs to do x y z and she ignores me. I have been super friendly and helpful to her. I want to be a team player. 

Today she added her name to a contract that I had dealt with.  Didn't even ask. 

The direct supervisor sung my praises at my interview.  But I also was told that I am invaluable to the other location, etc. I keep hearing stuff that alleges that I didn't get it..  

Now my mentor thinks that I need to let my supervisor know what transpired.  Why I didn't stay and finish all this work.  Because she kept walking off as I was teaching her.  She focuses on the wrong things.  She does not listen.  I keep repeating things to her and she does not grasp it. 

With this job you have to get certain things done the day it occurs.  She will put other things as a priority. Even when I say something she does her own thing. 

I want this job.  I am damn good at this and can start now and not need help.  I don't see how she will do this in her own.  I feel that I would be there for 2 months training her. 

I would be embarrassed to have her talk to corporate people because even though she is beautiful she plays the part as a ditzy but flirty chick. Not professional. 

I deserve this job.  Heck I have people calling me to find out things.  I have busted my ass proving I can do this. My direct supervisor said that she had big plans for me. 

If she is picked, it will be me how has to train her since I have 3 days a week that I can be borrowed from my home position ( I work 2 separate locations).

My training lasted 4 hrs.  I was left alone after next to nil training.  I went to each website or platform and taught myself.  But she does not have that kind of work ethic.

So am I just looking for reasons not to like her because of the job?  Should I mention how today went? And without sounding jealous?  Any thoughts or am I a sucker for doing this and allow myself to be used?",Limp_Photograph_6024,1,1.0,0,1707970197,2024-02-15 04:09:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ar6t0k/am_i_the_problem_how_should_this_be_handled/,2,2024

Last week I was fired from my job after being there two years. There was no real lead-up to it.  
  
I was working from home on a Wednesday when one of the Managers asked me to attend a last-minute HR meeting.  
  
The HR person mentioned there were some complaints about my performance and asked for a written statement. In the statement, I was able to show half of the complaints were BS and mentioned how none of my Supervisors have met with me since last summer. I also said it wasn't reasonable for me to speak with HR since I am not on any performance improvement plan.  
  
Needless the say the next day I was suspended from work(which always leads to termination). I complained this was retaliation since I was responding to an HR investigation. That same day I got the termination notice.  
  
Now I'm out of a job and low on funds. I kind of hate the city I live in, but not sure where to go since half the country is a mess.  
  
I've been applying to other companies in the same field. In addition to others that might be a fit.  
  
I've worked all over the US doing different jobs. However, I'm tired of starting over every two years and ending up in the same spot. I question if I'll ever be able to own a home or get a wife.  
  
I know at the end of the day it's my responsibility but I'm exhausted. I live in NYC and a lot of the jobs around here still pay like 45k. I was making close to 60k before getting the boot.  
  
At this point, I'm thinking about Joining the Air Force as an Officer just so I can have some stability.  
  
In my 20s I always chased after jobs and opportunities. Now I think it's probably best to put that aside and figure out where I want to live. No matter what job I'm doing.

1ar6fg4,Title change but no pay increase,"Hi! I am currently working as a Talent Acquisition Coordinator in a contract to hire role. I took this role in December and have been really loving this company and the development I have gained at this company. 

However, there is one thing that has been bothersome. My title, as stated, is a talent acquisition coordinator but I have been doing full cycle recruiting (which is fine as I have experience in this) however, this was not the expectation coming on. I voiced my concerns to my manager and he agreed that the job duties that were posted did not match my day to day work and that he would talk to his boss about a title change. He talked to his manager and his manager also agreed and I should be getting a title change in the next few weeks to Recruiter. 

The problem comes as he did not mention a pay increase and I did not think of it until after our call. I am looking for advice to naturally bring this subject up and how to talk about the pay increase, as this is something I never had to deal with. I took the pay I have now because I was under the assumption I would be doing coordinator/admin tasks but this is evidently not been the case. Do I need to come prepared to this conversation with a number in mind? If so, how do I gauge this number? Do I ask for backpay? Thank you for the help in advance! 

&#x200B;

P.S. I have also discussed my contract to hire status and have been told that before me coming on their plan was to make this role permanent (I was the first coordinator role in this company so they were testing the waters), is the title change and my FTE conversion not being at the same time weird? Or is this something that I should still wait out? I do not want to seem too pushy with this as I understand that I took on a contract role but I want to make sure I have a job at the conclusion of this contract.

1ar59o8,PSA: Don't Wait for Your Appraisal! Start Applying for Jobs Now 🚀,"Hey fellow Redditors,

Just dropping a friendly reminder for those of you considering a job change: don't wait for your appraisal to be over before starting to apply! 🤔 Here's why:

1. **Less Competition**: While everyone else is holding off until after their appraisals, you can get a head start by applying now. Your chances of getting selected are higher when there's less competition in the pool. ✅
2. **Managers Are Hiring**: At this point in the year, managers have a clearer picture of their project needs and resource requirements. By applying now, you're catching them at a time when they're actively looking to fill gaps in their teams. Waiting could mean missing out on opportunities as managers may already have filled positions by then. Plus, if you delay, managers might start thinking that they can manage with fewer team members, leading to missed chances.
3. **Especially for those in AI**: This is specific to AI roles. There's been a surge in high-profile AI projects recently. This means project heads are more inclined to approve additional resources and requirements for ML roles. 🎯

So, if you've been contemplating a change or just keeping an eye out for new opportunities, now's the time to take action! Don't let your appraisal timeline hold you back from securing your next career move. Start applying, networking, and exploring your options today. [Even Andrej Karpathy understands this](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1757600075281547344). So good luck out there! 🚀

They are never at our place of employment and take forever to complete simple management duties which in return pisses off our customers and isn’t running as smoothly as we used to. I mentioned our manager was a personal family friend right? Well the owners of where I work have noticed that something has been going on with our manager for quite some time but just didn’t have the time to piece everything together. Well some more time has gone by, all the employees are upset because our manager is never around, so many things falling thru the cracks, ect. The owner finally comes to me and the rest of the staff and asked us some questions that we were honest about… in return, they decided to fire our manager and promote me to her roll. 
Old manager is now LIVID and thinks I conspired against them to take their job. It’s causing some family drama and I’m feeling so guilty even though I didn’t do anything besides work hard and do what i was asked.

1ar44k1,New Career Needed: My Arm Amputation Severely Limits Career Change Opps,"\*\*Please I desperately need some help figuring out what career I can change too\*\*

&#x200B;

I lost an arm in an accident Jan 2020.  Im 35, up to till my accident Id worked as a debt collector and most recently as a truck driver.  Driving truck is off the table since my accident, i cant get medically cleared. Im otherwise healthy.

The collections job I did from about 18 till 30.  Its a desk job. phone skills, i call it reverse-sales, as its harder.  im getting ppl to pay money for loans or things they already bought and got rid of LOL. theres also an investigative side, tracking these people down, calling relatives, finding their employers etc etc

Its a job im good at. Im good at competitive-negotiating, im great at tracking down these people, where they work, who they associate with, where they live.  From like 18-28 it was a pretty damn good gig, climate controlled office, no grunt work, my hourly was enough to pay my bills with a little left-over, and on top i was pulling in $1k+ bonus checks about 10/12 months.

Collections Industry really started to get bad, base pay stagnated, bonus checks went down, and thats when I left to get my CDL and drive truck.  After my accident I had to come back to this career, i wasnt able to drive, it was early pandemic, and was the easiest/fastest route to get bills paid again after leaving the hospital.

If i still had both arms, id be finding some type of blue collar job in hopes of liveable wages and a chance to move up a ladder hopefully.... but unless Im mistaken, i dont think its something I can do anymore (open to it, if someone knows anything). 

Im in NC, I make $17hr, and after bills  (no frills at all, no car payment) and child support Im lucky to have $100 leftover for food and anything else I need (working remote saves me a lot of $$ on gas and food). Grocery prices are outrageous, I cant keep doing this.

I really dont want to go college route, Im slowly drowning now, 2-4 years ill be way under.   I know my current role has some transferable skills, id rather not be in sales as low base pay/bonus incentives is scary.... i have bills to pay and a daughter.  Ive talked to everyone I know, and I cant figure out what my options are.  Would be willing to go after certifications or anything I can do in up to \~6mos, to get a better job, doesnt even have to be the best job (for now). Im scared a lot of these classes/certs im seeing wont lead me into a job at all, let alone at least tread water @ $17/h, I cant afford to chase a certification thats going to end up useless or very low demand.

If you have any ideas, it would greatly be appreciated and might save my butt from starving to death!!!",AmputeeBoy6983,5,0.8399999737739563,7,1707961665,2024-02-15 01:47:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ar44k1/new_career_needed_my_arm_amputation_severely/,2,2024

1ar3yuu,How to Ask for Raise/Promotion Next Week,"I will be having my meeting with my manager next week to discuss how I met my yearly goals and such, which will lead into whatever pay increase I receive. I had my 5-year anniversary with the company last fall, and the more senior person on the staff retired, leaving a lot of the work to fall on me. I've been working a lot of weekends lately, too, and really carrying a large share of the workload over the past year. 

When I initially joined, it was with another company, but we merged about a year or so into my tenure. The main reason I initially left my old job was because of the bonuses the company offered. However, the company we merged with does not do the same types of bonuses. Initially, I was OK with it because my workload was decreasing, and I went from performing three tasks to my main one. Since the work has been creeping up steadily, with no end in sight, plus my tenure and the positive feedback I typically receive for my work, it feels like an opportune time to have the discussion. 

Much to my detriment, I hate talking money with really anyone. I like this job well enough, though, that I would rather try to voice my salary concerns first before looking for another job. Based on my research, I could probably get around a 12-15% increase if I moved jobs, but I'd rather not go through the hassle. 

Before I left my last job, I was offered nearly what I am making now, but the bonus potential sounded like it had more upside, and it did, as I made \~$7k more than I would have if I had stayed. I was also upset that they knew money was a factor in my job hunt when I told them I was looking for other opportunities, but they only threw money at me about 10 minutes after they heard I had another job offer. Based on that experience, I want to try and do what I can to get at least a 10% pay increase at my current job.

If anyone has any advice for how to best present my argument, please let me know. My manager at the company I started with pre-merger has some more sway in the new company, so I was wondering if it might be worthwhile to reach out to her if my immediate manager can't do anything. Honestly, I feel like I am being underpaid for the value I provide, and if I were to quit the company would probably have to spend more than whatever increase I would receive on finding a replacement. Should I just be that blunt or try to be a little more diplomatic when voicing my concerns? Thank you for any advice.

1ar3s7w,Advice on Trying to Start A Business,"I am struggling on figuring out where to start as this whole idea sounds kind of crazy to me. I am 24 years old and am currently at my second job out of college with a degree in data science and have been there for almost 2 years. It's a solid job and pays all my bills but just struggling to find any passion or desire to push myself on a daily basis. I have done lots of soul searching and thinking about what I can do that would truly push me to care deeply about my work and have landed on personal finance and retirement planning.

I come from a pretty poor background and have done everything I can to try not to end up in the same situation as my parents have found themselves in. I went to the cheapest college that I got in to and have been saving my paychecks aggressively since before I even had a real job. I have always loved learning about the subject and it's one of the only things I go out of my way to continue learning about. 

I think the world of personal finance and retirement planning can be daunting for a lot of people which leads them to avoid saving entirely. Many people claiming to help you are also quite predatory for the services they provide. I do not want to be a full scale money manager but rather someone who can sit with individuals to review their finances and plan best for their future. I would also love the opportunity to speak to larger groups of people if I got to be successful enough.

1ar0sn7,"Data Center job, Level 4 background check questions ","Hi, 

So I'm in the running for a Data Center Technician job. This job would be life changing for me and I want to do this right. 

They told me if they decided to hire me, theres a level 4 background check that they'd do. I am unsure of what that means in full, could someone clarify? 

I know we have some rooms that are owned by the government. 

Additionally, I just found out my lawyer passed away so I can't ask him questions regarding my past/how to fill out the background check information. 

As a juvenile (15-16), I was in a predicament that I honest to God don't remember the full verdict of. It was a bit traumatizing. I know i didnt go to jail. I did go to therapy, etc. If I have to give more detail for you guys, I will. But it's not something that is job related or anything. 

Moreover, I had a one night in jail due to my grandmother being drunk one night and her and I getting into an argument. No harm was done to either of us but at the time, we did not see eye to eye. (Im trans and she didn't like that). It was a misdemeabor battery/disorderly. The charges were dismissed/no prosecution. I'm working on actually trying to get my fingerprints removed.

None of these charges show up on ccap. Only the last one shows up on a standard background check. All of these were before I was 22. I'm 31 now.

I live in Wisconsin.

My question is, can they see the juvenile stuff? 

If my adult charges were dismissed, it means there's no conviction so I shouldn't have to worry or put that down, right? 

Is there a place I can contact to get my questions answered? I contacted my local court, they were extremely rude. The Criminal History Unit, State of Wisconsin Department of Justice couldn't give me answers...but they are why I'm trying to get my fingerprints removed. 

Any help would be appreciated. As I said, this would be life changing for me. I really dont want to let this slip by. ",DannyJSchwe,1,1.0,0,1707952488,2024-02-14 23:14:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ar0sn7/data_center_job_level_4_background_check_questions/,2,2024

I (an entry-level assistant who has been working full-time for the past 6 months/was moved to this team last month) was sent a letter template created by my supervisor and approved by their supervisor, and was instructed to personalize each letter to our invitees. One aspect of the template was the type of visa they should be applying for. This is what was incorrect. When I received the template I did not think to check if this visa type was right, since it was approved by my supervisor/their supervisor and I have no knowledge of visa processes, they do. 

I personalized each letter, and drafted the email we would attach to the letter to be sent to each person- in which I include the incorrect visa type found in the original letter template- I sent my email draft to my supervisor to approve, and they correct the visa type to the correct one.  I then sent the letter with the incorrect visa type along with the correct email. 

I realized just now that, since it was changed in my email, it probably should have been changed in the letter- I assumed (which I shouldn’t have) that my supervisor and their supervisor were right, and for whatever reason this is the way they wanted to communicate with the conference attendees… But after looking it up myself, I’m seeing that the visa type included in the letter was actually wrong. Like it doesn’t exist. 

I’ve really struggled with feeling incompetent, and while I know the mistake isn’t mine- I did not draft the letter template and was just following orders and sending it out- I feel bad that I didn’t catch this mistake or think to change it after it was corrected the first time. 

I’ve just told my supervisor what happened, but I’m not really sure what to do. Could this be something blamed on me..? I mean I did fail to catch the error/think to correct it and sent it out wrong.

I am truly Stumped.

For once in my life everything seems to be going great. I have recently been offered two jobs and i can't decide between the two.

For Navy Federal i would be doing  **Delinquency Control Counselor** , and it would be half remote half at in office. I never done any type of Call Centers. I have done remote work before.

All of my experience has been doing Logistic Work for Government Contracting as i already have a security Clearance. I don't know if i should go with the government job as their will probably both have a lot of room to grow. Only thing in the past when the government loses contracts it seems to lose a lot of employees.

For DLA it looks like its a going to be ordering parts and stuff, which i do have a lot of experience in that is my expertise. It is also on a Naval Shipyard which is a honor to work at.

I would have to move back home where i dont know as many people to work for the Government job though, but i can always meet new people.

Can anyone give me advice on what to do or a different perspective?

Navy Federal pays 18.50 an hour but does overtime,

Where DLA does 40,132$ (around 20.50).

I told my boss things with a project were great and all information was present. Cut to 2 months later during an anxiety spell I think why not take a look again. Turns out all is not great or present. 

The assignment was already turned in and is going through soon. There's a chance it could be ratified but chances are slim and out of my control and would cause a lot of embarrassment to the client and the firm. 

It's technically too late to make any changes to the assignment at all as it would have had to be accepted.

This is fact but mostly what I tell myself to feel better. 

In reality,  it may possibly get fixed but would surely result in me being fired and a very very tense client talk which would put contracts in jeopardy. Hoenstly I already put the whole contract in jeopardy. Me being fired solely with no other outcomes harming the team would honestly be the best case scenario. 
But I also am unsure because I discussed with the client the possibility of this happening but I don't think they expected it to be on this scale. Additionally, the cold hard truth is this was not what they asked for. This is entirely an issue of my own making from my own bad decision making and my own failure to fix when given the chance. Embarrassing ik.

Additonally, I have screwed up so many times (each month a new realization of a new fuck up) no matter how right i think I got it. In fact this isn't the only f up in that assignment currently.

1aquluw,I don’t have the right personality for my role and am struggling.,"I have been working in corporate for eight years, primarily dealing with tools & technologies to support operations. I was damn good at it and started managing my own team. It was challenging, but rewarding and I gained a lot of new skills. I busted my ass all day, everyday because I enjoyed it. I was a top performer in my department and regularly recognized. 

I started in a new role a few months ago at the request of my manager. He wants me in this role because it’s a component of my industry and if I am going to continue in this career path, I need to perform this role at least once. 

My problem is that I am *terrible* at it and I hate it. It requires an aggressive personality and deals with a lot of high stakes negotiations with sales people. I am a people pleaser to a fault and frankly, I have an inferiority complex. It stems from some mental health issues for which I am in therapy. For whatever reason, I didn’t have issues with resolving conflicts in my old role. Maybe because we were all on the same side in the end. 

My boss is supportive and wants me to succeed. I am getting along for the most part, but it’s like pulling teeth and I find myself doing little to nothing for most days. It’s becoming a feedback loop for my depression.  

I can’t and won’t quit and I know it will get easier as I mature in the role.. it’s only been three months. But I can’t do this long term for my own sanity.

1aqsoy6,How would you handle this salary negotiation? (Toronto),"I am hoping to get some advice from all of you around an upcoming salary negotiation and some information that I just learned. My meeting is this Thursday, and considering the below information, I am very curious how each of you would handle this salary negotiation and if you would even mention this golf membership. More details below, but please let me know your thoughts.

I also want to say that I am very aware that I do well for myself, and there are a lot of people who would greatly appreciate the offers I received. This is in no way meant to brag, complain, or look for pity amongst you all. I am just trying to maximize my opportunities and get the most out of every situation that I can.


I work in fully discretionary wealth management and have so for the last 7 years, specifically for high-net-worth clientele. Last year (Jan 2023) I changed firms after some internal changes at my previous employer. This previous employer had offered me around total compensation (salary + bonus) that was about $15,000 higher than my current firm, but I really felt like I could be a long-standing member of the team with better growth potential. Now to be clear, after speaking with some recruiters, my current compensation is within the range for my role, but on the lower/average end of the spectrum.
Fast forward to the present, and my boss pulled my aside to discuss renegotiating my salary. He offered me a 3-year deal with a salary increase schedule that is $10,000 increase this year, with the following 2 years my salary increasing by $5,000 annually. These are not small increases in salary, and the first one is above the standard 3%-5% range. Bonus structure still undiscussed.
 
With that being said, there are some job performance details that I believe are important to consider. I have done well with the team, and I would say outside one of the associates who has been there for 7 years, I am the next most trusted person on the team. My objectives for the year were to get to know the 100 families that I was taking over for and get familiar with the business their process, etc.
 
All those things were achieved successfully, and on top of that I helped to bring in $40,000 worth of annual reoccurring revenue, with a high likelihood of getting an additional $14,000. This $40,000 makes up about 1% of our recurring revenue for the year. In addition, I have a few more opportunities in the pipeline, with another sizeable chunk of revenue generation of approx. $50,000.
 
I have been working on find some referral sources and officially setup a reciprocal relationship with a very large law firm. They believe that they can refer us ultra high net worth clientele and even confirmed that they are dealing with some billionaires that could use our assistance in some cases. We continue to meet with them and develop this relationship. Furthermore, I have been an integral part of a direct mailing campaign that has been bringing in some significant opportunities. I have been and am involved the strategy, collecting prospect information, and coordinating each new letter that we send out to over 2,000 people with a mailing house.
 
Now the piece of information that I learned this week: The other associate who has been on the team for 7 years, is likely going to be getting a golf membership with annual dues of around $20,000 per year and initiation of $100,000. This associate has been very important to the team, especially for prospecting purposes, and I assume that prospecting is the main goal with this decision. It is a good idea, but I can’t help but think that is also quite the personal benefit and I am not sure how I feel about it.
 
Thank you all for taking the time to read through this and assist me!",Turco1515,1,1.0,4,1707932263,2024-02-14 17:37:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aqsoy6/how_would_you_handle_this_salary_negotiation/,2,2024
1aqslm5,Study abroad vs study online: which one to choose?,"Hey guys,

I recently received an offer letter from the **University of Edinburgh to pursue a master's degree in Innovation and Entrepreneurship**. It is an exciting opportunity, but I have also discovered that the **University of Oxford offers an online post-graduate program**. The online program consists of four annual one-week online meetings, followed by a traditional graduation ceremony in Oxford.

  
While I am thrilled about the prospect of living and studying in Edinburgh, the online program offered by the University of Oxford presents an attractive opportunity. With an online program, I can receive a prestigious education from a world-renowned university while continuing to work and reside in Brazil.

**I am facing a dilemma between two great opportunities**: one option would allow me to reside in a smaller city abroad and pursue a master's degree, without the need to work during the course, while the other option consists of an online post-graduate program from the University of Oxford. 

**Although the Edinburgh opportunity sounds exciting, it may be challenging to determine whether the diploma would be recognized and would yield financial returns in Brazil**. On the other hand, I am uncertain about the online program, but the **University of Oxford degree appears to be more prestigious.**

Additionally, both courses are similar in terms of costs, with Oxford charging higher tuition. However, taking the online course would enable me to continue working and remain in Brazil, which would help reduce living costs. As I need to make a decision soon, I would like to seek some guidance from the community. Would anyone have any advice on how to choose between the two options? Any insights would be greatly appreciated!",gabrielleori,1,1.0,0,1707932032,2024-02-14 17:33:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aqslm5/study_abroad_vs_study_online_which_one_to_choose/,2,2024

1aqs6zc,What's the best way to change careers?,"Hello!

I have been considering changing my career for a while now, but I am struggling to figure out the best way possible to get to the career I want so I thought I might share my experience on here and get some insight!

For some background, I was interested in pursuing a career in photojournalism when I was getting ready to go to college. I ended up changing my major and even my university last minute due to a variety of reasons, but I ended up pursuing a degree and career in working in nonprofits. I have enjoyed many of my experiences and have learned a lot and grown as an individual in the years that I have studied and worked in this career field, but my passion for photography and writing has never left.

I now work for a university as an advisor and coordinator and have the chance to get a master's degree, or a degree in general, with a tuition reduction. I thought about getting a masters in English since it was broad enough to get me closer to a career in journalism or writing in general, but I have been struggling with my job for the couple of months that I have been here. There is nothing specifically about this job that is terrible, but I have very little motivation to do my job and I just feel so awful everyday. I think about quitting all the time, but I don't want to hop to another place where I'll end up feeling the same way or miss the opportunity to get a degree at a discounted cost.

Because I was struggling so much with this job, I thought of the possibility of going to a local community college and working on getting an associates degree instead. It would still be fairly affordable compared to other options and I wouldn't have to stay at my current job. I could also get an associates degree in journalism which is what I specifically want to do. I would have liked to pursue a masters degree in journalism, but after researching the program that my university offers, I wouldn't qualify due to their prerequisites. 

So now I am between these two choices, but I am not sure which one will actually be more beneficial in making a career change. If getting a masters in English is the better move, then I want to figure out how to stay in my current position and get past this funk I am in, but if getting a associates in journalism would be the better way to go, then I'll take the opportunity to start looking at other jobs.

If anyone has any insights or experience in the journalism field and might know what degree would be more useful in getting a career as journalist, I would greatly appreciate any help!",ReviewSufficient,1,1.0,0,1707931048,2024-02-14 17:17:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aqs6zc/whats_the_best_way_to_change_careers/,2,2024
1aqs1s7,Career Advice - Wealth Management,"Looking for some advice on next career steps in wealth management. 24 years old, graduated in May 2022 from non-target with a finance degree. Worked for 1 year on a team at UBS in Southern California. Licensed with SIE, Series 7, and 66. I found the role predominantly centered around cold calling and felt it did not align with my career aspirations. I also am originally from the East Coast and wanted to be closer to family and learning in a more fast paced environment.

Currently 6 months into a job in NYC at JPM. Support 3 advisors with books all around $1mil. While I appreciate the work-life balance that comes with this position, I find myself yearning for more substantial challenges. My responsibilities primarily revolve around operational tasks such as placing trades, handling client inquiries, and preparing documents for advisor meetings.

Seeking advice on logical next steps in wealth management. I like what I do, but I seriously feel like I am underutilized and have more to give. The job itself just isn’t very challenging. I also would love to be compensated more, but obviously understand the long-game nature of the industry as well as the work-life tradeoffs. That being said, I wouldn’t mind more work and less life, honestly. Additionally, there is a lot of down time between tasks and I think I would be more suited in a project-based role rather than task-based. I am planning on beginning the WMCP in March because my firm pays for it and credits go towards the CFP. I would also like to do the CFP by mid-2025 but I’m hesitant to set aside the study time if it doesn’t make sense for my career trajectory. I enjoy wealth management, but I can see it getting extremely draining hand holding clients each day. I am quite extroverted, but don’t necessarily need to be in a team setting.

Is there another angle that I should be considering? I am open to exploring various avenues within JPM, as well as considering other career paths, such as corporate finance. Additionally, I am keen on leveraging my licenses and would appreciate advice on how to maximize their utility. Any insights or recommendations from fellow professionals in the field would be immensely valuable.

Thank you in advance for your guidance and expertise.

1aqqwof,"Considering applying for my dream job, not sure what to do...","Alright. I've been dealing with a career conundrum for about a year now. Even talked to my therapist about it and I still can't manage to make a decision. Please bear with me as I tell my tale, seeking your advice.

In 2022 I graduated a research masters in Environmental History. I wanted to do a PhD, applied to a few, got invited to all, and was second choice each time, but only by a hair. 

January 2023 I found a government job as an administrative assistant with the aim to follow a training and become someone who checks up on companies and organisations to see whether they adhere to our Environmental laws and regulations. I started the training finally in October 2023.

I never intended for this to be my eternal job. It is also below what challenges me and I thrive on a certain amount of stress, challenge and excitement (I have ADHD). So when my job was making me go towards a bore-out I took on a part-time teaching job at the University (Nov 2023 until July 2024).

I had quit searching and applying for PhDs because my husband and I want to start trying for a child (like, within 3 months from now) and a PhD and pregnancy/newborn is just.... very intense. So we decided it would be better to sit this current job out for a bit (low stress, great maternity leave, stable job and income, etc.).

In the meantime a lot has changed at my full-time administrative job. Things are going south due to system changes and our team is under immense stress and they're asking the impossible. It's gotten to the point where I fantasise about calling in sick for a week for my mental health or when I feel the slightest bit of ill or have a bad night of sleep I want to call in sick.

Now... last year a PhD vacancy in my city was posted and at the time I didn't apply because if the aforementioned reason. Another reason I didn't apply is because I feel intense anxiety at the thought of letting my current employer now I'm leaving, despite having acted all intrigued and excited about my future position in the organisation. I'd feel _so_ awkward. 

However, the PhD vacancy was reposted and it has made me reconsider. The last months of teaching really reaffirmed what I already knew: academia is really what makes me happy and when I come home from those workdays I am radiating. My husband always remarks this and says ""I should take a before and after because the difference is so immense"". 

So yea. I'm reconsidering applying for this PhD (especially this one in particular since it's in our current city and all the other universities require 4h travel a day at minimum (back and forth combined) and that truly is too much for me as I very much value having time for my family and despise public transport).

I know applying doesn't mean I'll get it. But if I do... I'd have to have a very awkward conversation, and hopefully combine this with a pregnancy and newborn. And academia is no joke, the workpressure is intense as I've already experienced throughout my studies.

What would you do in my position?

1aqoheq,Confused about my Career since the past 10 years. Need Advise!,"Hi, thank you for going through to this post! I am a bit confused at this point and I need help/advise!

I (m/27) am a Bachelor in Management studies, specialised in Marketing, in India. I have been working since 2018, mainly in different sectors, from Sports, to Events, and then finally into Digital Marketing and social media.

I have also wasted 2-3 years out of these past 6 years, either Jobless or looking for the 'right"" company or the ""right"" Job.

My issue is that I am an extreme overthinker, with analysis Paralysis and fear of long-term failure. 
I am lazy and Procrastinate alot.
I am into Digital Marketing because my friend suggested it in 2017, that's it. I've been trying to learn every year, apply. I enjoy it a bit.

I am inclined to alot of unconventional career ideas like Music (I play the Guitar and Sing well), or  Sports journalism/ Sports coaching or Content Creation.
But I start none,
1. Looking at low pay
2. High likelihood of failure
3. Clueless in direction
4. Lazy and Procrastination 

Because of these possible careers, I'm not currently fulfilled, am i wrong? Right?
I didn't do any masters as well, so no MBA or anything. Hence at a Lower Pay scale

Maybe I need to figure out what I Love? That's also alot of things then.
Football. Music. Traveling. F1. Anime. Movies. Content Creation. Etc.

I have been thinking of Freelancing as a Digital Marketer to earn more, but I have pretty limited skill and even lesser execution experience. I need to learn and try alot.
At the age of 27, I'm at 35k/month or 4.2lpa, which is very very low.
I just can't focus or stick to something too long. I don't want to self diagnose but i think I have ADHD, I took ADHD meds as a kid, to study for 10th board exams.

I am confused what i should do ahead. Digital Marketing? Content Creation? Sports? Music?
Everyday I have myself questioning again and again and inclined towards doing *something different*.

I feel like a constant failure and dumbfuck.

Need Advise on ""HOW SHOULD I CHOOSE MY CAREER PATH"" and where can I get a Mentor?

Any advise and suggestions are welcome, thank you!

TLDR : confused about my career path, been switching fields too long. Scared to try risky fields but interested in those, like Music, football, sports etc. confused how to guide the next steps of my career.

1aqn0fw,Transitioning into more “official” HR role,"Although my background (both education - master’s degree - and employment) is higher education, my position for eleven years included essentially complete HR for our department’s 70 student employees. Some of my responsibilities included: onboarding (paperwork and training), training (semi-annual for all employees, including both skill training and professional development), and recruitment (marketing, application review, first round interviews, applicant tracking). I created all of this from scratch, as my position had been vacant for some time before I was hired and nothing was passed on. I supervised 14-20 student employees (hiring, scheduling, ongoing training, timesheet approval, disciplinary actions, and reviews) as well as a few full-time staff members. One year, I was even asked by the university’s director of training and development for HR to create and facilitate a series of workshops for other supervisors of student employees on campus, since our student staff program was so strong. 

I’d love to move into a HR-specific field, but I’m concerned that I won’t even be considered since at a glance my previous positions don’t appear to be HR-based and most HR-related aspects were for student employees rather than full-time staff. Of course I’m highlighting the appropriate responsibilities and achievements in my resume and cover letter, and I’m not considering positions that are unrelated to my work history (for example, benefits would be entirely out of my wheelhouse). What types of positions should I be considering at this stage, and how can I get past the initial hurdle of a resume with no HR titles?

When I interviewed for this position, I was told that I would bring in my experience(tax validation) to help with their processes; but after spending a month here, I’m starting to realize this job is mainly tax reporting and has nothing to do with my old job.

For context, this would be only the second job in my career, so I do not possess any other “specialties” or solid skills to work in the new role I am in (which is a higher level position)

I realize that when you move up into a new role, there will be challenges, but I feel kind of overwhelmed by the expectations as the functions of this job are super new. So I am back to square one, where I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing. This position doesn’t give me the privilege of getting trained, all of the functions are to be learned through documentation which aren’t all that helpful.

I have one teammate that has experience in tax reporting, through which I am learning little by little, but I have a feeling that it is becoming clear to my boss that I do not know much of what I am doing and I feel I might get fired in near future. 

On top of all this, I am not really sure if I want to work in tax as a career and I really do not have a passion in this. I am also very homesick (moved for this role), feeling depressed and thinking every morning “what will happen today” is just draining me.

1aqghvc,Was a UI/UX Designer but got laid off. Studied Statistics at UCLA. Where can I pivot to? Should I get a Masters?,"Hello!

I am a UI/UX Designer who got laid off from my first role back in July 2023 (almost 7 months now) and I am struggling to find roles in UI/UX and Product Design. I have \~2 years of design experience (only one of which true corporate experience). I've gotten a few interviews, but no offers, and I'm starting to lose hope and quit design altogether. Design doesn't feel stable at all and I fear I will eventually go through this cycle again 20 years in the future. 

I am considering pivoting back to data analysis (I graduated from UCLA in 2022 for Statistics), but I don't have any data-related projects or internships to back me up, and I hear that data analyst roles are extremely saturated, just like UX, so I fear that I am not a competitive applicant at all. Also, I am a bit out of practice in R and have no SQL knowledge. 

Because of this, I'm hesitant to transition back to data analysis. Do I still have hope of becoming a data analyst with just projects? Or should I go back to school and get M.S. in Analytics?  Or should I stay the course and get a M.S. in HCI or something related to that? It seems like every option is bad because the jobs that follow are saturated or don't guarantee security. What are some other fields I should research that have use for my skill sets in visual design, user research, or data analysis, and have a decent barrier to entry? Is Supply Chain Analyst roles worth pivoting towards?

As you can see my mind is everywhere :/ Would appreciate any advice!

I would consider myself to be a person who learns software/processes quite easily (for example, Python/SQL/BI would be not that big of a deal to learn). My main thing is that I don't like presenting/speaking (even though I had to do it a lot in my previous role), and I think something that I could never do is Sales. 

In regards to salary, I previously earned 78k, and honestly, that was enough for me and I would be happy with that salary for the rest of my life (striving for DINK) so long as it provided work-life balance (I was severely overworked in my last role + toxic manager).

In regards to passions, I liked the work that I did in UI/UX because I got to design things and conduct user/market research! However, I vehemently hated the recruiting process (portfolio curation, portfolio presentations, product design exercises)--my first job took 6 months to get, and I forsee this happening again.

I love fashion, music, and entertainment, but I don't know how I could make career in those areas. I like graphic design, but don't consider myself to good enough to compete with people who went to schools just for design. I'm trying to learn Blender so that I can be a 3D artist (moreso as a hobby), but it's hard staying consistent when I'm juggling recruiting and a part-time Data Annotation job (I feel like if I'm learning Blender, I'm wasting time that could be spent elsewhere but haha I'm actually spending like 4-6 hours a day on TikTok which I know is really bad). 

In regards to mental health and what I want from life: My mental health is pretty bad! It's always been bad (since middle school, mainly attributed to high expectations, lack of a support system, and being lgbtq), and it's even worse now that I'm burned out (in truth, I don't want a career, I don't care about working, but I must work to live, and **am willing to dedicate myself to a career I don't care about so long as it's mentally stimulating and has decent WLB**).

1aqgbm2,Navy vs. Army OCS,"  
Hi, I know no one can predict the future, just looking for general career advice from those in the know. Can't post on r/army because account is new so posting here   
Been considering applying for an OCS for a while now. Trying to decide between Army or Navy OCS. I'm 24 years old. My main flaw in my application is a low GPA, 2.5. However, I believe myself to be an otherwise good candidate. I am very physically fit both strength wise and endurance wise, have good communication skills, attended a well ranked university, and I'm a good test taker so I think I would do fine on the OCS entrance tests. If it matters the low GPA was mostly due to spreading myself too thin with other clubs/activities on campus and just not prioritizing studying.  
I'm interested in joining the Navy because I've been sailing since I was a kid. However, I hear the Army has more open positions, and I'm interested in the work they do as well, especially abroad since I studied IR. I don't want to go to the trouble to apply to one and get rejected, I want to get a move on with my life. Any tips on making this decision? Can I apply to both?",Longjumping_Ask_4900,1,1.0,1,1707892002,2024-02-14 06:26:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aqgbm2/navy_vs_army_ocs/,2,2024

1aqel0d,Should I tell HR I know the company wants to fire me?,"Should I tell HR I know I’m getting fired?

My company is trying to put me on a PIP. Please look at my post history, I already made a post about the details. Tomorrow I have a meeting with HR as I was presented with my bonus and my performance was rated low 30 percent when last year it was almost 90 percent. I know that’s not possible as I have been putting more effort than ever. But I have realized they are trying to fire me. 
Like I mentioned, I have a meeting with HR tomorrow. I want to tell them the following things but I thought I’d ask you guys before I do as I don’t want to show all my cards. 

1) My manager who put me on a PIP is incompetent and untrustworthy. She sent me a fake email. She pretended to send me an email, don’t ask me how I know but I know the email is fake. I even checked with IT and they said the email was most likely never sent. I asked her to “forward as attachment” and she pretty much ignored that. Should I tell HR that how are we to trust someone who is lying at work? Also with that fake email, she jeopardized me responding to an urgent request which is one of the clauses on the PIP. That I need to be timely. But is she timely? I know this would have been more beneficial if i told on her before the PIP but I didn’t want to be a snitch. 

2)Should I tell HR I know that me being put on a PIP is preparing to have me fired and I’m aware about this? I work in legal and I have access to some sensitive documentation. I was searching for my PIP on my computer and through a shared drive, I found access to multiple PIP’s and lawsuits that happened. I checked the names of the employees and they aren’t with us anymore so assuming they were let go. I didn’t do any breach of privacy to find these PIP’s/claims. My drive has access to all this info. Should I tell them I know of the process and I’m aware they are trying to build a case or is that showing my cards?

I’m also going to chat with an employment lawyer. Also, look I know you guys will tell me to put my energy to looking for a new job but I can’t let shitty management get away pulling a stunt like this. I am ok to get fired as long as they give me some $$ on my way out for all this trauma.",New-Business-5330,1,0.6700000166893005,18,1707885970,2024-02-14 04:46:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aqel0d/should_i_tell_hr_i_know_the_company_wants_to_fire/,2,2024

1aqbi0i,How to switch from Statistics to DS (mid-level career),"As the title suggests, I am a statistical modeler. To be exact, I have a PhD in economics/applied econometrics, and have been professionally trained as a statistician. I work in consulting now for pharma and biomedical companies. This means I regularly run regression models (linear and GLM), longitudinal/clustered models (GEE/GLMM), propensity score modeling to approximate causal inference. I use bootstrap and Bayesian inference pretty regularly. I know a lot about randomized controlled trials which are similar in design (if not implementation) to the A/B experiments used in the tech space. I run a lot of computational experiments (eg, Monte Carlo simulation) to test new methods before taking to scale across client project. I can troubleshoot, lead teams, and teach methods.  
  
On the tech side I know R, git, various Bayesian sampling tools (eg JAGS), Stata, Mplus. Mostly statistical programming. I've learned and re-learned SQL (I don't use it often enough). I've only dabbled in Python. Obviously I have less expertise in SQL/Python, which is my limitation. But I teach people new skills all the time, and I have learned and re-learned skills before. If it means working late hours to figure out a code base at first, then I can do that.  
  
Does this fit the profile of a data scientist? How easy is it to switch from one sector (like mine, which is in health care) to another (such as fintech, entertainment, manufacturing, or something else).  
  
I am doing very well in terms of role and compensation, but I am tired of doing the same kinds of analyses over and over. I am not motivated anymore. I want to try something completely different. Has anyone done this? Any tips on how to kickstart this next step? Do I need to pull a Chandler Bing and take an internship at age 40?

I have taken career counseling sessions, and my results were INFP and Investigative, Social, and Creative. 

The careers I really want to pursue are 

-- Psychologist 

-- Counselor/Therapist 

-- Teaching

Now, I don't want to pursue a psychologist because I will need to give UG - 4yrs, Master's - 2yrs, and then Doctorate. Now I am okay with studying 5-6 or even upto 7yrs but not more.
I want to have a career with high security and income stability.

I have researched Counselor/ Therapist, and I really really want to become one. I am willing to put all my effort. But I have  heard that they are underpaid unless you do private practice.

I wanted to pursue teaching as a job, but my counselor and other reddit threads have told me that it is not worth it. As a teacher, you don't have any support, and you are basically fighting a lone battle.

I am in banking right now, and I don't want to do it. I don't like trades, big machinery, sales, working with hands etc.

1aq8ij0,"Feeling anxious about the functions of my new job, it is not what I expected","

When I interviewed for this position, I was told that I would bring in my experience(tax validation) to help with their processes; but after spending a month here, I’m starting to realize this job is mainly tax reporting and has nothing to do with my old job.

For context, this would be only the second job in my career, so I do not possess any other “specialties” or solid skills to work in the new role I am in (which is a higher level position)

I realize that when you move up into a new role, there will be challenges, but I feel kind of overwhelmed by the expectations as the functions of this job are super new. So I am back to square one, where I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing. This position doesn’t give me the privilege of getting trained, all of the functions are to be learned through documentation which aren’t all that helpful.

I have one teammate that has experience in tax reporting, through which I am learning little by little, but I have a feeling that it is becoming clear to my boss that I do not know much of what I am doing and I feel I might get fired in near future. 

On top of all this, I am not really sure if I want to work in tax as a career and I really do not have a passion in this. I am also very homesick (moved for this role), feeling depressed and thinking every morning “what will happen today” is just draining me. 

I want to give 2 more months then reevaluate but I just don’t see the future in this job and industry for myself.

Should I leave this job while I can and pursue a different career path?",PsychologicalAmount9,1,1.0,0,1707868244,2024-02-13 23:50:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aq8ij0/feeling_anxious_about_the_functions_of_my_new_job/,2,2024
1aq8eni,I could use some help trying to figure out how much to lower my salary demands in my job hunt.,"I worry I'm scaring away employers before they even get a chance to talk to me by listing my old salary as my desired salary. Most sites don't even allow me to put in a range, just one number.

For insight - I've been out of work for almost two years after breaking my pelvis on another continent. Then I needed a major surgery. I've only been really searching since January of this year.

In 2022 I was making $135,000 as a Media Director for an ad agency in Chicago (remote). That's a pretty high wage for where I live. In 2021 I took on an Associate Director role for $100,000. Prior to that (pre-Covid, where I was laid off), I was consulting for $45 an hour (probably a discount). And lastly, as essentially a Sr. Manager for a Fortune 500 in 2018, I was making $75,000.

There's a broad difference between what I can ""make work"" and feeling like I'm being properly valued. I understand that a two year gap is a big deal and I need to be aware my value is low, but also prices have gone up everywhere and my cost of living situation is higher than it was, with no opportunities for me to downsize/move elsewhere.

What would people suggest? Do I bring it down by a %? Do I bring it to $100,000? ",IGNSolar7,1,1.0,3,1707867970,2024-02-13 23:46:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aq8eni/i_could_use_some_help_trying_to_figure_out_how/,2,2024
1aq8d57,Should I transfer jobs,"Hi I just had a baby ( 5 months old) and I have a demanding job where I travel Monday through Thursday most weeks but some weeks I'm at home. Some weeks I can bring my husband and my baby with me as my husband is not working right now.
I have every holiday and every weekend off.
I am the mom if that matters. I've always pictured myself to want to be a very involved mom.

I like my job very much but the company has squeezed us a little bit recently and it is demanding of my time. Most people would probably say that my job is not the best for someone with young kids but I do have 3 co-workers out of about 50 plus others that have young kids at home.  Those other coworkers are men.

I always thought that I would jump at a remote position if it ever came up and I even had an alert on the company HR site to email me every time a job with the word remote in it came up, finally one came up that I am qualified for after over a year and I jumped on it right away. My entire family and friends thought it was the best thing to do.
When I applied this job was a day shift and when I called the manager he told me that there was a slight chance that it could become a second shift if someone from second shift wanted the day shift.

When I did my first interview I was told it was day shift. When I did my second interview a month later I was told that it was second shift and the hours were even more horrible than I thought they could be which was 1:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. everyday including Saturday. Mon Sun off.
My job right now is very independent and I have a lot of flexibility in what time I arrive at various sites so I'm definitely not used to this type of inflexible highly monitored job with this terrible set schedule.
The time has come that they have told me today to apply for the position again because they wanted to change some wording with the shift times and they want to make it a done deal.

I'm really worried that this job does not give me much time with my baby as I thought working from home would and for several other reasons I don't think I'll like this job very much.
What should I do? I feel like I've already pretty much accepted the job and I'm having regrets. They haven't discussed pay in detail only vaguely telling me that if I accept the shift they would try to match my pay so I do still need to ask about that. I wish that I hadn't rushed to say that I could do the new schedule when I had my second interview last week I should have told them I need to think about it but I did mention that it was not my preferred schedule.
The only plus side is that I do have an Airbnb that Im trying to get off the ground and I could work from there and I really would like to be on that property more but other than that this remote job turned out to be a bust. If I say no I'm worried that an entire department will be pissed off at me and would never look to hire me again if situation changes.
I'm also worried that I might get burnt out on the travel eventually after a while being away from my baby my current supervisor told me that she would try to see if I could travel a bit less but she's on vacation right now and it seems that this other department wants me to officially put in for the transfer this week.

1aq85lu,"Received a verbal offer for a life changing job, but hitting a ""speed bump"" after a super organized process. Any others experience this?","The recruiter last Friday gave me a verbal offer for a life changing role and money. She ambitiously said they'd get it to me by Monday despite a Sales Kick Off happening this week.  
  
I reached out to confirm if they were still on track for Monday EOD and she called me 20 minutes later. Told me that the hiring manager needs to check in with a few senior leaders that referred candidates and he needs to give them a heads up there not giving an offer to their referral. I pressed her to see if I need to be concerned they're interviewing, but she assured me there was nothing to worry about and even updated the start date due to a black out period for new hires. Then said at the latest they'll get back to me by end of week.  
  
A little odd to get that note in the final hour, this has been by far the most organized process I've been apart of.  
  
Schedule the next calls immediately  
  
Interviewers with extended team give me positive feedback on the calls and even sometimes after to my thank you note.  
  
The recruiter follows up with positive feedback the next day after the interviews as well  
  
Hiring manager shared positive feedback during my final presentation and even responded to my thank you note reinforcing the positive comments.  
  
Scheduled a ""coffee chat"" call with who would be my direct report  
  
Quickly got feedback from my reference.  
  
Recruiter proactively scheduled a ""verbal offer/salary expectation/start date call"" that took place an hour after my last reference.  
  
Even told the person that referred me that I got the job immediately after they verbally offered.  
  
So ultimately my gut tells me it's going to be ok, but obviously a little concerning because it would be brutal to get blindsided in the final lap like this to internal politics.  
  
Especially considering, how organized the process has been and how much positive feedback I've received verbally and in emails.  
  
I'm so anxious this week waiting for the final word.

1aq822z,Boss expects me to do more work than I have time for- help,"I (21F) work at an accounting firm as a junior accountant. I started almost three years ago as an assistant and was recently ""promoted"" to that role. I work 35 hrs a week as I'm in school for electrical engineering, I didnt go to school for accounting. My boss is aware of this and let's me change my schedule to accomodate for classes. 

Since we're getting into tax season, and with my ""promotion,"" I've had to take on double the work I used to do and do not have the time to complete everything. I refuse to work more than 35 hrs, which my boss agreed upon, yet she said its expected we come in on Saturdays. 

I'm expected to send out document requests to clients, prepare tax return WP's and do data entry, pull statements for 20 ish clients, reconcile/do the bookkeeping and AJE's for 35+ (when I haven't even been taught how to do AJE's), prepare financials for 1 or 2, prepare and file sales tax for 10 ish (soon will be 15) clients, help with project management in a new software we're using, prepare 1099s (which are finally done), among other things. Cherry on top is I make $22 an hour. 

With my workload I'd have to work 45+ hours a week to feel comfortable with getting everything done. I'm getting to the point in school where I need to ask for less hours too. 
My #1 priority is to school and I feel like I'm gonna have to directly tell my boss that.

I've brought up twice how I feel overwhelmed with my workload and her response was essentially to manage my tasks differently. I'm getting really frustrated and honestly only do this job cause it allows me to go to classes and helps pay for school. I'm at the point I'm trying to look for other jobs. 

What can I tell my boss to help her understand my circumstances better?

1aq6h66,"My manager told me to wait until July to start a project, but I knew I needed to start it in December. Now the VP and higher-ups are impressed and excited by my results, but I feel like my manager is taking all the credit.","When I joined this company in November, I discovered that a program I'd been asked to manage was, put simply, a complete mess. The girl before me had no idea what she was doing with it (which was one of the reasons why they let her go). Because of my experience at other companies, I knew there were better programs on the market. I suggested this to my boss and my boss's boss and offered to begin interviewing possible replacements. 

My manager told me in a message that I could put a reminder on my calendar to start looking in July. Well, I knew based on my experience that this could take a while, so I began setting up calls in December. The companies I found provided private demos and I narrowed down the list to two vendors, and then set up meetings with my manager, his boss, and our other colleague so they could meet the final two choices.

The VP of our group was excited by this development and wanted us to talk about it with the corporate team. I was invited to this meeting, but not able to get one single word in. My boss did say, ""Manager and balletbouquet have been setting up meetings to find a new program"" but this struck me as odd because my manager didn't set up a single meeting or even research any of the options I found. Had it been up to him, we would have been waiting until July to get started on this.

Now the VP wants us to ask other departments if they could benefit from this program too. I feel like, just because I have ""assistant"" in my title, I am treated like garbage and undervalued. For example, the VP also asked the head of a department I work with closely if they'd like less direct contact with me, and for me to funnel my suggestions/ideas/comments via a more senior team member instead of directly sending Teams messages to the head of the department myself. I was SHOCKED by this. Both the head of the department and the senior team member repeated that they were fine with how things are communicated, and the senior team member said, ""I appreciate manager and balletbouquet so much.""

This struck me as odd, YET AGAIN, because my manager does not send these people in question any suggestions/ideas/comments. I do. That is what I have been doing since I started. 

Am I being sensitive, or is my manager getting credit for my work and I'm being treated like a peon?",balletbouquet,2,1.0,1,1707863132,2024-02-13 22:25:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aq6h66/my_manager_told_me_to_wait_until_july_to_start_a/,2,2024

For about a month I've been applying for jobs and interviewing. I finally got an offer recently (not accepted yet), but the start date won't be for a few weeks and I have other interviews lined up.  
  
This job isn't my first choice, and while it is more pay, the benefits/PTO also leave a bit to be desired (I didn't realize you could negotiate PTO days) - I'm losing 10 days of PTO compared to my old company. Granted, I was at my last company for over half a decade, so I did build that up over time.  
  
I want to take this offer so I have a job locked in and not have to worry about employment anymore. But I also want to be open if something better falls on my lap, as I still have some interviews lined up for the next few weeks.  
  
Is it a ""dick"" move to accept this offer and then back out/quit a bit down the line if something better opens up soon? Not saying something WILL, as I'm still in the interview phase at other companies, but it is a possibility.  
  
Also, while I ""negotiated"" my pay on the phone, can I call HR and ask about negotiating more PTO days? I would like to get 5 more at least - getting my extra 10 I'm used to probably isn't realistic.

I’m at my high school on a full ride, am captain of the  tennis team, and am president of multiple projects/clubs. I’ve also worked in retail, interned at neuropsych practices, ran tennis programs, coached tennis, and tutored (among other random jobs). I’ve never worked at a non-summer job for less than 6 months and my references all love me. I personally don’t see anything immediately wrong about my resume, but if anyone sees a red flag from an employer’s perspective, please let me know! 

I quit my job of 2 years a few months ago because they kept promoting me while somehow decreasing my pay and am looking for a job for the next 5-6 months before college. I’ve looked into a few different places and while they all expressed interest in me, they all also basically turned me down once they found out I’m a high school senior.

1aq3849,Accepted a job but not in the field I was hoping for.,"Hello, 

I just graduated in Dec of last year with a B.S in Physics. I applied to grad schools but I got a few rejections right now and things aren’t looking so great with the rest. 3 months, which I know isn’t a long time, I haven’t been able to find any lab positions or anything related to physics but I got a sales job. 

This isn’t where I wanted to end up so I’m feeling a bit directionless. I accepted the job since I need the money.

I wanted some advice about this situation. I want to get a STEM job since I have a physics degree but I only have relatively small amounts of research experience. I have programming experience but no huge projects to show for it as my research didn’t really go beyond data analysis. I was thinking about just sticking with the sales job and going to school in a year to do a CS degree but that also makes me very disheartened.

1aq2m4s,How to switch to a career in finance?,"Hi all! I would like to shift fully to a career in finance, but not sure how to do it. 

I (M28) work for a non-profit organization, as a project officer. My responsibilities are 60% finance and 40% admin, and I have over 6 years of experience with similar functions/organisation.

I recently got promoted (“junior” title scrapped) and when I asked my employer to change to 100% finance, they refused saying they still need me to do admin and activities implementation stuff. I have been here for 3 years and kind of want to move on anyway. Also my salary is definitely below the market. 

Problem is, I don’t speak Dutch or French. Also, I am still doing my Masters degree, hopefully will graduate this summer. Degree is in Economics, Business and Management, so quite relevant, I think. My bachelors was in Law.

I realized I am quite good at working with numbers, and I do enjoy this kind of work. I don’t mind working as an accountant, finance manager, or analyst. 

What would you recommend? What qualification do you think I should do? I guess I definitely need a certificate in either Oracle or Bi-finance? I guess I should definitely learn Dutch or French?

1aq1yz0,Take your power back in your job search,"
Before searching, be strategic and create a 'company description' to guide you. Just like company do to fill a role. 

This will help you avoid applying to and wasting time on companies that don't align with your profile. Here's what it should include:

- Industry
- Company size (startup or corporate)
- Top 5 values
- Management style
- Corporate philosophy
- Growth perspective after 1 or 2 years in the position
- Benefits
- Working hours

1aq1jug,The scope of my new job is way higher than the scope of my old job. Feeling anxious.,"When I interviewed for this position, I was told that I would bring in my experience(tax validation) to help with their processes; but after spending a month here, I’m starting to realize this job is mainly tax reporting and has nothing to do with my old job.

For context, this would be only the second job in my career, so I do not possess any other “specialties” or solid skills to work in the new role I am in (which is a higher level position)

I realize that when you move up into a new role, there will be challenges, but I feel kind of overwhelmed by the expectations as the functions of this job are super new. So I am back to square one, where I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing. This position doesn’t give me the privilege of getting trained, all of the functions are to be learned through documentation which aren’t all that helpful.

I have one teammate that has experience in tax reporting, through which I am learning little by little, but I have a feeling that it is becoming clear to my boss that I do not know much of what I am doing and I feel I might get fired in near future. From what I can infer, my manager hired us thinking no training is necessary and we are experienced enough to run this show. However, I’m not experienced in this stuff and struggling a lot.

My expectations were that I would have a team, or people to rely on because I was prepared for a learning curve, but did not expect this. Again, to reiterate, it just me and this other guy.

On top of all this, I am not really sure if I want to work in tax as a career and I really do not have a passion in this. I am also very homesick (moved for this role), feeling depressed and thinking every morning “what will happen today” is just draining me. 

I want to give 2 more months then reevaluate but I just don’t see the future in this job and industry for myself.

1aq1hjy,Need some advice on whether or not to withdraw myself from consideration for a job,"Hi all! I need some advice. 

I applied for a local government position in early January. I was called for an interview on January 17, and they seemed to be in a rush to interview me as they said they wanted me to come in on the 19th. That day was highly inconvenient for me and I even mentioned that I was going out of town that day, but I agreed to interview on the 19th since they seemed to be in a rush and I really wanted the job.

I interviewed on January 19th and it seemed to go well. I was told I would hear back the following week. The next day (Saturday), I received a call from the hiring manager who asked me to complete an assignment as part of the vetting process and to please submit this assignment by EOD Tuesday, January 23. Please note that he reiterated in the follow-up email to me that they wanted this assignment before “making our decision next week.” No problem, I did the assignment (which took me about 5 hours to complete) and sent it off to the hiring manager. He confirmed he received it.

After that, I heard nothing. I was getting super antsy because I had been given a specific timeline as to when I would hear back. Two weeks went by and I realized they had reposted the position on January 24 with no closing date! I emailed to follow up (without mentioning that I had seen the reposted position) and the hiring manager said that they were still interviewing candidates but all interviewed candidates were still under consideration, and they will reach out if they need anything from me. No specific timeline was stated in this email. No apology for ghosting me. Nothing.

It is nearing a month since my interview and I have a really sour taste in my mouth about this position now, which is so sad to me because I am super passionate about the work & I know I would’ve absolutely killed it in this role.

Should I email the hiring manager and ask to withdraw my name from consideration? If so, should I mention anything about the way I was treated? I would’ve been fine with them just flat-out telling me no, but being given the run-around and being ghosted was just super frustrating when I put hours of my time into an assignment for them.

Now, I'm drawn to the exciting world of Supply Chain, but the question remains: **which Master's program should I pursue?**

**Option 1: Master of Science in Logistics and Supply Chain Management (MSc LSCM)**

* This program offers a comprehensive dive into the intricacies of supply chains, from procurement and warehousing to transportation and distribution.
* It equips me with specialized knowledge and skills relevant to various supply chain roles.
* However, I'm concerned about the lack of directly transferable skills from my current experience and the potential need for additional industry-specific training.

**Option 2: Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) with a concentration in Supply Chain**

* This path integrates data analysis and problem-solving skills with supply chain knowledge.
* It broadens my skillset beyond traditional supply chain functions and potentially opens doors to diverse career opportunities.
* But, with my limited programming background, I worry about keeping up with the program's pace and effectively applying those analytical skills to the specific domain.

 **Here's my background:**

* I hold a Bachelor's degree in Supervision and Management.
* I have 4 years of general office experience, but no specific experience in supply chain management. I’ve done simple inventory for some of the offices I’ve worked for, but nothing too much beyond that.
* I'm definitely interested in entering the supply chain field, and I'm willing to put in the work to climb the ladder.

**The burning questions:**

* **With my background, which program would better equip me for a successful career in Supply Chain?**
* **Are there specific considerations or concerns I should weigh for each option?**

1apzfa0,Are these questions considered red flags in the job interview?,"
TL;DR: (1) Do you have a car? (2) Are you married?


Through LinkedIn, I applied to that job. After two days, the HR called me to schedule an interview. I went as an Engineer of +15 years’ experience to this fancy company which is located in an expensive financial district in my city. First there was an interview with the HR and then another one with the technical manager. However, I noted the following:


(1)	Both of them, asked me the same question: “Do you have a car?” and I answered “yes”. I implied from that they are trying to maintain kind of a social image of their company through their employees. As the use of public transportation in my country (I’m not from the US) is considered as an indication of lower social-economic status. But this begs the question in my mind: do you-as an employer- recruit based on merit, experience and professional attitude or showing off is a part of the equation?


(2)	The technical manager asked me: “are you married?” I was surprised by his question, and I answered “no” then I chuckled and asked “don’t you think this is a too personal question to ask? What is the purpose of it?” he responded in a sarcastic way (like he was offended) without looking at me “when you grow up, you will know!” so I told him “When I grow up, I will know?! No, I am old enough”. He then proceeds to tell me about his 35+ years of experience to prove “now, aren’t you convinced that you’re still young?” I replied “No, I am not. I am not young!”. He smiled and changed the subject. I was thinking what is wrong with this guy? Is he trying to assert his dominance on me only because I questioned his intrusive question?! Anyway, at the end he tried to explain why he asked me this as he sees that a single man will have more time to work than someone with family obligations – that’s it. So, I refuted this by stating that his company is using single men for doing more work than the others. He disagreed by saying that’s not always the case. 


If you were me, would you find this alarming or am I overthinking the interview? Specially that they offering me 1.5 of my current employer’s salary. I’d like to know your opinions.",Adamsayash,1,0.5,7,1707846078,2024-02-13 17:41:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1apzfa0/are_these_questions_considered_red_flags_in_the/,2,2024
1apzc3e,"Bad manager quit, need advice on how to benefit from this","Sorry for this very long and rambling post, I have only been in IT for ~5 years and the first few years I was more on the installation side. 

Okay to start with a little context, I am a level 1 support tech at a smaller MSP (about ~20 people, 4 of them are in management and the rest of us are split between remote and on-site help). The only people who are super relevant are the two owners ""Adam"" and ""Andrew"", the remote support manager ""Charlie"", and myself. I have been with the company for almost 2 years and the company has exploded since then, when I was hired the entire company was ~8 including me and we supported about 40% of the users we support today. Its been pretty cool to grow with the company, and it is relevant. 

Because of our growth we decided to actually sit down as a team and come up with some SOPs and to start doing things ""correctly"", and last June management made a new policy that impacted me pretty directly (I come in an hour early to catch any server/network issues that come in overnight) and I had an issue with one part of the policy. The policy itself and my issues with it aren't super relevant but this disagreement ended with Charlie yelling at me and suspending me (without pay) for the rest of the day and the next day in front of the entire team. IMO this was entirely unacceptable and I ended up turning in my resignation over this. 

The owners really didn't want me to leave and I had plenty of meetings with all three of them, or one on one with each of the managers. They assured me that it was unacceptable and it wouldn't happen again, and to their credit it did not. They also made it a very specific goal to give me more networking/sysadmin tickets (where I would like to go long term in my career) and that has been super nice. 

I kind of thought we would let bygones be bygones until yesterday when Charlie called a company wide meeting to resign effective immediately. His reasonings for quitting were that he didn't like the direction of the company (not super sure what he means by this), he didn't like how the owners didn't follow processes (true), and he didn't like feeling undermined by management which from what I gathered means he didn't like how he wasn't allowed to fire me. 

Now, immediately yesterday the two owners pulled me into the conference room to reassure me that they were very happy that I was here, and Charlie's feelings about me had absolutely no impact on their thoughts. We had another talk about where I wanted to go in my career and they apologized many times for me being ""unfairly pigeonholed by grudges"" and gave me a very slight pay raise with the promise of them helping to officially move into a sysadmin role because we will have one opening up here in a few months. 

Now, my work anniversary happens to be at the end of the month so I am going to sit down with the two owners to have my annual review and I was hoping maybe some of you guys could help me navigate this meeting. To be clear, I want this meeting to be largely optimistic about *my* future. I have had a number of long talks with management and I don't think it would be helpful to rehash the ""I don't like this"" or ""how do we prevent this from happening again"" because we have already gone over those things many times. I also want to be clear that this company is largely (besides the one manager) the best company I have ever worked for. 

Some questions I already have

* When I was hired we talked about certifications, but that has been pushed off the whole time I have worked here. Can we commit to actually getting me certified?
* If I do move into this new role, who will take over my existing workload? A new employee or existing coworkers. 
* Are there any other concerns or issues you have with me? I would *always* rather know I did something wrong, than it fester and cause issues
* I do actually agree with him about management not following internal processes, is there something we can do about that?",Lv_InSaNe_vL,1,1.0,0,1707845869,2024-02-13 17:37:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1apzc3e/bad_manager_quit_need_advice_on_how_to_benefit/,2,2024

My husband works in sales and had an amazing year. We were expecting a pretty decent bonus, but unfortunately when the bonuses were presented, the figure was not a reflection of his year. I could tell that my husband felt defeated, but I tried to remain supportive and positive. 

He recently received a call from his boss who brought up the topic of his bonus, and mentioned that it wasn’t as they had expected so his boss said he was going to put a request in for my husband to receive a raise and that he should come up with a figure by the end of the week. 

How does one approach this? My initial reaction is “he can’t ask for too much, he needs to be considerate with his request”; however I feel like this frame of mind is why we just can’t seem to get where we’d like to be, financially. While we do live a blessed, middle-class life, with inflation we are not in as comfortable of a position as we’d like to be, or have previously been in. For example, for a couple years we were able to contribute $500/month to a Roth IRA. This is our second year where we have not contributed a penny because we are using those funds for groceries, daycare, flood insurance (eye roll), etc. 

What are the questions we should be asking ourselves? 

What should we be researching? 

When presenting the figure, should he mention everything that he has considered to get to the final number? Bonus points if you can type of a type of speaking template or bullet points :) 

Am I overthinking all of this? 

I can provide more details, if needed, but really just want to ensure we are putting thoughtful consideration into this opportunity. Whatever we come back with, his boss will need to get approved, so I imagine that our request won’t be fully met, but we are so grateful to be in this position.",Nice-Somewhere-1314,6,0.8799999952316284,8,1707843439,2024-02-13 16:57:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1apyb5n/husband_was_offered_a_raise_but_was_asked_to_come/,2,2024
1apy60s,Not sure what to major in,"Hi so ill start by saying my main goal with a career is to migrate due to my country having so much normalized homophobia and sexism. I am currently a nursing major but i hate it and do not want to become a terrible nurse just to migrate. That would be so unfair to the people who genuinely have a passion for it.

&#x200B;

I would like something in business or tech, I'm introverted and i think it would suite me way better and i also did super well in those subjects during high school. I was thinking Comp Sci but I'm hearing how hard it is to get a job. I was also thinking marketing because i liked it in high school but again i have heard you do not really get visas with marketing, what other business degrees can i look into? Or any careers in general that an introvert can thrive in. (doesn't have to be in business or tech)

1apwuc2,Why should the average worker bother to take initiative anymore? (Where is the incentive?),"Is it so crazy to think that in 2024 NOBODY should be taking initiative without pay? Why do managers and team leads expect more and more to get done without even caring about their people? 

I complete all of my assigned work every day, sometimes right around the end of the day but other times I still have hours left and could technically start a new task. But why bother? There is no incentive at my job to take the initiative to complete more work. At the end of the day I am being paid what I’m being paid whether or not I don’t do anything or if I bust my ass and complete 3 or 4 major tasks. There is no “thank you”, there is no “good job” and most importantly there is no extra money, so what’s in it for me or anybody else? On top of that, my coworkers on different shifts get a pass for whatever reason to barely do anything day in and day out and they make more money than I do, (the metrics prove such, I’m not just bitching here). There’s even been times where I have taken the initiative, or at least partially, by at least asking what I can work on next, and I’ve even just started and completed new tasks without being told to. It’s all for nothing. Then the managers like to walk around with an attitude like we don’t do anything which is ridiculous, even when they get their numbers for the day. I’d be all for completing more work than I’m assigned for more money, but for literally nothing in return? No thank you. Have any management level employees seen the state of the economy and even had a human thought about caring for their employees?

1apwkqq,"I (27M) want to pivot careers from marketing to journalism, how do I do it?","So I’m currently 27 and running my own digital marketing and SEO business. Keep in mind that SEO involves a lot of writing, and I’ve always been an extremely strong writer and I really enjoy writing about topics I’m interested in. Anyways, I started this business when I was 18 on the side and after college got a job in analytics that lead to a few other decent jobs over the next few years. I put my marketing business on hold to focus on a corporate career with little intention of picking up my marketing business again.  
  
I absolutely hated my most recent job that I left in 2022, so I picked my marketing business back up and built it so that I was making enough money to quit my corporate job. After about 1.5 years running my marketing business full-time, I fell on some hard times and currently make about $50k per year. I moved back in with my parents after living in the city for 3 years, so my expenses are low and I’m making it work for the moment but I’d like to move out and buy a home hopefully soon. But in order to do so, I need to make more money and would like to have a stable job with better health insurance than my shitty marketplace plan.  
  
The current job market for marketing and SEO is brutal, and like I said, I’ve always been a strong writer but never really considered a career in writing as a possibility. Instead, I was forced to learn math, physics, chemistry, and Spanish instead of building my writing skills and pursuing a career in journalism or something similar.  
  
Long story short, where do I start if I want to break into journalism, copywriting, or similar professions? Do I need to go back to school for a new degree? I have lots of interests including real estate, politics, sports, finance, investing, traveling, and automotive. Writing for websites or newspapers focusing on these things would be ideal, but perhaps I would have to start somewhere entry level and work my way up. Also I’d be concerned about low pay starting out and that I’m already 27 and essentially would be making a huge career change. TYIA

1apu7qu,First Career Step in the Music Industry: Have I Made a Valid Choice?,"I am about to finish my master's and I need to complete a required internship to graduate. I want to work in the music industry, and since I went to a great school I didn't have too much trouble getting interviews. 

A couple of weeks ago, I faced a crossroads: I had two final round interviews at two small-ish yet very important companies. One is a traditional record label (A), the other is a more modern management company (B). Company size is fairly similar, but while the record label focuses on older artists and has more history, the management company is very new and manages young superstars that are closer to my generation.

Before the interviews, I leaned a lot more towards company B. Company A's interview, though, was much earlier than B's, so I went to that first. After a couple of days, A offered me the internship and said that most interns then get offered a full-time position. The manager during the interview was very charming and I liked him as a person, finding myself agreeing with his views on the industry. I was also amazed at the amount of connections this guy has in the business.

Company B said they would contact me for the interview a few weeks later. In the meantime I accepted A's offer for a number of reasons. I liked the company, and most importantly they made me a tangible offer not just an interview and a bunch of emails. 

Fast-forward to today: my internship starts next monday, and I have just received an email for B's interview. I have already accepted A's offer and my university has already registered my internship. Deep down though, I feel a bit of regret for not waiting it out. Company B is newer and everything, but it is younger, and probably makes a lot more money. Company A said that they would teach me all the aspects of working in the industry and I really appreciated that, but I can't get rid of this subtle regret. I talked to a more experienced guy in the music industry and he told me that the hard part is getting in, and that moving around after a while becomes quite easy.

Have I made a reasonable choice? What would you have done? Any reassurance helps in this kind of stressful time!",yungstatue,3,1.0,2,1707833009,2024-02-13 14:03:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1apu7qu/first_career_step_in_the_music_industry_have_i/,2,2024

I desire to build up skills that’ll allow me to improve my income and allow me to start a business as I’d like. I am looking into the trades and am considering the HVAC trade via Union as it offers the fairest pay and clear outline of goals and direction.

Here’s the issue: The Union pay cut is will put me back $11 dollars per hour and will take me 4yrs (completion of my apprenticeship) to only make equal or even less than what I am making right now (per Union contract). Also, if I’m not mistaken, on my 5th yr is when I’d see a change in salary of maybe $7-$11 depending on pay steps at my current employer.

I’m a bit reluctant about going through all of this to only make what I make now or even go 5yrs to reach only an $11 salary change at most.

Now am I looking at this all wrong or am I being rational about this?

1appz3i,Which career to pursue further given the threat of AI,"I often think that AI will take away a lot of the jobs. I have many friends in technology or services companies where they say that teams have downsized by 30%-40% easily over the past couple of years.

1apnyli,my employee made an aggressive remark,"How do you deal with an employee who power played you in front of other employees who work for you and you didn't respond?

An older male employee (45M) made a covert micro-aggressive remark in front of other employees, and I (30F) passively accepted that comment because I was in my head on that day. We all have bad days, and I was mentally exhausted and in physical pain on that day to pay attention. I have a chronic health condition, but I show up and act normal, but it definitely makes me look distracted. After I came home and cooled down a bit, I realized he has made an aggressive comment, and I just quietly took the comment. I also looked very passive on that day, and in appearance, it seemed like he acted like he was in charge of me in front of other people and I looked like an idiot who is a pushover. He probably saw that I was a bit weak on that day and took advantage. Since all my employees who were there were male, I sensed that there was some laughter from the rest of the employees. I even overheard some humming sound coming from the employees after the comment was made as it seemed like I acted like I wasn't in charge. I feel like people lost respect for me as I am in the authority position, yet I just took the comment passively. Usually, it's the boss who abuse power, but in my case it's the employee who acted like he is the boss, while I looked like a scolded puppy. I look like I was too afraid of him and now I feel so embarrassed. 

What should I do? Should I let it go and be careful next time? Is it something I should be ashamed of? Is it something that needs to be addressed? I am someone who maybe capable but can't detect power play sometimes, but that incident made me self-conscious.

1apn4kw,Take BMW offer?,"Hi guys!  
I recently got an offer from BMW for a full stack developer Spring co-op intern position. The pay is $29.50 an hour, and it is hybrid (3 days a week in person, 2 days remote).  
The work place is an hour north of my campus without traffic.  
The company recently gave me an offer for a car program where they let me rent a BMW (X1 of 3 series) for the time I am interning for $380 a month including insurance.  
I was wondering if you guys think this is an offer I should take for the spring (not my summer internship). I am taking a lighter load next quarter so I think I would be able to handle the internship, but what do you guys think about the pay + car program (I have to take the car program or else I have no other transportation options). Do you guys think this is worth it? BTW I live in California, and I calculated my monthly salary to be $3,287 after taxes. I would have to pay $400 for the car program + gas which I will estimate to be $250 - $300 a month for the commute (\~110 miles back and forth) + $350 for 3 months of parking!!  
That means that I will be making \~$2150 for the first month, and then \~$2500 the second month and third month. Is this worth my time? I will also need to commute two hours for 3 days a week.

1apmjgi,I think I messed up my job interview.,"I recently just got interviewed by the hiring manager for my dream company however, the hiring manager turns out to be the sister of my previous colleague and is friends with my previous Department Head. This was alarming for me because my past colleagues mentioned that our Department Head would block your application to other companies with the same market - even when you are no longer with the company. 

With that, she asked me why I left my old job and applied for this new one given that it's the same industry and almost the same responsibilities. I told her that I would like to explore new growth opportunities and challenges and this company would be able to give me that. She started to dig deeper and asked about my issues with my previous company or anything I would want them to change. I got super nervous since she does know who my previous managers are and I said I had no issues but if there were something I'd want to change, it's the openness to hearing out new/ younger voices since it was a very traditional company. There were also no opportunities for growth in my previous company (promotion takes at least 3 years before you are considered for one but I didn't mention this detail to her)

Is that bad?? I feel like I messed up in the sense that I spoke negatively of my previous company.",Ill_Elk_7850,1,1.0,0,1707804258,2024-02-13 06:04:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1apmjgi/i_think_i_messed_up_my_job_interview/,2,2024

1apk9xn,Need career advice ahead of my performance review on Friday,"Throwaway account because I know my colleagues browse Reddit. I need to provide a little background on my career history. I am 35 years old, originally from the U.S., worked in my field a bit there but not extensively, spent most of my time in university, and then moved to Australia in 2018. At the end of 2022, I graduated with a master’s degree in urban and regional planning. During my last semester of university, I worked with a local government, LG, on the strategic planning team (dealing with regional plans, zoning codes, and development applications) for 5 months. I was offered a position on another team at this LG but chose a role with the state government as an active transport planner. This was right up my alley considering I don’t own a car and I cycle and walk everywhere. This was my first “real” job post-university, I was very excited. It is a contractor position with a guaranteed 3 years and pretty great pay (to compensate for the lack of benefits provided to contractors). So now a year has passed, and the initial excitement has settled, I have realised I am not in a role I want to be in. We are very policy-focused, but it's more than that; we're also attempting to promote an active transport agenda in a state that prioritises building roads over alternative modes of transportation. It feels like an endless struggle, and at this early stage in my career, I don’t know that I’m ready for that fight yet. Everything is very hierarchical and bureaucratic, which I know is part of planning life but is especially prevalent at the state government in a nanny state. I also feel too distant from the people I want to represent. Honestly, I would have never known this if I hadn't been in the role; you have to try things to know what you want/don’t want. My team is less focused on planning footpaths and cycleways; the LGs do that, we assist them with funding, review their maps to ensure adherence to guidelines and technical advice, essentially acting as stakeholders for LGs. I want to work for the LG I live in, or at least one nearby. I want to be the one planning footpaths, precincts, areas of growth, parks, etc. So, I know I need to be at an LG or private firm.

  
The issue here is that on Friday I have a meeting with my boss to review my development agreement (basically a document outlining my job, how I will complete tasks, my goals, and how I will achieve them). It has been one year since we established this agreement, so it's time to make any necessary changes. I am wondering if this is the time to bring up to him that while I have learned a lot, I have started looking elsewhere. My boss is a legend. He has been amazing, involved, and supportive, so I feel pretty comfortable talking to him. But most importantly, I need to tell him because he is my reference, and if another job shortlists me post-interview, they will call him.  I have applied to three roles in the last couple of weeks and one of them is very promising. It would be pretty dog not to inform him. However, I am concerned because I am not just going to accept any other job; it needs to be the right one, so it could take a few weeks/months. I don’t want things to become awkward. I also don’t want him to say that they will start looking for my replacement, and then suddenly I’m out of a job. I don’t know what to do here – what is the right, professional step that honors my goals and passions but also does right by the people I work for?

1apjumy,Am I being impractical?,"Hello all, I’m at a crossroads right now and have no one to really speak to on the issue..

I’m 29m, working a decent paying but dead end maintenance/custodial job for 8yrs and am in a toxic environment. I would like to leave and make more, but this current job offers:
Pension
Cadillac benefits
Full entitlement to my thrift
Schedule flexibility

I am considering a taking up a trades for the benefit of having a marketable skill and the ability to create my own business. The issue I have is that by joining the union,  I would be taking a pay cut of $11 to start and after the mandatory 4yrs, I will only return to my current pay status maybe even a little less based on union contracts (even lower for nonunion). Also, if I’m not mistaken, the journeyman’s wage would kick in on the 5th yr at only a $7-$11 increase after our annual pay increases..

Although I desire to add a trade to my skillset, I am struggling to justify this step back financially to all to only make what I am making now or even just make a $7-$11 increase in wage… 

The other option is Sales, which I have experience in. I feel that I would have a higher likelihood of better outcomes on a shorter timeframe by going this route..

1apjt3q,How do I go about asking for an hourly rate increase? (Freelance Video Editor in LA),"TLDR; I want to ask for an hourly rate increase as a video editor at the startup I'm freelancing at. I'm realizing retrospectively that the original rate that I quoted and I've been working at is low. I have 10+ years of experience and I like working for the startup. What is the best way to go about this?

&#x200B;

Hey there -- so I want to ask for a rate increase on the contract I'm working on. I'm a video editor living in Los Angeles. I have 10+ years of experience working at some pretty well known digital media & marketing companies.

My friend brought me on to a startup and i've been working 2-3 days a week for them. I really like working with them, and they like working with me. They basically asked me to name my price at the beginning and I messed up and totally low balled myself at $60 an hour for 18 hours a week of work. ($1080 a week before taxes)

I'm fairly new to freelancing -- I've mostly worked at companies where I've made a $400 or so day rate and then the last place i worked at my salary was 100k. So that's kind of how I came up with the rate because ($60 an hour x 8 hours a day = $480 x 5 days a week = $2400 x 52 days in a year = $124,000)

However, I just did another job with a big fashion company and they paid me $125 an hour. So now I'm looking back and realizing my rate that I quoted for the startup is super low.

Also, the startup just posted looking for a full time director level position and the salary range is in the six figures. So they have the money.

Also I know that some of their contractors are being paid at around $100 an hour + they have a guy on contract that's making 10k a month.

So what I'm thinking is that I want to ask for a raise from $60 to $100 an hour. It's asking for double of what I'm making now. I'm thinking that what I'll say is that the market rate for a video editor is $100-125 an hour for video editors, and that I originally quoted them low because I knew that they were a new startup, but that actually my rate is $100 an hour. Then maybe we can negotiate and we'll land at $80 or $90.

Has anyone dealt with something similar to this? We have office days every Wednesday, so I think that I'll probably email the president (person that deals with the money) and say I'd like to discuss a new contract, and then we can chat in person.

&#x200B;

I'm 23 years old and working my first ""professional"" job out of college. My title is fulfillment manager, and my bachelors is in management.

We are a medium sized manufacturing business and I am in charge of all fulfillment. I have a team of 11 direct reports also. I work a minimum of 45 hours a week on salary, though its usually more like 50. Sometimes more. 

In my state the fulfillment manager salary range is 57k - 91k. I would fully expect to be in the lowest tier as I've only been in this job for a year. However, I'm making 47k a year. There also is no benefits package yet. I've had one bonus in the last year that was respectable but not blow your socks off good. When negotiating the contract, my boss told me he had does his research into salary ranges and was offering what he thought was fair.

Recently, there's been some different things happen that make me think maybe my boss sugar coats things to make things seem better than they are. Not always maliciously or anything, but still. I've always thought ""well Glassdoor, Indeed, etc must just be inaccurate with their numbers..."" But I'm starting to think I've just trusted the guy too much.

When I was laid off I decided to finish NP school full time and then study for my licensure exam as well, so on my resume now I have a section under work history titled, “Education and Career Break” where I have a short summary, “finished full time NP rotations, prepped for NP licensure exam, and explored options for first NP position.” Is this a good idea to keep on my resume or does it look unprofessional/odd somehow?

   I get there for this “interview” as soon as I introduce myself the guys whole demeanor changed to just being very awkward. I literally can not even count this as an interview because it was so weird? He didn’t ask me much and kind of talked to me like I’m a child or something? Idk how to explain it then… 
    It gets very quiet and he can’t make eye contact then says “I don’t know what to say to you, I’ve never interviewed a female before.”

 IM MAD AF INSIDE because what the heck does that even mean? Speak to me like you do to all the other technicians you would interview…

1aphkep,What should I do?,"I am from a 3rd world country trying to secure employment in a 1st world country.

It has been 2 months and 0 interview. I plan to upgrade my skills, which I approximate will take 3 or 4 months, then focus on resume and interview.

Is it ok to have a 5 or 6 months gap in my resume after graduation? What should I do to fill in that gap if I cannot land a job soon?

1aph3cq,QA Manager vs Project Manager,"I am an Assistant Project Manager (Construction) with 3 years of experience for a public entity and just got my PMP in January. I am set to be promoted to PM around March. I found out today I would go from $80k to ~$88k a year, which is not even close to what I was expecting.

I found out how much of a raise I'm getting because another department offered me a QA Manager position, where I will lead a team of 12 people and make more than 6 figures. They haven't disclosed an exact salary yet.

The question is: Would it be a bad career move to choose the QA Manager position over PM?

I do want to be a PM at some point, would that slow me down, or put me behind in terms of going back to a PM role?

How related are the two roles?

1apgmsz,Do I have a good manager?,"Hey everyone,

Need some advice or thoughts on my manager situation. She’s awesome about letting us work from home and is pretty laid back about office hours and appointments. We all appreciate it and do our best to keep our department looking good because of that freedom.

But, there’s a flip side. 

She’s not great with the details. We often end up with last-minute tasks from other teams because she hasn’t set clear boundaries, and it feels like we’re always playing catch-up on top of our design projects. It’s like she doesn’t really check in on what we’re already handling before saying yes to something new for us.

Jumping into projects without much info is the norm, and she’s only hands-on if it’s a high-priority thing. 

One-on-ones are a bit of a joke too; she’s often not fully there, typing away at something else and then asking you to repeat stuff. Promises to help out often fall through as well. So you end up doing it alone and then having a one-on-one about it where she might not be fully engaged.

I love the autonomy she gives us, but I’m feeling the lack of support on a daily basis. Does this sound like a bad manager to you, or is this just how it is with some managers? Any advice or similar experiences would be really helpful!

I worked in my family's commercial real estate business for 4 years , I was basically chilling and not doing a lot of work at all, the only thing I got out of it that I learned a little bit of accounting.

After I got bored of not doing a lot and not doing what I liked, I applied for jobs and I picked the first one I was accepted to which was the dumbest move I could make in my career and accepted a Job as a game tester.  I've been working as a game tester for 2 years now but I feel stuck and I don't know how to escape.

My passion is to be a software developer and I have done a couple of courses but nothing really to get me employed. and seeing the current state of the market I am really worried about commiting to it and then just end up wasting time.

All the jobs I look at which are related to my field of graduation (Business Analyst, Data Analyst) have insane requirements even for the entry level jobs. I also get extremely stressed in interviews as I panic badly and have nothing to really talk about since all my experience isn't really related to anything that I graduated from.

It's really a shame when all my friends and people around me are making 100k+ and I'm just trolling over here. I really do need help figuring this out and if there are any recommendations of what I need to do to progress my career and actually get a job related to my field.

1apecz0,Received my first Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) from work today. What should I do?,"I work for a Pharmaceutical company and received a Performance Improvement Plan this morning. I have been working here for almost three years now and had no issues until my new manager came about a few months ago.  
 After he came, he hounded me about my performance and made me feel very unsafe in the way he spoke to me. In December, he told me he was going to place me on ""informal coaching"" and that he would guide me to help me reach ""performance goals."" Even though I felt like it was all BS, I went along with it because I needed this job as I have 2 children to put through college.   
I shut my mouth and went along with everything he asked me to, even though he kept on belittling me and always mentioned how stupid I was. I applied for another position open at my company, and they assured me that everything would be confidential. I thought all was going well until my manager called me and told me that my performance was ""not satisfactory"" and that I would be going into a Performance Improvement Plan. He told me I wasn't qualified for the position I have right now and continued to say that I suck as an employee. Still, he should have mentioned specific things I could work on. He said that I had until tomorrow to sign the Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) and that if I did not, he would sign it for me himself.   
So, should I sign the PIP, and what should I do? I'm at such a loss, especially since my eldest child is going to college this year, and I have never heard any complaints about my performance.

1ape4v7,deciding my career path...,"In serious need of advice & opinions...  


  
I have such a clear idea of what I want to do for my career and medical school seems like the best path to take to get there...but what I want to do has 0 to do with most of what they teach in medical school...it seems daunting to have to sit through two years of surgeries and performing minor procedures such as catheters or stitches.  


  
I want to be a psychiatrist who researches new interventions. I value the medical education and I value research so my path is MD/PHD. I was planning on applying this cycle, 2024 and attending school fall of 2025. Then I was told July was too late to take the MCAT and I need to take it May / June...which is not possible as I am a full time student with two jobs, running an independent research project (like actually collecting data on participants myself), working on improving my volunteering hours & shadowing...there's just not enough time in the day for me to study...so I have to take two gap years (I am a senior now)...

  
but I am a super senior, I decided to go premed my senior years of undergrad..I was already older for my grade..so now I am 24 (turning 25 in october)...so taking two years means I'd be 26 starting med school...and if I want to do a phd/md ... who knows when I will actually be graduated.  


  
I just don't know what path to take. I feel such a strong passion to what I want my career to look like, and yeah I could do a PhD, but I won't get the same respect as a MD/PhD...I wont get the same value to my voice. I dream to make change and improve the field. I am so scared of regretting, scared of making the wrong choice..what's a few years extra of school if it means that no door will ever be closed for me? If I don't go MD/PhD will my voice not be heard as loud? Is it worth the struggle that medical school will be? Is it worth the delay in career? I just want to start. I don't mean to sound like a Phd isn't valuable because it is...but I want to practice with my patients, that's the biggest thing , I want both.

It was already generating lots of money, was created a few years ago but I joined them at a period where they were restructuring themselves. The offices were not 100% finished built, and there was still everything to do about their online presence (new website, social media etc). I was the 4th guy of the new team (boss included), and responsible of their social media strategy.  
Within a year I made the company get hundred thousands followers, lots of videos with millions of views, lots of investors discovered that company through my work, so epic win.  
Also I'm doing the work of like 3 person, because the boss doesn't want to hire too much people.  
Despite that, my salary is low, I was making more money as an independent before I joined, but I still took that job because I thought I could way make more within a few years.  
Now that it's been a year, I realize that I'll never get soon a higher income through a salary because the boss re-invest EVERYTHING the company generate because he wants it to grow up as fast as possible.  
Thus... I feel like there's only 2 options for me to make more money:  
1) get shares of the company, but I feel like it's too late, lots of big big wealthy people got their eyes on the company and are about to heavily invest, so why would by boss sell me shares at a low price ? Also I don't know if the bank will give me a loan since I'm already about to get one to buy an appartment.   
2)  create a new income source within the company, like using social media for brand deals etc and get a commission on that, but the boss doesn't seem to be interested by that

1apcsj0,How to get back into software development with resume gaps?,"TL/DR: \~8 years of experience in full stack development, in the last 12 years, how to deal with two large resume gaps, and get back into the industry?  


I'm posting on a throwaway account, asking about a family member I know, but looking at perspective for myself. They graduated from a top 10 US engineering college with a computer science degree. Less than a year after graduating they landed a job which they held for 6 1/2 years. It was a startup type company in the financial sector, and the job centered around development of a handful of different front end and back end technologies. Later they were laid off in 2019 just before the pandemic started, which naturally did not help. Then just under 2 years later they landed a contractor role doing some back end work for another startup. They held that job for about a year, and were laid off as the fed raised interest rates, and cash flow from Silicon Valley banks to start-ups began to decline. It has now been about another two full years without a job.  


As far as I know they're still applying for jobs hoping to continue where they left off. In particular intermediate level roles for the most part but some senior, and some more junior. They have a portfolio of stuff on github, and have done small web development jobs here and there, but they have no other employment and are borrowing money or draining their savings. They have been interviewing the whole time and are able to get to second round interviews, but haven't been given offers.  


I've asked various people IRL about the resume gap and some people with hiring manger experience have told me straight up that someone with that many gaps in their resume would not get past screeners and even make it to a hiring manager's desk. I have suggested that they branch out to other jobs such as Dev-Test / QA / IT / Support roles, in order to broaden their net. I have also suggested that they attempt to get a stop-gap job, which could be in any field, just so that there's a continuous history of employment, and that they be frank about it being a stop-gap job situation during interviews. So far I think they have done the former but not the latter.  


My question is, what would you advise to a person in this situation? How does one deal with gaps in their resume and get back into the software development industry that they enjoy and want to be in?",Few-Resolve8716,1,1.0,1,1707776280,2024-02-12 22:18:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1apcsj0/how_to_get_back_into_software_development_with/,2,2024

For the past 2 years (1 year and 11 months actually) I have been an IT Business Analyst/Project Manager within a top 3 financial institution. Sadly, my role is contract. I was in the process of being converted after my first year, but hiring freezes caused the process to get canceled. I was then extended another year and fingers were crossed that things would get better and I would convert before my two years. I have been told they can not convert, and 2 years is the limit for the contracts. I expire end of March. They have welcomed me back though, but there has to be a 3-month hiatus to begin contracting again.

  
Anyway, I love my job and the Agile environment. I have a great W/L balance and am certainly overpaid. My w-2 said (before taxes) \~127k. I'm confident I could find another job fairly quickly, but only on contract. I get 5-10 LinkedIn messages a week from recruiters. Seems all large companies are handing out contracts left and right, but FTE is small. I get why, but it just stinks. I'd like to return to FTE.

  
I'm searching for ""IT Project Manager"" ""Project Manager"" and ""Business Analyst"" roles across the web. I believe I'm a good fit for 50% of the ones I apply for, but as everyone knows, landing interviews is hard. Lol.

From my undergrad, I accumulated about a year and a half of experience through three six-month internships, one of which closely resembled my current role. Our team focuses primarily on reporting, especially during quarter-ends when the workload significantly increases. Outside these periods, the hours are quite manageable. The benefits seem good, and I believe my starting salary ($64,700) is decent for my role. It's a complex position, I've got a lot to learn, and the company is fairly large and does seem there is good mobility. The industry is quite old so there is a lot of opportunity for youngin's like myself.  
  
Issue: My manager, who was hired around the same time as me, resigned about a month ago. He struggled to meet the demands of the role, grasp concepts quickly, and complete tasks accurately and promptly. He had he said 18-20 years experience in the industry. Often, I found myself correcting his mistakes or having to train him. At times, our team lead would assign tasks directly to me, knowing I'd complete them more accurately and on time. His resignation, frankly, was a relief, or so I thought. Since then, I've been covering his duties and then some, with the expectation that this will continue into the next quarter. My team lead praises my work to upper management and even the CFO, for whom I recently completed a project that went really well. Since a lot of their tasks are very manual and slow, I've been using my Excel VBA skills to speed up a lot of the work my team does, and the project I did for the CFO probably saved him and another upper level managers team significant hours. However, I've been informed today that they're looking to hire for a new senior role, hoping to have someone by next quarter to take over some duties. Yet, it seems my workload won't decrease, as our responsibilities expand with the addition of sister companies. The new hire won't be my manager; that role has effectively been absorbed by our team lead. And granted, we do need the extra hands because of the fact our responsibilities will be growing.  
  
I've hinted a few times that I've been filling in for my former manager's role and have taken on much more than expected, a point my team acknowledges. They plan to ""grow"" me but sidestep discussions about aligning my role, job description, or pay with my responsibilities. Albeit, I've been a bit passive here. More hinting that I would like to continue this path and that I've absorbed more responsibility.  The only assurance I've received is of potential talks around my one-year mark, despite having performed senior-level duties for several quarters by then--which I feel iffy about.  
  
I'm wondering if I'm being too passive. I'm cautious about pushing too hard but feel I might be taken advantage of. I'm considering leveraging potential job offers as a negotiation tactic, though I'm unsure how my short tenure since September might be perceived by recruiters or in interviews.

1apc7zr,Tech/Project Management Career Opportunities?,"Hi. For the past 2 years (1 year and 11 months actually) I have been an IT Business Analyst/Project Manager within a top 3 financial institution. Sadly, my role is contract. I was in the process of being converted after my first year, but hiring freezes caused the process to get canceled. I was then extended another year and fingers were crossed that things would get better and I would convert before my two years. I have been told they can not convert, and 2 years is the limit for the contracts. I expire end of March. They have welcomed me back though, but there has to be a 3-month hiatus to begin contracting again.  
Anyway, I love my job and the Agile environment. I have a great W/L balance and am certainly overpaid. My w-2 said (before taxes) \~127k. I'm confident I could find another job fairly quickly, but only on contract. I get 5-10 LinkedIn messages a week from recruiters. Seems all large companies are handing out contracts left and right, but FTE is small. I get why, but it just stinks. I'd like to return to FTE.  
I'd like to begin casting a larger net and applying for more jobs, but I'm not quite sure of the titles I should be looking for. Does anything I have said give anyone ideas of what kind of roles I may fit for? I know, I haven't given a ton of info on my skillset.  
I'm searching for ""IT Project Manager"" ""Project Manager"" and ""Business Analyst"" roles across the web. I believe I'm a good fit for 50% of the ones I apply for, but as everyone knows, landing interviews is hard. Lol.

1apbvpv,I would say my current manager acts very uninvolved with me or my work. Would you have any guess as to why that is? Or could it by anything?,"I've worked at a company for about 2 years. My manager has probably talked to me about 10 times I would say. When I've had managers before they probably talked to me over 100 times in the span of a year. One of then even added me as a Facebook friend.

Also, I would say most of the time I ask him any question he differs me to a Senior level coworker.

Here are the only things I can think of:
- He got married about the same day I got hired. Maybe that affects people?
- Maybe he just cares about making money?
- Maybe he just doesn't think it's necessary to supervise me
- maybe he sees that I'm not really doing anything wrong so he just keeps quiet


Do you think it's crazy how someone can work at a job for basically 2 years and never really be supervised at all?

1apa9ep,"Stay in research or return to Big Tech (MAAMA), or get into AI Safety?","Im at my whit's end, so turning to the internet. I graduated two years ago in CS from a small state school, applied to all the top phd programs for ML, got rejected from all, but walked away with 3 FAANG offers.  
I went and worked for big tech for a year, but really missed research and felt bored in my systems-software role. So I quit my job at FAANG and got this prestigious fellowship doing AI for physics at a major national lab for 1/3 the pay I was getting, thinking I was forgoing income to pursue my passion and make the world a better place. However, I did not realize how lonely and meaningless research can be, plus my boss is waaaaaay too busy to give me any direction or really attention so Im really just an independent researcher with no direction and no PhD and nothing to show for nearing the end of my fellowship. Feeling extremely lost.  
I just got an offer to be an ML SWE back at FAANG. I also got really big into AI Alignment during my fellowship, which is not exactly related to my job but is a personal passion. I took this fellowship in order to set myself up for grad school, but it has completely turned me off to the idea of getting a PhD, and also has not resulted in any publications.  
My career goal is to be an expert in ML and work as a research engineer for a big AGI lab, eventually working myself into being a tech lead/principal engineer and starting my own company some day, but I feel that I need the credentials/credibility to become an expert as I graduated from a no-name school.  
So, do I try and salvage the last third of my fellowship and go for a mediocre publication for grad school app? Do I take the FAANG job and make bank working on ML but perhaps fall into the trap of being a fat-cat dispassionate tech worker scared of being laid off? Or do I hold out and try and get an AI safety job?

1ap9z5y,Got a job as a recruiter...Feels like I've started strong and sputtered out.,"About 8 months ago now, I was able to get into an environment as a recruiter off a recommendation from a former coworker of mine. I have a master's degree in a related field, but haven't been able to break into HR in the 7 years since I got it.

Recruiting is not day to day HR, but it is part of it. At the start, I was able to hire candidates at a blisteringly fast rate, and in the 8 months I've been there we've gone from like 135 employees to over 200 (then back down due to attrition).

Now though, I've reached a point where the roles I'm trying to fill are more specialized, and the pace has slowed. I'm feeling less satisfied, and I feel like my boss is evaluating my performance negatively (they hasn't said anything, but their attitude towards me seems to have shifted; she's been questioning my productivity when she never had before). 

I feel like my early success is holding me hostage now, and I'm at the point where I'm dreading going to work each day.

However the opportunity to grow is small, there is only 1 other IT employee who is my manager my previous IT manager left and was replaced by the current one. My hopes is that if I stay with the company is one day become the IT manager but that depends on if my manager leaves or they decide to bring in another manager like last time with more experience than me.

However, a recent change in our work arrangements means that we are all around each other much more and his behavior has gotten more erratic, the drinking and drunkenness more open, with visible drunkenness in meetings, and culminating in a drunk driving incident the other night and some inappropriate behavior with one of my colleagues (not sexual, but enough to concern us all). I have decided to leave the company, but I want to get my ducks in a row and it could take a couple of months before I can make the switch. In the meantime, the other three team members want to stay due to various reasons, but hope he makes some changes — they seem to think he'll do it on his own, or with some gentle feedback from myself and the other senior leader. But the more I think about it, the more I think it's just unnecessary exposing myself and will not help the situation at all. He will likely be defensive and lash out. Also, this is not my battle to fight — I can create boundaries and remove myself from the situation when I need to until I can permanently leave. Do I have a moral obligation to help my team?

1ap88kp,Should I Quit Without a Job Lined Up?,"I realize just based on the title most people's answers will be no, so let me provide some context.

For the past 9 years or so, I've lived on my own, hundreds of miles away from family, friends and really any kind of support network. Originally, I was fine with the solitude. I didn't mind the work I was doing, but after a few years of being on my own, I wanted more. I took a job a couple years ago that required me to move even further away from my family and friends, but that offered me a *substantial* pay raise. Naturally, I took it.

To put it into perspective, this job started off as everything I wanted. Big pay raise, the ability to manage myself, and the ability to work from home 100%. But as time went on, those freedoms began disappearing. Our customer requested I be in the office every day because they wanted to physically see me, so now I have to be here. Effectively a pay cut, since I now have to pay for gas when I didn't before. I've gone through a series of managers because they just keep quitting, and every new manager brings new, pointless restrictions to the things I am able to do.

There are supposed to be two of us in the state. I am supposed to be local for a single customer, and the other is supposed to take care of the rest of the state. Since I was hired, the second position has remained vacant, so I've had to handle the entire state on my own, outside of what I signed on for, with no extra pay. They almost hired someone to fill the position, but literally the night before they were going to call to give him the offer, he had a heart attack and died.

I work on call, so I'm available 24/7. In the past few weeks, customers have been calling me every night after midnight because of issues that are fixed by just rebooting the machine, and it's infuriating. I'm expected to be constantly available for issues that can be fixed in a matter of seconds just by turning it off and back on.

After nearly 3 years of trying to make this work, I have come to the conclusion that I absolutely hate this job. Fortunately, I have an option, even though I have not yet been given any offers of employment quite yet:

I've spoken with family and my dad has agreed that if I do this, I can stay with him rent free for however long I need. He is also a fairly influential person at his company and could create a job for me, but the pay would be much less than I am currently making. Without having to pay rent and utilities, I could make it work, but with my existing debt, finances would still be tight.

While I've been considering this, I've been putting in 5-10 job applications every day to various jobs I could do remotely, but haven't heard back from any yet. I'm hoping that I start hearing back soon, but trying not to get my hopes up given the state of the economy and job market at the moment.

So I ask you: What would you do if you were in my position? If you had nothing you truly wanted where you currently are, would you throw everything away so you could move back home and start over?",Exystredofar,4,0.699999988079071,15,1707765466,2024-02-12 19:17:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ap88kp/should_i_quit_without_a_job_lined_up/,2,2024

1ap7tpu,new job with 38% pay increase vs promotion at current with title and industry I want,"Hi! Looking to gather some opinions on what I should do/next moves to consider.

Situation: I work in a central marketing unit that serves many different business units. A selection of peers and I have been asked to move to one particular BU. I have been offered a role with this new BU with a title I eventually want for my career. This BU is notoriously chaotic. Slightly concerned it's a bit of a sinking ship. On top of that, no official transition plan or timeline is place. 

However, it is in the industry I would like to be in and with a title I would like to have. 

I am also in very serious talks with another company to take on a role there in a different industry, different title. One I don't mind and totally good with having.  I do not have an offer yet, and nothing is real until I have that in hand, but I'm confident in my interviewing skills and know they want to make a decision soon after this last interview. It would be a 40% raise.

I am still pretty young in my career, so I think I could transition from this new company back to the industry I am currently in, but I know that's never a guarantee. 

My current options from my point of view. 

1. Stay at current job in the BU with the new title and in the industry. Do what I can for the next six months, then hop to a different role with new title in the same industry.

2. Take new job. Quit current job. 

3. Delay interview/start date for the new job as long as possible. Take new title and work at current company in the meantime anyways?

4. Work both????? The new job seems like it will be very chill for the first few months but no doubt it would ramp up. Most folks at the new company are also in a later time zone so it could be possible if I scoot my day at job 1 a bit earlier. 

I'm a bit inclined to do number 3. 

I am supposed to hear more about transition plans for current job at the new BU this upcoming week. 

I know I may not get the offer for the new job either. Which would leaves me back working at my current job with the new title and doing job hunt things because I don't 100 percent trust my current company. 

Anyways. Always fun to bounce strategies off of strangers.",acbc24,1,1.0,0,1707764467,2024-02-12 19:01:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ap7tpu/new_job_with_38_pay_increase_vs_promotion_at/,2,2024

I've never been a 1099 employee (feels scary AF) and the hiring manager told me to push for the higher end of the wage band at $160k. My gut says I should tell them I want an hourly rate commiserate with the $160 and tell them we can discuss W2 salary when I convert.

1ap78gw,Should I tell my boss that I’m burnout on life?,"I’m conflicted on telling my boss that I’m burnout as I have my PTO/vacation coming in 3 weeks. 

Last year, I lost my job and switched industries and have had a significant pay increase when I got a new position. Previously, I have been working non-stop with no vacation time. I would take the weekend off and Friday/Monday but nothing that’s long lasting. This isn’t a brag by any means, I see how this can really hurt you emotionally/physically but damn I am so unmotivated by everything.. 

I’m not going to lie: this really burnt me out. On top of this, I’m a musician and an original artist. The rest of my time is dedicated to my music. Which is roughly 30 hours a week of my time, plus I work 38+ hours a week..  

Lately, I’ve been having stress induced panic attacks and I’m not sure if I should tell my boss about this either.. not sure if age matters, but I’m 29m. 

Any advice on how I should approach this conversation?

1ap7559,How to seek accountability from others,"I work in local government. I’m a pretty hard worker. My colleague on my team is a slacker. This morning my boss took on half of his assignment because he’s behind, but I’ve heard him chatting and laughing with colleagues all morning, clearly not working.

It infuriates me. I need to see some balance and accountability.

However last I spoke about this specific issue with my supervisor, the manager of the department, (about 6 months ago) I was basically told that some people (like me, and
My boss)  have more “capacity to work hard” than other people (this guy) and that it’s just an unfortunate truth that you learn to accept. I’m sure he thought it would be consoling and it felt like a compliment (because I admire my supervisor a lot) but now I feel like it was a smack in the face, ie accept mediocrity

I see my options as find a new job where I’d be more supported or grit my teeth and keep working more than my share. 

But more importantly, how to come to terms with this emotionally — do I give up and accept that some people skate through life and that is their karma. I can eitherstick to my own integrity and keep working hard,  maybe just quiet quit and be more like the skaters.

 I currently have a remote job in recruiting that makes around 60-63k a year. 

Recruiting job is pretty much dead end. Typical standard benefits. 

I am cutting it pretty close every month with a mortgage but the job does give me free time.

&#x200B;

I interviewed for a restaurant management that will pay me 85-90k a year after bonuses can be up to 110k. Company  Pays for 80 percent of my benefits and 50 percent of my sons benefits. In addition they do a 401k contribution up to 4 percent.

My question is does it sound crazy to go for the restaurant management job? I know that the recruiting job has work life balance but a part of me as a dad and husband feels guilty having payments for the month come close. Recruiting job at the moment I stopped contributing to 401k to have a higher paycheck for expenses. 

Although it is a comfortable cushy job I started asking myself if this was a smart decision to stay in the remote job for more flexibility with time. But on the other end of the spectrum if we have any major surprise expenses we are kind of in a bind.

1ap5tdq,Do I Pursue This Opportunity?,"Hey All,

Currently an EE in the power industry making 100k base salary a year (low cost of living area). Bonus is about 12k per year 

I have an offer to switch into the defense industry as a control systems engineer making 140k per year base (same area). Bonus would typically be about 20k per year.

My current job is very laid back, and gives me much freedom and flexibility. It is low stress and mentally I feel very happy, even though it can be a little boring some times. My boss is amazing to work for.

The new job pays much better but does not allow work from home, will require much longer hours, and I get the sense will be much more stressful.

New job would bump me up to senior engineer whereas I am currently a base level engineer in my current role.

My wallet says take the new job, but my heart says stay with my current company.

Reason is:

1. All ten years of my experience (not all of which has been in engineering) has been in the power industry/utilities. I literally haven't looked at a transistor in 10 years and this job will be very heavy in troubleshooting components, designing pcb's, and programming processors in C. All of things are skills I had at one time in college but have since completely forgotten since then.
2. I am relatively dumb for an engineer. The guy I will be training under literally has a PhD from MIT. I worry that I cannot keep up with the demands of the job on an intellectual level if I am being honest.
3. I have a great reputation at my company and have been told by numerous people that I have ""high upside"" if I pursue a track in management. I think this is because even though I am a bad engineer, I am a good people person and a great public speaker. I am also really good at managing people on my team or a team of people for a project when I have been given that kind of latitude. I worry about leaving my network behind at my current company where I am respected and have a good reputation.
4. I have had two other engineer friends interview for the same position and turn it down because they did not like the company culture. Both of them are significantly smarter, and I would say, harder working then me.
5. Going to get engaged soon, then married soon thereafter. Really excited! But worry that this job won't go well and I will be starting off my marriage in a stressed, miserable state.
6. In the interview, the VP told me that they intentionally do not hire enough people to handle the work and that I will have more work than I can handle. AKA, long hours, high stress, tight deadlines, constantly feeling behind the eight ball.

Obviously I am not basing this decision off of reddit answers but honestly have a lot to process here and just needed some people to bounce some ideas off of. What would you do in my situation? Any wisdom?",riit_wing,1,1.0,2,1707759680,2024-02-12 17:41:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ap5tdq/do_i_pursue_this_opportunity/,2,2024
1ap5lo8,When To Leave A Company During Layoffs?,"Hi all,

Over the past year my company has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs, leaving about 12% of their workforce unemployed. I have been fortunate enough to not be impacted by this yet but I am worried there could be more in the future. I don't want to provide the name of the company for privacy reasons but they are a large cooperation that most of you would know the name of. They still post profits of a few billion each year so it's not like they are going bankrupt tomorrow or anything. 

My question is, when is it a good time to jump ship and start applying else where that may not be facing these layoffs? Should I ride out this wave and hope the economy improves soon? I have only been here about a 1.5 years and actually like the work I do quite a bit but it's scary that every email I get might be my last. I do have some ""golden handcuffs"" with RSU's and 401k match that needs vesting still but I wouldn't call it a large amount compared to my salary.

However, I've never had a formal coffee chat with a complete stranger before and I'm nervous and overthinking. I'm not sure how to approach the coffee chat.

Based on the information I see online, I have the impression that coffee chats are informational interviews and that the agenda is based on the ""interviewee"" (me, in this case). Would it be effective to solely chat about the role I applied to, or would you recommend steering the conversation into a less ""traditional interview"" direction?

In my initial follow-up email, I included a blurb on how I thought I was a suitable candidate--unsure if I should expand on those thoughts or would that be cliche/make me blend in with other candidates?

1ap5i7s,Should I take the new job?,"Should I take the new job??

Hello!!! First time poster! I would love some advice. I have been with the same company for 5.5 years. I'm the top sales rep. Work from home...travel for conferences 6x a year. I grossed 220k last year...might not make that much this year as they added a new sales rep I'm now sharing some leads sourced with. My base pay is 50k so most of my income is commission. I have great health benefits. I pay around 3k a year for health care for my entire family (husband is self employed so we need my health benefits). I've been kind of un happy with my new management over the last 2 years. He is wanting me to change my sales style to high pressure...which does not make any sense because my ability to build relationships is why ive been a consistent top producer. When my manager first joined he told me he wanted me on a leadership track and I asked about equity and he said it would be an option in the future. My year end review last year ended in ""we did not budget for any raises for development because the income potential is too high"". Also no chance at equity...well he told me there may be more equity available in the middle of the year??? 

I was approached by a business acquaintance who told me that he is on the board of a company and they need a new sales director. I told him I would never turn down an opportunity and went through the interview process. The industry I am in is pretty small so I actually was able to speak with the person that was in the role I interviewed for before me and she said nothing bad...loved the management and the team...the travel is what killed her. (During my original interview they said I would have to travel 2x a month to headquarters in MD for 2 days each trip). The original offer was 80k base pay and a weird commission that goes down and then up depending on the deal number you are on. I had a follow up call this past Friday where I was prepared to tell this company I was not willing to travel as much as they wanted AND THAT MORNING I FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT, which honestly I kinda thought was a deal breaker. The complete opposite happened and the company says they still want me and they are happy that I am pregnant and would be accommodating as my family grows.... they also raised the base pay to $100k. The manager lady literally said ""I want you in this role"". So I told her I would think about it. I received the offer letter and yes the base pay is $100k but the health benefits suck. I would go from paying 3k a year to 16k a year for health benefits. They offer a 401k but no match. 15 days PTO. I have unlimited PTO at my company...

While my current role provides ample time, I’ve noticed that it’s not being utilized effectively for my growth. Some days are incredibly busy, while others are painfully idle. This unpredictability makes it challenging to find satisfaction and fulfillment in my responsibilities.

Working from home exacerbates this issue, as the lack of interaction with team members and clients hinders my professional development. The days of idleness leave me feeling stagnant and detached, requiring me to muster confidence and revisit tasks from scratch when they arise, which, although only a week or two apart, feels like an eternity.

Recognizing that this cycle risks trapping me in a perpetual comfort zone, I’m determined to break free and pursue opportunities that offer meaningful growth and advancement. Looking ahead, I am targeting to switch within the next six months. During this time, I aim to leverage and develop specific skills to enhance my career prospects. I would greatly appreciate your insights on which skills I should prioritize and focus on during this period to make a successful transition.

Additionally, I’d like to share another aspect of my current situation. I am currently in a junior position within a team of four, where all three other members hold lead roles. Recently, a team member with less experience joined after me but was appointed on a lead role with a higher pay scale. Despite expressing interest in a role upgrade, my request was denied, with advice not to compare myself to others.

1ap338h,What masters should I prefer if I want to reform or revolt economic and political policy?,"&#x200B;

My Desire:

**I would like to reform or (start) a revolution to overthrow systems of economics that I believe are inefficient and are impacting people's ability to live and to contribute to society.** 

I am fascinated by how we can digest political theory, communicate it with others, and how to have debates to help generate new ideas. I could see myself as possibly doing diplomacy, journalism, or teaching. I am not much of an academic, and would rather spend my time interacting with groups and communitieis who are seeking to make changes in their local/state economies. What should I think about, what should I study?

**My specific goals are as follows. I am pursuing a masters degree to satisfy the following:**

1) Make a salary of at least $60,0000

a) Make enough to at least afford a studio apartment or 1 Bedroom in a Medium CoL city. 

2) Sharpen my writing skills to write news articles for socialist or revolutionary media groups

a) These articles should be well-researched, with facts to provide strong arguments for changes

3) Although I am bored with sitting through reading policy, I know it;s important. I'd like to be able to debate strongly, and more importantly, sharpen my critical thinking skills.

4) Have the ability to work for a public agency that works to administer/execute environmental, medical, and economic policies. 

&#x200B;

**I want the following skills:**

1) Communicate effectively (able to identify arguments, identify flaws in arguments, and write rebutals or arguments against other arguments)

2) Teamwork with other partisan groups (I want to be able to communicate and work with different partisan groups, and identify solutions through communication)

3) A critical understanding of history. This translates to being able to use past policy or history movements to justify action. 

**Things I do not enjoy, or find annoying:**

1) Deep math. Math puts me to sleep. I have common sense statistics skills from my CompSci degree, but I really don't enjoy it. However, I can see it being used for a specific purpose. 

2) Too much desk work. I love talking to others, and find podcasting, talking to groups and people to be the most engaging. I am a bit of an extrovert. 

&#x200B;

**Thank you. I am wondering whether these fit the bill of useful solutions. Keep in mind I have a background in CompSci. Here is what I propose are solutions:** 

1) Masters of Political Science, with a focus in Policy 

2) Masters in Public Policy

3) Masters in Economics, with some focus in Policy

4) Masters in History (A bit more difficult to pursue since no Bachelor's in History)

5) Masters of Urban and Regional Planning

1ap1o48,Engineer here: I feel stuck and unmotivated after 7 months. How to proceed?,"Career guidance: I hit a wall after 6 months, or is it normal?

Hello,
European here. 30 years old. 

I graduated with a BSc in civil engineering last year. Prior to my engineering degree, I worked in sea logistics, as an international freight forwarder, for several years. Also did a summer internship as a HVAC design engineer, inbetween semesters.

I’ve always loved civil engineering, construction, architecture and design. So I feel very much at home in the business. 

I work as a ’project cost estimation engineer’, it’s my first job in the business out of uni. I like my job because it’s a good hybrid of managing your own time, working alone, but also collaboratively. PLUS, short deadlines before moving to the next project to sell. Which is fun! 

I work at a mid-small company (200 people all-in-all). 7 months in, I’ve been handed more responsibilities outside of my job description.  Management said they believe I could do it. 
- I’m the product owner for a planning tool for our manufacturing that we’re developing (with an outside consultant). 
- I’m also in charge of developing a EPD generator-tool with another outside consultant. 

I do enjoy being given many posibilities to explore and try things out. I want to do a good job! I like the people and the company. I can thrive here I think.

However, as I passed the 6 month mark I started to become more and more unmotivated! With the added responsibility, I feel like I’m not given enough mentorship or a pat on the back. I also started resenting the salary I make. I do the same job as my peers (we’re 3 in my department total incl my immediate manager), but I also have all these other responsibilities!

How shall I proceed? I feel kind of lost. I put in a lot of work that I believe benefits the company, but I don’t really get any validation or incentive in terms of salary raise. Can I expect asking for a bigger raise that’s more than the annual? Considering my role here... 

How can I motivate myself if I don’t get very little validation from management, for the work I put in, other than from my peers? 

Is this normal???

Would love to discuss further with you!",gordonschlansky,8,1.0,3,1707749291,2024-02-12 14:48:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ap1o48/engineer_here_i_feel_stuck_and_unmotivated_after/,2,2024

It was a very conscious choice. During college, I did not really enjoy development or coding that much and I wanted to take up a field that gave me more creative leverage. A year ago, I quit my job because of toxic work environment and since then I have been looking for a job. But the current job market is so harsh, I am not getting anywhere. There is also that disillusionment with PMing. Apparently, there is not that much of a creative choice and it is more of stakeholder management and being a yes man.

1aoznwo,Reassurance to go back to work after maternal leave,"I work in the field of AI/ML in a pharma company in IT . As I approach the end of my maternal leave ( 7 months in Europe, normal), I feel more and more like a scam and feel like everyone will discover the way I am when I am back. To put it into a context, I work in a role where I am supposed to connect talent with the need, seeing the gaps in the value chain in the organization with stakeholders and place teams to work on automation tasks with AI. 

All I hear since I left is how nicely other colleagues are achieving. I genuinely feel good for them but I feel like I am left behind the technology and what makes me attractive for my own position isn’t unique anymore. I am involved in many political discussions and try to navigate the group for the value of the company despite agendas. This was something i could do before and tbh I also am tired of it especially after my child is born. 

Another issue is that I lack self confidence which is the reason of all above. It is because of my upbringing and I get therapy for it. 

The issue is couple of times I was assertive in my decisions, I was always questioned by (male) peers. In the end, I (feel like) I fail to convince skeptics. My boss is always on my side but I feel like she is also soon getting tired of my insecurities. 

So given my personal state and the advances done when I am gone, I feel like I won’t be taken seriously at all when I am back. This is really getting to me and going back feels like a nightmare. 

What would you suggest to a person like me? I aspire to come to a position where I empower people. And I do this way better than many people, I put a lot of thoughts into mentoring and seeing people’s strengths and company strategy.  But I am also the worst enemy for myself so in the end I always undersell myself.

Issue: I am done with auditing. This was a mean to an end and nothing more. Now, I have been thinking of getting back into programming/SWE. Nothing specific but seems like a job I can do till/beyond retirement.

1aot1pt,Would you stay? Or would you leave?,"tl;dr: no raise for over 2 years, work is not interesting anymore - recruiters are offering 1/3 more in pay and interesting work. Happy with colleagues and benefits - boss is okay, not necessarily good or bad. Decisions, decisions. 

I started at my organization in 2018, working entry level for $50k. SaaS start up. Great pay, great benefits (unlimited PTO, remote work normally, very flexible work schedule, etc etc.). I received a promotion to mid-level, getting me to $68k in late 2019. And then the world shut down. For 2 years, I was working 50-60 hours a week (salary based, mind you) to help keep our small team of 4 above water. Late 2021, I nearly quit due to burnout, but my manager helped calm me down and provided me another bump to $75k. This helped, and I started to shift my job responsibilities to more meaningful projects and tasks rather than the usual queue work. I’ve been happy. 

At night, I’ve also been attending school, have gained a few certifications, and I finally feel  that I know where I want my career to go. The responsibilities I mentioned before directly coincide with my schooling. But now, they’re retracting to another team, because it more aligns with what they should’ve been doing, and now they have headcount so they can work on them. I’ve tried to apply and move over to that team a few times, but was always passed over for external hires. And now I’m doing the work I was doing previously when I just about quit. 

Normally, I ignore recruiters, but one in particular caught my eye, and I decided why not chat about it, what’s the worst that can happen? Well.. here’s the conundrum that came from that. It’s 1/3 more than I make now, is in the same area as my current work (although not remote), and the work is completely different (still the same type of role, but way better than what I’m doing). The recruiter I spoke with was excited and told me that I’d be a great fit, and suggested I talk to my current manager and let them know that I’ve been contacted by a few, and they’re offering xyz generally, but I feel strange about even bringing it up with him, without an official offer. I feel like that would potentially bite me in the ass. But she did make a point about burning bridges and whatnot. I’m conflicted about talking to him about it because I don’t want to make it seem like I have my foot out the door, but at the same time, I need to do what’s best for myself and my family. 

I’m really torn on what I want to do and what I should do. I don’t want to leave, because I truly believe in the product, it’s a stable company, and I genuinely enjoy my coworkers. But at the same time, I don’t want to do the work I’ve been doing essentially since I started, and my family is nearly paycheck to paycheck due to inflation and skyrocketing housing costs. I’ve talked with my manager about pay and tasks before, but when it came to pay, he would straight up say that “he’s trying, but if I’m looking for a large jump, I’d need to look elsewhere”. I understand that is the case now, that I shouldn’t expect a $20k raise or whatever. But damn.. I’ve worked my ass off here, and for that? Feels like a punch in the gut. Not only that, I absolutely feel I’ve just been given busy work as we don’t have many cool projects lined up for the year, as the org is tightening the purse strings right now (although they are touting that they’re doing pay adjustments to align better with the market, but we’ve heard that before and it didn’t happen).

I don’t particularly have loyalty to the company, but I do feel for my colleagues as they’d get the brunt of me leaving, and the benefits aside from pay are fantastic. There’s not many places you can work and take off when needed, and currently my life requires that to an extent. 

Anyway. This is mostly a rant. But I’m curious about what others would do in my position. Thanks for reading.",Reasonable-Club-8612,2,0.6700000166893005,12,1707717467,2024-02-12 05:57:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aot1pt/would_you_stay_or_would_you_leave/,2,2024

1aophg9,I feel like I should go learn a trade but I am nervous about going back to school.,"Storytime: I graduated from college back in 2021 with a degree in media and communications with an emphasis on Marketing. After I graduated, I took a job learning to be a house painter and while I did ,for the most part, enjoy the work and the skills I learned, it wasn't what I wanted to do and I also sense that there wasn't a ton of growth in terms of pay. I made good money for a first real job but it wasn't enough to have me move out of my parent's house. 

So, after 2 years of that, I left and have been trying my hand at various marketing jobs but never found one that stuck. Even worse I never found the work particularly interesting. I studied it in school, but there was so much I did not learn and no one at the companies I worked for seemed to want to take the time to teach me. I tried to teach myself in my sparetime but I learn better when working with someone and doing the job. To be honest, I had a better mentor when painting. (Perhaps he set my expectations too high of what a mentor is supposed to be like)

Now, 2.75 years after graduating and still not being able, or even having the desire to, find a job in the field that I went to college for, I am beginning to question if my college process and experience was even worth it and if I should have just gone to a trade school. I do like working with my hands and I understand that trades, especially in my area, are seeing a significant decrease in employees. 

Now here comes to my true dilemma. Trade schools, like most schools, cost money. Money which I do not necessarily have at the moment. And while student loans are a thing, the idea of being in debt of any kind is extremely unpleasant. I know that trade schools cost a lot less than colleges do, so paying back the debt isn't not such a massive thing, but my point still stands. 

I suppose what I am asking for is, is there anyone here who had a similar experience? Went to college, did well, graduated, but when the time came to find work related to the degree, it just didn't work for them and they did a trade instead? What trade did you end up doing? How are you doing now?",Opposite-Cartoonist6,1,1.0,2,1707705453,2024-02-12 02:37:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aophg9/i_feel_like_i_should_go_learn_a_trade_but_i_am/,2,2024
1aopgvp,Senior full-cycle account executive at a crossroads. What would you do?,"Hi everyone.  
I am a senior full-cycle remote sales executive at a B2B SaaS and telecommunications company, selling month-to-month subscriptions to SMB professionals in home services, finance, and law. When I started two years ago, my base salary was $35k, and the OTE on LinkedIn was only $60k. In spite of this, I sell enough to be the top member and six-figure earner of my team. This comes from making at least 250 cold calls a day to scraped leads, managing a very tiny amount of inbound prospects, and either closing in one call or performing demos through teleconference.   
I’m a single guy with no kids. If I had to, I’d travel, move, or work long hours and weekends. I’m successful working 40 hours/week remotely with work-life balance, and I’d love for that to continue. But money is most important.  
At the end of Q3 2023, my company was forced to downsize and make several organizational changes for the worse. While I retained my position (and management increased my base salary to $50k to convince me to stay), my earnings still came in lower than anticipated. The new VP of sales told me on-camera that he wanted to pay me $15k more for the deals I closed. Yet, his commission plan was rejected by our board in favor of another that paid us less.  
That very well could be a lie on his end, but it should elucidate part of why I’m reaching out to this community for advice.  
It is time for me to move to a more advanced role (in or out of tech) that pays at least $100k base salary. What that looks like exactly I must figure out. I know I have the talent and work ethic for career advancement, but I’m still learning in sales how to properly network, ask for mentorship, find positions where the grass truly is greener, and interview properly. Not to mention avoid the current layoff trend once I transition.  
I will continue to give my current role my all for the foreseeable future, but I need to start this process now before the company goes under. A little bird told me that almost happened last year. My gut tells me it still could.  
My first ideas are to hire a career/interview coach and subscribe to one of the paid LinkedIn tiers. Necessary? I’m not sure. But as one of my favorite quotes goes… if I want success, “figure out the price, then pay it.” Today that means skipping the Super Bowl right now to write to you all. Tomorrow it could mean something I haven’t even thought of yet, based on whatever suggestions I get from you all.

1. Set specific days and time block for your search, ex: mon-wed-fri from 7PM to 8:30 PM
2. Prioritize quality over quantity, is better to take the time to analyze the companies and apply to 3 jobs a day 
3. Remind yourself of your strengths and successes when you receive a rejection,   every no is an opportunity to grow and open other doors

1aokgu3,Recruitment to HR: Should I take this job offer?,"Based in Australia. 

For the past three years, I've honed my skills as a recruiter, gaining experience both internally and within agencies. However, I've recently decided to transition into HR and will be studying a Bachelor of HR starting this July.

I recently interviewed for an HR Admin role and received an offer. However, I'm deliberating over several factors:

Pros:

- A chance to transition into HR
- Opportunities for career growth
- Strong team support
- Yearly salary reviews

Cons:

- Lack of remote work flexibility, with mandated 8am to 4:30pm office hours
- Management exhibits traditional, 'old school' attitudes, male-dominated mining industry
- Daily commute of 30-40 minutes, leading to increased fuel expenses
- $5k lower salary compared to my current position

Over the past three years, I've enjoyed the flexibility to choose my work hours and WFH, which has greatly benefited my mental well-being. I'm concerned about the lack of progressiveness within the company, especially in a HR role. I typically dhere to the mantra, ""If it's not a fuck yeah, it’s a no” but I'm torn about passing up this opportunity to break into HR. I’ve been actively applying for other roles, but there isn’t too much opportunity out there at the moment.

1aok7ug,"Longer resume gap, or shift to unrelated junior-level position?","I was laid off in a large RIF at my former company in March last year after working there for six years (as a senior 3D artist). Immediately after, I took several months off from job related searching. Last Fall I resumed the job hunt in earnest, sending out on average 3-4 applications per week. Since then I've had several phone screens and a couple multi-round interviews but no job offers. I had been thinking of returning to school but that is still up in the air. As of this March I'll have a year long gap in my resume.

In the meantime I have been considering taking on a temporary entry-level job unrelated to my background just to generate some income. I'm thinking I have two choices:

1) Keep hunting for a 3D art related job that's tied to my background and not worry about a growing resume gap

2) Take on a junior level job in a clerical role, product assembly or something similar just for the immediate income and to shorten the resume gap

From a potential future recruiter perspective, would it look worse to have a longer resume gap? Or to have a senior-level position on the resume followed by an entry-level position in a completely different field?

1aojmya,Pharmacology MS exploring careers outside of research but limited by MS. What are your career change recommendations?,"Hello, excuse my grammar for I am typing on my phone. 

I am a pharmacology MS exploring careers in industry, law, medicine. 

Background: I am a 29 yr/o female pharmacology graduate, 6+ years in neuroscience & molecular research with publications, and co-founded a 501c3 non-profit. I was on the pre-medical track and I am older due to financial and health barriers. As I was ready to apply for medical schools, covid hit, & I became ill with an autoimmune condition that affected my nervous system. This forced me to reevaluate my life, my physical abilities, & my identity. I am in recovery, and currently exploring alternative career options. I no longer believe I have the time/luxury of dealing with medical residency. 
From my career research, an MS in a life science seems very limiting. A PhD, MD, PharmD is almost always required for careers that have peaked my interests, such as a life science Patent Agent, patent prosecution, MSL, healthcare consulting, or moving up in Pharma/biotech. (I do not see myself spending more time in a lab, nor can I work with lab animals any longer). 
Several biotech/pharma professionals I have spoken to recommended me to earn an MBA from a top healthcare program (“shortest, least resistant path”). I don’t know if the hefty price tag is worth it and have submitted to r/MBA. 

I’m currently applying to jobs like healthcare/business analyst, regulatory affairs, compliance, and I may even consider sales..
I am weighing the pros and cons of earning a JD, Physicians Assistant-C, MBA (healthcare consulting, business), and PhD (I prefer no more lab work but I am exploring research options, omics, etc.).
I am even considering a coding bootcamp.

I’m in my late twenties and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I’ve pursued several educational, vocational, and employment paths but nothing has stuck. I feel the walls of age closing in on me. I need to find something this year. Money isn’t all that important compared to being fulfilling. 

In the past I:

- worked in landscaping (enjoyed it)

- joined the army as a combat medic (did not enjoy it)

- attended university (didn’t finish)

- worked in the oil fields (enjoyed it)

- preformed heavy rescue operations (enjoyed it)

- attended a cybersecurity bootcamp (finished it, got comptia certs like sysadmin+, pentest+,  linux+, etc. was never able to find job in field) 

- worked on an Alaskan fishing trawler (enjoyed it)

- repossessed cars (enjoyed it)

- worked as a private investigator (enjoyed it)

I’m trying to use my veterans benefits for schooling but I don’t know what to do. I want to make good money, I want to enjoy my work, I want to be in demand, I want to live in a rural area, I want to do something active, I want to do something I could possibly turn into my own business.

I'll give you guys a run down of my life and after could you please let me know what you would do if you were in my situation?

  
CAREER  
I currently work in Finance but was recently laid off. I do have another job offer that is paying roughly $75k with this France job would pay $60,000. I am worried about leaving the financial industry and re-entering it with my last experience being a job where I got laid off of. I also got this france opportunity a year after my first job in finance and took a year off from working in the field when my visa got rejected.

WORK EXPERIENCE

I worked at a bank in finance for a year then quite because of this opportunity. I never got to go due to covid so I proceeded to not work for a year. After than I worked at the same bank at a different role for a year an a half before getting laid off. Very shortly after getting laid off I got this opportunity. Now I am weighting out my options.

  
RELATIONSHIPS  
I currently have a long term girl friend that I love. We would be long distance but I dont want to potentially ruin our relationship. I do also have a great group of friends from sports (more to come below) that i would really hate to leave behind. We have a lot of trips planned and I would hate to miss out.

  
EXTRA-CURRICULARS  
This one is a big one. I am very into paddling sports (I would say I love paddling more than music at this point of my life) and am on the Canadian national team for Dragon boat with goals to be on the National Team for Canoe Sprint as well as the olympic roster in the summer olympics after this olympics. If I leave I would leave all my teammates, wont be able to paddle, and would have very low chances of making the olympic roster for the 2028 Olympics as I came into canoeing late. Lastly, i would miss out on the 2024 world cup for Dragon boat which is the last competition I have not competed in for dragon boat as it has not been held in 7 years due to covid.  
I would be living in Nice France (which is beautiful) but also hard to visit back home due to they way flights are there.

1aof783,Back to Civil Engineering or Stay in Tech with Family Considerations?,"Hi! I (32) have been a Consultant for a software company for the last 2 years (WFH). On a whim I applied to a job with a large municipality that would be much more aligned to my educational background in civil engineering (14mo of experience before my current role). It would likely be more meaningful work overall to me as what they do aligns with what inspired me to pursue civil engineering in the first place (hard to tell until you're really in it though). I had my 2nd interview recently and I am waiting for a response. Financial compensation is about the same, but there would be a pension, 1 extra week of vacation, 15 other flex days I can spread throughout the year, and a better work life balance (less threat of late nights working on client deliverables, and less ""drinking from the fire hose"" stressful speed-learning that comes with Consulting).   


Sounds like a no brainer to switch right? Two main dilemmas:   


1) One of my parents was recently diagnosed with serious cancer. They are undergoing treatments soon, but I am very nervous about this. My current role allows me to WFH, so I can go out to the rural part of the country to spend time with my family where I grew up as long as I want, even move back there (I am considering this as I just moved to my current HCOL area for new experiences/dating/sports I was lacking back home). If I get an offer and take the new role, it's not WFH so I'm ""stuck"" in my current HCOL area where in the long run buying anything beyond a 1 bedroom apartment is extremely difficult to afford, and even if you can you're a mortgage slave. So, I couldn't visit my family as easily/often, move there if things get worse, or build my life where they live in that LCOL area once I'm ready to settle down.  


2) Although there's a pension, more holidays, better work life balance, and likely better meaning from the municipal position, staying in tech is likely more lucrative in the long run (especially if I move to the states for a few years, as I currently work in Canada), which would get me to my eventual early retirement goals sooner (still part time work, just not as much grinding) which could possibly compensate for a job that is easier but I have to do for 5 years longer. I worry if I leave tech now I'll ruin my momentum/won't be able to get back in as easily. Picturing most of my career being alone in a room WFH is also depressing in its own way though.  


Overall, I'm worried that if I get an offer and accept, I'll feel like now I have to stay in this HCOL area, it'll be harder to visit/live close to family as we deal with this illness as well as possibly settling there in the longer term (2+ yrs), and I'll be reducing my long term earning potential. But if I don't take it, I'll have more stressful work, and more work/overtime, while not being as aligned to my civil engineering interests (assuming I get along equally well with the new people I'd be working with, which is a whole other unknown).   


I'm feeling anxious about this and would appreciate some insight. Maybe I won't get an offer and the decision is made for me, but if I do get one I'm going to be frozen with indecision.

1aoe1a8,Indecisive on what to do as a career.,"As the title says, I’m super indecisive on what I want to pursue as a career.

New to this sub, so forgive me if I post TMI, but here goes:


Background: I am 30-M, located in SE USA, if that matters. Spent 8 years in an automotive plant doing everything from Injection Molding to Quality Assurance to “Backup” Shift Supervisor. 
I am currently in banking, as a teller (was a desk banker but stepped down due to finding out I strongly dislike sales and conning people into products I don’t believe were beneficial to them) and make ~$43k/yr. Literally a burden having to go in there everyday, tbh. 

I’m currently doing GenEd courses with a plan to pursue a Bachelors in IT afterwards, but am doubting that path as that career market is trash for the foreseeable future it seems. Only have a HS diploma, and two certificates from Google (Cybersecurity & IT Support.) I’ve always liked working with computers and technology, but am getting burnt out on direct customer-facing roles. So, not sure if there’s something within that field that can meet that.

Also, as far as “hobbies” go I guess: I love to cook, but know I wouldn’t want to commit the hours to be a ‘chef’; Enjoy photography; Minor video editing and clipping skills for my local church for their YT channel


Any ideas/advice/tips/guidance would be much appreciated. Don’t care about the $200k/yr. life but also would like to make a “comfortable” (for myself and my spouse) living wage (aka $70-80k+). Tired of feeling like I’m wasting time and energy at jobs I could care less about that I want to turn on my notice every time I walk through the door. 😂",Nearby-Ad2600,1,1.0,1,1707674298,2024-02-11 17:58:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aoe1a8/indecisive_on_what_to_do_as_a_career/,2,2024

In my mind an EM role is generally preferable to a PM role but I'm not sure I fully understand the implications of this choice.

I'm aware that the idea is that a PM chooses ""what"" to build and the EM chooses ""how"" to build; however, in practice I suspect that both will have an ongoing dialog and the what/how will be the result of this discussion.

1aocbvk,What do you do when your completely burnt out? I don’t think I can stay in the public sector anymore.,"Have I simply had a bad run of luck, and am letting my burnt-outedness and paranoia bleed into my new job. 
For the past seven years I’ve been working in government. The pays not been great, but I’ve always done semi well. First job in government a supervisor really liked me and put me on a path to higher grades, leadership, etc. Then higher up’s decided to shake everything up, and mismanage the office, so my supervisor left and then I took a fellowship as I had just graduated. The fellowship was hell. There were two very supportive people who tried to help so much, but because our boss refused to address the elephant in the room (our hostile secretary), I had to leave. I was sick of getting screamed at, having to mend fences with other departments because she yelled at them, and belittled everyone’s work. She got physically violent with someone else, but because she was a single mother, hands off…don’t even think about firing her. She eventually quit a year later. But then rampant nepotism took over in that office (friends hiring friends and refusing to promote from within, it’s good I got out). 

I was out of options, and my old job offered me a promotion in 6 months following my return (never happened). Took on loads of responsibilities, supervisor never communicated with me. I went out of my way to send at least thrice weekly updates, though all my work was director assigned. Then the pandemic hit. Supervisor didn’t come into work. I had to go in, and because I was doing work until 8 pm (calls from our director who needed spreadsheets put together all the time) even after I got home, I figured, what’s the issue if I’m showing up late, I wasn’t getting paid overtime, and all the work is getting done. I informed my supervisor and, she was okay with it. Supervisor who took calls while she was working on her farm, showed up one day and started to yell at me. She did see reason because the complaintant was out temp who’d watch movies all day, and she had agreed to this before. But really?!?Guy ended up getting fired. Never got a bad review, always did everything I was asked and more. But then, after being promised a promotion, they changed the entire job description, opened it up to other people. People who I had forged relationships with and been helpful and guiding (a second director they hired who I helped everyday because they had never worked in state government, literally coaching her through webinars and admin because she asked), didn’t have the decency to come tell me that they had gone with someone else. In this worst case scenario, all I wanted was a face to face after two years, someone telling me, we’re sorry we’ve gone with someone else. They we’re cowards and never owned their decisions. They notified me via pdf and then told me, oh it’s okay, this person might fail and then you’ll get the job. That’s not what I wanted. I don’t want people to fail, I was mad at administration for breaking promises, and then not acting professional. And they also tried to pressure me into  training them in all your duties. If they were qualified, why don’t they know how to do any of this?

Fast forward 6 months, I got a new job. Again, in government, but in a field my masters degree is in and everyone has been extremely nice, extremely helpful for the most part. Somewhat sick of getting emails when I sit right next to someone for very insignificant things. 

I started with another analyst and we’ve both been seeing the guidance bleed away after the first six months. It’s been mostly constant training without a ton of practical reinforcement, so we’re both a bit confused. And everyone is busy, so it’s going to be difficult to get that experience. It’s been acknowledged….If YOU don’t give the new guys opportunities to work, how will they ever become competent. To be fair, this was the office’s first set of outside hires in 8 years.  

Even though everyone is nice, each time a promotional availability has come up, they act weird around everyone. I was asked six times if I applied by a supervisor, though I’d only worked there 4 and 6 months when asked. And I’ve made it clear to everyone, I need a year in this position before I can confidently transition to a supervisory role. Until I can train other people, I’m not interested. Everyone knows that I’m also the caretaker for my elderly parents, so more responsibility wouldn’t work for me anymore, at least right now. 

The other day a friend told me they knew someone was coming over and when I asked a colleague they got all weirded out that I asked, and trepidatiously said that a person is being promoted. I had to make clear I hadn’t applied, and was just hoping to move desks, so I’m not stuck next to the air vent. Then they relaxed. I just hate spiteful gossip or when people start acting secretively, just be up front and honest. That’s all I ask. It’s probably just my paranoia and stress bleeding through. 

Right now, the last thing is that I can’t imagine staying in government. By the time a promotion opens up again, I’m going to be 33 (most likely), and I’ve already seen the people two and three grades above me have been in the game 30+ years. One person in their 40s just had kids because they could only afford them in the top position. My life, my actual life has suffered between the high pressure, stressful jobs and taking care of of parents. Outside of those two things, I have almost nothing, and don’t even want to stick it out in this job. 

That and this jobs is so existentially stressful. I hated dealing with politics and stress within the governor’s office I worked in. Now I have to deal with crime/criminality and sick deviants. 

The obvious off-ramp for me is 1-2years from now after I get a security clearance. This will enable me to get a number of remote positions with pay 2-3 times what I’m getting right now. I have a second citizenship which is complicating the process, but I’d like to move to that country from the US and work remotely. 

I don’t know if I can hack it that long. There’s a constant self doubt that has creeped into my mind that started in my last job. There were a number of things I didn’t know how to do and no one would teach me. Then I was berated for not knowing how to do these things”office specific” things. This self doubt has followed me into this new job and combined with elder care stress, and the completely loss of a social life.

I’ve broad set of largely esoteric skills, which lend themselves to government work. BA in Classics (Greek and Latin, was going to be a teacher, but no real jobs)/Management, a Master degree in International Affairs.  Only other job experience is in retail, food service (mainly as a part time somm).

I’d contemplated moving to Italy or France, have an EU passport and even doing physical labor on a vineyard, just because I’m so sick of the office setting. I fluent enough in French, but my Italian needs work. 

Do I need to mentally frame this better. I think I’m going to permanently burnt out and unhappy in government.",New-Pay9393,1,1.0,2,1707669983,2024-02-11 16:46:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aocbvk/what_do_you_do_when_your_completely_burnt_out_i/,2,2024
1aocamh,"How do I survive unemployment/job hunt for an extended amount of time, mental-health and motivation-wise?","Hey! 

At the end of 2022 I (29F) reached absolute breaking point of unhappiness in my old job and quit. I went traveling for a few months in 2023, and since last July, I am job hunting actively, full-time. 

I never counted how many job applications I send, but it's depending on quality and motivation, I would say about 30 highly motivated/high quality ones, and at least 50 more generic. 

I've had a bunch of interviews, but nothing ever came of it, even ones where I felt really good afterwards. I always made sure to show interest an motivation, and even added application videos where it seemed relevant ad reasonable (I know recruiters do not always love being spammed with too much material). 

I am in a really tough industry that is also suffering from the economic situation, so I know no matter how much effort I put in, I also need a lot of luck. I am also now in a mid-range experience wise, which makes me compete with anyone between 2 and 10 years of work experience (I have indeed been interviewed even for a head-of position, but obviously lost it to someone with more experience). Last week I had a call with a recruiter who told me they had applications ""in the high three digit range"" for the position I was applying for, just to give you an idea.

At this point, I am sad, frustrated and depressed, and I just can't find any motivation anymore. Money is tight and all my friends are far away at the moment, so it's like my whole life is starting a standstill, and no matter how much effort I put into it, I just can't control the situation myself. I have even invested into working with a coach and upskilling in my field. 

I have broadened my job search while still prioritizing those I assume to have the best prospects in. 

But I have once again reached breaking point. I simply cannot stay hopeful for building a future in a better job (my old one was just super toxic), and it's becoming harder by the day to stay motivated to even look for jobs, read endless job ads, write motivation letters about how amazing I will be for the organizations when I lost all sense of self-worth. 

HOW do I continue. How do I survive this time.

I really don't know what to do anymore. 

Thanks!

When the market tanked, they restructured our salary so the max we could make essentially went from 135k to like 102k. Base became 85k and then an opportunity to bonus 20% of that new salary. I have had my pay nearly cut in half for 1.5 years and it’s appearing like there will be no 2023 bonuses (of course corporate can’t come out and say that to our face).

My boss is amazing and I told him I have to go if I don’t get a raise but he’s not very confrontational and I don’t think he knows how to advocate for me. 
The executives that would make a decision about a raise are all a bunch of frat bros and literal brothers that have known each other forever.

1aoagns,How to deal with toxic work environment? My new job is killing me,"I recently got a new job - started mid December 2023 (marketing agency 150-200 employees). During the interview things seemed fine, I was promised to have a nice work life balance and was interviewed by a guy who was supposed to be my manager + 2 more higher people. He seemed pretty chill and nice. 

When I started, turned out he wasn’t going to be my manager as he is moving to another side of the company (managing the US clients). Another person that was I nterviewing me went on sabbatical. After all, I was assigned to a freshly hired VP who had to build the team in our region (Canada clients), and she also had no idea that was the plan up until her first day. 

The guy who interviewed me was supposed to still onboard and train me. I ended up chasing him to get at least some information, and half of what he was telling me was either useless, or wrong. I feel like he is setting me up for a failure on purpose but I have no idea why. He has been talking to me in a very condescending, borderline rude way (other ppl confirmed that). On top is it, he would tell me one thing, and then a completely different thing to other managers which made me look bad when I did things wrong. I sucked it up as he is the only one who knows all the processes there..

It’s only been going downhill. A new person was hired to the team, she is above me and she is treating me as if we are in the army. No please/thank you, etc. Just orders. No matter how much work I do, I don’t feel appreciated. 

The processes in the company are a mess, nobody knows anything, huge miscommunication between the departments, and everyone is blaming each other. The lower your position is, the more shit you get for upper management mistakes. I feel like I have to fight for my life every day, have huge anxiety and troubles sleeping. Work 9-10 hours a day with literally no breaks. 

Is there a way to survive this? What is the best strategy to stand up for myself and not get fired? Any advice?

Company performance has yielded no bonus for the last two years.  Right now it feels stable, but always on my mind.  I’m also not very happy there.

Wife is fully remote as well with a thriving company.  We own two homes. One in a resort area (we work and live there all summer) and the other in a normal residential area with decent schools. Both home are mortgaged with sub 3% interest rates

I have a very aggressive job offer (also a thriving company) with generous relocation sign on bonus, 20% annual bonus (same as I would get now) and a 12% salary bump.  I’d also reunite with some former colleagues. It is fully in office, no travel and requires relocation to an area with a higher cost of living.  Commute would be about 45 miles each way to an area we would want to live.  

We would rent our resort house exclusively because it would be a little too far for weekend trips.  

Wife, kids and my mother who lives with us are all on board but I’m really unsure.  Giving up our summer home, lifestyle and friends would make this a tough move.  The new location is about 2.5 hours from home now.

1ao5u53,What do I do now? I'm getting frustrated with how my life is going.,"Hi I'm 22 and just graduated college with a useless general Studies degree. (Organizational Leadership, Sociology, and History where my concentrations). I had a 2.4 GPA when graduating. I always hated school and just did it because my grandparents forced me to. (I lived with them since I was 8 after being neglected and abused from my biological mom and step dad's.)

I had 4 jobs since I was 15.

My first job was for a large grocery company that's well known. I started off as a bagger when I was 15. At 18 I became a cashier and started working full time and took online college courses online as well. I was promoted to Front End Supervisor a year later and the falling year at 20 years old I became an assistant front end manager. (I loved the job but hated how corporate was managing the business and it was making it more stressful than it needed to be for a few months before relocating.) 4 years and 1 month total with company.

I moved out of my grandparents house at 21 and got my own apartment. I got a warehouse job that paid the same from my previous position and worked that job for six months before getting tired of it due to the extreme hours and strict policies. (I became a lead because I worked the longest at the company without getting fired.) I quit this job Christmas day of 2022. I took a break from working to finish that useless degree full time.

I got another warehouse position for a pharmacutical company in a distribution center. I quit this job though in three days due to the environment being worse than the previous company.

I finally decided to go back to retail and got a Service Operations Assistant Manager position with a rival organization with my first job. (They are merging within a year though) I like the job but I'm not treated well by any of my coworkers. The managers are cool but even as an assistant I'm part time and my hours will go from 40 to less than 10 on any given week. If I try to ask for more and a manager trys cutting someones else's, then they get yelled at and I will too by them since everyone is older and been there awhile. Overall I like the job but hate how I'm treated. I just his my 4 months mark with the company.

I'm just lost and getting frustrated because I was pumped at first when I got my current job. I don't want to go back to school since I hate school with a passion and if I was going to get a degree, I want one because I wanted it not because my narcissist grandma can say ""My child is college education."" Even though I clearly didn't know what to study or mentally ready to attend a university.

Does anyone know any decent careers for someone with a useless degree with a crappy GPA but an impressive job history? Im a hard worker and go above and beyond every time. I do have social anxiety from past childhood trauma but learned to over come it with my retail experience. I have tried applying to a bunch of different companies to either not hear back or make it to a final stage of interviews to be turned down when they see my college transcript.

Every single application I've submitted for a job in accounting has been rejected.

As the title says, I applied for a job that required quite a lengthy and detailed personal statement, questions and various other elements, including discussing my quantitative experience. After submitting all the information, I noticed a small error in my CV despite running it through Grammarly -  I spelt lead instead of led.   
I really think I have a good chance of getting this job, but just wanted to see whether this error is big enough to seriously hurt my chances? Here is the quote from my CV: 

  
""Lead the development of an ........."" 

  
I understand that an error on a CV is a severe mistake..... but something like this slipped through the cracks of proofreads and spell checks. Do you think the hirers will pick up on this? And could this seriously hurt my chances of landing this job?

1ao49uc,Moving teams internally at company,"I’m seeking advice on the best way to go about moving teams at my current company. I’ve been in my current role for a little under 2 years. Thinking long term, I don’t see myself progressing into a management role and that’s really the only direction I could go if I wanted to grow my career only current team. The alternative would be to stay in my current position indefinitely which isn’t ideal either bc there are aspects of my role I’m not crazy but they are a part of the job. 
I know for certain that there in an open position on the team I’m interested in. I’ve also worked directly with the team (specifically manager I’d be working for if I were to get the new position) over the past 1.5 years but more so over the past few months. I also received high praises from this manager recently given my current team’s involvement with their team. 
Should i express interest to the new potential manager first before going to my current manager and saying that I am having thoughts about wanting to try a new role? I don’t want this opportunity to pass me by but on the other hand I also don’t have my guarantee of this new position so I’d be taking a bit of a risk. I also wouldn’t be as inclined to do this if I didn’t think I was qualified/actually had a chance.  I also don’t want to do anything shady and have word get to my manager before I tell him myself. However again I don’t want to miss this opportunity if it’s there. 
I’m just concerned that if I don’t say anything this opportunity will pass me by and I’ll be stuck in my current role. I do like the company I work for and want to stay with them. So I’m less inclined to go somewhere else if it doesn’t work out. I’m not concerned on getting canned from the current role either because I work on a small team and all of us are needed a lot right I just think it may create some waves.. I have a good relationship with my current manager but I have a feeling this will come as a surprise. 
Any advise welcome, thanks.",0rang1na,1,1.0,0,1707644104,2024-02-11 09:35:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ao49uc/moving_teams_internally_at_company/,2,2024

Not sure how to put it but i'm into manyyyy things but mentally get stuck on moving foward? I live with my mom, been in this state texas im in 24yrs, never moved so desperatly wanting to move outta state (or country but I dont know how to get 10k fast). Got told by parents have money saved for college/classes, but I'm not gonna go into any big place & go into debt. 

\-So i'm interested in carpentering, welding, or diving, knowing the trade will pay well to live off of & I can defiantly go to trade school or community college though I'll have to retake this test for math, I've looked at nautical archeology/shipwreck career but that's lots of yrs & debt, as well as shipwright (volunteer, either trade will help, unpaid crew mostly a hobby though), love animals & underwater mysteries but no job in mind for me.            MOSTLY Not sure if should just stick to a trade or two instead?? Because I am interested in many hobbies & skills which i'll list off if anyone's ever intrigued, but I feel it'll be useless looking for a solid path. also doing security as my job currently. 

Hobbies:  
Firedancing(Poi's/Staff), instruments of many traditions (Learning the Lyre, Arabic Oud, silver flute & darbuka drum current), viking hedeby & birka living history reenactment/live steel eastern/western combat, diy crafts listed below, b-ball, archery longbow, gaming, stick&poke, hiking/Urbex exploration too, bushcraft/Camping, martial arts (learning krav maga now than muay thai as a goal), skating/ice skating, snowboard(someday), also bout to take a culinary class for basics as idk shit. 

  
Skills (I have/want to learn):  
Leatherwork, machine/hand sewing, woodwork/carving, butterfly knife tricks, kargyraa throat singing, another language (norweigen, swedish, latin or something), then just some basic past job shit (pizza, security, barback, just rando)   
(udemy classes I got saved for the future)- graffiti, drawing, graphic design, fl studio 12, hacking (for flipper zero & gigs), blender.

 \- I have some goals for the future but not entirely, mostly exploring places I've saved/traveling, still young so plan on loads of misadventures, owning land, some others, I do have a idea for a etsy/e-commerce shop though hundreds do what I like already, and I know of some side hustles too...but out of reading all these subjects & trades, But what kind of path should I find? 

if you haven't clicked off or left a comment already ty........I'm also spiritual but never delved in. But I did minimal research and want to start basic shit after I moved & figured if I'm doing trades instead of career but the list is very long of cool ass subjects JUST for the occult realm of spiritually, religion and so forth. So if you're into that & wanna know what I saved to know later?

1anwua9,Would I be crazy to reject a job that increases my salary by 50% because of these disadvantages?,"I am a teacher in the UK and recently was offered a role at an international school where I would:

Pros
- Increase my salary by £20K
- Live in a city with a cheaper COL than I currently do
- Get to experience a foreign culture
- This has been my goal for a long time, though I didn’t realise about some of the cons when I had this plan.

However, I am inclined to reject because:

Cons
- The school has only bad reviews from former employees on Glassdoor and an International Schools Review website
- I have read that schools in the UK don’t really value international school experience, so it might be hard for me to get reemployed in the UK when I eventually return
- I love my current life and where I live. I don’t know anyone in the city or country where I have been offered the job and would have to start a new life from scratch. I’m 27, so getting older.

1anwez6,"Patent Research Engineer, good opportunity? Or mind numbingly boring downward spiral","Thought I would give some context about me to help people understand the situation.  
  
**Background**  
I finished a Mechanical Engineering BaSc back in June 2023 where I did quite well and seemed to like most of the subjects. I have been working as a video game developer ever since September 2023 due to getting an opportunity which pays me well enough and now I plan to do it part time as I believe it is not something future proof, neither something that I really want to do/ planned to ever do.  
  
After passively looking for engineering jobs I did some interviews here and there to get some experience, I even got some offers which I rejected due to various reasons (I don't live in the USA and the job market here is not horrible). Now I was fortunate enough to get an offer from an IP/Patent Researching/consulting company where I would be a ""Patent Research Engineer"".  
  
**Reasons putting me off**  
Honestly I applied without even fully understanding what the job role meant and after the interview and some online research I kind of understand it now. My immediate thoughts were that this kind of thing is probably not for me, as I always hated huge blocks of texts about some small detail or nuances, I'd prefer to engage in technical discussions and not in ridiculous semantic discussions, I want to solve problems write equations and code ,I'm not a very well organized person (I put immense effort in my organization just to not bother other people), I'm not really interested in Law, unsure of how transferable the skills would be to other engineering jobs.  
  
**Reasons keeping me in**  
Now for these reasons I'm still thinking of accepting: I want to get a taste of an engineering job, a job with more structure and significance. The pay they offered is not bad at all for a junior position in my country. Seems like a very serious company where interesting people work at. Opportunity to do innovation engineering at a sister company under the same roof after some months of mainly being a research patent engineer, but even then at best I would be doing 70% patents 30% R&D. I would get to educate myself on the latest technologies. And lastly I believe it would look good on a CV.  
  
**Question**  
I apologize for this huge post (I know, hypocritical) but I felt like it was needed to convey my struggle. It pains me deeply to admit that I'm terrible at making decisions, undecisive, get cold feet, mostly make decisions based on feelings and randomness. This has really pained me in the last months and has probably caused me to even lose good opportunities, so I've come to ask for any sort of advice.  
  
Could you provide me with any additional insight and comments? I would be very grateful for a comment from somebody who does Patent Research Engineering. I would also be very grateful to anyone who takes time to read and write something in the comments, thanks.",Particular_Egg8500,1,0.5,4,1707615879,2024-02-11 01:44:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1anwez6/patent_research_engineer_good_opportunity_or_mind/,2,2024

1anuc88,Teacher looking for a change,"Hi! I feel kinda lost on what to do about my career and I think I totally need outside opinions and recommendations, so I’d appreciate your pieces of advice. Sorry if I overshare a little 😅  
I’m 26 and I studied Audiovisual Translation. However, seeing that 99% of professionals are freelance and the offered rates are really low and there are always problems regarding that, I got scared and ended up being a teacher in private education. After 5 years in that position (and a promotion to studies coordinator), I feel burnt-out, and because of that plus other reasons like the constant unpaid extra work, I’ve been considering pursuing a different career. The problem is I’m stuck on the decision. I have this feeling that, due to my age, I’m already behind and I’m running out of time, so I feel I should find the Perfect Career, as in: whatever I choose now needs to be my definite career.  
I think I could thrive in a creative job which has a 9-5 work time, with overworking not being tied to the field (unlike teaching, that is), and I feel passionate about creating things, having exciting projects (oh, that great feeling of novelty), personal growth and knowing the work I do has some value and makes a positive change in the world, even if it’s just for a few people. Since I love technology and I’d say I’m sensitive and empathetic,  I thought about studying either Digital Marketing or UX/UI Design, which I heard are well-paid and fit my criteria. However, I’m unable to decide. I feel that maybe the latter is more creative than the former and maybe I’ll enjoy it a bit more. But I’ve heard right now the market is bad, so I don’t know if Digital Marketing is a safer option. I’m in the EU, btw, so I guess that will also affect how the field is for each career.  
I'd appreciate any input, be it some recommendations, any things to take into consideration when deciding which I may have overlooked, your opinion on this matter... anything which can help me take the leap and have some hope for the future.

1antvds,Having an awful time at work any advice welcome,"Hey Reddit fam,

Need some advice on a sticky situation at work. So, I've been in my role for three years now, and I recently got an ""exceed expectations"" performance rating. A couple of weeks ago I found the competency/salary framework for my role in a public folder. I found out I'm at the lowest level. Talk about a blow to the ego, especially when I learned that others in the same gig but with a different employer (we work for the same company same role, but are employed by different companies) are making more bank. Like between £5k - £10k more! 

I brought this up with my manager, but all I got were vague responses and delays. They agreed to send my role off to be salary benchmarked against internal and external data. It took nearly two weeks to send my this, with the possibility of any adjustment being included in my annual review, contrary to company policy. Which I’ve highlighted to them so many times, but each time they said I’m confused and won’t be at a loss if any adjustment given is included in my annual pay rise. I think this is wrong here’s what the policy says; 

""A salary adjustment may also be applicable if an employee's salary is on the low side relative to the internal and external benchmark data or cannot be explained in the gender pay gap analysis. Salary adjustment is not part of the salary review, but rather a separate process and therefore adjustments must be handled separately and without delay.""

Plus the company have failed to process my Access to Work grant within the specified timeframe and it’s now been withdrawn. I’ve brought it up on multiple occasions but each time they offer no explanation or apology. Saying I have to wait for HR to return for holiday. I feel like my disability is treated like a common cold. 

To make matters worse, opportunities for moving up the ladder are as rare as a unicorn sighting. And when a colleague in my department got promoted recently into a new created senior position without interviewing it seemed like it happened out of thin air without any clear criteria. Like, what gives?

I tried to take initiative by suggesting ways to streamline processes, loads of things!, and my managers were on board at first. But then they made decisions days later meaning I wouldn’t have the workload capacity to do this anymore, without looping me in, leaving me blindsided at a meeting.

I have been made to feel like I am the problem, with no proactive efforts from management to understand the specifics of the issues I am facing.

Honestly, I'm feeling pretty demoralised and overlooked. It's like my efforts go unnoticed, and the communication around here is about as clear as mud. Im feeling isolated and unsupported, and I'm not sure what my next move should be.

1antppl,27 and being underpaid as a paralegal. Where should I go from here?,"I've worked as a remote paralegal for about two years and have gotten one raise back in Sept 2022 that was a pittance. My firm over the past year has re-structured to the point where it is difficult to see any room for growth or further development of my skills and experience. Being 27, I am beginning to stress more about my future and financials and the opportunity to raise a family. I've thought about law school, but don't want to take out loads of money in loans and don't like the idea of spending three years not working in my late-20's. 

I've been applying for higher-salary positions in the legal field but am not getting very many bites. My main question is where should I go from here? What fields or positions would paralegals have a good shot at transitioning into? I am in consideration for a program coordinator role in a field I'm not interested in but it would double my current salary while remaining remote. If offered, I think I would take it for the money and think further about my goals/what I want to do with the rest of my life and re-evaluate.

1ansv8h,expected to manage a second and third store with no pay raise,"Background: 
I manage a food/drink service establishment. My title is “‘x’ location manager.” I have been with the company four years, 1.5 years in current role. I asked my supervisor for a performance review at my 1 year mark, he said they were happy with my performance and gave no notes, I asked to revisit my salary because of this and other reasons. I was told it wasn’t possible and would not be an option for at least another year (due to financial issues).

Issue:
The company is expanding to add one and possibly two new small locations just serving drinks (non-alcoholic). Due to the small size of the locations the owner won’t hire another manager and is expecting me to take on all responsibilities for staffing and managing these locations, in addition to managing my larger current store. I was very briefly happy to be considered for these increased responsibilities (assuming it would be a promotion and new salary), but I soon became concerned over how these responsibilities were just being handed off to me with deadlines, with no conversation about me moving into a new clearly defined role/contract. I voiced my concerns about the tasks being outside my current role as ‘x’ location manager, cited the fact that this work was previously the scope of our general manager who was laid off months ago (and got paid way more than me) and asked to get a description of my new role in writing. 

The owner responded saying that they don’t foresee these new locations being much work as they are so small (bullshit and out of touch) and that he views them as “extensions/outposts of ‘x’ (my current) location” and so managing them does fall under my domain with no pay raise. 

I am beyond frustrated and feel hugely taken advantage of and insulted. I know the work I do is valueble, and that these new stores will bring in lots of revenue and simply can’t succeed without a manager. I also love my current role a lot (before this debacle) and am worried I will get fired if I keep pushing back. It won’t be easy for my to find  another job as good as this one, even though my current pay isn’t great (bad job market).

Please give me advice. Do I grin and bear it, or keep fighting for what I deserve.",lavendersparkle99,2,1.0,2,1707605795,2024-02-10 22:56:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ansv8h/expected_to_manage_a_second_and_third_store_with/,2,2024
1ansv06,Is a PhD necessary for the career I'd want?,"I'm an undergrad applied math major (w/ a comp sci minor) wrapping up my degree soon. And so I've been thinking a lot about my plans post undergraduate. 

So far what I've realized is that I want a career where I either do mathematics research or use math/computer science in a non-trivial way to solve problems. Using math to answer questions like what are under the ""What Kinds of Problems Might You Work on?"" section of this SIAM page sounds really fun to me: [https://www.siam.org/students-education/programs-initiatives/thinking-of-a-career-in-the-mathematical-sciences](https://www.siam.org/students-education/programs-initiatives/thinking-of-a-career-in-the-mathematical-sciences)

And as far as how much I eventually make, I've never been a very materially focused person. But my parents have taught me the importance of how money can be a blessing. So I'd be perfectly happy making 60k-70k my first couple of years out of school and hopefully choose a career path to where I can make around 90k-120k.

So what I'm trying to consider right now is whether or not going to graduate school is the best path to achieving this sort of career given what I outlined above.

From what I keep reading I'm getting the sense that it could be yes, but with a lot of qualifications. Most people who I encounter say grad school is absolutely grueling and uses up the ""prime years"" of your life, since it usually takes 5-7 years to graduate. So you have to have a rock-solid motivation for going. And many say a masters, especially if you're paying for it, isn't smart career-wise either ultimately. 

But of course there have been other perspectives, and people who feel differently. Still, the attitude most people have towards grad school is really turning me off from the idea of going unless it really is the best path to achieving the kind of career I want. It just doesn't sound fun to live in damn near poverty for most of my 20s while constantly feeling discouraged, miserable, and depressed like most people say grad students are.",algerbrex,1,1.0,1,1707605777,2024-02-10 22:56:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ansv06/is_a_phd_necessary_for_the_career_id_want/,2,2024

I have done multiple forms of tactical training, got my CCAF in Criminal Justice as well as got my Bachelor’s in Homeland Security and am only a few credits away from a Master’s in Homeland Security: Counterterrorism. 

So I decided that I had no interest in becoming an NCO, seemed like it’d be filled with more headaches and trying to get a bunch of deadbeats into shape than any actual benefits aside from a bit more pay. And anyone whose ever served in Security Forces can tell you that we don’t get a lot of winners. As well as it seemed any “Career Progression” I would get would be a nice cushy back-office position where I’d do nothing but sit on my ass all day. I’m sorry but I’m not like a bunch of other people in my generation where I’m ready to sit on my ass for a job when I’m only in my mid-twenties. I haven’t worked my ass off in training and PT just for that.  But at the same time where else am I actually going to find meaningful work that isn’t going to restrict me to an office chair? No one takes the Air Force seriously! Especially Security Forces. And the very few that may will only see me as good for said office job where I’ll be staring at a computer screen until my eyes melt.

1anoepe,Looking for change in career but don’t know where to start,"Hi, I am a 27 f looking for career advice.  To start from the beginning, I graduated with a bachelors degree in psychology. Not the best degree to graduate with, I know, but at the time, it was something I was looking into pursuing post-graduate. I barely got past financially with my bachelor’s and had hoped to get a job that would help sponsor a post graduate degree as some tend to do. I found a job a an adolescent psychiatric center that was an absolute nightmare and it turned me off the entire profession. I got another job soon after quitting as a medical receptionist/admin assistant at a small practice. It was great and I stayed there for close to 5 years despite the low pay. This past December, the practice announced they were closing their doors permanently and in the beginning of January, majority of the staff (including me) were let go. Since then, I have been searching casually for a new job but nothing seems to catch my attention. I don’t really know what sort of work I am interested in besides that I would like more administrative/financing work that pays well enough to live on my own. I have had the privledge of living with my parents since I graduated college and honestly think they prefer it that way. I have a younger sibling with a large age gap between us that and I have been the de facto babysitter since he was born and also help my parents financially since my mom does not work. I am hoping to get a job that pays me well enough to get my own apartment as I would like my own independent space. My parents refuse to let me move out unless they can see I am financially stable - not saying that I am financially irresponsible but I think it’s more of an excuse to keep me at home. In my culture, most women do not leave home unless they have a very good job or get married.

1ano4db,What is a reasonable raise in my situation?,"I've been working remotely as a video editor/graphic designer for a large company making educational content for people getting insurance designations online since May 2021. I will be getting my first raise sometime this month apparently after the budget meeting. I know it's ridiculous I've worked there this long without a raise. I was in a serious depressive state for all of 2022 and 2023 and the last thing on my mind was asking for a raise. I had a good deal on rent and could make ends meet comfortably but as prices for everything have gone up astronomically and I have more and more bills, I'm struggling to make ends meet so much more now than 3 years ago. I also am forced to find a new apartment in Chicago since my landlord sold my unit, and the new owners are ready to move in as soon as my lease is up. As someone living alone, I will be paying at least $200 more a month in rent starting in April.

  
It's a bit of a weird one because I'm treated somewhat like a contractor. I don't get paid for my 30 minute lunch every day or vacation days as well as days the company is off like holidays. But I do have insurance and a 401k.

  
I haven't been told what this raise will be. I'm a reliable, knowledgeable employee who's been there longer than the whole design team except 1 person. I take a leadership role often. And I work independently without needing guidance.

  
Also worth noting, one of the senior members of the team retired last September, and my boss explained to me that they were told to replace her position with someone who could come into the office so they would be hiring someone completely new. Me and another member of the team work in different states than where this company is based. This was also when she told me about the incoming raise (I'm assuming to soften the blow).

  
So the rate I've been paid since 2021 is $26/hr. I was happy with this in 2021 as I was 24 and had lost my first job after college to COVID, and this job saved me from unemployment. However, now it's 2024 and I'm 27, and prices are crazy and I feel quite poor again.

  
What should I be expecting as a raise? I feel like something quite significant due to the amount of time with the company without any added benefit. Plus, this company is based in insurance, and I feel like they have the money to spare. Now that I doing much better mentally, I'm fully prepared to start looking for another job if this pay raise is not enough.

1anmb63,I Want Your Advice Before I Fire Someone for the First Time,"Hi,

So for the first time in my life, I have the ability to fire people.

I have this analyst - he's very smart and has worked with us for about 5 months. However, over the last month, he has been completely unproductive.

My group has a task and it's up to myself and a few others including him to handle the deliverable and send it off.

I created a deadline for last week and split the work up appropriately. 

However, this fuck has done *absolutely nothing* and has been putting his time elsewhere. I have pressed him on getting it done repeatedly and he's replied with false promises that he'll work on it and that he's just had to leave the office early due to ""personal issues"" that he doesn't expand on.

I decided to do his work myself this morning and send it off after his final promise that he would complete it last night was broken.

I am very heated over this and my first thought is that I should fire him and find a reliable replacement immediately after being jerked around and giving him plenty of chances.

However, the other (kind, caring) side of my brain imagines a world where we can resolve these differences and he'll start to put in the quality and volume that we saw from him in the first few months.

I've tried talking to him, but he clearly doesn't want to discuss what has been taking up his personal time. His role is very competitive with great pay but long hours and we'd find a replacement immediately.

1anlcec,Advice for finance grad CV,"So I am 23 right now, graduating oncoming summer and currently updating my CV a bit, but I would say mine is rather different than most fellow students and idk how to structure my CV accordingly. 

I did a bachelor business administration and now a master in finance. I study at Erasmus (Rotterdam-Netherlands) which is rather well recognized internationally I believe.

My GPA is utter shit though. I absolutely hate studying ever since high school and barely put in any hours at all. I received a lot of criticism along the way from teachers/ professors but I figured I just want to pass and get a degree. 

Instead I worked a lot during my studies. During my bachelor I started working as a business developer for 40+ hours a week. I gained a lot of sales experience during high school and used this as a business developer for an IT firm. I spent my time mostly doing cold acquisition, constantly talking to c-level management (including large MNC affiliates). I did this for about 3 years. 

I wanted to do something more finance related and now work at a small M&A firm. Its 6 employees so really small, but I get a lot of responsibility. I do both company valuations (DCF-method) of companies <1M in revenue, and I try to find potential buyers for companies of any size. I do this for 32 hours a week since my master takes up more time. 

Anyways, Ideally I want to work in M&A, sales&trading, or some other partially comercial / part finance role. I’m actually quite flexible as long as salaries (especially bonuses) are good and it is a large firm, and there is a high pressure work environment. I don’t want it to be a 9 to 5 job or solely cracking numbers all day. 

Anyways, I feel like a lot of the large corporates/banks etc with such an environment want people whom graduated cum laude etc. Is there a way I can structure my CV so that I kind of put more emphasis on my work experience? 

Do I put for example in the hours a week I spent on side jobs or is this not smart. I sometimes feel kind of like an idiot spending so much time on work rather than studying. 

Should I put in a short motivation explaining this at the beginning for example?

1ankm0g,Dedicating your off time to developing new skills is better than working overtime at your current job or picking up a second job.,"This is assuming you are financially stable of course. If you need the extra money to literally live, then of course get the money now. But if you are trying to get ahead it's generally a better idea to invest your time in new skills that will lead to better opportunities in the future. Bonus points: if you earn money while gaining those skills. Doing this will have better longevity for your health and will less likely lead you to burn out. Maybe it's working on night classes, getting a new certificate, becoming bilingual, or maybe it is working overtime and learning more about your trade (bonus points).

1ankjv2,How do I apply for internships by messaging the Hiring Managers directly?,"Hello Community,

I am a Grad student currently looking for Summer Internships but I feel stuck and unmotivated. I have applied to over 150 internships but have not heard back anything from even the ones I had applied to back in September 2023. Recently I am getting rejection mails from some companies but the problem is while applying to these companies, I was pretty damn sure to get atleast an interview but clearly, that is not happening.

On this subreddit, I read a lot about messaging the Hiring Managers on LinkedIn but I am a bit confused as to how? The InMail messaging is restricted to just 5 per month on Premium as well. I do sent connection requests with a Note in them but for most of them they just accept the request but never really reply back. What am I supposed to do, I have no clue and at this stage I am genuinely desperate for an internship.

If anyone has any suggestions, related posts, articles, websites or anything in general that can be useful, please let me know.

1anjgw8,How to tactfully communicate my career change,"I’m currently working full time and going to school part time to make a career change. My ideal scenario would be to transfer departments within my company once I finish my degree (if there are any openings at that time; otherwise I will apply to other companies). However, I can’t afford to put my current job in any kind of jeopardy, so I’ve only told the manager of my desired department about my schooling so he can keep me in mind for opportunities.

I’ve told my current manager about my interest in this new area, but I haven’t told him how serious I am about making the switch. He is supportive of my growth and interests, but if I tell him about my schooling, all my cards will be on the table. I don’t want to be seen as less committed to my current job, and I don’t want to be the first person someone thinks of if we have layoffs.

At some point, though, I do expect the topic of my schooling will come up, especially if there is an opportunity to apply to my desired department. I will also need to update my LinkedIn once I start applying for jobs. I’m just not sure how to approach this conversation with my manager when it inevitably arises.

1aniwlm,Extremely underpaid,"I work as a network engineer/network provisioning engineer and I marked 2 full years this January 2024. I got moved to this department from my previous design team when the team got laid off during covid, where it was nowhere as technical as my current role. I could state several hypothesis why, but some people got laid off from the team then, some moved to the engineering department directly. There was no salary re-negotiation when I started in the design team, nor the move to the network engineering department.

It took me an insane learning curve to become an ""engineer"", through self studying and training on the job. I keep telling myself why I didn't have a good enough case to fight for salary renegotiation back then when I first started 2 years ago, as I was nobody and couldn't call myself and engineer. But now after it's been 2 full years, especially the whole 2023, my performance has been to the extreme. I got certified, my manager constantly is throwing the escalation on me as if I am the most qualified and expert engineer in our team, I take over calls or task work from colleagues ""that cannot do it"" or do it too slow, colleagues shadowing me, other engineering teams contacting me to help them with equipment configs, manage task queue while my manager is out of office. I am appalled by my own achievements for the past 2 years, especially the past 1. I become a ""network engineer"" from scratch. I don't even have a technical education, and I don't want it to sound so rude but it seems like I surpassed my colleagues knowledge and expertise that have been in this career for 8-10+ years. 

I've told my manager about how I am extremely underpaid last year, he was surprised to say the least. He said he will be looking to increase my salary to match ""those of the more junior"" members across the department. I reminded him again this year before the fiscal ""corporate end of year"" in April, and from my understanding they didn't even submit any sort of a business case to explain my situation, so I have the opportunity to fight my case. Idk what to do anymore. I mean I know the option is leaving. Silly enough, applying on LinkedIn and networking with people in my field and recruiters is now my part time job. So far I have not had so much luck, and the job market seems to be very tough especially now.

1aniicp,Needs some advice,"I was laid off my from a full time role as a program manager in September 2023. I knew it was coming so I had been interviewing prior. Due to the labor market being how it is, I decided to look for contracting roles as I really need healthcare. I have 6 years experience in cross-functional program management directly in multiple business teams ranging from marketing, HR, product and tech. I took a role in October 2023 as a program manager working on managing customer experience programs. This is my first time as a contractor. I will cut to the chase: no training, my manager has never been a manager (for example when I prepared a 1:1 agenda parsing our time on what is currently going on and the other half about strategic issues - she was absolutely confused), the whole team is new, and there is little documentation on anything. The company is disorganized, a lot of the employees have been there for more than 5 years and deliver sub par work. 

As a contractor - I was asked to lead really complex and messy programs and projects. Really messy. I put in the hours to figure it out. I now get that they will always give me the messy and complicated work because I am the contractor and I can be the punching bag. It’s high stress and with my medical condition - this doesn’t fair well as I am starting to get flares. Currently, most of my time is spent reviewing flows and specs and finding errors, finding holes, finding copy issues, data munging and tailing people for solutions ( I am brought into messy programs that were not scoped properly) but timelines remain the same despite my call outs. 

I got a inquiry from a temp agency to work at Apple. I am still in the interviewing process so it’s up in the air. It would be the same pay but hybrid. I am currently completely remote in my current position where I start working at 530am and end around 5 or 6pm and I work every other weekend. 

Should I consider a hybrid contract role where my commute will be an hour one way? I am not assuming I will ever convert to full time employment at Apple. I am realistic. What I do want is a better work experience (hours will always be long but want accountability from teams) and learning opportunity to eventually get a full time role elsewhere. 

As for the currently company - they discussed that their “intent” is to hiring me as full time. I don’t trust that until I see numbers. There was only one discussion on this and I am skeptical. I believe they are waiting for me to pull a miracle - which I can do but the hours are really weighing me down. Once I pull these miracles, I will be setting the expectation that I can always do this. I have brought all the above issues up to my manager and the response was “hold them more accountable”.

1anigfv,How can I explain this while job hunting?,"I was an executive for a few years in a small but very political non profit and got terminated without cause by the board. Long story short, one board member was very difficult with me and it slowly affected the culture amongst the board. A few months in after a new and inexperienced Chair of the board got elected, I was out. My termination was done very swiftly and unfairly. I could not say goodbye to my team or colleagues and had to leave immediately. 

During my tenure, I worked hard recruiting the whole new team during the pandemic - the old team pretty much all quitted a few weeks after I was appointed. Despite the sector we worked in being stalled in terms of growth, I always attained all financial objectives or surpassed them with the team and volunteers. I implemented strategies that doubled some revenue streams and that will continue doing so in the long run. The team I recruited is still in place and is doing a great job despite the difficult context. 

I am still slowly healing from how this experience ended, because I also moved to another city with my family to take on that role…

That said, I’m also trying to build a narrative for future recruiters / work applications that would make sense and in which I feel comfortable. I’m a frank person and I tend to tell too much when not well prepared. Please note that I am considering switching sectors while staying in non profits.

1anhtfk,When to stop job hopping,"So I've been job hopping for most of my career(~10 years), almost never stayed somewhere for more than 2 years. Usually because of life events making sense for me to do a big move to another location. 

It's always been beneficial for me. I started in a call center and now work as a Salesforce administrator with a niche specialization.

I've only been at my current company for 9 months and I really like the people I work with, and I get constant recognition for doing a good job. I think I could move up the corporate ladder here pretty quickly if I stayed. 

I think I could be making at least 20-50% more. They underpay most roles in the company. I also already make only 5k less than someone who's been there longer in a higher management role, so it feels unlikely I'd get a significant raise any time soon.

It's also an hour long commute and I only get to WFH 1-2 days a week. They told me upon hiring that they have planned to open a location closer to me in the next year but later found out they've been saying this for about 4 years and it hasn't happened.

Because of the niche specialization I get recruiters on LinkedIn reaching out to me weekly, sometimes for short-term positions paying 3x more than what I'm making now + fully remote but some longer term roles and they don't really give me the salary up front and I'm bad at negotiating.

I don't usually have a hard time finding work. I am worried though because I hear everyone saying the job market is terrible right now. I don't want to switch jobs especially to a short term contract job and then be unemployed for 6 months or something. 

I also worry that at some point my chaotic work history might come back to bite me. I don't really know anyone else who has experience with job hopping so I figured I'd ask here what people think.

Should I give up relative stability and a positive work environment for more money and WFH?

1anhpyz,Will work for the devil if it pays,"I’m mid-30s, and I’ve done pretty well in life for assets and retirement savings…but I’m in a weird place where I’m still early enough career that I have no idea where I’m going and my skills aren’t niche or developed enough to pay. 

I honestly do not care about my job. Any job. I will trade ~8 hours a day for as much money as I can make, prefer remote-only and sitting down, and I pretty much don’t care what the job is as long as it’s legal and doesn’t involve working directly with booze/dr::gs. 

I can take a bootcamp-style program or a year of education and I absolutely *love* school….but I just don’t have the time to sustain a master’s degree. I thrive in every single area of my life when learning. I could even drop out of life and do a program full time if needed. 

Current job: operations specialist in banking, $74k. Essentially I use a bunch of proprietary systems to fix their f::ck ups in large data sets and then document the sh::t out of it. 

Previous job: finance ops in tech, $61k and hella underpaid. I was *so* good at this and had a ton of responsibility for project lifecycles at the company. Not a PM, but worked closely with project teams to make sure financial and system data matched. 

Also had 10 years in the adult entertainment industry (my favorite career so far!) and currently have a side hustle managing a horse farm. Neither of these are relevant to work I want to pursue, except for soft skills. I have a bachelor’s in biology that was fun to get and is great for checking that “yes, has a degree” box on applications. 

Goal: I’d be thrilled to clear $80-90k next year and $100-110k in the next few years. I don’t need to shoot for the moon. I just want a weekend vacation once in awhile and the good tortilla chips lol.

I love data, numbers, finance, project planning, and staying in my little corner by myself. I dislike creative/artistic work, labor, and being self-employed.

1anhnts,Worried about referral,"I worked with someone 2 years ago for ~7 months. We were on seperate sales teams but he was a consistent performer, always at the top of activity boards and was really good on the phones (we were entry level). 

I ended up moving on and taking a dream job at an incredible company. This isn't a startup so for me and a lot of the people I've worked with in my career - this is TOTALLY different. This was admittedly pretty easy for me as I'm a boring old soul at heart so meshing with a bunch of older folks is no problem. 

They ended up building an SDR team here and I referred this guy as I know he's good - I'm no longer in that role but I do interact with his bosses quite a bit.

What I didn't realize is how immature he is. He's been smoking cigarettes in front of the building, not going out of his way to shake hands and meet people, etc. He's also been unemployed for quite some time and after having a conversation with him the truth came out that he sort of just took this job because he needed one... This is the kind of company that likes to retain people long term and values employees who care a lot.

I'm going to call him out on the cigarette thing - no offense to smokers but for this office in particular that would come across incredibly unprofessional. He's got to at least make some effort to hide it. I might be overreacting but I'm really nervous as this guy is going to look poorly on me. I'm taking comfort in the fact that they ultimately decided to hire him and they liked his personality and background.

Hopefully I'm not coming off as a complete tool right now. If he was working remotely I would not be worried at all but he's going to be in my office 3 days a week and I don't think he realizes the culture here - despite how much I've warned him. Truth be told, this is a pretty judgemental industry and the idea that this guy is walking around introducing himself to folks as my friend has me a bit uneasy.

1anhmrw,Biology undergrad → BME?,"Hey all, I'm not in school currently but am looking to go back, plan on going pretty far if everything works out, and I have a variety of interests. I know for a fact I'll be pursing education + career in STEM, and I'm think I'm pretty set on Biology. That being said, I've recently looked into BME as an academic discipline and a STEM field, and I must say, I am intrigued. I love biology because I love to learn about scientific principles regarding living organisms, biological processes, cells and organisms, etc.

But the idea of acquiring knowledge and skills that can be used to design and develop new inventions sounds awesome to me. Applying skills to develop something tangible also attracts me, which can be somewhat limited when coming from Bio, as far as I know. Whether I decide to study Bio or BME, I know for a fact I'll be looking to apply my knowledge to healthcare, and I think both are perfectly fine for that interest.

So my question is, would it be possible to get the both of best worlds and do my undergrad in Bio and possibly get into a MS or even doctoral BME program? What would be the difference between an individual who did both their undergrad and grad in BME and someone who might do what I'm proposing to do?

1anhf3a,What non-academic job can you do with a PhD in archeology?,"I live in the UK. I am getting married this autumn. My fiancé is finishing the corrections of his PhD in archeology. At the same time he is also working in the concierge of a hotel just to pay the bills. 

I have studied copywriting for years and plan to start out very soon as a freelance copywriter. My soon-to-be husband is not sure he wants to stay in academia after his PhD because we want to have children at some point and buy a house. The problem with post docs is that they force you to constantly move from city to city every few years, and that is not how we would like to raise our children. The pay is also not great compared to other professions. 

One idea was that we should start my copywriting freelance business together. The downside of that is that I am just starting out and I am not sure I will have enough clients to support myself, let alone two people. I hear from other freelance copywriters who work with their spouse that they brought their husband/wife in when they were two years into the game, and so well-established that they had too much work to handle. That is not my current situation. 

My husband’s fundamental issue is that he has always worked in academia (he comes from a whole family of academics) and never explored anything outside of it. He does not necessarily want to stay in academia, but he does not know what his other options could be.

1anguei,Seeking Guidance on Career Progression: Handling Unexpected Setbacks and Balancing Personal Goals with Company Expectations,"After 2 years of working in business development in an SME, where my responsibilities increased every 6 months with no variation in salary, I (29F) moved to a larger SME, with an increase in responsibilities, an intensive work schedule, +50% increase in salary and reporting to the Deputy Director. It seemed to be a turning point in my career.  
  
During the second month, I saw an opportunity to create a marketing department and took the initiative to set up a marketing working group with two other newcomers (33M and 34M) and the HR manager (33M) as a liaison with the board.  
  
Gradually, the other member of the group became disengaged. By the last term of last year, I was the last one standing with the support of HR. It was really discouraging at times, but I kept going.  
  
In January, the newcomer (33M), who I've identified over time as a social climber, arranged a meeting to give a new impetus to the marketing working group. I prepared a presentation. It showed what had been done in the past year, my vision for the project and my goals for the current year. I shared it with the other 2 newcomers to see if they wanted to add anything.  
  
The opportunistic newcomer told me to meet him to discuss the slides and his changes, while he bragged about how much work he had done on the marketing project. At the start of the meeting, the HR manager scolded my teammates for not working enought and praised my work. As I intuited, I was the only one making the effort. After the meeting, the HR manager came to talk to me and told me how brilliant my work was, adding that sometimes the brightest people have to cope with the greatest demands that I had to keep pushing because something is changing in the company. His responsibilities have grown over the past year and he would like someone else to act as coordinator of the marketing group to, I was his first choice.  
  
My boss - the Deputy Director - asked me to present the results of the presentation to him. He praised my work and said it was obvious that I was knowledgeable about the subject. But he said he wanted me to be more involved in developing the business and less involved in marketing. I told the HR manager.  
  
Since then, I have worked as the marketing coordinator, managing my colleagues, actively supervising the documents they produce and delegating my marketing tasks to focus on business development, as instructed by my boss.  
  
Yesterday we reviewed these documents in preparation for presenting this year's strategy to my boss for approval and then starting to implement it. During the meeting, the HR manager shared to the group he would like someone else to act as coordinator of the marketing group, now he pointed out to the opportunistic newcomer, sharing I was his first choice but my boss wants me to dedicate less time to the proyect. He will propose it to the board. I was devastated.  
  
When I was in my previous company, my goal was to manage people by the age of 30. Since I changed companies last year, I have decided to postpone it until I am 31. Not only had I misunderstood the situation, but all my efforts to grow in the company this past year were thrown away by my own boss's interests and served on a silver platter to the opportunistic newcomer. Currently, I don't see any other growth opportunities for me in this company.  
  
I will wait to hear the decision before making any decisions, but I would like to know which are my options.

1angc5i,"Influencer client stole my work, applied minor changes and is now ghosting me: how can I respond?","I recently worked with a very big influencer on editing videos for his brand launch. 

He said I have the editing gig, gave me timelines, gave me footage and his inspiration board. I took all of this into account and gave him three video variants for the first video. He downloaded them, not a day goes by and he posts what I thought was my video and I was expecting him to say thanks and send over the payment. 

I am not doing this job full-time first of all. I used to be a child actor turned influencer as well but quit because how fake and rude both the viewers and other influencers are. I am currently working a real job and every so often I edit videos for content creators I like, and do voiceover work for some other brands. So, I know how the industry functions. This is an influencer I genuinely liked up until this event. Now, I think he is rude. I am not happy with this situation. Though, at this stage I do not expect the payment, I expect a thank you. Especially because the final video he used and posted is 98% the same as my submission. Aside from minor changes there are no differences. 

In addition, yes maybe he used a second editor but he said I had the gig and it is not right to completely not acknowledge my work. He is in the US. I worked with him for this video at late night hours to adjust myself to his ""work time"". 

As I said, I work everyday from 7am to 5pm in a serious global organization. Me accepting a gig like this with my time constraints is already a huge concession. One damn thank you would suffice. My question is, how can I professionally say all of these in an email to him?

1anezce,"Is it normal for your boss to have a very base level understanding of your work, so they give you minimum guidance?","I have about 3 years of experience in my field of work, as well as a masters degree. I recently got a new job 3 months ago in the same field but different industry and have been the most confused as I have ever been in my career. At my last job, although I had knowledgable leaders, they did not have the structure in place for me to continue growing in my field of work. They lacked a defined strategy, and did things in a way that did not have frameworks in place so that is all that I had access to learning. They did not go about things the way that the industry does, a lot of it was home grown with a lack of strategy behind it. 

Now I am at my new job and constantly feel like I’m confused. My new manager, now that I am in the role, is open to saying she doesn’t know my field of work and has to ask her boss for guidance on my work. I’m placed in projects, and she is expecting me to know exactly how to go about progressing through the projects. I have ideas, but she asks questions back to me, never giving me an answer and causes me to feel like I have no direction but all of these different ideas on how to complete something. My anxiety is at an all time high and confidence is low because I was looking for a new role that allowed me to get experience in creating strategy (hoping to learn industry standard frameworks) but my manager doesn’t give me any solidified guidance. It’s like the more I asked questions the more my experience level is being exposed. If I am supposed to know the exact answer to how I should conduct my work, I feel that that should be a manager level, which is what I am not. I am at a specialist level and the only one in my field of work at this company.

I feel that i might have been put at disadvantage at my last job, because they gave me, im assuming “entry level” work my entire career in the field so I don’t know the exact way to execute on things, I just have ideas. I think that because they are expecting me to know things, that I do not. 

Has anyone experienced this? How do I get experience in creating strategy, or just a higher level of work, without being in the role or at a company who doesn’t have it in place? Is there a medium, where I can learn about it, be apart of creating it and also get directed guidance from my manager?

1anctqa,"Made a mistake, not sure what's gonna happen","I've been working for a company for about 10 months or so, things have been going pretty well.  
Boss seems to like me, bosses boss does as well.  
They've been giving me more work and putting me on more and more projects.  
I work as a Technical Program Manager for a relatively small IT company.  
I oversee file transfer infrastructure systems for major enterprise partnerships for this firm.  
I made my first major mistake last night, by just making a really poor decision - despite being told to do otherwise by my boss.  
We had a bit of discrepancy on some of the files we issued over for a major client. My boss and I had a brief call to discuss what should be done, they told me what we needed to do - who needed to be on point to help, but I decided that I was going to try and take initiative and try to mitigate the issue myself - since the point of contact that's been instructed to help on this is very much overwhelmed and might take some time to get the problem resolved. I thought it'd make things go a little smoother if I just fix the problem at hand.  
Well, it all came back to haunt me less than 24 hours later. The client responded to some file transfers, reiterating that problem was NOT resolved.  
Turns out, the fix needed for specific files is more complicated than I originally imagined which is why my boss told me to utilize a specific contact. Lesson learned there.  
My boss was made aware and we had a discussion where I immediately took responsibility and explained my rationale behind my decision. This ""initiative"" I took unfortunately created more work for my boss and ultimately broke the trust that we had already established.  
I reiterated that I was incredibly sorry for trying to take matters into my own hands and that it wouldn't happen again.  
They seemed to be receptive to it, but my anxiety/paranoia seem to be getting the best of me here.  
Rightfully so, I still feel pretty awful about it and will probably feel this way for the remainder of the weekend.  
Without knowing much else, I guess I'm just looking to see if I've created a dynamic of distrust that can't be rebuilt by making a poor judgement call.

1anbsgt,Advice for freshie,"Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out here to ask for some tips and guidance regarding a challenge I'm facing. I recently graduated with a degree in mathematics and have just started working as a protege in the audit team. I chose audit because I believe it offers a great opportunity to learn about business operations, especially since my degree is quite technical (focused mainly on problem-solving).

To cut to the chase, last week, my boss gave me some feedback. He mentioned that while I'm good at my job, I lack a clear goal for my career path. He suggested that I should engage with the staff to explore different areas covered in audit and find out what path might suit me best.
However, I'm hesitant to ask questions because I'm afraid the staff might be busy or uninterested in answering questions from someone like me who's new to the field. I also struggle with knowing what questions are appropriate to ask.

Could anyone with experience offer some advice on how to start conversations, approach colleagues, and ensure that my questions are relevant? I really need some guidance on this.

And for someone who has a broad degree like me, how do i really determine what I want to pursue. I feel like Im good with any path. But somehow that limit me from really doing what I love to do.

1anb30w,Did my boss silently demote me?,"Tldr - gets hired, works hard with management to get ""senior title"" promotion. Company bought out by larger company. Manager says new company still assessing my job and salary since ""isn't 1:1 situation"" even tho definitely look that way. Can see coworkers titled the same as me. Manager says they will fix it. They ""fix it"" by giving me a raise. Coworkers got same raise. Start to believe manager is lying. Program is introduced to make titles simplified based on salary. Based on mine I do not have ""senior"" title. Ask director, seems like manager was lying. Being told there is now meeting with HR to fix. 

Long version:

I cleared a promotion with my manager at smaller company. Submitted outline for my current work and additional responsibilities. Did the damn thing. Got the promotion. Company is bought a year later. Lots of paperwork and meetings about new company. New company pays a lot more and we're told that in a year we will all be paid x amount of money. All doing the same exact work. Just nested within larger department. After first year passes with another excellent performance review I ask manager why my title is the same as coworkers. Have they also been promoted? ""Nope. We are still figuring out your title. Don't worry. That will be fixed next year. Things are shaky with new company. Let's keep our heads low until we get it situated."" Meanwhile we are all told ""Your personal title can be whatever you think makes sense. We know things are weird with merger and long corporate titles"" so personal title is still ""senior"" We bounce around in different divisions and areas because we work on smaller company still. Big company isn't sure what makes sense for team.

Next year. Excellent performance review. Told title and pay is now ""fixed"". Title and pay is still same as coworkers. Get email from HR at the end of the year that I was ""assessed as being underpaid for title"" I check with coworkers, they did not get that email. They were already being paid correctly. They are titled the same as me again turns out. So not only does it seem I am not being recognized for my prior promotion while doing all the additional work, but I'm now being paid less than coworkers.

Director hosts department meeting outlining new program to simplify titles and band levels. I see clearly now with management my band does not reflect ""senior"" title. Which also means senior pay. Start to really get fed up at this point. Wait two months for performance review. Flying colors yet again. No mention of title adjustments. Email is sent out telling everyone to now align current title to band. This would mean I would need to take ""senior"" off. 

Confused and frustrated I email director. ""I want to meet about titles. I am confused because I was given promotion before merger. What does this mean for my current situation?""

Director(who is only been at job a year) joins call DISTRAUGHT having looked at the situation for only a day and my single short email asking to talk about titles. He is frantically going over what he calls a ""series of subpar"" raises and band levels. Profusely apologizes that he didn't even know to look into this. Seems topic has never been covered with manager. Asks series of questions about how this came about. Agrees that there was a situation with merger but that it should have been resolved over a year ago. I ask is my job different than your other ""senior"" titles? Director says, its true that there is no way to talk about duties 1:1 because my job requires more skills. Should be valued more than his other ""senior"" titles.

Based on everything that was said in my meeting with director and evidence, I'm very sure that my manager was going to continue gaslighting me into thinking I was being paid correctly. I can't dream up any situations in which my manager wasn't negligent or malicious. He was the person who gave me the promotion. Did he magically forget when we merged? Was he supposed to inform someone and didn't? What the hell happened? Why would he talk me up, give me a promotion, 3 years of amazing reviews- only to sit back and watch my title be taken away?

He told me multiple times this mix up was all due to merger and he was working on it. Was told department only had x budget and he was doing his best to get me higher pay. Director echoed that low budget for our team was correct, but not information about my title. Director says there should have been steps taken by ""someone"" to fix situation. Director says, ""May have been a mix up in HR or some confusion. What did manager say exactly?"" I let him know I was just told multiple times it was due to larger company discussions. They hadn't sorted me yet. He nods silently and asks if it's okay if manager is included in HR call to adjust title and title update will happen in 2 weeks or less. I responded, ""Of course manager can join. I have just been told x for two years and I believed it. He's never been a bad boss. He just apparently can't advocate for his team I guess."" Director apologized again for not knowing about my situation sooner. Says he never meant for new titles to screw me over and even so, this should have been adjusted before. 

Do corporations ever do back pay in situations like this? Do I need to directly ask my manager wtf happened? Do I need to point out I've been doing the work for two years, being paid less, meanwhile my manager was paid two band levels higher than me the entire time? It feels like intentional neglect. But things have always been peachy with boss. Feels so shitty to think I was gaslit to be quiet and trust my manager to figure things out when I could have just talked to my director.

1anaud4,One of our best managers gets BURNED by salty staff???,"What to do? 

We have a fantastic branch manager. I have worked with teams in 4 different continents, in various industries and roles and companies.

 Currently working in a large corporation but a small branch. We have an older yet EXTREMELY wise branch manager. He moved to our city just to revamp the branch. I am more out on the field so I don't spend much time at the office but recently found out that a group of about 4 people whom I respected maliciously conspired to BURN him on the management surveys. They literally gave him the worst scores on purpose to burn him off his manager bonus. Now this ails me as the man is so so so so kind. I have worked with him for years, even before he moved to this branch, and I gave him the highest scores possible on this surveys and previous ones. He has an impeccable track record with the company. 

He is the type of man to always ask about your family, gift the employees TVs and floor cleaning robots if he has extra budget, if you ask him for something, he will drop whatever he is doing to help you out. Our branch was a 💩hole, and he cleaned it up so well. Remodeled it, put pictures of us everywhere. It feels amazing to work there now. 

It pisses me off that people are so hypocritical that they gave him bad scores. There is about 12 of us at the branch and it's a little group of about 4 people who are all conspiring against him. I never knew this until today. As I said, I'm always out on the field, so I'm often not involved in the day to day drama and I feel so blind sighted. I cannot believe I'm working with people like this. Straight up liars and malicious people. They betrayed this great man. I can speak of his work ethic because I worked with him in a different branch before this and I know his character. The others (the good team) at the branch are also upset but not shocked as apparently this little gang of coniving peeps have been this way forever. They want to get to ""top branch manager"" and boot him off,  and are doing everything they can to get this decent, sweet, upright, nice older man close to retirement out of there at whatever cost. It's making me furious as he is really the most stand up guy. The type of man I wish I had as a father. I cannot believe they are doing this. 
 I see them hug him and bring him coffee and talk his praises every day, but now the manager surveys show that his staff betrayed him.

Now,  I have a field day with one of the malicious gang members. You could say their leader. Should I bring it up to him? Be like ""How could you do this? Did you really do this?"" Or keep my mouth shut for the sake of politics? 

I'm just so upset. I want people to respect me but at the same time, I can't afford to have 4 people against me. So far, because I'm always out on the field, my role has been neutral and everyone likes me. But I feel like I need to speak up for what is wrong.

Right now, I'm thinking to join a company/agency as a Digital Marketing Assistant/Manager or an eCommerce Specialist.

I'd be lying if I say that it's not for money, yeah it is. But sometimes as a Solopreneur you get too overwhelmed, wearing multiple hats to manage everything on your own. And human/social interaction with people is almost zero. You become lazy and drag things as you have no one to answer to.

I have knowledge and experience of eCommerce, I'm great at Canva, and I know how to make money online. But now, I want to try something new and see how things work in the corporate World and how teams work in a structured environment. Financial stability would be a plus point as well.

Skills: Digital Marketing, eCommerce, Canva, WordPress, Blogging, an eye for design/detail, and I'm really good at learning new tools and technologies.

1an8z5w,Potential Employer Asking Current Salary But Not Disclosing Theirs,"I've been with my current company almost 7 years.  I submitted my resume to a place where I have a connection (I applied to a listing on the company site), got a request for a phone screening with HR.  On the call she asked me my current salary; I was totally caught off guard as I've never been asked this before so I told her truthfully (it's a low salary, part of my reason for leaving).  The call went on, it was kind of a soft-interview.  Towards the end I asked what compensation range they were offering, which I thought was safe since she asked me my salary.  She told me it's something that has to be determined by the hiring manager.  I then did a video interview which went very well (no mention of offering salary) and got invited for an in-person interview, which I have next week.  The company is very professional, they gave me benefits brochures and all other information.

Is them withholding the compensation range a red flag here?  I've never experienced a company not disclosing it by this point, I even had another phone screening with another company and they told me right off the bat.

1an8luv,Am I missing anything to consider for this job offer?,"Apologies for the wall of text.  
I'm looking for some advice on a potential job offer. Company A offered me a position that pays \~5k more than I currently make (only \~5% salary increase) so the base salary increase alone isn't enough to warrant a job switch. However, I would be saving over $300/month in health insurance premiums at the new job (wife is SAHM and my current job family premiums are astronomical) and the new job also offers much better insurance/benefits across the bard. I ran the numbers and my monthly take home would be about $500 more at the new job when I consider the small salary increase+cheaper health insurance premiums. I usually see people just compare base salaries apples to apples but I think the premium difference is definitely worth considering.  
I emailed the hiring manager and countered with a small salary bump as that would make my decision to accept the offer much easier. She responded telling me she's concerned because it would likely take a while to approve the salary increase (state government) and she would really like for me to start by February 28th. She did tell me I would be receiving a 3% raise in June and another 3% raise in July which would actually bring my salary slightly over my counteroffer within the next 6 months. I know I'd receiving a 3% CoL raise at my current job so one of those raises is a wash. Also, these raises would be there whether they approve the salary increase or not so I wouldn't be getting anything extra by accepting the original offer. Should I even be considering these future raises in my decision or should I continue to push for my proposed counteroffer?  
I know I need to ultimately make the best decision for myself and family but just looking for some guidance/advice for things to consider when switching jobs and what I might be missing. As far as the job functions I think it's a step up career wise with more upward mobility and I'd enjoy the work a little more. I just wish the base salary was a bit more. They also offer 3 days a week WFH vs the 2 days I'm getting now.  
My industry is IT by the way with around 7 years experience.",throwawayjob1845,1,1.0,0,1707541720,2024-02-10 05:08:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1an8luv/am_i_missing_anything_to_consider_for_this_job/,2,2024
1an7vpz,I'm a star engineer who is chronically passed up for opportunities,"My coworkers routinely tell me I'm the best engineer they've ever worked with, yet I'm constantly passed up for corporate leadership programs, promotions, and the like.

I asked my manager why that is and he said, ""you solve problems so far ahead of everyone else that no one ever knows why you are doing what you're doing, and by the time they figure it out, you're already long gone fixing the next thing.""

I'm torn. Do I need to slow it down and put out more immediate fires? The company already has an abundance of short-sighted fire fighters and I much prefer to get ahead of issues. Or perhaps I should find people who know how I work and ask them to advocate for me? I'm also considering seeking mentorship with some senior management to get my name out and share vision with them.

For what it's worth, I took a two year move out of engineering and into strategic initiatives two years ago. I was the only technical person on the team. I'm pretty sure I confused them and they basically ignored me the whole time but the programs we consulted with loved me. My management kept pushing initiatives that sounded great on paper but had no chance of working in practice and would unknowingly sink the programs. I would go in and problem solve them back to a working state, necessitating a number of compromises. This happened over and over to the point where my management told me either fall in line and implement as designed or get out of the way, so I went back to engineering.",Old_Tea687,1,0.6000000238418579,14,1707539290,2024-02-10 04:28:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1an7vpz/im_a_star_engineer_who_is_chronically_passed_up/,2,2024
1an69qq,I want to do work with female athletes doing hormone research/advising.,"Does a position like this even exist? And how should I make it exist?

I (24F) am looking to do sports endocrinology research and advising for female athletes of all ages. I want to be similar to a sports nutritionist, but for hormones. I would like to work with the menstrual cycle, menopause, pregnancy, etc., and advise athletes on training protocols based on research. The field is a blend of sports psychology, behavioral endocrinology, behavioral neuroscience, and human performance science. I am currently getting my Master's in Psychology and have a BS in Psychology, both with neuroscience specializations. I work in multiple labs in both the Psychology and Kinesiology department, doing work with hormones, biomechanics, and athletic performance testing.

I am not sure where to begin my career. Should I immediately get a PhD (do I have to)? Should I contact sports teams asking if they could use someone of my skillset? Should I get a more medical position, working with PTs or endocrinologists? I can't just go on Indeed and find what I am looking for.

1an2zib,Should I be a total a**hole and milk this situation for a raise or Take the Lateral Move ?,"
So here's the dumpster fire i am dealing with : 

I'm a hotshot consultant type of professional at a Fortune 500, but I've been stuck in a bureaucratic nightmare for over a year between 2 VPs who just can't seem to play together in the sand box.. My department is basically a team that assigns consultants to improve processes in different departments across the organization. The VP of my department and the manufacturing VP are locked in a Cold War, leaving me with all bark and no bite on projects.The VP of manufacturing basically thinks that my improvement projects will make him look bad and hence does not want me near his factory. 

Despite being a high performer with tons of  accolades , my ideas are gathering dust and i am unable to get anything done due to the bullshit politics at this place. Meanwhile my boss is well aware of my situation and acknowledges my frustration. I have told him many times that i want to move on to something else within the organization but he has urged me to stay on for another year. Me adandoning ship one year into my role makes him look bad as he is constantly trying to negotiate his way into creating space for me in the manufacturing VPs operation. I waited patiently for a year for this situation to be sorted but there is no end in sight. I feel super unwelcomed at the factory during my visits  and my anxiety for not getting shit down due to the politics is getting out of hand. My worry is that 2 years into this role i won't have anything to show for and that i can become an easy target if layoffs were to happen.

However, recently the allure of a lateral move offered by a senior leader in the organization in a completely different department has brought me at a crossroads.

Should I play hardball and ask for a raise to stay in order to put up with one more year of bullshit, or should I take the leap and risk burning bridges for greener pastures within the company ?

1an2km8,I have to correct a very senior engineer on the proper way to apply security markings to a document and I thought I handled it discretely but he made me feel like I was the idiot for correcting him. Was I wrong to correct him?,"So we have to apply security markings as a Department of Energy government contractor to all documents. These documents are mostly engineering related and I just took a new internal posting in Information Security where we are basically responsible at ensuring documents are properly marked for security reasons (among other duties this is a small part of our job). Well part of this job involves me seeing many documents and sometimes these documents are brought to me by other cognizant engineers. The document was not marked correctly and was missing the footer we require to be added to each page or at the bottom of the document. I should state this is not a PDF or a \*.DOC word file it was a Excel \*.XLSX file but the marking requirements are the same.  
  
Also the draft marking we have a subcontractor apply to these documents was not removed (the subcontractor cannot review documents so they send everything with a marking basically ""Treat as UCNI, Remove After Review"".  
  
So this person, someone I know made the mistake. I ended up sending out a email to the entire group that was reviewing the documents not calling anyone out in particular giving some basic instructions how to remove the draft marking and that they should add our required marking to the footer of each page if it meets a specific security classification.  
  
Later on that day I ask if I can speak to this person in my cubicle privately and just point out what the requirement is and he had all these excuses about. ""Well we don't mark Excel files that way"" ""Why would someone have to print out that file? It doesn't need the footer markings if it isn't going to be printed out"". I pointed out that our requirements say you have to apply the footer marking ""UNCLASSIFED CONTROLLED NUCLEAR INFORMATION"" if the document is marked by the reviewer as that type of document and that he had to remove the draft marking.  
  
Well this went back and forth and it was clear he was getting all in a huff and was almost offended that I would correct him. I mentioned I had not called him out to anyone but was simply trying to discretely correct him. Well things did not feel like they ended well and I ended up sending him a Teams message later on with the specific guidance reference. No response. Feel like I offended him and handled it the wrong way.  
  
should have I handled this differently? I feel like I was handling it pretty discretely. We do have the authority to request that employees have their marking authority removed if we see a pattern of behavior... but like I said this guy is like 30+ year career person not someone new on the block.",Diotima245,1,0.9900000095367432,5,1707523140,2024-02-09 23:59:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1an2km8/i_have_to_correct_a_very_senior_engineer_on_the/,2,2024

1an1vh2,Feel like I’ve had an awakening,"Hi,

I’m looking for some perspective. I’m 27 (M) and being completely honest I haven’t taken my career seriously to this point, I’ve worked entry level roles  consistently since graduating. Currently work within sales on a low basic salary, taking home on average around 1,900-2,000 a month through commission after deductions. 

Employment future with current workplace is unstable with redundancies and a takeover incoming. 

Last few days I’ve really processed where I currently find myself and feels what I’d imagine a mid-life crisis would just a bit early 😅. Feel like I need to wake up and focus on my career but I’ve got this awful feeling I’ve left things too late to make a success out of myself, see people around me, friends from school etc higher up the corporate pyramid (managerial etc) whilst I’m at the bottom with no one to blame but myself for lack of intention and desire.

Current situation:

- Living at home with parents.
- Single, no children from past relationships or financial dependants.
- In good physical shape.
- Drive and own a good car.
- 2:1 Sport related degree
- Have £11,000 saved toward a deposit
- Uncertain on what I want to do.

Admittedly I know a lot of people may find themselves in much worse positions but as 30 is approaching I’m just concerned that time is running out to generate a good income and I don’t want to be the ‘old’ guy working basic jobs.",Anon19171816,1,1.0,1,1707521196,2024-02-09 23:26:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1an1vh2/feel_like_ive_had_an_awakening/,2,2024
1an1tvj,3 years helping to build a company I loved working at... and now feel lost.,"So, I’ve been at a startup for 3 years. And was one of the first 5 employees in the company.  
Started in London (UK) and I really put my everything into trying to create something great as a service and product. And all our teams hardwork... worked, we now have multiple offices UK and US and over 100 people. So after spending 2 months training a team in the US I was offered a job out there.  
This took several month in getting Visa etc, but eventually I made it out here to do a role.  
In the meantime a new manager was hired in the US about 4 months ago. He’s a nice guy, who I was excited to work with, and a key thing he wanted to change up the structure of the LA team and progression paths.  
I was excited about this, in 3 years I had one bump up to a new role 2 years ago… I’d invented the job basically became the senior version of it. Of course now, that role was erased.  
SO I arranged a meeting with him, excited really wanting to progress, we’d gone over a new org chart and there was a role I thought I might be good for and would want to chat about.  
He offered me the role below that… which was basically my old job but now supervising the people I had previously been… training… and sudo supervising except for approving holidays etc.  
But it was a very uninspiring meeting, he kept saying “this isn’t an offer, just we’re thinking” “trying to consider if you might be good for it or if we try and hire from outside.” Now the only role below this one in the new Org was my original Job… that I invented 3 years ago.  
Then the next day I get told one of the folks I trained was offered the role I had applied interest for.  
I was obviously feeling quite down after this, I wasn’t apparently good enough for this, I’m I’m feeling zero confidence from this manager in me. So chatted with my boss from the UK team who brought me onboard this… And our talk went really great, he tried to reassure me and was confused what caused me to feel this way, I loved the company so much I moved 6000 miles to keep working there.  
SO, my Boss chats the the manager (who reports to him) and I’m feeling better, maybe this was just a breakdown in language.  
The next call goes just as sour for me. “BOSS says you would be good for this role… now I don’t even know if the role will happen, and I am a stakeholder in this so I need to make sure whoever we get is going to be able to do the job. And I’m not sure the CEOs will even approve the job, but maybe if they do.” I had said a few other things that came up in my Convo with BOSS, with more of my innovation stuff I was doing in London, I know more about a lot of the stuff than anyone in the LA team cos I help invent stuff. However this was met with “I’m not sure if we’d be able to fit that in around this role, and obviously we need someone with the right skillset”, he said he’d chat to HR about me potentially doing the job though to see if it’s something that would even get a greenlight.  
SO a week and a half goes by and I hear nothing… And a call comes up… so now we want person X we promoted to take a bunch of the other people that I’d trained several months back and work with him to see if “one of them could be the same level as me and work in parralel as a peer”.  
So now there’s me… nearly 40, been here 3 years, helped develop a lot of stuff and also with with 17-18 years industry experience and a group of fresh faced 23 year olds I trained, both surpassing me and being on par with me.  
I’m lost… It’s not that I have an ego, but I’m def feeling a bit under appreciate but more so. No-one here has any belief in me. Obviously I have a lot of perks from being in a company so early so I don’t want to leave, and I’ve been a massive cheerleader. I’ve never loved a job and a company as much as this one until a few weeks back, and now, in one change up I’m feeling like I don’t belong in a place I was a part of helping make, and loved so much I was excited to move 6000 miles and start a new life for.",section_33,2,1.0,0,1707521071,2024-02-09 23:24:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1an1tvj/3_years_helping_to_build_a_company_i_loved/,2,2024

I am aiming to be a software developer and don't have the discipline for self learning. 

My thought process for going for the bootcamp from UNCC is that its one of the best technology schools out there with a good reputation and that once I complete it, it's practically guaranteed I get a job and with the types of salaries out there for the taking, it should be easy to pay off the debt.

What do you guys suggest? Are there any other boot camps that might be as successful who also gives a good certification?",EliMurg,1,1.0,3,1707515851,2024-02-09 21:57:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1amzuf8/what_should_i_do_in_this_situation/,2,2024
1amzoeh,What would you do? (Career wise),"So I have an opportunity coming up in the near future (this fall) where I will be side by side running a newly established residential facility. I’ve been waiting in an opportunity like this for almost 6 years now but the opportunity has finally presented itself. The dilemma I have right now is that I also have an opportunity to elevate in my current position as a director, but it’s kind of a messy situation being that staff are leaving, the current director will be going out on maternity leave and things are changing by the day and no one is sure of the future of the program. As much as I would love the experience on my resume for the future, I’d hate to be in that situation with the uncertainty and being responsible for the state of the program without the support I know I’ll need.

1amzkkq,"I'm at an impasse. I've moved around multiple jobs across 3 industries. Really just want to settle on a career that a enjoy, pays well and doesn't require me to go back to uni. Please advise. Thank you","Please read below and suggest any jobs or careers you reckon I should pursue. Happy to provide more info/ answer questions. 

For context, I've just had a really terrible YER 9 months into the job. I've been struggling and stressed for the past 3 months. I work as a partner manager at a fintech company. Should I quit or tough it out?

I'm 30. I studied hotel management only because I wanted the opportunity to travel and utilise my language skills. However, the long/ unsociablehours and physical demanding roles were wearing me down.

At 25 I got a year's experience in wealth management in customer services. I was one of the best performers. However towards the end I started having issues with timekeeping. Looking back at it, I was starting to get into a depression.

Pros: 
- Great pay
- Opertunity for progression
- I discovered I had a knack for sales.
- Savings and investments interest I work in client management for a fintech company.

Cons:
- The other side of the business was mortgages.. which I didn't enjoy.
- Call centre vibes (constantly being on the phone and time managed, even when you went to the loo)

At 26, I had one more crack at hospitality management. It didn't last long. Mainly because of the pandemic but I also didn't enjoy it. Wasn't really mentally challenging and I realised that I know longer wanted to manage people. Discovered I'm more introverted than I thought 

Just before I turned 27, I ventured into the world of tech sales. The first job was a first level 1 sales role. I Excelled at this and even go promoted in 6 months. Even at level 2, I became the best performer. However, 2 months later I decided to relocate for bigger opertunities.

Pros:
- Great, patient training provided
- I really understood my role and took pride in my job.
- Didn't necessarily have to work really hard

Cons: 
- Low pay
- I couldn't continue this role if I wanted to leave the country.
- Progression wasn't worth it. More work for poor salary.

At 28, I joined another tech company, in sales. Actually in the same industry as the last job. 

Pros:
- Double my salary from previous job.
- Initially enjoyed the office atmosphere
- I felt challenged and was learning a lot.

Con:
- Quickly became a toxic environment. Very results driven (proper sales job).
- Company was a start up. So the place was a revolving door. Particularly in sales
- CEO started micromanaging the entire company.
- No proper training provided. 

I did a personality assessment.

My strengths: Sociable, adaptable, disciplined
Weaknesses: Technology, Excel, 
Interests: Events, Tourism, wealth management, Business in general, tech

Any advice and suggestions are welcome.

Thank you.",Nzau79,1,1.0,4,1707515134,2024-02-09 21:45:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1amzkkq/im_at_an_impasse_ive_moved_around_multiple_jobs/,2,2024
1amzg4x,"Should I put my two weeks notice, even though I just started this job?","I originally posted on r/careerguidance, but I am unsure which subreddit is a more appropriate page to post. 

I’m (20NB) going to keep it vague because I don’t want to be recognized by anyone.
I was working at a place in 2023 that was pretty comfortable. Due to my employers health I was laid off, and quickly applied for any job that could take me. With some connections I was able to get hired very quickly at a store like CVS/Riteaid. Now, it’s been a month and a job I’ve previously applied for has reached out to me and the interview went really well. This new job is in my career field, a field I’m incredibly comfortable and happy in, and the customers are easier as well. Logically, it just makes sense to chose this new job, but I guess I’ve developed guilt for joining cvs then wanting to leave so soon, I’m worried that will impact my work background, and I feel guilty because this friend did help me get hired.

1amy0iu,Should I switch jobs after only a few months,"So the situation is as follows: I left my former employer around 4 months ago due to the fact that the only work they had for me required extensive travel. Overall I liked the position and I liked my coworkers but the traveling was just too much. When I left the position I took a roughly 15k pay cut to come to my current position. Well yesterday I received a call from my former boss and we were chatting and he mentioned that they could get me on in a fully remote role if I wanted to come back to that company. The only caveat is that the contract that I would be working on is up for rebid and I could theoretically not have a job after September. The likelihood of that is minimal, but there is still that chance. I told him that I wasn’t sure I wanted to leave a job after only 4 months and I had to think about it. He also informed me that if I came back they could offer me a 10k pay bump over my previous salary (a 25k bump on my current jobs salary).

Now this job that I’m currently in requires me be in the office, but they don’t really let me do much of anything. It’s an IT position in which they are trying to slowly ease me into, but I’ve got 6 years of experience in the field and am fully capable of all of the tasks they’ve shown me that they do. Thus I’m left feeling quite bored most days and honestly more exhausted than I’ve ever felt before even though I’m not actually working a large percentage of the time. Most of the time when I am allowed to do something someone just watches over my shoulder to ensure that I am doing it correctly. According to my manager, I should be given more responsibility towards the end of May. Now outside of my grievances about the work or rather lack there of, this company is more stable and I could ride out my entire career here making OK money but never great money. My former company is less stable but the pay is substantially higher. 

This brings me to my question, should I stay with my current company and just ride it out and hope that I finally get to do something or should I go back to my previous company that pays higher and gives me the ability to develop my skill set further by allowing me to actually do my job?",Throwawayx587474,1,1.0,2,1707511117,2024-02-09 20:38:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1amy0iu/should_i_switch_jobs_after_only_a_few_months/,2,2024

I went to college when I was 18 but didn’t finish my sophomore year. I’m smart but just let the struggles of my life stop me from finishing school. I’ve worked warehouse jobs and retail. My major in college as Communications with a focus in public relations. But I’m to a point in my life where I feel like I’m getting older and I want a career that’s gonna make good money and change my life for the better. I love reading and writing, always loved my liberal arts related classes, I never like stem classes but I am a good student and test taker. Im also a critical thinker, like I think about things deeply and if I don’t know about something I will do tons of research to learn about it. At first I wanted to be a lawyer but I don’t want to do 8 years of school so that’s why I thought of being a paralegal. Even though I’ve never been interested in Stem related careers there are some people in my family who are making a lot of money in the medical field. It’s not my passion and I always said I wouldn’t purse anything in that field. But after doing some research I saw how good those careers pay and I’m tired of struggling at dead end jobs. And I live in Atlanta where there are tons of hospitals. 

After researching I decided on C-Ray tech. I’m just scared about the schooling. I’ve never been a stem person. Like when I took chemistry and physics in high school I had to study hard to pass it. I’ve always been the liberal arts type of person and feel like I’m not smart enough to be in the medical field.

1amx4zk,Supervisor title but no responsibilities,"I was promoted to a co-supervisor position a couple years ago when I asked for a raise.

When a person needs another job she will call him even when he is busy even though I’m standing there and can do it too. The other supervisor does not include me and with holds information about where certain staff are or says he doesn’t know. The manager will update me on things but it’s almost an after thought, like she knows the boss wants me included but she doesn’t actually want me included. It didn’t bother me for quite some time but I’m to the point where it’s affecting my job performance because I don’t know where people are working or what they are doing. I have brought this to the attention of the boss a year ago, she wrote down exact descriptions of our jobs but nothing has changed. Part of my job is to create a list of tasks that need done, and the other supervisor is supposed to delegate those tasks. He loses my list, ignores it completely, or doesn’t acknowledge the jobs on the list. I feel uncomfortable bringing this issue up as I feel the manager will not be on my side.

1amwyfq,Ask questions throughout interview or only after?,"I was recently advised to ask questions throughout the interview, not just at the end.

Is this valid advice? In any interview I did, I was told the last few minutes would be for questions, so wouldn't asking them beforehand just be interrupting them when they want to move on with other questions?

1amwgnk,Imposter syndrome with boss,"I started a new job about 6 months ago, and I really like it. My biggest hang up is that my boss used to be in my position but was moved up to manager last summer, and I was hired as their replacement. My boss is very well respected in our company, they have been with the company for 5 years and promoted twice. When she got promoted, they hired myself and another person to cover all they were handling. I work for a large company with small regional offices and whenever someone hears I work at this office, they always make a comment about working with X and how lucky I am to have a boss who really knows the role and how great they are and stuff. 

I’m having trouble “filling her shoes”. I can’t believe she was doing this job essentially double, and the other person they hired as my counterpart feels the same way. It just seems like every time I feel like I’ve got a handle on things, I’ve missed something else. My boss is really understanding in “learning the job takes time” and always makes time to help me with questions or advice, but being 6 months in I can tell they’re getting tired of reminding me to do tasks. I just feel like I’m having trouble keeping up and can’t help but feel like I’m being compared to a rockstar.

I hope you get the picture. He's done this with another person who raised it to HR, but he clearly hasn't learned.

What are my options here?

Most of this stuff happens over call, sometimes on client locations he'll tell me off in a not very public place. I am scared if I take it to his boss, I'll be termed as lazy or a complainer.

1amut6l,"A very manipulative, unstable, & stingy boss. Should I quit or hold on till my contract's over?","Hey guys, I need your input on my current situation: I recently got promoted to a managerial role without mentorship, now I'm struggling with a heavy workload and a knowledge gap. My boss isn't happy with my slow progress on projects, even though he previously praised my work when it aligned with his directives, but now criticizes ideas he himself suggested. Additionally, he's temperamental and has anger issues.

Despite overseeing research and development and managing the laboratory, the environment is toxic, with a high turnover rate and office gossip. Before signing the contract, the company required us to submit our latest university certificates. Among my coworkers, there's an old employee who is a hypocrite and obsessed with recognition. My boss only holds my high school certificate as collateral (I won't get it back if I resign, but it'll be returned if he fires me). 

Despite enduring this for 7 months post-graduation, my attempts to address the issues seem futile. Many left due to document manipulation, despite having only regional and national certifications, as we need to remain anonymous. Products are released to customers without proper testing, a common practice in the pharmaceutical industry. Even though I've been offered a higher salary, seeking mentorship is impossible (he also wants to minimize cost as low as possible) under this managerial tyranny, where employee efforts go unrecognized. My mental state is deteriorating, and I've even fallen ill after enduring public humiliation from my boss in front of other management.

1amuhwk,Having an anxiety attack at internship.,"I’ll try to make this short. A little context….I became disabled 17 years ago and I’m now almost done with grad school and am currently at my internship. I haven’t worked in 17 years. What started out as something I thought would be exciting has turned into something dreadful. My major is counselor education with a speciality in rehabilitation counseling. I want to become a vocational rehabilitation counselor.

I’m interning at a site that offers many different programs for people with developmental/intellectual disabilities. They have a VR department as well as a day program and also a school. I was under the impression that I would be working with the VR department, but they dumped with me the day program staff. The day program staff are really nice, but they don’t do anything related to VR. 

I come Wednesdays and Fridays for 8 hours. When I tell you I haven’t done anything related to why I’m here I HAVENT DONE ANYTHING. The director who said she would love to have me as an intern barely speaks to me anymore. I supposed to have 80 hours of direct service. 200 hours altogether. My supervisor whom doesn’t even work in the VR department quit, but they kept her on to help with the interns virtually. 

I’ve literally talked to multiple people about this yet nothing changes. I dread coming to this place and find myself going into the bathroom often to deal with my anxiety from just sitting in a room all day staring into the abyss. 

I get along so well with the clients they all love me. We all just sit in this big room all day and they do various activities that I participate in, but like I said it’s nothing related to why I’m actually at this place: 

The problem is there is no where else for me to go at the moment. There’s not tons of VR places to choose from. I do have a summer site lined up but that doesn’t start until May. I don’t know what else to do to make this more bearable. :(

1amttla,Freelancer to management? (Really need advice),"4 years ago, I had my 1st middle management job in a small company, lasted less than a year.  
  
I quit then because I believed I could do more for myself (both financially) and experience-wise.  
  
I took on freelancing (business consultant) for different kind of companies (mostly small) in different sectors.  
  
Now, I feel that freelancing (finding clients, closing them, then do the actual work, and handle the politics of it all) is exhausting. I'd like to get back to full time as a manger or a highly-paid consultant.  
  
I've put so much work and mentoring into leadership in myself, besides my technical experience as a consultant, I've also dealt with (and handled) the hardest of personalities throughout those 3 years as a freelancer!  
  
I've been interviewing at some companies but their budget range was below.  
  
The only practical idea I have for getting a manager position faster is this:  
  
Contact (via a personalized message on LinkedIn) many managers, and seniors in companies I'd want to work at, and just ask them for advice...etc. and use this meeting to pitch myself.  
  
Tell me if it's practical or not and if u have other suggestions for me. I'm really in need of some decent advice (I have total of 7 years experience) (I've already capitalized on my current clients and network)",Wonderful_Success492,1,1.0,0,1707500401,2024-02-09 17:40:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1amttla/freelancer_to_management_really_need_advice/,2,2024
1amtlru,"to everyone in management, please answer me this","Told my boss today that I (30) have no desire to be in management after I was asked. She seemed a little surprised, but told her it’s just never been something I ever really wanted. the “managing” other people doesn’t sound appealing to me. I rather just come in and do the work I was assigned and clock out. 

This question was also asked by 2 other people from the same company who were both in management position and when I told them I have no desire of moving up the corporate ladder, they both just gave me a shocking or confusing look and responded with “oh.”

One of them then asked me how I got a senior position because it is moving up which is true but I wasn’t even looking for this job. Got a message on LinkedIn randomly one day, said okay to meet just cause, then next thing you know they offer me the position and im here.

But Is it really that weird or uncommon that I dont see myself being in any management positiom 1,2 or 5 years from now? 

I don’t know, maybe this thinking of mine will change in the future but what is so good about being in management aside from the higher pay? I never liked babysitting even when it was my little cousins, and to do it with grown adults? yikes",Whoopdidu_Meh1327,13,0.9300000071525574,32,1707499846,2024-02-09 17:30:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1amtlru/to_everyone_in_management_please_answer_me_this/,2,2024
1amt47a,Should I interview where my assailant works?,"I have a job I love but applied to another great position based on a bit of a whim due to the desirable location. No bad options in this sense. It’s a competitive position and I’m being asked for an on site interview. Very flattering.

The downside: a current employee of the company I applied to sexually assaulted me at a conference about a decade ago when I was in my early 20s. It was reported at the time but nothing came of it except my being disinvited to a few upcoming events by the organizers the incident was reported to. Things were different before #metoo. 

In this new positions, I would not have to work directly with this person, although that doesn’t mean I’d never see him. He is significantly older and in a more senior position than me. I have no idea if I would have to interact with him in the interview process. 

I don’t want this person to continue limiting my choices based on his actions but I also know that I will never be willing to work cordially with him.

I am female, in my 30s, and work in tech. I am part of a lot of professional communities and I feel like I see a lot of the same professional issues crop up. I have an inkling of an idea that I want to start a podcast for women in tech to provide coaching. The coachee would be anonymous and in return, they'd get a free coaching session. This would then be shared as a podcast. I think it would likely be 2 coaches (me and a friend) and a coachee.  
I'm in the middle of getting my coaching certification but more importantly, I've had a lot of work experience and am probably a good source of advice. I did some group coaching last year and I feel like hearing people have similar issues to you is really comforting and very relieving.

1amrzn7,Just want a little advice on my work situation.,"I had my next supervision at work yesterday. The main takeaways is I’m good at my job, they have zero issues with my time keeping, work rate, I have great relationships with the people we support (I work in the care industry in the UK) etc. There was talk of completing an NVQ and potentially moving up to be a senior and house manager etc. So, there must be some worth/value to me in their minds and wanting me to stay, right?



The one bad point is my relationships with my colleagues aren’t great. I get frustrated at work a lot and it shows - genuine point. And I can be negative at work - genuine point. However, I work with some lazy and toxic people. When I lone work, there are never any issues, just issues in the main house with the staff I work with most of the time.




Like, I’ve been told by one young colleague that I should leave my wife, move back in with my parents in a town very far away and quit my job - because she doesn’t like me. Other staff just complain about wanting to die and hating life constantly in front of the people we support. Some of the smokers will spend over 45 minutes at a time outside smoking whilst the guys call for help. Stuff like that.



And maybe I’m over thinking things here but I’m the problem? Because I get annoyed at no-one doing any work or helping the people we support? Obviously, I need to work on some things and hide my emotions. But I’m unsure if this situation is saveable or I need to try and move on asap. Any thoughts would be helpful.

1amry7s,Have I got ghosted after the interview? I can't even sleep.,"I applied for this job on their website which led me to a personality test. The next day their recruiter reached me on linkedin for an interview appointment and the same day I got a mail ""We cannot go further with your application since you don't live in the job location."" I assume there's a misunderstanding since I live in the job location. The mail looks like an automatic reply. 

On monday morning, I had the interview with the assistant head of the department and it was perfect. I think they really liked me and I was pretty sure that I was gonna get an offer. I fit the job perfectly plus the ""nice to haves"". I got very excited since I am desperately applying for jobs and even having therapy because of the hardship of the situation.
Even when I asked if they have remote options, she said that they don't but she can ask the HR about it for my position. I insisted that it's not necessary and I am very flexible. 
In the evening, she sent me a mail about what kind of laptop I use for my work and what softwares I need. At this point I was pretty sure that I was gonna get an offer tomorrow. 

The next day the HR guy connected me on linkedin and sent me a message to my phone number about taking the test again. He said that the test result looks ""invalid"" and I should take it again. I asked him for the links and applied again. I didn't get the test link in hours so I sent him a message about it. Maybe I sounded too pushy but I think I was just being cautious. He informed me that it's normal and in the night I got the link for the test, I finished and sent it. In the morning I texted him that I finished the test. He thanked me and that's the last time I heard from them. It happened on wednesday morning. I am planning on sending a follow up mail on monday. 

At this point I don't think I got the job since they told me that the role is very urgent to fill. It's been a week but no response. What should I assume? I continue applying for jobs but I feel like I will never have a job and I would even consider ending things if it wasn't for mom. I had a breakdown because I can't takr how hard finding a job anymore.

1amq3t1,How and where should I switch and should I even switch ?,"Hi guys,

[Sorry for the rant]

I am a 25M software engineer currently working in a mid sized fintech MNC.
I have 2.5 years of full time experience and I earn about 32L base +  2.75L LIT + variable (upper and lower limit undefined).

I have friends in other companies who earn about 45L base + LIT + performance and friend in my own team who earn about 35L fixed + 2.75 LIT + variable (limits undefined)

I don’t want to compare compensations directly because I have just started my career and I want to focus on improving my skills but deep down I feel like I deserve more money. 
The work that I am currently doing is pretty adhoc and doesn’t interest me much. They are usually tasks that take 1-2 weeks of effort and don’t have much impact on our application moreover it is always about adding a patch or workaround or small new feature on top of whatever that is already built. Whereas my friend in my same team gets assigned better tasks with more visibility, items that are built from scratch so he gets to learn a lot nee things and hence he earns more money as well. I always tell my managers that I want to work on something big and they keep reassuring me that they’d assign me something good but whenever such a project or requirement comes, I always get sidelined and my friend gets that task or it gets assigned to seniors.
I am frustrated of this and I want this to change. It has been about an year since I have been begging for more visibility and impactful work but I don’t understand why it doesn’t come my way.
I don’t mean any hate, my friend is super smart and capable and delivers everything assigned to him but on the same hand I too have a similar track record. Whenever I ask my managers for feedback, they always tell me that I am a reliable resource and I have always delivered and exceeded their expectations.
Yet I don’t understand why the long running, good work doesn’t get assigned to me.

I feel like this is hampering my growth and learning and I want to switch teams or company if possible.

Apart from this one thing I am very fond of my team and my managers and I really look up to them for mentorship and guidance. They’re really nice people and have supported me personally a lot of times which normal managers in corporate would never do.

As much as I want to stay here for the people and  togetherness and comfort, I feel like I should move out of this place so that I can grow in the right direction and take my career forward.

Please share your thoughts and experiences if similar on the matter and help me understand if my feelings are valid or not. 

Thank you.",Negative-Till-4967,2,1.0,0,1707490948,2024-02-09 15:02:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1amq3t1/how_and_where_should_i_switch_and_should_i_even/,2,2024

After that conversation I did not hear from them for another week, sent a follow up email asking about the status of the interview process and received this email in reply:

“Sorry for the delay, I have been discussing things internally with the team, specifically related to your financial expectations which as we discussed were slightly higher than our internal metrics; we have another person who has subsequently applied who the team is determining the desire to interview. I should be able to get back to you within the next few days with an update.”

- Really enjoyed myself there
- The staff really respected me
- I would have a promotion to a managerial position
- 40% pay increase
- Some hybrid work

The only negative is that it scuppers plans of relocation with my partner. We can still relocate, but our current workplaces are pretty far from each other. However, I feel the pay incentives are huge for us, especially as I don’t expect my partner to be on money like this anytime soon.

Obviously I may get other roles, but something about this is so appealing as I LOVED my time there, and was sorry to go.

1amnedj,Is sales a good career path for my personality?,"Looking into changing a career path while I’m still young. I’m 3 years out of college, currently a Senior SEO in a marketing company, making 75k. Some techy background, and obvs decent SEO skills, but where I really shine is communication.

I’m a very strong presenter and I guess I can be somewhat charming naturally. Since early age I noticed that I can convince people of my way of doing things in most cases. It’s like I visualize my arguments and see exactly when and what to say. When it’s time for an example or a personal anecdote. When to get serious or when to ease it up. How to lead a person to a place, how to show them the way out, and how to make them feel like it was their idea all along. It’s effortless, and it’s one of the few things that I genuinely enjoy doing AND that I’m naturally good at.

Most of my success at my current position can be attributed mainly to this trait. But getting deeper into my career, I’m seeing that I have no interest whatsoever in marketing. It’s rather ambiguous for me, I like doing more concrete, defined things. There’s more to it, but I won’t get too deep into it.

Anyways, I thought that it would make sense for me to capitalize on what I’m good at & what I enjoy doing. Many folks suggested that tech sales might be a good career shift for me. However, I have a few reservations, especially regarding my lifestyle and personality.
So, here are some arguments pro and against.

Good:
- My communication & negotiation skills.
- SEO background might help with lead gen?
- Techy background might help me navigate the SAAS landscape?
- I did door to door sales in high school and was able to make solid living off pure commission. I didn’t enjoy it, but I got pretty good with rejection & talking to strangers.
- Freelance experience where half of what I was doing was selling myself & my services, which went pretty well too.

Bad:
- I’d have to start from an SDR and potentially take a pay cut.

Ugly:
- I travel a lot, working remotely from different places at times. Traveling is my biggest passion, nothing I can do about it, so I just learned to adjust my life to it. That’s the reason I got into SEO to begin with. And while there are many sales positions that can be done remotely, it seems like it all just works better when you are in office. Everyone I know who’s in sales is in early and out late, and usually don’t WFH even if they can. Although I’ve met some people in my travels who said they were doing sales back home, and they’d just leave for a few months to travel, and then come back to keep doing it. But I can’t imagine how to get to such a place. One of them was in real estate, so maybe that’s different. Overall, it seems like you kinda have to live for your job in many ways. Which takes me to the last point.
- I’m not that competitive naturally. Maybe I can sell water to the fish, but I gotta be excited for it, and believe that it’s good for the fish. Not sure just how well that translates into sales, and whether that’s enough. My motivation is to genuinely find solutions that help people, that’s about it. Work is just work for me. Don’t get me wrong, I still do it the best I can because that’s how you gotta do it. I give my best to anything I’m doing, including work. But also, excluding work. Family time, health, friends and interests and whatnot. The important part of my life happens outside of work for me, and I’m worried that this attitude won’t take me far in sales. I don’t have that burning desire to be the best, man, my motivation is to have enough money and time to live a happy life.

Any input is appreciated. It could be a pretty dramatic shift, and losing my current employment for trying something new is a big step. So, I’m trying to approach it responsibly.

I am a lawyer working remotely for a private university. My job is low-stress, and I have a lot of flexibility. I like the team that I work with, and my manager is awesome, which is why I am hesitant about leaving. I was also recently promoted. I currently make 91K.

My question is, what career fields out there offer good quality of life and very competitive pay (what I would be forgoing if I don’t pursue the airlines).

Theres this travel nurse who is outspoken and has a strong personality. Past couple shifts that I have been working I am suppose to train this new hire who is a seasoned nurse. Since she is experienced I don't really have to be on top of her all the time I just monitor.

  this travel nurse has been throwing shade at me publicly while at work saying that I don't do anything for past couple days that I am just relaxing when its not true. I normally just brush it off but this day she really pissed me off. So I come back from lunch little early and she goes ""you are back early. It doesn't matter not like you do anything anyways."" where everyone can hear it. I tell her that ""she must be the queen of being toxic. I tell her that im suppose to be orienting this nurse, but I got that IV stick on your pt for you, I helped clean one of your patients, took your pts to the bathroom but you must have forgot about all that on top of helping the other nurses out and helping out the charge nurse. (I even passed out some of the nurses meds that were behind but I don't mention it).  I am not obligated to help anyone out matter of fact as that is not my role but I do it. I am not the break nurse or relief nurse. I am precepting this new hire nurse. That nurse was stunned since I am normally reserved and said she is sorry. That it was just a joke. I was like its not a joke thats peoples work reputation. (i hate people that hide behind that its just a joke excuse). I was like I know you a traveler so I am not going to report you but I want it to be known. Then it was dead silent. 

After couple hours of more work I thought about it and said I don't owe her anything and I don't want her back since she was planning to renew. So I reported her to the manager who said that they will probably let her go (IDK if its empty words tho). I have a good reputation at work and I never complained before.

It pays $50k annually, 11 days of PTO and 1 sick day per quarter, with only 4 federal holidays off. Annual bonus is between $1k and $4k and annual raises are $2k. It was the only offer I had at the time and started this week. 

On Monday, I received an offer within my industry for $60k with a $2k sign on bonus. The hours are Monday through Friday 8:15 to 5:15, with the potential of working 1 Saturday monthly. The commute is 45 minutes. I get 15 days PTO, all federal holidays, and a similar annual bonus. Annual raises are 3%-5%. 

Here’s the kicker: the second offer comes with the probability of them finding out I was terminated with cause and I’m deeply concerned that could effect my ability to remain employed with the company.

Upon joining I find out my director doesn't have any technical skills and can't answer most of my questions about how certain variables work or how to do certain tasks. Through out this year I have asked for help several times and when I do get set up with one of the managers on my team she never has time to meet with me and often just doesn't show up to our meetings that I setup. 

I have watched someone new join the company on a different team and seeing the training she has received and daily calls with her leader to help her ramp up and become good at her job genuinely upsets me because I don't feel like I got any of that. That other team appears to be more organized and supportive than the one I'm on. When I try to talk to my director about what I'm working on to get feedback and suggestions I'm told that I'm not working independently. When I try to voice my opinion on how I feel I'm spoken over and told that she has done all of these things. 

I don't even think switching to a different team would be helpful at this point. I'm sure many negative things have been said about me because she likes to gossip and the office is very clicky. I have been berated by her in team meetings and other members of the team I'm on has been as well. Favoritism is very clear here and I've never heard her speak down to them. I definitely don't fit in and I often wonder if it's because our backgrounds are so different. In a department of about 100 people spread across a few offices I'm the only person that looks like me. 

Based on my experience I don't know if I genuinely suck at my job or if I was just put on a crap team. I feel like I have been gas lighted into thinking I'm terrible at my job despite not being given proper training. I have made a ton of progress since I began but I keep going back and forth with myself based on my experience because I have struggled to get to this point. My director has told me that she doesn't think this role is for me and that I should try something completely different. 

So my question is do I suck or am I in a bad environment? 

Do I go for the same role at a different company or try something completely different?

TLDR: I have a crappy director and I  don't know if I'm the problem or if I have a bad leader.",Ok-Metal-9175,2,0.75,4,1707442024,2024-02-09 01:27:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1amc42n/first_year_in_corporate_america_do_i_suck_or_do_i/,2,2024
1amc3oh,"New job only gave me a first day and start time, not even an end time for that first day. What's the most professional way to ask my manager for the full first week schedule?","I start my new job on Monday. All I was told is ""Come in Monday at 9 AM."" No end time for that first day, no other days mentioned, nothing else. \*(Is this normal?)\*

&#x200B;

As far as I understand, this job requires employees to work all 5 weekdays, but because I wasn't given any additional shift info and I'm still new, I don't know how much of that applies to me yet. For all I know, the first week might end up being training on Monday - Wednesday that ends earlier than typical shift end times, Thursday-Friday off, and then the following Monday as the official start of my full time schedule. 

&#x200B;

All that being said, what's the most professional, appropriate way to ask my manager what my end time will be that day, and what the rest of the week will look like? I'm concerned because I don't want to come off as demanding or impatient. I don't want him to think ""this guy hasn't started yet and is already asking for all of this."" I've never had a job give me such little, ambiguous info so I'm understandably confused. And as I'm sure you all understand, it would help to know what my week will look like ahead of time so I can plan accordingly.

1ambstm,"New job acting weird, I don't know what to do","I have a bachelor's and lots of experience in accounting. I needed something temporary and randomly applied to this Office assistant job ($8-10). They actually called me right away for an interview. They mentioned free lunches for everyone as a perk. Everyone is impressed by me and they want to hire me on spot. $10/hour.

I then regretted going there, since I'm getting more interviews later that week. I call and say that I got a better offer somewhere. The boss says he really wants someone with experience and that he can counter-match whatever the offer is (and move me to accounting). I said $14 and then he offered that as well. He also told me more about his perks like life insurance, blabla. I told him I needed a few days to think about it, he said sure.

Two days pass and he calls me again! And he says he really needs the help asap. He's offering $1000 sign in bonus and $15. So I just accept because honestly, I liked the company, close to home, and free lunch perk lol.

On my first day, I'm doing receptionist work (as they hire someone for this role, and then they move me to the accounting). I didn't bring lunch, and part of my duty was actually ordering the lunch for everyone. At lunch break, someone comes to me and tells me that they're tyring to cut costs and I'm not included in the free lunch perk!! It seems so obvious they're trying to get me for the $1000 sign in bonus. I almost walked out.

But why would they want me so bad?? They can just open another job position for accounting if they needed someone. It almost felt like they were trying to catch me before I left for another company. My resume aint that impressive either! I dont even know how to use quickbooks.

Not the best decision of my life I feel. The salary was not that great to start with but I suck at negotiating and I just accepted what they offered to me. I had the chance to look for some other job while I had this offer but I didn't. I just got lazy and I guess I am paying the price for it till date. I had a plan of switching after 2 years but that didn't work out. I chickened out in all interviews. In 2022 i tried again and did get an offer from a company but they were low balling me with the compensation and hence I rejected that offer in the hope that I would find something better. But that didn't happen as we have tons of layoffs going on for the past year and half and it's still not great out there. I just feel stuck somehow in my current job. Everyday feels like a struggle to show up. I just don't feel curious about learning anything. I just end up sulking about myself and how I am not good at my job. I have lost myself in all this.

I also feel it would a good career jump for me and considering Tesla, it might not be a place for me to learn and work together? May be?

I am rn in a turnmoil to go for the job at tesla or stay where I am. I have no problems with the current employer but the only thing is the place it is in. It’s little too calm and dull for me and I don’t see my future here.

I dint try for any job or upskill during these months cause i was trying out a business of my own which dint work out but now i want to get back to doing a job so i started to upskill myself back in data engineering domain but every job post that i see in data engineering domain is asking for a min of 3 year experience which i unfortunately do not have.

I see 3 scenarios put forth in front of me as of now

1) I continue to upskill in data enginnering domain and find a job organically

2) I upskill in DE domain but put fake experience and find a job

3) I start to upskill in full stack development and start searching for a job cause full stack has lot of opportunities

4) This would my final option that i just give up hopes of getting a job and find myself doing masters.

This would be at a pretty big/large company, so I feel I could *""spin""* my experience to a future company in 1-2 years and look for a better paying position. I would go from being a ""Manager"" to a ""Director"". I also live in state, where it is illegal to ask about salary history.

The primary reason that I'm considering it, is that I'm facing a lot of push back from companies when I apply for ""Director"" roles. They want someone, who already was a ""Director"" or equivalent in their prior role (lateral move instead of a diagonal move). I faced a similar challenge when going from ""Senior Associate"" to ""Manager"", so I'm not unfamiliar with that challenge.

1am6rg4,Retention Bonus Advice,"My employer offered me a retention bonus this week after letting my manager go and making significant changes to how things are done. They need me, and they know it. While not an actual leader on HR’s books, my responsibilities place me as a leader to my peers. They have looked to me for support with the changes and team leadership expects me to play that role. Additionally, I will have more responsibilities. The bonus is 15k, and I must stay for a year. I have reason to believe only 2-3 of us are getting bonuses. 

While I’m willing to stay for a little and see how things go, I haven’t been happy for awhile and I’m not happy with the changes, though recognize there is some potential for the changes to be good, and I’m curious to see. However, I don’t want to be locked in for a year. 

Is it reasonable to ask for the retention terms to be 8 months (my three year mark at the company) and express my commitment to supporting the changes and willingness to try it out but wanting to have earlier flexibility if the changes are unsuccessful. (Or, any suggestions on how to explain why I want a shorter term? Is 6 months acceptable? I’d love as short as possible) 

Alternatively, my ideal plan would be asking for a raise instead. Is a 10k raise a reasonable trade? 

Could I split and ask for a 8k raise and 7k bonus with 8 months term?

1am6loi,Is sales a good career path for me?,"Looking into changing a career path while I’m still young. I’m 3 years out of college, currently a Senior SEO in a marketing company, making 75k. Some techy background, and obvs decent SEO skills, but where I really shine is communication.

I’m a very strong presenter and I guess I can be somewhat charming naturally. Since early age I noticed that I can convince people of my way of doing things in most cases. It’s like I visualize my arguments and see exactly when and what to say. When it’s time for an example or a personal anecdote. When to get serious or when to ease it up. How to lead a person to a place, how to show them the way out, and how to make them feel like it was their idea all along. It’s effortless, and it’s one of the few things that I genuinely enjoy doing AND that I’m naturally good at.

Most of my success at my current position can be attributed mainly to this trait. But getting deeper into my career, I’m seeing that I have no interest whatsoever in marketing. It’s rather ambiguous for me, I like doing more concrete, defined things. There’s more to it, but I won’t get too deep into it.

Anyways, I thought that it would make sense for me to capitalize on what I’m good at & what I enjoy doing. Many folks suggested that tech sales might be a good career shift for me. However, I have a few reservations, especially regarding my lifestyle and personality.
So, here are some arguments pro and against.

Good:
- My communication & negotiation skills.
- SEO background might help with lead gen?
- Techy background might help me navigate the SAAS landscape?
- I did door to door sales in high school and was able to make solid living off pure commission. I didn’t enjoy it, but I got pretty good with rejection & talking to strangers.
- Freelance experience where half of what I was doing was selling myself & my services, which went pretty well too.

Bad:
- I’d have to start from an SDR and potentially take a pay cut.

Ugly:
- I travel a lot, working remotely from different places at times. Traveling is my biggest passion, nothing I can do about it, so I just learned to adjust my life to it. That’s the reason I got into SEO to begin with. And while there are many sales positions that can be done remotely, it seems like it all just works better when you are in office. Everyone I know who’s in sales is in early and out late, and usually don’t WFH even if they can. Although I’ve met some people in my travels who said they were doing sales back home, and they’d just leave for a few months to travel, and then come back to keep doing it. But I can’t imagine how to get to such a place. One of them was in real estate, so maybe that’s different. Overall, it seems like you kinda have to live for your job in many ways. Which takes me to the last point.
- I’m not that competitive naturally. Maybe I can sell water to the fish, but I gotta be excited for it, and believe that it’s good for the fish. Not sure just how well that translates into sales, and whether that’s enough. My motivation is to genuinely find solutions that help people, that’s about it. Work is just work for me. Don’t get me wrong, I still do it the best I can because that’s how you gotta do it. I give my best to anything I’m doing, including work. But also, excluding work. Family time, health, friends and interests and whatnot. The important part of my life happens outside of work for me, and I’m worried that this attitude won’t take me far in sales. I don’t have that burning desire to be the best, man, my motivation is to have enough money and time to live a happy life.

Any input is appreciated. It could be a pretty dramatic shift, and losing my current employment for trying something new is a big step. So, I’m trying to approach it responsibly.

I’m also exploring things like consulting, but that seems to need tons of experience in something else first, so that isn’t really viable right now.

1am69ec,How to answer very unique “why did you leave your last job?”,"Try and follow me here:

To start, I have a fairly niche job with few local companies that specialize in what I do so it has been pretty hard for me to find anyone who can see how my experience relates to their job posting. Plenty of interviews but no one hires me.

I worked at Company A for a while, then left because Company B gave me a promotion. I left Company B and went back to Company A because they paid more.

Then about a year ago, I quit Company A because of a recently hired bad manager who was obviously targeting me to quit and a reorganization that forced everyone at my level to take on an enormous amount of extra work without hiring any additional employees/increased pay. Everyone who is still at Company A is there because they need to pay bills. They are miserable.

1am4l92,Career Advice: Transitioning from Marketing to UX Design as an International Student in the US,"  
Hello everyone,  
  
I'm seeking guidance and advice. 🙏 Over the past five years, I've been an international student in the US, initially under a J-1 visa for a cultural exchange program, then transitioning to an F-1 visa for education. When the pandemic struck, I chose to remain in the US to continue my education and enhance my skills, with the intention of pursuing an international Master's degree.  
  
My background is in marketing, with four years of experience as a generalist marketer for a startup IoT company, along with previous involvement in marketing and graphic design projects. While studying in San Francisco, I pursued a STEM master's program focusing on marketing intelligence, diving into consumer behavior, research methodologies, and data analysis for marketing purposes.  
  
However, I've discovered a stronger passion for creative and qualitative aspects over analytics. During my final quarter, a UX Researcher professor introduced me to UX Design while teaching storytelling with data, sparking my interest. Despite exploring complementary courses and boot camps, I found them too expensive and demanding given my urgent need for employment, limited work authorization, and financial self-sufficiency (which I'm struggling with).  
  
Job hunting has been super challenging, especially with a five-year gap in my resume. While in my heart I'm inclined towards a career shift into design, I've been focusing on marketing roles and entry-level positions in market research due to my background. But with all of this, I lost interest in marketing, leading to a period of depression and a halt in job hunting for a few months. To maintain my work authorization, I've been volunteering for a non-profit and taking on sporadic marketing gigs.  
  
Ideally, I'd dedicate time to a full-time UX course, but it's not feasible at the moment, as I have until June to secure a job. I have also tried apprenticeships, but I'd still need some prior knowledge.   
I'm struggling to balance student loan repayments, rent, and visa maintenance as time runs out. What would you do if you were in my shoes?  
If you have any advice or thoughts, it would be immensely appreciated.",FlaviaCris,1,1.0,0,1707422160,2024-02-08 19:56:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1am4l92/career_advice_transitioning_from_marketing_to_ux/,2,2024

1am46fe,Career Advice - which offer is better for the Path of accountancy,"I am 20M in the UK, currently with no degree at all (a school leaver with A-levels - UK equivalent of US's High School) being highest education.  
    
what happened for role A (which is the Apprentice Finance Assistant - AFA - with the business admin level 3 qualification, for a government council) is starting next week right. AAT apprentice is role B For HW fisher (small accountancy firm), i done the interview for last week and I chased up for a reply today which they said they will give me a response on friday, but today they give me the response stating that I got the offer for the AAT Apprentice role. In between the times that I asked for the reply and when I actually got for the HWF AAT apprentice, I sent the signed contract for role A due to myself thinking at that time that I was not going to get the confirmation in time for role B and I would be losing out on Role A as well (got no confirmation as of yet).   


Now, I've got 2 options:   


Say to employers at role A (AFA - business admin level 3 - salary: £28,818, retry rates - unconfirmed) that I am not interested in it anymore despite myself sending signed contract already and mention the fact that Role B has the qualification (AAT apprentice - 2 year contract for level 3 and 4 - 22500 as salary and 2 retries)   


or    


Stick with employer at role A, pass the apprenticeship and progress internally to another role to do the AAT level 3 qualification in another position (managed to check that the government council that I will be working for next week, if not rejected, also offer AAT scheme as apprenticeships so could potentially try and get study support if pass the business admin level 3 apprenticeship first).

1am406g,Help with pay negotiation for promotion!,"Help! Any insight into my dilemma?

  
I was hired in a business development role for a construction company 4 years ago with a comp structure of $52,000/year + 1% commission on closed contracts I brought in. I've done well over the last several years, and I was given a title change to Sales Manager in July of 2023 by my sketchy former boss, who is no longer with the company. This title change did not come with a comp adjustment as my former boss said my responsibilities wouldn't change because I was basically already doing the job. I have absorbed all of his sales duties over the years, and I am now leading the sales department managing 6 estimators with a goal of $10.5 million. Most of our sales leads come from me now, but I'm still on the same comp plan as I was with my business development role, which came with a fraction of the responsibility and work. The company has been dragging their feet on adjusting my comp, but their first proposal is as follows: 

  
Payment of outstanding 2023 commissions= $67,000

  
I would move to an all commission structure receiving an overall percentage (override) of the department contract bookings. I'd receive a salary draw of $75,000, drawing against my overall commission that would be set at 1.15% up to my goal, then increase beyond that.

&#x200B;

||Override|Bookings|Total Comp|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Threshold|1.15%|$6,521,750|$75,000|
|Goal|1.15%|$10,500,000|$120,750|
|Stretch Goal|1.25%|$13,125,000|$153,563|
|Super Stretch|1.50%|$15,750,000|$199,500|
|BHAG|1.50%|$20,000,000|$263,250|

  
Am I wrong in thinking I would be making less money under this structure? Before, I'd only have to get to 7 million to make $120,000. The catch is that it can often be months before I start receiving commissions on the contracts I close as they are mostly large commercial new construction projects.  
I also was contacted by a recruiter for another company that wants to hire for my exact position. The recruiter's first offer was $90,000/year with potential for $30,000 annual bonus, so $120k a year starting offer that the recruiter said was negotiable. I don't plan to move to this company, but the initial proposal was timely.   
It's been difficult to figure out an appropriate comp structure going from commission sales to management. I stand to make a decent amount this year with a new comp plan plus the company paying my outstanding commissions, but want to make sure my comp is appropriate for after my past commissions are paid out.    
Any tips to negotiate this are appreciated!",bassbingirly2002,1,1.0,0,1707420687,2024-02-08 19:31:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1am406g/help_with_pay_negotiation_for_promotion/,2,2024

1am3j59,Need an advice for my career path,"Hi I'm a software engineering student and this year is supposed to be my graduation year however I've failed all the tests to secure a spot in top companies in my city to do an end-of-studies project (or you could call it a graduation project you present to your teachers at your school to get your degree) .

 So my best bet would be going outta my home city which is not feasible due to my financial circumstances. I know if I find an opportunity in a company they may grant you a compensation but I doubt it'll cover my needs.  

I found an opportunity of a backend developer where I'm at ,the teamwork and the subject of project are intresting BUT there's no compensation + 8 hours a day + no working at home + tech stack is unpopular (flask while everyone uses spring /.NET /symfony/laravel ) so I'm feeling like I'm being enslaved here 

There's another opportunity I'm waiting for in the same area but not confirmed where there's a less  teamwork and maybe a less intresting subject but there's a compensation which is my main motivation right now.

So I'm thinking of quitting and retake the year to hone my skills I'm sure of my ability to grow and become competent in fullstack development as I couldn't prepare enough this year because of health issues.

There's another possibility of completing the slavery-like internship and take the degree with it however the market is less likely to recruit junior engineers due their high cost so the recruiter rather hire trainees in there last year (like myself right now) so it cost them less which makes me consider the first unless the 2nd opportunity calls on me.

1am39ff,"Pivoting careers, not sure if the ROI makes sense.","So I am blind, have a degree in humanities, and up until recently was employed in the public sector. I have never really earned over 50k a year, and spent all my savings moving across the country to a job that didnt work out. Below are my current debts/finances. 


Right now I have $800 on savings, will likely get $2-3k back in taxes, and recently had to move from a major city to a resort town. I am in my mid 20s at the moment. 

Current debts: 

- 30k student loans (Federal, subsidized and on an IBR) 

- 6k personal debt to family (they helped pay my rent when I ran out of savings)

- approx 10k in medical debt (just had two surgeries on my eye, so this is an estimate and might be wildly off)

My plan is to go into massage therapy. I have worked previously in the hospitality sector as a prep cook, dishwasher, and back-office staff for a hotel. I have been reckoning with the fact that my vision is decreasing and I'll need to find a career path, this is a field that I see many blind people go into. A few I have spoken with told me it certainly isnt something to do for 40 years but you can certainly get 20-30 out of your body, its a very physical job but relatively low stress depending on the setting. I have always enjoyed working with my hands, when I was 19 working in kitchens I loved how time just slipped by, and the espirit d'cour.

What I am concerned about is the income potential, and the ROI on a massage therapy program. Most I have seen cost between 6-8k, and my vocational rehab agency  doesn't seem to be in the financial position to help, given that it would likely be more than just the cost of a program (transport to/from the school as an example, or going into debt for accomodations if I cant find something local while I live at home).

1am380t,Coworker is extremely unhygienic and management won’t do anything,"i work in an office. my coworker started 2 weeks ago.

from day 1, he absolutely reeked. specifically of wet dog and musty, unwashed clothes. we soon found out why, as he told us that he lives in a shed and breeds pitbulls. 

i cannot describe with words how rancid this man smells. sometimes it’s actually physically painful, like a stinging acidic feeling in my nose, and no i am not just being dramatic. and i have to sit right next to him. 

since he started, we’ve been telling management to say something. they keep saying they’ll do something about it ‘today’ and then what happens? absolutely nothing. he comes in the very next day reeking even worse. they keep putting it off. 

it’s hard to find someone with his position who’s decent at their job and they don’t want to risk any bad blood between them. it’s understandably an awkward situation, but it’s becoming physically unbearable. sometimes it’s near impossible to breathe. 

we’ve explained to him that it’s not fair on us who work in the office to have to deal with it for 8 hours a day, he says something like “yeah, yeah, i know” in a way that kind of brushes us off, and he’s even laughed at us a few times. nothing about this situation is funny.

we have this conversation every day. we’re not sure what else we can say, how we can get our point across, because nobody in management is listening to us. 

he’s worn the same jeans for 2 weeks straight that have shit stains on them. yes. SHIT STAINS. how do i know this? because today he brought his dog into the office, which isn’t even allowed unless you’re management/have permission. it was an xl bully/mastiff cross that was literally the size of a small horse. it was mostly calm, just wondered around aimlessly, until it started pissing over the printers and fax machines, as well as shitting on the floor. 

according to my coworkers and the cctv footage i watched, he picked up the dog shit MULTIPLE TIMES with his BARE HANDS and threw it outside, then proceeded to wipe them on his jeans. the entire downstairs office was stinking of dog, and there’s no windows or doors that are able to be kept open. management doesn’t care because he sits in his private office with the door closed.

we’ve even given him a new uniform, but it doesn’t help because it just starts immediately stinking of wet dog again. it’s not like he doesn’t have money, he’s just a fucking slob. 

i’m going to tell management tomorrow that i’m moving upstairs from now on. this is going to be very difficult for me because i have my pc set up downstairs (that i’m unable to move) and it’s very hard to work on 1 screen, and sometimes it’s vital to my work to be able to look at 2 things at once. working from home is also not an option because i have terrible wifi connection. 

i can’t say anything to him because it’s honestly not my place to do it. i wasn’t the one who hired him, it’s a job for my manager. all of my coworkers say the same. and it doesn’t look like he’s going to be fired because of his hygiene any time soon.

i’m willing to make this sacrifice because i can’t take it anymore.

Would I benefit more from attending in person fully or would hybrid learning do just fine? Is it feasible to get this done in two years or longer? For those of you with work experience in this field, what would you recommend that I do?

1am195s,Equity (Future) or Salary (Now),"Long story short, I previously worked at a fintech company where employees had the opportunity to acquire equities of less than 1%. The company was securing excellent deals with banks and appeared to be growing. I left to double my salary, seeking to build a substantial financial foundation. Additionally, I preferred a remote position over the in-office job at the fintech company. Although working there with my friends was enjoyable, it was also highly stressful. Since my departure, the company seems to have become more relaxed, having overcome the critical ""death valley"" phase most startups face. They now offer vacations and small holidays, and employees have received their equity shares. Consequently, I'm experiencing FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and sometimes feel compelled to return, potentially even for half my current salary. I'm uncertain about the long-term prospects of remote jobs and tech careers, whereas being part of a company feels more stable.

1am11u2,Is my employer cheating me?: Can they halt the appraisal process upon resignation,"I am from India and I am currently employed at a startup where I was the third employee to join, so we are a very close team. Only issue I had was the low salary. But since I was a fresher, I was ok with it. Despite this, I've dedicated myself to the company, achieving all set goals last year. With an appraisal cycle approaching in January, I anticipated a revised salary reflecting my contributions. But I got a better offer in a better company where I have to join soon. So i resigned before the appraisal cycle started. However, upon resigning in January and serving a two-month notice period, my employer informed me that I would not receive an appraisal, asserting they no longer needed to ""impress"" me. I feel betrayed and angry. I was under the impression that appraisals are for the past year's work performance and I achieved all the goals that was assigned for me.

Now I want to know 2 things

 1. I have 12 days of Privilege leave of this year and 2 days of casual leave of January and February which will bring down my notice period to 40 days approximately. I want to pay the remaining notice period amount for 10 days and serve 1 month notice period and leave the company as there is nothing here to impress me either. But my employer will definitely not like that. Can he/she stop me from taking my leave. Because usually the manager has to approve the leave. Please clarify this to me
 
2. My new employer even offered to cover the notice period amount for a swift transition, but I was conflicted about leaving my current startup hanging. As i am playing a key role here, I wanted to do the right thing so I said my new employer that I will not be joining soon. So now that gate is closed. Here I am stuck with low salary and no way of getting out soon. Now I feel betrayed.  Is this typical company behavior? Can they halt the appraisal process upon resignation? What does Indian law says about this scenario?

One piece of advice: No matter how close you may feel to your employer, it's essential to prioritize your own well-being and interests. Remember, at the end of the day, they see you as a business asset.",Sparow_jack,1,1.0,2,1707413248,2024-02-08 17:27:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1am11u2/is_my_employer_cheating_me_can_they_halt_the/,2,2024

1am114w,Insurance related careers,"Hi there! 

My boyfriend has worked in insurance for 5 years and is pretty confident he doesn’t want to stay in it long term but doesn’t know where to start as far as looking for something else. I’m a big believer that a lot of skills are transferable and he’ll be able to find a different job (likely semi related) without having to ‘go back to beginning’ and start at entry level. I’m usually quite helpful for advice in these situations but I really know nothing about insurance or any related industries. 

Could anyone give me any suggestions for industries or roles that we could look into? A bit more detail below (but forgive me because I am woefully naive when it comes to insurance!)

- he works for an international Insurance company in an underwriting team but is not an underwriting path
- he has experience working for his company in the US when they set up a new office there 
- I think his title has been exposure analyst and aggs technician 
- He’s worked in an upstream energy team, but has also worked in property 
- he has a top degree in maths from a good university 
- he’s naturally smart, great mental maths, very savvy with his own investments, market trends etc

July 2021-April 2022: Job 3 - left after 9 months because the job completely changed from what I was hired to do and my boss was borderline abusive  
April 2022- Oct 2022: Sabbatical - after that terrible experience I took time off to a) mentally recover and b) figure out what I wanted to do next. I planned to be on sabbatical for 5 months, ended up being 7.

1alx4yk,Private or Public: Which opportunity to pursue?,"I am a fresh graduate with Latin honors (cum laude), with 6 months of part-time job experience as a pharmacy assistant during and after my internship.  
  
I recently passed my board exam just this November and I aimed to apply right away for an entry-level plantilla position (Pharmacist II) at a government hospital. However, there were only 4 open positions available. In line with my application, I passed their first screening, qualifying exams, and actual performance evaluation, which took me 4 months to complete until I reached their final stage of screening. Initially, there were a total of 21 applicants who took the exams, but it was narrowed down to 14 of us who underwent performance evaluation. Now, the remaining 14 applicants, including myself, are about to undergo the interview, which is the last step of their recruitment process before receiving a job offer.  
  
Due to my doubts about my chances of getting into government service due to factors such as being a fresh graduate, limited years of experience, and lack of connections, I sought a backup plan by applying to a private hospital (Level II) in the same location. It's one of the leading private hospitals in the city, and I got accepted after passing their exams and interviews. However, there's a catch: in order to be finally hired, I have to undergo a 2-week training with no pay (only provided with free lunch and transportation allowance), then I will work as a probationary employee for 6 months (earning around ₱14k-₱15k monthly), and after another 6 months, I may be regularized with a potential salary increase (up to <₱18k). Additionally, after passing the 2-week training, I would have to sign a minimum 24-month contract, and there would be a fine if I break it. However, they promised comprehensive training to enhance my skills in various areas and assured that they would cover all expenses for convention training or CPD training.  
  
The problem is that my training in the private sector and interview in the public sector fall in the same week. Let's say, the training starts on Feb 19, and the interview at the government hospital is scheduled for Feb 21.  
  
Questions:  
  
If you were in my situation, how would you strategically and realistically approach it?  
  
Is it acceptable to accept the 24-month contract knowing that there is potential for professional growth with the private hospital, or should I continue to hope for an opportunity at the government hospital instead?  
  
What is the probability or likelihood that a government agency will accept fresh graduates and recently board-passed individuals? (Some of my fellow applicants have over 3 years of experience in the field, and one of them was even my professor before. Also, some of them are fresh graduates like me)  
  
Suppose I still wanted to attend the interview at the government hospital just to gain experience and insight into what to expect if given the chance to reapply again. What would be a suitable excuse to give to the private sector to be excused from training on that day?  
  
Assuming the universe favors me greatly this year and I am lucky enough to be selected from the 4 positions the government agency is offering, how would I handle this situation, knowing that I am still undergoing training in the private sector?  
  
Considering realistic possibilities, what is the best course of action given the factors at play in this situation?

1alun4g,How do i handle unexplained work i have never done before?,"I have been working for a big company for the last months. The start was tough. There has been a lot of self-learning and I have been a pain in the neck. Normally I would have done a lot of trial and error, watched others do it and copied what they did.  Since I work as a software developer, I would look at git or older tickets. I know how to help myself.

  
But there are some tasks where that's not possible.  We have a lot of internal company processes and programs. I can't google them, and if I did and found something, they would have a problem. My supervisor, who forgot on the first day that he was supposed to meet me at the front door for over an hour until I complained, asked me to do a task and I said ""Yes, if you can give me a quick description and show me the software"" only to get an answer, ""It's this software and you'll see what you need to do. 

  
Yes, I did not know where to find the software because there are many sites... and when someone else showed me, he also explained everything to me. It is important that I do it in a certain company way. It was not possible for me to do the job without it, even my colleague told me that.  

  
It happens all the time, he says I have to do it because he has no time. If it is a new task I say something like ""Sure, but only if you explain it for 1-5 minutes"" to which he replies ""No time, you can find it out yourself, you can do it"" and then leaves. I get so angry and usually take a 5-minute coffee break to cool down, give myself 10-15 minutes to try and figure it out myself and then ask another colleague.  This week it happened again. No one was available, and I tried to do it myself. In the end, it was wrong. Who could have guessed? I feel like a painter and the client tells me to paint the wall, but doesn't tell me which color, how he wants it ....

  
I have tried writing down questions and sending them to him in emails, I am trying to be patient, but I am so angry at the moment.  I accept my mistake if it is something I should know. But with this company's internal processes, it is impossible to learn a new task by myself. Sometimes i forgot a process because i did it half a year ago. I get so angry, but I try to remain professional and calm with him. I have also tried to tell him this in a constructive way, and he agreed it's hard. 

How can i professional improve this situation or me. If I make mistakes with the processes, this can cause more problems. Some steps can't be set back. So I am extra nervous and want a second pair of eyes.

For years I’ve been polishing my skills and about a year and a half ago finally managed to get a good paying job. I work at company that actually (seems) to care about the people working for them. My boss is competent and a decent person, and my coworkers are really chill to work with. 

  
Now I’ve been working here for about one and a half years and I realized I absolutely hate working in an office environment and that I don’t get any energy from IT work. I’ve tried to ask for new tasks and even those don’t do anything for me. It all ends up draining me completely. I’m working 9 to 5, 5 days a week and every Saturday I’m broken and Sunday I’m extremely restless dreading the coming week. Most days I just feel like crying, but I’m genuinely to mentally tired to actually let out any tears.

  
I don’t know what to do next. I can’t just leave because it pays good and I need the money. Even if I left, I have no idea what else I could do. I worked my ass of for years to finally get into this field and never expected to hate it this much. What would be ways to make work more energizing or at the least not so draining?

I have two opportunities currently. 
1) To become data analyst - I am quite familiar with SQL and Power BI from udemy courses and exercises. 

2) To become IT project manager - I have passed courses and done a project for a website which I had presented to the audience.

I want to look in the future and decide where want me to be in 2 years. As we all agree that IT industry is the future I think I could be a software developer. 

Watching other developers their working environment, workload, working process, dialogues, results that what touches me and makes me go this way.

I have not had an opportunity to work with data analysts, thus I do not know there career opportunities, salary expectations and where can they be after 2-3 years.

I want my life to be interesting and working process way far away from routines.

1alp60w,"Sudden ""communication issues"" at work.","I started a new position in September. Everything was going amazing, I could tell right away in my interview that the supervisors were my kind of people. The job is amazing, I love everything about it. Except... A few weeks after I started, a new supervisor was promoted. They have never been a supervisor before. In December, I was assigned to directly report to them. Things started getting weird right before Christmas. They sent me an email with some materials to review for a phone meeting we had scheduled for the next Wednesday. The email arrived on Thursday and implied that I was already gone for the weekend and I would be opening this email on Monday. I replied something like ""you caught me before my weekend, I have PTO on Monday and Tuesday but thank you for the prep time."" I immediately got a call from my supervisor above them and I never understood what the beef was but apparently they had looked at the schedule and saw someone with a similar name who was already off for the weekend and thought it was me and that I was being insubordinate(?) with my response. 

Ever since then things have been really awkward for me at work, I feel like everything they say to me is in a condescending tone. I have been just sloughing it off because I know you can't imply tone in text. Then this week a similar situation happened when I told a coworker how to do something in a public chat and they came in and told him that I was wrong. Again, I got a call from their supervisor who was ready to get on to me for giving incorrect information but then looked at the conversation and saw that I was right. But proceeded to tell me ad nauseum that my first answer should have been clear enough that anyone coming into the conversation would know it's right from the first message. (I said ""some people"" where I should have used the word ""managers"") I said fair enough and also took the hint that I can just give answers like that privately and they won't be scrutinized. 

A little while later, I got a message saying that I was being changed to have a different supervisor. I replied with thanks for letting me know and that I think this will be a positive change as the current supervisor and I seem to have differing communication styles. The reply really took me aback. It stated that I must have misunderstood the reason for the change, that all of the managers use clear communication, I have demonstrated a pattern of unprofessional communication and that if I make the changes she suggested I will not have any trouble. 

I'm trying to look at the man in the mirror here and figure out how to speak to anyone. I'm walking on eggshells afraid to open my mouth at all.

After all that, I received my copy of my monthly performance review and it characterizes things I talked about in regards to how I would integrate their suggestions into my work as making excuses and not being able to accept coaching. It was more of a discussion of ""ok, this is how I have been doing it but I can change my mindset to do it that way, thanks for the suggestion."" 

Regardless of whether it's me or them, clearly the management is in accord and it is going to have to be me who makes changes. 

Any suggestions for good resources on effective communication? Workplace advice in general?",longviewpnk,1,1.0,3,1707373101,2024-02-08 06:18:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1alp60w/sudden_communication_issues_at_work/,2,2024

1alnncj,A script for when I let things fall through the cracks — on purpose?,"I work as an executive assistant at a luxury property management company, and it’s one of those roles where “EA” is understood to stand for “everyone’s assistant.” I manage processes across our entire team that there really isn’t anyone else available to handle  (such as vendor management, setting up trainings, and so forth) and people are constantly coming to me with requests. My boss, the executive who delegated those tasks to me, has his own management portfolio consisting of two large buildings (in addition to his executive duties) — one of which includes a whopping 600 residential apartments, and both of which I assist with. On top of that, my boss hired another property manager nine months ago to take over a couple of buildings which *had* been in his portfolio, and unfortunately, our CEO hasn’t approved hiring a dedicated assistant for that person yet, so…guess who? (It’s “temporary,” as I have been told, repeatedly. For nine months.)

I basically have three jobs, with multiple managers. I work hard all day and then take work home at night. I go in on Saturdays to catch up on emails. And the pay is awful, so on top of all of this, I’m also cooking my own meals, doing my own shopping, washing my clothes at the laundromat, etc., because I can’t justify spending extra money on takeout or laundry drop-off. I am *burned out,* and I deeply hate property management.

I know what I need to do: immediately stop working 12-hour days and limit my work week to exactly 40 hours, so that I can spend my spare time finding a better job.

The problem is that I am working long hours to try to keep everything afloat, and most days I’m *still* not getting through everything on my high-priority list, much less having a chance to tackle lower-priority items. There is no one I can delegate anything to (we’re very siloed, and also short-staffed). My boss never has a solution when I approach him about my workload — things were easier back when he was an assistant, and he has no idea how much time everything takes now, and always makes the workload issue about my “time management skills” instead of the sheer unsustainibility of my role. So if I let things fall, I am going to *hear about it.* From him, yes, but also from everyone else in the company. I’m already getting flak from all directions for being slow to handle items on that lower-priority list.

Does anyone have a good, professional yet pointed way to respond to the kind of flak that results when you draw a boundary like this, and start letting you-know-what hit the fan? I have no doubt that my refusal to keep working long hours is going to be very poorly received, and unfortunately I can’t be cavalier about it — I need a salary and health insurance until I find something new. But I want to make it very clear that I’m done taking work home, and that making sure everything gets done needs to be partly (if not mostly) the responsibility of the management team to make sure we are adequately staffed and supported.

1almn32,What should we do?,"Hi everyone! A few coworkers and I are in need of some advice. We’re all currently attending an apprenticeship program through the company we work for to be journeyman machinists and we’ve come across a few problems. 

  Our wages are one of our concerns. The program seems to be designed for kids just out of high school. They start now at $16.50hr and you work only 40 hours a week. by the end of the program you’re supposed to be at $19.50 and after completing 8,000 working hours and you have your journeyman certification you’re bumped to $21.50hr, this is throughout 4 years. When the three of us started we started at $14.50hr. 
    My coworker and I both have family’s to take care of and we find it hard at times to provide making only $17hr. There’s plenty of machine shops hiring for $23+ an hour with absolutely no experience required.

1almhyl,"Dream job, depressing location","
Hello, i graduated college spring of 2022 with a major in environmental science. After graduation, i accepted a job with the federal government in an extremely niche field. The job is great, i love what i do and the pay is great for my major, with a clear path to move up. The only downside is that I’m located in a small town (<10,000). 

I grew up in a fairly large metropolitan area so the last few years socially have been rough. I have friends 2.5 hours away that I see about twice a month, but other than that it’s been terrible. I’m not an outgoing person so the extent of my social interaction has been playing pickleball with retirees. 

I know a lot of my classmates have had trouble landing jobs, most of them working seasonally for a few months of the year - if in the career field at all. And the horror stories of environmental consulting scare me away from that path. 

I have a good stable job, but the lack of anything else in my life right now is depressing. I’m not able to do hobbies i used to enjoy like rock climbing, and there are very few opportunities here. 

Is it crazy to leave my job? Or even worse to live to work. Please help",Kpbell7,1,1.0,0,1707364051,2024-02-08 03:47:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1almhyl/dream_job_depressing_location/,2,2024
1alm9nq,Which should I pursue? Interior designer or social media manager career?,I can’t decide between both. I applied for both masters in interior design and social media marketing. I love both. The good thing about social media marketing is you get to work from home where it’s easy to stay with family and kids and interior design is onsite but I love creating appealing spaces. Since I haven’t worked in both professions before but I want a flexible career not stressful I know stress comes with every career but not the kind of stress that would burn me out. I want to have weekends off don’t want to do any work after work shift at home. So I think social media is better but you manage social accounts and have to work after work hours to post and weekends too right? Tell me your experience if you worked in interior design or social media marketing plz.,Responsible_may,1,1.0,0,1707363335,2024-02-08 03:35:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1alm9nq/which_should_i_pursue_interior_designer_or_social/,2,2024
1alm87i,Are standups supposed to be 1.5-2 hrs long?? Is this something i can bring up during my 1 on 1?,"I work for a fairly small tech startup and this past year we doubled up in numbers: from 15 to 40 people.

When i first joined there were 10 of us and we did the standard startup process where we would meet for 30 mins everyday. But as the company grew, our CTO still wanted everyone to join in the startup, doubling the time from 30-mins to 1 hr because he wanted the devs to raise any concerns (bugs, broken codes) they have on the meeting and they would talk about fixing it.

It got to a point that it was too long so he only made it 2 times a week (mon and thurs) with respective teams meeting on their own. Team members aren't required to join the thurs call as the team leader will be the one presenting. But recently he's been bugging my team to attend the optional thurs call for no reason at all. He just saw some other members join and realized he wanted all of us there, even though we have a seperate stand up with him the same day in the afternoon.

The 1.5-2 hr calls are honestly so unproductive because 80% of the topics don't even relate to my team and most of it are the devs concerns.

I have an upcoming 1 on 1 with the COO and is this something i can bring up without making it look like i'm bypassing the CTO? We've already talked to the CTO multiple times about how the company wide standup isnt really working for us but i guess he just likes doing things his way.",MacchiatoRealness,12,0.8299999833106995,24,1707363209,2024-02-08 03:33:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1alm87i/are_standups_supposed_to_be_152_hrs_long_is_this/,2,2024

1allnq6,Job didn’t promote me but manager is all of a sudden keen to give me tasks at the level above me,"I don’t get it. This was supposed to be a rotational two year program when I applied. Against better judgment, I stayed when three weeks before I started, they removed the rotation component. I didn’t get in the department I wanted, but was told that we can switch after a year. A year comes by and it’ll be a regular transfer instead of a simple, “hey, can I join the new cohort”

I was told you “graduate” when you reach account manager. So, two promotions. The LinkedIn data supported that promotions happened on a yearly basis. The first promotion cycle was around 6 months ago and the new one was a week ago. Of the 20 people I joined with, I believe I am one of two-three that were not promoted, but I can’t confirm exact counts as they’re not all in my specific team, just in the same department, so I’m mostly seeing who had their title changed on teams. 

My first one on one since this happened was yesterday and my manager asked if I had taken over for my account manager on one study for the interviews (I work in market research, mostly quant, the interviews are qual and done infrequently )and I’m majorly confused as that is a stretch opportunity for the level above me. And she looked confused when I told her no. I eventually got her to back off when I told her it was a new important segment for the client , so not the normal ones we do maybe once or twice a year. 

She also messaged me today asking about me doing a presentation on the monthly call for our entry level program. Again, that’s a task for the level above me, so I just say yes, but still confused. Not everyone who had gotten promoted had ever given a promotion, again, it’s for the level above us mostly as a presentation requirement.

I feel slighted that I was not promoted when everyone else was. It makes me feel like they’re saying my work is not valued. Now, these above level tasks are cropping up and I’m not sure what to do. 

Background:
I got feedback 6 months ago and my manager admitted that some of it sounded like “personal differences” as I received negative feedback that said I didn’t ask enough questions and in the next sentence asked too many questions. I know who wrote it as the same account manager for some reason refused to cc me on client emails and got annoyed with me when there would be three different things for the client due within 24 hours that sounded vaguely the same, but were in fact different things. Besides that, I took note of some of the more useful feedback such as some of the account managers didn’t like that I waited until the end to ask questions and have been trying to do my job. My projects have gotten good feedback from clients, I pretty much took over several studies from busy account managers and those who were too “expensive” to spend too much time with it. I feel like I did my job, but apparently, that wasn’t enough. Now, I’m getting even more antsy as I have no work and how many billable hours you work is also a major component of promotions, but my manager told me there were no new projects, so literally half of my time is spend helping other people and still not reaching my rate. Also, my grand boss when I talked to him two weeks ago(this was probably when most people realized they were getting promoted, except me) he said they were hiring new people, but no projects? 

Anyway, I was waiting on our annual reviews later this month to bring it up. What’s the best way to go about it?",lightblend00,4,0.8299999833106995,4,1707361468,2024-02-08 03:04:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1allnq6/job_didnt_promote_me_but_manager_is_all_of_a/,2,2024

1aljv22,Is my job stealing my pay?,"Hey, I'm not sure if anyone can actually help me figure this out but I have a problem at my job. For some context I work at a medium-sized sized family owned warehousing company. I've been in my position for a bit over a year now and have work at this company in the past but in a different role. My current position it technically commission based, my self and 5 coworkers earn 25% of the total pay the company receives for freight being shipped out from one of our warehouses or that is picked up from 3rd party brokers. We also earn small randomly assigned dollar amounts for extra work that we do on and off property. My issue is that my employer refuses to tell any of us how much we are making prior to us doing any work and if we ask what dollar amount we are making on specific loads we are sometimes given an arbitrary number and other times turned away with a simple I don't know. I've expressed my dismay with this to everyone including the owner and have been told ""We do not have to tell you how much the total load is worth."" Another issue that goes hand in hand with that is each load changes pay on a case by case basis due to market influx which makes it difficult for us 6 to predict our daily and weekly pay. My weekly pay stub only has the dollar amount that is assigned to us but nothing more. No two paychecks are ever the same and have changed drastically week to week. I believe my job is stealing our wages and giving us an any dollar amount they see fit because we don't have any legitimate proof to argue against them. I've also been unsuccessful on finding articles or legal codes on an employer being required to disclose your pay. I enjoy my job and want to stay but can't stay if the pay is going to keep fluctuating.

1aljru3,"Can’t keep up with work as a CSR, advice?","I’m a B2B CSR for a chemical manufacturing company. It is a toxic place with baaad leadership and extremely understaffed. There are 7 CSRs and we are apparently missing 4 CSRs as in the last 6 months they fired 3 and 2 resigned. They are about to move our department to a bad area of town and some people quit because of it. Even with 4-5 more people, I’m still not sure there would be enough staff.

I have been there about ten months. I am doing well but I guess not keeping up, it is hard to keep up with the volume. I am expected to enter orders and respond to emails. The company has a lot of dysfunctional processes. CSRs left and got fired, the department got rearranged, and I got assigned more accounts and responsibilities in a different industry business unit.

We are supposed to enter all new orders within 24 hours, and also respond to all emails within 24 hours. About half or more of orders have issues that need follow up on. Management does go into our orders and track how long it took them to be entered into the system, but nothing else. Every customer thinks their order or request is extremely urgent (they are but everyone’s request is urgent).

I am highly detailed and organized but struggle to keep up. Sometimes I’ll only entered a few orders a day and send 50 emails, but management and higher ups only care about how many and how fast you enter orders. 

I do feel like I organize myself well but there isn’t enough time in the day to get all orders in and emails responded to. I guess I am not prioritizing new orders enough and tend to emails more with order changes, questions, etc.

I’ve always been a top performer at other companies but I guess not here. I think the work I do is good, but not fast enough. 

My manager suggested I not dig into issues much and pass them off to other departments and prioritize new order entry.

I am looking for a new job, because I do not like this company, but also want to work in my workplace habits.

I’ve noticed those who are prioritizing new order entry are neglecting other things like doing order changes and notifying customers of delays or not responding to emails. It almost seems like the unspoken rule is to enter orders at all costs and ignore actual work that needs to be done with existing orders. And not follow processes. Example, the person who enters the most orders daily ignores her daily reports for orders move outs and production delays, and also doesn’t hold up an order if it has a price discrepancy like we are supposed to, and I’ve had a customer or two call in saying she won’t respond to their email, so I would tell the customer to forward it to me so I could handle.

Or, I’m just slow AF and can’t keep up. I know I’ve heard a coworker say, when barraged about not entering orders fast enough, “I guess I just won’t answer emails then.” And also, a coworker whispered to me that she had 600 unread emails, as she just pulls out orders and ignored the rest.",RealAd1811,1,1.0,0,1707355984,2024-02-08 01:33:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aljru3/cant_keep_up_with_work_as_a_csr_advice/,2,2024

1alh67o,Banned from dream job and feeling completely lost,"
Hello everyone,

Since I [25M] was a child I dreamed about being a special agent in the FBI. This was my one professional goal and I crafted every aspect of my life in pursuit of this. I majored in computer science (a field that I am decent at but don’t really enjoy, I only chose it because the FBI has a huge demand for agents from a STEM background). 

I never touched drugs or got into trouble. Nothing so much as a parking ticket. After college I began working as a software engineer in a boring job I dislike just so that I could gain the necessary experience needed to apply to the FBI as a special agent. I applied to the FBI as soon as I met the requisites which was around a year ago. 

I passed all stages of interviews and received a conditional job offer. The last step before I received my final job offer was the polygraph, which the FBI requires for all applicants. 

I won’t get too much into it because I’m not supposed to, but I found out a few weeks ago that I failed the polygraph. I was honest but polygraphs have a high false positive rate. When you fail a polygraph with the FBI, you are banned from employment there indefinitely. 

I feel very lost. This was the one major goal I had in my life. It feels like I’ve worked for up to this point has been for nothing. I still have my software engineering job but it was only ever supposed to be a placeholder until I could get my dream job. The work isn’t fulfilling and I don’t think I could do this for the rest of my life. 

I’m not sure where to go from here. Maybe I sound dramatic, a lot of things in my life haven’t worked out for me but this has really affected me. I have no motivation for my current job anymore. 

I know there’s other agencies besides the FBI but their mission has always been the one that stuck with me. The process of applying to these agencies can take years and most have polygraphs which as I’ve learned can be a coin toss. 

I’m really just looking for any feedback on how to proceed from here. I know it was foolish of me to put all my eggs in one basket but that’s life. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",sunfyre1,1,1.0,0,1707348711,2024-02-07 23:31:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1alh67o/banned_from_dream_job_and_feeling_completely_lost/,2,2024

Today we had a meeting and theres restructuring to make everything more streamlined. It’s a big place and honestly the restructuring would make things better. I was sitting with all of the other supervisors in my department and our boss & she said the other supervisors would get a title change & nothing would change. But in my building, because I dont have a certificate, they are opening the job up for other people to apply. It was kind of humiliating sitting there while my boss said anybody could apply for my job. So i’ve been doing the work as supervisor, without a title change, and without a pay raise and I figured that would change once I get my certificate. It sucks but I really love my job and was willing to accept that until I could get it. Now I just feel used and like i’ve been played. I’m in the supervisor group chat, im doing all the work as supervisor, everyone in my building comes to me because they think im the supervisor. I just feel stupid now. My boss said I could apply and I could interview for the position but she wasn’t sure if i’d get it. She told me to tell them I was working towards getting it, and she’s told everyone that im doing a great job and she’s “gravitating” towards me for the job. I’ve never made any big mistakes, everyone says im doing great, that im great with our residents, this just really sucks. What would you all do? If i applied, my new boss would be my building administrator & we have a good relationship so I feel good about keeping my job. but im not even sure she knew that the restructuring for my department meant id have to interview for it. I plan on talking to her about it but I just feel so god damn stupid and humiliated.

1algavx,Got an interesting offer as a software engineer intern,"Background: I’m currently interning (paid) as a full stack software developer until mid-August. Then, I will go back to school for two semesters and graduate in May 2025. I love my job - I learn a lot, enjoy the people I work with, and have a relaxed environment to grow with. I’ve worked as an intern at another company previously, who I believe would extend a full-time offer, but my current job aligns much better with my career goals.

  
My boss messaged me asking to talk today and they basically told me I have been doing a really good  job. They asked if I was interested in working part-time when I return to school, to which I agreed since I could use some extra money.

  
Then, they told me they’re going to pay me more. They said if I commit now to working part-time and then transitioning into a full-time role (post-graduation), I will get an even larger raise. Specific numbers were not discussed yet, but once I determine how many hours I can commit to part-time, I'll ask for more details.

  
The offer caught me off guard, but I am definitely interested in working with the company full-time. However, I don’t want to make a choice I’ll regret later on. With the way the job markets been, it also seems safer to me to accept the offer and agree to work full-time.

  
TLDR: My boss thinks I’m good at my job, told me I’m getting a raise. They offered me an even larger raise if I commit to a part-time work while I wrap up school and a full-time job.

  
I’m interested in hearing what the community thinks. Would you accept the offer? Why or why not?

1aleykx,Should I Quit My Master's Program?,"I am in my first semester of my clinical mental health counseling masters program and I have been hating it. I'm taking a skills class and we have been doing mock counseling sessions, but it is not how I thought it would be. We are not allowed to give advice, we are taught that we are only allowed to listen and give minimal encouragers/paraphrase to get the client to keep talking and to figure out their own way. I would walk out of a counseling session if someone just repeated everything I said. I thought this career was about helping people and being able to learn the skills to give them the coping skills and to help them see what they cannot. I understand that some people are not able to recognize how they feel, but we are not even allowed to ask them about their feelings. There are so many rules and this is just not what I thought it was. I am 34 years old and it has taken me so long to find a career path that I was passionate about and this is just so discouraging. I guess I just need advice. Has anyone gone through this? Is there another career path that could be better for me? I need something active, helpful, and that does not limit me.

1aldl90,"Totally lost and struggling as a junior almost year in first tech job, what to do?","So I joined a relatively small startup almost a year ago as a Data Scientist. Its a  very small DS team of only 2 people, one senior and one mid. I am a junior which it is my 1st job straight outta college and I only did 1 internship before.  
  
Everything is great there, the benefits, the people. They are very patient with me and I'm also learning a lot from other people not in my department (Backend, DevOps etc). I do mostly ML engineering recently but overall I do a little bit of everything including Data Analysis, QA, SWE etc. I personally don't mind as I am learning a lot through the way but I feel very exhausted and fatigued. The environment is chaotic as expected from a startup, we do a lot of status meetings and like I said I am doing WAY more than my original responsibility. I am always late on tasks, been stuck on one for a month of rewriting the entire service and every time new issue comes up and I'm just driving my supervisor crazy because I always need help. I am sometimes struggling of total grasping of how some parts of the code works or sometimes forget things that were explained to me before because I've moved to new things. It's an entire mess and I am getting super desperate because I'm drowning and can't find the way up and no one approaches to take the task from me or help me.  
  
I did get positive feedback in the review meeting and I did make hella progress since I started there. I also know I'm strong technically and with a lot of theoretical knowledge and capabilities but I still have the feeling I am a drag on the team. Like I said I really love the job and the people, I don't make that much but it's great learning place and it's super important to me to do everything to not be released from it.

1ald9uh,Is this standard practice?,"I’m looking to get my first job in customer service/ advertising and it was looking fine but a few red flags started popping up but I’m not sure if this is standard for the industry.

First off they kept making it clear I would be an independent contractor and not an employee. I figured that wasn’t too odd but they also said that means I need to pay for my own background check, and pay for their mandatory training. 

The training takes about 3-6 weeks and it honestly sounds like they want me to work for free in that time but I’m unsure.

And lastly and probably the biggest red flag to me is they’re looking to have me pay 50 dollars every pay period to cover admin services, scheduling tools, and technical support.

Overall, the job doesn’t pay great, and theres these weird terms and conditions but I don’t know if I’m just being stuck up and naive about the job market.",Remarkable-Creme7898,1,1.0,3,1707338998,2024-02-07 20:49:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ald9uh/is_this_standard_practice/,2,2024

However, I’m struggling a lot to meet the standards of the shop and my confidence is being destroyed and I’m scared of being fired. Im doing my best to learn and improve but I’ve only been here for maybe a month and change so far so my improvement hasn’t been drastic.

i don’t have a degree or even been to college for any IT-related stuff, but after doing web design for 7 months on the side at work, i’ve found that i really enjoy it. it’s challenging and i’m constantly learning new things. i can really see myself doing it as a career in the future if i work hard. i don’t have a concrete idea of what specific field id like to go into, but i’ve been researching mobile app development and it sounds the most interesting to me.

1al9umk,negotiating my salary,"so I recently got offered a manager position. I always get flustered on the salary negotiation part and usually just agree on what they offer me. This time though I made a lot more as a PRN (I’m an RN) and wanted to make at least the same as what I was making.
So here’s what happened, hiring manager asked me what I was looking for, I got nervous and low balled myself meanwhile she sounded happy. She called me back and gave me 5k more of what I said. I told her I will take it but then I thought about it and realized I really don’t want to take a pay cut for more responsibility and working more hours. Also I realized that the other manager is leaving and I will be the only one until they found another manager (in my experience it took so long for them to start hiring people so I don’t even know when they will hire another one). Also I think I have to mention that I waited 2 weeks from the time I agreed to the time I realized I want to negotiate my salary again (because of some personal issues) so she wasn’t happy about that either. last time we spoke she said they don’t want to give me what I was asking and basically told me that they gave me the highest they can for my experience (which isn’t true because I have more experience than the other manager who is leaving and they gave her more money, although she does have masters and I don’t).

1al9ij8,Problem with my (toxic?) middle manager for a change of role,"Hey everyone,

I just got into a junior position into a venture builder in which there are two divisions: greenfield projects and brownfield projects. Respectively new and mature tech.
I initially stated the preference for GF projects, but now in very first days I realized that I hate it as it is only PMO and given my previous VC experience I want to do more financials, which is core to the brownfield part.

Today is day 4 and I spoke with my line (GF) middle manager softly and politely explaining that I would like to change division as I really want to build financial modeling skills as a professional. 
He told me that it is a very bad sign especially in the 4th day and that he will take care of this and coming back to me with an answer in a week.

I think this was a very weird answer as he did not propose to organize a call and explicitly asked me to not talk with the BF manager. He neither organized a meeting with the  managers and partners (it’s a small team every knows each other and partners are very open)

I do not know what to do. I do not want to wait a week as a new guy is entering in the BF position next week. I want to have visibility and actively discuss of this, as I am afraid he will not correctly present the situation to the partners.
Moreover, I could reach out to the other employers that offered me m&a positions in the previous weeks to ask if they would reconsider.

What would you suggest me to do? Should I push for a faster answer? Ignore the GF manager and contact the other line manager?",Tasty-Raspberry-9658,1,1.0,0,1707329643,2024-02-07 18:14:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1al9ij8/problem_with_my_toxic_middle_manager_for_a_change/,2,2024
1al9ca3,Do i move on?,"Hi, sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile. Please be as respectful as you can about this as I’m at a loss and I don’t know how to gauge any of it.

I’m 20yo, accepted a position as a biller at a small billing company. I have an associates degree and my high school diploma.

I’ve been at this job for a year and a half. I’m making $15 an hour. I also recently moved an hour away from the office, because I was living check to check at my apartment closer to the office. I moved back in with family.

This is where things get tricky- we’re a small company. My manager currently used to be a coworker of mine at a restaurant. They decided they liked my work ethic and asked me if I wanted out of the service industry. I said yes! Please! First big girl job at 20 in healthcare with set hours and benefits? Sign me up!

Everyone in the office is tight knit. Like, family friends type shit. They’ve known each other for 8+ years. Everyone knows everything about everyone. Initially, I thought this was cool- being friends with the managers. Not so much anymore.

I was hired as an account manager but have just been floating. I don’t have any accounts, but I handle tasks they throw at me as needed. Lately I’ve become someone who they dump everything onto. I feel like I have no official role in the office, I just do everyone’s backwash work (for lack of better words). People give me tasks they find too difficult or tasks they simply don’t want to do. This isn’t what I was hired for.

I’m asked to run errands for my boss. I pick up lunch almost every day for the office per managers request and am not compensated for it. I pick up their kids from school upon request and am not compensated for it. At first, I thought this was their way of making friends, but after a year of busting my ass and not getting a simple “thank you”, it feels like I’m being used. Maybe this is normal and I’m asking too much.

I was promised a raise a year, but it wasn’t in my contract so I’m unable to enforce it. They tell me I need to go to the higher up boss to ask for a raise, but that I need to meet him in person. He lives out of state and the only conferences they have are for managers only. They’ve given the two newest employees raises, and they’ve only been here 6 & 8 months. 

Essentially, the only work I do is assigned to me by my boss. I’ve tried to take the initiate of helping out where else it’s needed (backing up another coworker, physically cleaning the office, asking if I can help elsewhere) but I’m never given anything and have been reprimanded for helping another coworker.

I’m told I’m a star employee, I’m flexible, I’m awesome at my job, etc. but I’m not being treated or paid like I am.

I know for some people it sounds like a no brainer, but I’m new to the corporate world and have no scope on this. My idea or plan currently is to wait until my two year mark and ask for either a raise, or that I’m able to work remote because of moving an hour away. But part of me wants to say fuck it and start looking for other jobs now. Some people I’ve asked for advice tell me to look elsewhere, that I can make more money easily. Others tell me to stick it out.

Any advice is appreciated.

1al8wid,Lowball offer to relocate,"Late last year I got covid for the first time, and it sucked at worse than I thought it would. I've been a remote worker in the analytical equipment industry for about 6 years. During the height of my feverish delusion, I was convinced that I was going to be fired because my management was pressuring me to finish a bunch of work before the end of the year. It turned out they had gotten wind that another department was going to approach me about a position and they were fairly certain I'd take it. The job is actually great and something I really think I'd enjoy and excel at, and as the only person in my company of a few thousand who's ever worked in the industry that we service, I'm uniquely qualified. On it's face, my only complaint is that this role is focused on the Americas rather than global like my current role, but it's still a promotion, so there's room to move back to a global focus later. Weirdly, the position also requires relocation to the bay area, despite us not having an office there, and while we have customers and potential customers in the bay area, it makes up less than 5 percent in the Americas. I live near a relatively inexpensive city on the east coast, but I like northern California, so I'm open to the relocation for the right position. The city I live in is actually the third largest hub for the industry behind the bay area, and is very under serviced, so it's not a bad place to be. 

I finally got the offer last week and I was shocked when the hr person was very excited about ""how much"" they'd been able to get for me. It was a 15% increase from my current position, and a relatively anemic relocation package. I did the math and if I moved 2-3 hours from sfo, the 15% bump would equate to a 15% pay cut. Obviously, I'm not going to take that deal, but I'm not sure what to do. 

I just drafted a counter offer but I included two scenarios, with data to back up my rationale. Scenario 1 was a 25% increase in pay and I don't have to relocate, since I can do the job just as well from any location. The pay increase feels reasonable since I bring critical industry  knowledge/connections and will have a direct impact on revenue from our fastest growing industry in our most underperforming regions. Scenario 2 is a 65% increase in pay and a 120% increase in the relocation package. The initial offer kind of soured me on relocating at all, but without a doubt, I'm not willing to uproot my life for anything less than an amazing opportunity. If they accept this counter, I might just take the pay bump and pay for my own travel out there when needed, but never actually use the relo money (though this might be unethical and a fireable offense), just kind of drag my feet past the unofficial 6 month transition period. I could honestly afford a small apartment at that rate in Vacaville or Sacramento, and actually show residency and have a place to stay while in town, though I'm not a fan of the state tax rate. I'm also thinking of saying that I want the relocation cost repayment clause taken out unless they're guaranteeing employment for that length of time. Scenario 1 would save the company closer to $100k in relocation package, and a significant amount in salary, ands the only downside I can see is that it wouldn't look as impressive as it would if we had someone ""dedicated"" to the bay area, even if it's not actually true. 

Now this whole thing is complicated by the fact that the day before I got the offer an old colleague reached out because they're having a really hard time finding someone with my profile, and do I know anyone. I said, ""well... there's me..."" and he immediately responded with a dinner invite. At dinner he said he didn't think I'd leave my company, which is why he didn't ask me directly. At the end of the night he asked me if I'd be willing to relocate to the west coast, and I did yes, but I'd rather not. He then kind of sheepishly explained that the company pays significantly more for west coast workers, but that the remote pay wasn't terrible, and said they'd probably offer me an amount 2.5x my current salary but suggested I try to negotiate for a number 3x my salary. I really did my best to not spit my drink all over him. Now this job is nebulous, as in I don't know if I'll end up getting an offer, while the original is concrete. If I make the counter and they accept one of them, but in a month a get a MUCH better offer and leave the company all together, I'm going to feel like a real ass hat. 

Any thoughts on how to navigate this? How crazy is making two parallel counter offers?

I’m 25 and completed a bachelor’s degree in health & biomedical sciences since I wanted to go to med school. Unfortunately I’m not quite cut out for it. So upon graduating I decided to complete my MBA since most jobs I’d get with my bachelors degree would be in labs (not something that I wanted to do). I also completed some courses on data analytics that covered SQL, powerbi, and Excel. (Not sure if relevant, was just interested in learning this) 

Nonetheless I finished my MBA and have about 2.5 years of project coordination/project assistance experience, specifically in the healthcare sector. I also have 4 years of experience in retail sales selling phone plans & home services. I enjoyed my time at both of these roles but I feel that in my current role I am not learning anything new.

I'm good at what I do. I've been invited to a few art exhibits, asked to submit my works for residency programs. To put food on the table and to pay my bills, I'm forced to apply to any jobs available. Unfortunately, I don't have any skills needed to do the job. I'm only applying because I need the money. 

My first job is being an office admin worker. Minimum wage ($6.50/DAY) and I don't get to do much. The only thing I hate is the 3 hour commute everyday. I was busy attending gallery events, doing network and putting my name out there so I was always absent. The manager suggested I should resign.

My second job is online during the lockdown. I was tasked to help design a book cover. I'm not good at graphic design but had to lie because I badly need the job. I have excuse after excuse after excuse of not executing or doing my work properly: bad internet, power outage, storm. My contract was only for a month, and I ghosted them in the last 3 days. I had another freelance job with the same responsibilities and I ghosted the client too.

My final job I was fired immediately because of a misunderstanding, I didn't send the correct invoice. It was an okay job, and I worked for a year. Now I'm looking for a new job and I realized that I can never have my former employees/clients as my reference because I failed in all those jobs. 

I guess I wasn't good at these jobs is because they're not really what I want to do and I feel forced to do them because it feeds me and pays the expenses. I interned at an art gallery before and I did well at that. Unfortunately, the gallery wasn't hiring so I wasn't employed there.

I recently got offered a Quality Systems Officer Role in a start up ( they have approved products but are now growing there team- they have about 20 people in the company so far) I work in a company with over 1000 people . 

The new role will mean wearing many different hats and helping other departments like they will help me etc. it’s fully remote bar one day a week and they are offering a 6000 rise on my current pay. 

I am a low level engineer here and have a very difficult manager and a toxic culture but other than that I love
It here and get on well with many people and feel like I belong .

I am just afraid I am not qualified enough for this new role as it seems quite high up compared to an entry level position.

Recently I have been stressing out about money because I don’t make a lot as a substitute acutally barely to cover any of my utilities. However this one particular school has had their eye on me and the Assistant principal invited for me to apply to the following school year 24-25 for one their teaching positions. I haven’t gotten an interview as of now but I was thinking of getting a 2nd job which I did receive at the bank for answering customer inquiries for like $16 an hour which is slightly higher than the daily pay as a sub. The only issue is it is $16 an hour and but there is room for growth and promotion. I’m afraid if i get the teaching job in like August, I would have to leave my bank job Since I was considering it since I don’t get paid in the summer as a sub. I don’t know if i should stick to my bank job or get the job as a teacher for high school students which are my favorites. I was also offered a long term position from the school for only 2 months but don’t know if I should accept or deny it due to only have a secure job 2 months then again having to look for shifts as a sub. The only thing is after April when the job ends I would go back to regular sub schedule and unpredicted days if I will work or not until the end of the school year which is until May and no summers which is why I wanted to get the 2nd job now to prevent being unpaid during that time. My bank seemed very friendly and I got along very smoothly with the team and management. There is opportunities to grow for the bank and I also getting my MBA in case things don’t work out for my career as a teacher I have lots of experience in the retail world as well as teaching..However the school that has been having their eye on me, it has been too good to me and I LOVE IT! Agh, I don’t know what to do!!! I accepted the job offer from the bank and in the process of a background check. I don’t know what to choose, so far i haven’t gotten the interview yet as a teacher but I know its coming soon. Please help me make a decision, thank you!!!

My grades are decent (>3.5) and I have a bit of experience in debate (became best debater of last year's tournament in my university). However,  I feel like I'm truly not fit to be an engineer/researcher. I am more into theoretical knowledge than practicals.

I have no passion for my major and chose it because I was curious about the physics of human body. My curiosity has been satiated and I'm no longer interested in any of the sub fields of my subject. Although, I enjoyed that one product design course on solidworks back in 2nd year. I have tried falling in love with BME, tried enjoying coding, building stuff and academic writing but nothing ignited passion. I can't change major at this point and my university has a closed credit system anyway. I won’t drop out though, I must finish my degree. I'm worried about my career afterwards. 

I love learning. A LOT. That's why my initial plan was to join academia. But not in this subject. I can't sit hours and hours pondering over fields that I can't contribute to. It makes me feel like a loser.

I have always enjoyed reading about religion, history, wars, ancient civilizations,  anthropology and linguistics. None of these seem to be related to my major except perhaps anthropology (i.e. genomics). I would love to become academician in any of these, or related, humanities based subjects. Kindly, help me out guys:

1. Will it be a good decision to shift? Should I just remain in Science and shift to a more theoretical subject for M.Sc.?
2. Is it even possible to shift? Will it lessen my chances of getting a scholarship for masters or masters-PhD in Europe/Autralia/ East Asia? 
3. Can my engineering degree be of any help in those fields or put me at an advantageous position? 
4. What subject will be the safest and easiest transition for me? What will be the easiest subject to become an academician? 
5. What skills should I acquire before graduating?

There are only 5 employees total including the owner/my boss. I’ve been with my company for 2.5 years and we’ve been in business for 4 years total.

Some background information.  
  
Studies: Commercial Economics (University of Applied Sciences, Bachelor of Science) Graduating in February 2025, 5 month internship + writing thesis as of September 2024. After the bachelor I want to do an MBA, which might require a GMAT or pre-master, so from February 2025 till June 2025 I want to finish this, so I can start in September 2025 with my masters (1 year).

Professional work experience: 1 year internship during studies. Job Title: Assistant Key Account Manager for Reckitt. FMCG company (Finish, Vanish, Durex, Air Wick). Reckitt offered me a full time job, but I rejected it because I wanted to keep studying. I said I wanted to work part-time instead, and that offer was accepted. Since I started planning for my mandatory (thesis-)internship I am looking for a different company. Did several charity board years. 

\- I would like to live abroad, so I am planning to do this internship in Berlin (currently Amsterdam).   
\- I don’t want to work in the FMCG sector again.   
\- I would like to look into options in Tech, such as SaaS. But since I have no friends or family with experience in this industry, I would like to know what different jobs are accessible for me with my unfinished bachelor as an intern.   
\- I would prefer larger multinational companies, English speaking (Salesforce, SAP).

  
1. What are some of the different roles that interns can have in SaaS companies? What are the typical tasks and responsibilities of each role?  
2. Does anyone have experience working (as an intern) in the SaaS sector in Berlin? If yes, what was/is your role? And how is it like to work there and what are the pros and cons?  
3. What skills and qualifications are needed to get a job in the SaaS sector? How can I improve my resume and cover letter to stand out to potential employers?  
4. Which (multinational) SaaS companies in Berlin are looking for interns or graduates?   
5. How common is it to work in English in Berlin-based companies? Do I need to speak German or can I get by with English only?



If there are questions, I can specify.

1al27fl,Getting over fear of job hopping,"Hello redditors, 

I've been with the same company for over 5 years and love it! My salary has increased, but so have my responsibilities. Unfortunately, it seems that I've reached a point where I will only get the annual 2-3% increase and get promoted years down the line for a miserable 8-10%. I've noticed a lot of my coworkers leave to competitors for a substantial raise and some return for even a bigger raise. 

What is the issue? I know I have job security here, I love my bosses, and my team is extremely qualified (we are talking people with over 20 years of experience), which makes my job as a PM very easy. Furthermore, my bosses also like working with me, My concern is job hopping for another 15-20% without these guarantees. I now have a family, and a mortgage and do value job security.

1al0xjy,I'm really struggling to find work ?,"I've been informed since November that my current workplace will close in January, so I have time beforehand to start searching for work. I made a resume and applied to at least 50 places in November and December, and I had a lot of good opportunities. I would even say there were like 2-3 ""dream"" jobs where I'd get to the third and fourth interviews....but then get rejected. This alone would damage me badly because the interviewing processes were really smooth, and I actually told a lot of friends and family members about upcoming good jobs, but I didn't even get them in the end.  
  
I've been discouraged but didn't stop looking for jobs and continued applying, and the thing is that employers don't really care about you starving or not having work for months because I still have two upcoming ""last"" interviews from December last year, and I just can't keep doing this for months more. When I apply to 50 job offers, I willl receive like 4–5 answers within 2 weeks, and after the first interview, it's a plus week to get to the next step. And if I proceed and, after one plus week (again), get the chance to actually get the job, then I'm just rejected in the end. Now all my ""best bets"" are gone and I'm applying to any kinds of job offers, but I see that the cycle is repeating, and I will need another 3–4 weeks to get to the ""last interviews"" and then get rejected because somebody is hiring their brother instead of me or somebody asked for a 1 dollar less salary.  
  
Also, the moment something gets published, it has like at least 20 new candidates, and I constantly refresh and check job alerts, but I'm not always that fast. And even if I am, in the end, I'm still competing with 40 more people who may have asked for less money or have more knowledge than me.

Just seeking some advice for a situation that I (26M) find myself in (in Australia). 

My partner (25f) and I have been in a relationship for abit over 2yrs and reside together. we both work in the same field and actually met at a previous job, where she worked before I joined the org. We began dating while working in the same office (on different teams) but didn't tell anyone and kept our in office relationship strictly professional (only speaking when needed and didn't sit together at lunch etc). Eventually I moved to a new office (same org) and then eventually my partner got a new job at a new org. 

Moving to now - my partner has been at the new org for about 14 months. They have recently had a position come up that I believe I am well suited to, and am considering applying as it is a step into a leadership role for me. The position does not really relate to my partners role but seems to have some overlap (very very minimal by my partners experience). 

I just wanted to get some advice on if I should apply for this job, what I should consider when I do, and if it gets to that point - when should I mention to the org that my partner works there? Any other advice is appreciated also!

My partner and I have spoken about my possible application and we are both in agreeance that we are okay if this was to occur.

The job isn't going well as I have a lot of gaps in my education and that makes it really hard to be able to follow and I take some extra time in tasks.  

As I have feared, my manager wants to schedule a meeting with HR to discuss my work. He framed it as ""understanding how can our communication get better and how can he help me more as he has 20+ years of experience and perhaps things are sometimes too obvious for him', but I know this is just a nice way of putting that I am sucking at my job and take too much time even at the simplest of tasks... I feel so ashamed and I am scared of getting fired not only for the shame but also because I don't know what I can do financially then (no savings) and I fear no other company will hire me.

1akw97e,Networking to get a promotion / Playing the “corporate game”,"I’m 36/m and have worked for large corporations almost my entire professional career.  In every stage of my career, I’ve always been lauded by my managers/supervisors for the quality of my work, my work ethic and the results I produce.  However, pretty much every promotion I’ve gotten was essentially because I forced a managers hand, either by giving 2 weeks notice and then getting a counter offer that resulted in a promotion and salary increase, or by applying to a higher level role on another team that either resulted in me taking that role, or getting a promotion within my current team because a manager didn’t want to lose me.  

This path has been tumultuous at times, but I can’t argue with the results - I’m now making over 6 figures and I currently have pretty good job security as well as plenty of fallback options if things went south for me.  All this to say, I don’t have much to complain about.

I recently jumped ship to a new company and am coming up on 2 years here.  The role I hired into at this company is one that I was on paper over qualified for, but the company offered me a salary number that my previous employer couldn’t come close to matching and this role offered better work/life balance so I took it.  After working here for 2 years though, it’s clear (at least to me) that I should be in a higher role and I’ve brought this topic up with my manager.  

In my current company, promotions have to be “signed off” on by at least 2 managers in my division that are 1 level above my manager.  Essentially this means they have to know who I am and/or the work that I do.  Without going too deep into it, my team is somewhat of a niche team that our higher level leadership doesn’t keep too close of a pulse on, so they don’t see a lot of what I or any of my teammates produce or do because of the way our division is structured.

My manager knows this and is recommending I “network” with those skip level leaders more so they get to know me better, and thus would be more inclined to approve my promotion.  To be honest (and this is the crux of my post), the thought of that feels so contrived and fake and really bugs me.  I’ve always been someone who lets my work speak for itself, and I’ve never been one to rub elbows with senior leaders just to get a promotion.  The thought of doing this just makes me cringe inside.

On the flip side though, I feel if I want to continue to move up in my career, I’m going to have to eventually bite the bullet and play the “corporate game” to make connections, etc.  What’s somewhat holding me up on that though is that I felt I built good connections in my last company (I was on first name basis with the CEO) and that got me nowhere.

So - as a mid-30’s professional, do I suck it up and shmooze with the higher ups, or go find another employer who values me on my work, rather than who knows me?",175doubledrop,1,1.0,0,1707286107,2024-02-07 06:08:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1akw97e/networking_to_get_a_promotion_playing_the/,2,2024
1akvosu,Need Career Advice,"24M. Been depressed lately. I live in NY still at home with my parents, bachelors in business marketing. I currently have an office job that I've had for about 5 years now and has a lot of pros. My coworkers even joke that they will never give it up. And outsiders joke that they can't wait for me to leave so they can take my spot. It is a very easy office job, 5 minute commute from my house, work with friends/family, make decent money, paid vacation/PTO, 401K match, bonus, whole nine yards and we all look out for each other. Problem is although I'd hate leaving, this is pretty much a dead end job for atleast the near future and I am only making about 50k so I cant really financially support myself on my own with just this. This has led me to start considering other career options but I have had no luck finding anything marketing related.  

Now today, I got a legit offer from a friend working a supervisory role at a medical facility in Florida making roughly the same wage. Now although it is the same wage, this would be a huge boost for me in terms of resume and growth oppurtunity. I have also considered pursuing going back to school for something medical related, so this would help me make that decision. Fortunately, he told me I can stay with him, save my money until I can get something of my own so I wouldn't really have to worry about the the financial aspect. But as an introvert, who feels comfortable at home, it would kind of be a tough transition for me and I would feel like a burden. 

But heres where I'm torn. I have lived in NY my whole life and went to local community college so I've never even been away from home for more than just a couple of vacation days. One part of me says I am 24 with no wife/girlfriend this is my oppurtunity to get up and make a move although that would mean leaving my parents, brother, sister, grandparents, nieces, etc. It eats me up feeling like I just been stagnant and still do not have a career, just watching the time go by. This can be a major career oppurtunity but also help me grow up. I'd just hate to leave, regret it in 6 months and now I lost my office job. 

Would love some feedback and advice on this.

1akvkxy,Looking for advice on negotiating salary (promotion),"I work as a lab tech and I interviewed for a promotion, and I expect to get it. I am very highly paid for my current position, and I expect the offer to come in well beneath what I would like to earn.  My base pay is $75,254.40 (Hourly employee switching to salary). In my experience, promotion offers are called over the phone, if that matters. From all of the scattered data I've found online, the Lab Supervisor position in my area makes around $85k - $90k. I expect them to offer me $83K-$85K. I want to negotiate to $105K. The minimum that I would accept for the role is (Will edit in true value after I do my budget, probably 88K-94K range) 

**I plan to present the following when I receive the call regarding my offer:**

My previous years earnings with our company (gross pay):   
2020 - $100,904.40  
2021 - $111,136.46  
2022 - $127,189.25  
2023 - $159,007.09  
  
My remarks regarding my worth:  
  
\-I've gotten an ""Exceeds Expectations"" performance rating for 2 of the last 3 years.  
\-My promotions and annual compensation over the past few years shows that I'm a valuable asset to this company.  
\-I have been in the field for 12 years and with this company for 5 of those years, all of which have had some aspect of acting in a leadership role.

\-I have proven myself to be capable of learning, growth, and have shown my willingness to perform to the best of my ability for our company.  
\-My pay request is a representation of how I perceive my own value, and while it may be higher than the industry standard, I, as well as my leadership, would agree that I am not a standard employee.  
\-I understand that I will have to accept less than my previous years, however, I do feel that the  
company could work with me to achieve a salary that is beneficial to the both of us.  
\-I want to be able to focus entirely on performing as well as I can for the company. xxx,xxx is the   
value that would allow me to concentrate on my duties and fulfill my needs.  
**End of remarks**

\-Please tell me if my salary expectations seem reasonable (too high, too low)

\-Are there any problems with my remarks? (Couldn't find conclusive pay ranges for this position)

\-If aiming for $105K, what should I actually ask for?

\-The Lab Manager that I interviewed with told me that because I'm an internal employee, that I wouldn't be eligible for the $10k sign on bonus, but to work it into salary negotiations. Tips on this? (We didn't discuss any figures)

\-Any other advice or feedback will be appreciated

1akvge3,Recent Graduate lost in this world,"I have just graduated last year from the University of Newcastle with a bachelor of business majoring in both leadership and management as well as international business. The first year of post graduate life I wanted to secure a simple job for the mean time whilst I look for my ""dream career"" not only to build my job experience but also to obtain an income to survive. I started my post graduate life working at McDonald Jones Homes were I was a building and design consultant which has the least to do with my degree but nevertheless the pay was sufficient and the hours were suitable. The true job hunt ensued all whilst designing and drawing up peoples dream homes late at night in my three bedroom share house in which I dwelt. There was once a sense of wonder and whimsical childlike innocence that came with reading into these job descriptions and thinking what if, the jobs I was apply to at this time were truly in ever sense of the word ""dream jobs"". Alas, my efforts were in vein. Perhaps I was naïve regarding what I was capable of because I did not hear back from almost any of these jobs. It evident that I had to lower my expectations and be more realistic which is what I did as I started to apply to the next levels of jobs. I thought it might be as simple as putting in more effort into my cover letters. Thus, I spent hours upon hours writing what I thought of as magnificent works of literacy to engage employers and give me a chance of having a life that I wanted to live. 

I was having very little luck and felt tremendously lost as to why I had just done four years of university to be sitting in a very bare bones job I didn't particularly like ticking my time away, day by day as they roll together. I had soon learned of our Japanese office for McDonald Jones Homes and thought that would be a great place to start for my career in international business. We had a sales meeting coming up and I knew the CEO would be present, this was my chance. I prepared what I wished to say and had a aura of confidence that all would go well. Approaching the CEO of a rather large multinational company is much like going up the marble steps to meet with god but I was determined to change my life and make it one worth my time. I had him completely alone at the bar of the event, it felt although the time was right as if in this cosmic nightmare their was a sense of fate that had given me the perfect opportunity to say my peace. We hit it off to say the least as I started off with small talk and getting to know him as a person rather than a deity. He informed me of how he came to be in this role which rattled my brain a bit and put things into perspective on how the world works. He told me that he was friends with one of the directors and he's family had already established a small building company and it kind of just fell into his lap, he then went on to tell me of the importance of networking. I don't know if he was slightly intoxicated or if the forces of this world decided to give me a chance but I secured an interview with the head of corporate affairs the month after the conference but order of the CEO. I had my meeting with the head of corporate affairs which was a magical experience but he was quite shocked as to how I secured the meeting or why he was seeing me at all. He told me that we would stay in contact and the overall sense of the meeting was quite positive or so I thought. 

The next week I had a meeting with my manager and he brought up the meeting and was very displeased that it ever occurred. He then proceeded to bring in the HR manager and they terminated my employment. 

&#x200B;

I am now in another role which is a bit more closely related to business but I am still apply to jobs. I really don't know to express my feelings, I feel cheated in all honesty. My question for you is what am I to do? how am I suppose to fulfil my yearning for working in the role in which I studied for such a substantial amount of my life? I'm quite lost with my life and feel although it is becoming to late to even keep trying (age 24).

1akv5dk,Comp Sci graduate with decent experience but unable to secure a job,"Hi all,

So I’ll try to be brief, I graduated from a good uni in Canada in June 2023. During my time at uni, despite there being a pandemic I was able to work internships. One was for a support analyst role and one for software engineer. I have a total of about 16-20 months of relevant IT experience in good reputable companies. However I’m still struggling to find a full time/contract position after graduating. I tapped into my network and applied to some positions through referrals but still no luck. I even asked some of the senior engineers who I worked with to review my resume and they said it’s pretty solid. I have applied to over 300 jobs but not a single interview call. I am so shocked that I’m struggling so much to land a job despite having good experience for an entry level role. I am so stumped as to why I’m not seeing any success or even slow progress. 

Does anyone have suggestions on what might be the reason for this? Any advice is appreciated, thanks for reading!",bluetealsky,1,1.0,0,1707282305,2024-02-07 05:05:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1akv5dk/comp_sci_graduate_with_decent_experience_but/,2,2024
1akux1l,Confused on which career path to take,"I have about a year left of school before I go to college. I'm torn between two totally different career paths. 

The first one is to become an esthetician (skincare specialist). I love skincare and think it would be fun to have that as a job. There is a college half an hour from my house that has that program. It would save me money if I lived at home while going to college. It is also close to home and I can stay with my family and not get homesick. 

The second one is to become an ultrasound technician. I would get to see what a baby looks like in fetal development. The job would pay more than being an esthetician, but it would take longer too. Another problem with this is that the only colleges in my state that offer this program are 3 hrs away from home. 

I still have a year to think about this but wasn't sure if anyone could give me advice on how to figure this out.",VegetableCat8516,1,1.0,1,1707281564,2024-02-07 04:52:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1akux1l/confused_on_which_career_path_to_take/,2,2024

Should I keep info like my Major/Minor, graduation date, GPA (3.35) and university?

I was also in Gamma Iota Sigma which is a professional society for Risk Management, Insurance, and Actuarial Science. I'm currently in the industry that business frat is for, but I didn't do much and I'm no longer a member. Should I keep this?

I think I will be fine if I can get an interview. I typically interview well and I've done really well at my current job the last 1-2 years and can really talk to that/show it on my resume. I just don't want to take up too much space with my one job (although it's my only real experience) and also look silly with college stuff I may be to old to be showing.

1aksyqc,Internship regret,"I went through a lot of stress picking an internship and decided to go with an accounting one. It is a niche role though that as I progress in school, I have no more interest in it, and I am literally changing my second major because I do not care about it. The other one (insurance brokerage) I was deciding between asked me if I still am interested even though its been 2 months. I accepted my other internship in November and I don't want to rescind my offer because I went to a lot of networking things with them, and I am pretty sure I would get paid 15 more dollars an hour at this internship. At the same time, I should not care about money because it is an internship. But fyi my ""end goal"" is closer to the internship I do not have because it is in the insurance field. The insurance field I am interested in is surety underwriting. I am currently building my network in that field so whe I graduate I can have a step up. I know it would be a terrible move to rescind offer because I literally signed a contract thing. I just do not want to mess up my career this early.

1aksx7o,Recruitment process moving faster than anticipated,"I work in consulting and went onto “the bench” about 2.5 weeks ago. (This is completely normal as I look for billable work) Typically someone like me can be on the bench for 2-3 months before being let go. It’s a little concerning because although my firm is large, we’ve been losing a lot of my work. 

I still want to stay at my firm but submitted an application to a couple of our competitors over the weekend. On Monday a recruiter reached out to me and I have a screening call with the recruiter tomorrow.

I wasn’t expecting this type of turnaround and had built in a timeline so that in case anything goes wrong, I’d have a fall back. I also have a few potentials within my firm.

It’s moving faster than I expected and I’m wondering if it’s acceptable to set an expectation with the recruiter at the other firm. If she asks me in for an interview, I’m concerned I’ll be offered (last time I interviewed with another firm I was offered while in the office) and either have to jump before some of my internal opportunities play out.

Is it ok to at least be upfront that the process is moving a couple weeks faster than anticipated at the end of the phone screen if she offers me an interview?

I’m looking for some advice here. I’m currently in the IT field working as an ISSO and would like to transition to what I’m passionate about -aerospace/astronautical engineering. I have a B.S. in Space Studies with a concentration in Aerospace Science from American Public University and am looking at expanding my education further into the aerospace field but don’t really know where to begin. I’ve got a few trains of thought though that essentially boil down to:

-Pursue an online M.S. in Aerospace Engineering and apply for engineering positions while pursuing this degree. 

-Pursue an online PhD in Aerospace Engineering (one from the University of Alabama, Mississippi State University etc…) and apply for engineering positions while pursuing this degree. 

-Get a graduate certificate in a topic like Spaceflight Mechanics, Mechatronics, Hypersonics or something similar which would help fill in more of my background knowledge and potentially help get me into an engineering job. 

Ultimately, I’m just trying to get into this field and do what’s actually engaging work for me as opposed to being bored with the IT world. Additionally, accomplishing a PhD in Aerospace/Astronautical Engineering would be the goal for education so if I pursue the certificate or M.S. option, I’ll still look at pursuing a PhD eventually.

1akrfyw,"What is more relevant, a general ed degree in IT or several big relevant certifications?","I just landed a big IT sales role and I love it.  The company I'm with is in 50 countries and the possibilities will be near limitless. They have over 200 products and services and if I make friends and do this right I'll have a lot of options. But I want to set myself up for the future and not remain stagnant in my career and personal development.  I'm 38, have a degree in Econ and three IT certs (SAAC02, CCP, and AZ-900).  

First, the degree in Econ should be an IT degree but my life was going a different direction in 2013.  Second, I love sales. I'm good at it. I'm open and direct (with tact when need be), I make fast friends, I love building new relationships and I'm not afraid to ask uncomfortable questions about budget and timelines to move a sale along. (relevant later) My background consists of sales and customer service roles back since forever. I've worked commissioned W2 roles as a sales rep, as a server and more recently bartending after I got myself a bartending cert.  To get to where I am now I've applied to thousands of IT related jobs for the last 2.5 years. This was my dream job as of 2.5 years ago.

What's the problem then?  Well, now, goals are changing. I want to give myself a better shot in 1.5 - 2 years at being able to take on more responsibility or to get away from sales altogether and move into back end roles. Back end roles would allow me to work remote and work remote digitally in LATAM (a big goal of mine for 2025).  

I like the idea of designing solutions and I can see myself working closely with the sales team as a Solutions Architect having that sales experience to guide those interactions. Pre-sales engineer. Something to leverage my background in customer service and sales where I could still be working with clients but in a more technical way.

Then, there's the other direction where I could see myself moving into a dedicated account management role or specialize in a particular area (IT Security) and become a specialist and work as an Overlay with the sales team. So many possibilities.  And that's the thing, it makes me think a general ed degree in ""Information Technology"" could be relevant.

But, some certs look really good on a resume. My SAAC02 has gotten me so many interviews and the next one I want is the COMPTIA Security+.  Maybe work for the state department when I get dual citizenship in Colombia (something I'm looking at seriously).  Maybe even a PMP and work as a consultant for myself in the future. Who knows. The point is, I want to give myself as many options in the future as I can.

Finally, there's a community college near me that offers classes geared towards passing some of these relevant exams [(NoVA)](https://www.nvcc.edu/academics/workforce/index.html).  Honestly though?  I think credits would serve me the best in the future because I could work towards a master's later.  But certs could help me move into a specialty without having to work towards a Master's (much faster). There's a lot to consider.

TLDR: I know this was a lot, but, basically.... the title without the story.",Nblearchangel,2,1.0,0,1707271069,2024-02-07 01:57:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1akrfyw/what_is_more_relevant_a_general_ed_degree_in_it/,2,2024

1akp0za,"CEO is irritated with me, how do I move past this?","You know when someone has been getting on your nerves and even if they said ""the sky is blue"" it feels like something you immediately want to disagree with? I've become that person to my boss.

Some context: I work at a small startup where I'm a mid-level employee. We had a product launch a few months ago that was very stressful on everyone but it went well. During that time, the CEO and I had some public arguments about product strategy. I pointed to a couple of major risks that I felt weren't being taken into account during all-hands meetings.

1akovcw,Venting and need some advice!,"So today 30min after work I get a call from my recruiter(temp agent) who got me my factory job. She tells me how she’s been receiving great comments from my supervisor about how I been working. Right after the great news she drops a bomb shell on me.

I was accused of harassment by one of the females at work. The accuser stated that I’ve been making her feel uncomfortable and that I’ve been trying to talk to her. She told my supervisor and supervisor told my agent. I’m a 24 year old male and I’ve never been in this situation before. I’m not the type to approach females, I’m too shy nor interested in talking to females at work. My heart was beating fast and Im just stressed the fuck out from all this. My agent finally tells me who the female is and I was shocked. Mind you this female just started working at this job and today would be her 4th or 5th day. We only had 2 interactions and that was her asking me questions about work and which I answered “I’m not sure” and “I don’t know”. We had a few awkward eye contacts off of me looking at her out of instinct. She was in my peripheral view and our eyes would meet. But Me being shy would look away first. But that’s it! I didn’t think nothing else of it.

I just don’t know what to do. She went to the higher ups and now I just feel like I’m gonna be looked down by them. I look like the bad guy. It’s her word against my word and I can’t just go up to her and squash the beef. Now I have to go into work and feel uncomfortable because of how somebody felt. I don’t know what her intention is but I hope she just genuinely felt uncomfortable from our awkward eye contacts. But then again she did say that I was trying to approach her which makes me think that shes out to get me. 

Has anybody been through this? What should I do?",SlikNors_,1,1.0,0,1707263955,2024-02-06 23:59:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1akovcw/venting_and_need_some_advice/,2,2024
1akoun6,What job should I go for?,"I’m here because I really have no one that can give me an unbiased opinion 
I’m currently making 23/hour been working there for about a year and half. Bad things about this job is: 
I’m sent to lunch sometimes at 10am or 11 
I get blamed when patients don’t show up(when I say I, I mean all the 3 employees that are in the office) 
I gotta make sure patients want to pay for treatment if they don’t I also get blamed for it
Everyone is always in a bad mood

Good things:
I can pretty much do whatever I want (I can be a little late, I can take a days off, I can use my phone, I know where everything is and how drs like to work) 

Recently I started applying to other jobs because I was just tired of the situation and to getting blamed for things that are out of my control. Found a new job doing pretty much the same thing but they offered me $26 I accepted and then let my employer know, they offered me $27 but told me to stop looking for another job every now and then because this isn’t the first time I try to leave but they always offer me more or something better in compare to what the other office offers me. In this case I don’t love the idea to work at the other place, for some reason I just didn’t connect with the place but they liked the way I work (we had a work interview) but other than that everyone seems pretty sweet and in a good mood, the other downside is that Mondays I would be getting off at 7pm but Fridays I would get off at 1 or 2 

I decided not to take the $27 since is only a dollar difference but now they’re offering me $29 if I stay and I really don’t know what to do, I know it’s hard to give an opinion but I would really appreciate some unbiased opinions here

1akotse,Work travel not disclosed?,"I have been at this job for a couple of months and travel was not something that was at all mentioned in the interview/job posting. I was told that I would be stationed out of a specific office so I moved and leased an apartment in said state/city where I was told I would be working so I could be close to the office. About a month into this job, I was informed that I would have to travel every single week to a remote location about ~3 hours away to be closer to the client and other members of my team. The travel takes place on my own time, with the expectation that I get there at or around the start of working hours which start at 7am and using my own vehicle as well. I stay overnight and also work the next day at the remote location so I am out of town 2 days/week every week. When this was discussed with my employer, they told me that the travel was an “expectation of the job,” despite it never being mentioned beforehand. For personal reasons, this is not sustainable for me so am not sure what to do since they seem to be pretty firm on the travel. Am I overreacting, and is this a standard amount of travel to do for work?

1akopqa,Is it worth even asking about a 50 cent raise to match my coworker?,"I work as a rehab aide at a physical therapy clinic, which is basically a job that most prospective PT students work before going to PT school. I've been here since May and have worked my way up to being the main aide and working the bulk of the hours. I make minimum wage which is $15 here. About 2 months ago we hired another aide. After a month and a half or so she ended up also taking on extra hours filling in at the front desk since we don't have a full time receptionist. The first 4 hours or so of her shift are meant to be at the front desk and then the rest is meant to be as an aide, but she often spends the whole 8 or so hours of her shift back there instead of helping the physical therapists. This dumps a lot of extra work on me as I often find myself helping with 3-4 patients at a time when she should be helping with 1 or 2.

Today we were talking about a prospective full time receptionist for the front desk and mentioned how he kept asking about the pay. At one point in the conversation she mentioned that she was able to get $15.50 as her hourly wage when she was first hired as an aide. I make $15 so it's not much of a difference (if I work 28 hours then it's essentially an extra $14 a week). Its sort of just the principle of it. I do a LOT here yet don't make the same as my coworker who doesn't do as much.

1akohx5,Upset by Annual Raise,"So here is the deal,

I have been working for the same company for the last 5 years. Including promotions and raises I have averaged nearly 12% increase in pay annually, with all raises being above 5% and most well into the 6% realm. I understand that these are generally great raises and I do feel quite lucky to achieve this much compensation, but here is the kicker. Recently I have begun switching seats to a position that is generally regarded as being more valuable to the company. I have taken on far more responsibilities than I have ever had before and worked longer hours than anything I had done in the past. It is my understanding that all things aside the base salary of the new position is the same as the old position.

This year I got a 4% raise. This number doesn’t look bad on paper but it certainly stings knowing the effort I have gone to to fill the role I am now in. 

Where my question comes in is - knowing the items above do you all think this warrants further conversation with my managers? I really love this company and believe in what we do but this feeling stinks knowing my past compensation history.",V1NC36,1,1.0,0,1707262997,2024-02-06 23:43:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1akohx5/upset_by_annual_raise/,2,2024

I'm a little burnt out after 3 years of working 70 hours a week and meeting deadlines. Most of what we do with the money from my business is give to charitable causes so I'm a little remiss to leave it behind as well, but this job offer seems like too much to pass up and I am SO BORED and underutilized at my current role...

1akim2s,Introvert in sales: I start feeling I am bad at my job,"I have 6 years experience in sales and marketing jobs. Now, even though I don't like calling or pushing people, and even though I can experience performance anxiety in meetings, somehow, in my first 2 positions I have absolutely smashed every target I had and brought good results, so that I have very quickly reached a managerial role.

However, sometimes I feel like I am a complete scam.

I managed to sell myself very well in interviews but acting like a confident, extrovert person and selling costs me quite a lot. i feel like I really have to fake it, which is possible on short, one off interactions, but doesn't work when it's all the time. So in customer's interactions, I have usually relied on building more genuine relationships with them, tried to really listen rather than forcing a sale and such. Things used to come naturally thanks to dedication and transparency.

However, the last time I changed job I came to an industry where the sales cycle is MUCH longer, so I am now not even bringing those contracts I was used to collect as proof that I was doing something I was, unexpectedly, good at.

And now I feel like I'll never be your ""stereotypical"" sales person and that maybe I am in the completely wrong path so maybe it's not just the long sales cycle, it's me!

1akhgb2,Communication Issues with Leaders,"I work in the public sector and am currently assigned to develop a new unit. The creation of this unit is due to changes with Frontline workers adopting technology, and we need to hire staff to manage that data. 

I'll be in charge of this new team in the future, and have done a lot of the work from drafting policy, creating procedures, drafted a business case that was approved. 

The issue I'm having, is I have to liaise with another senior leader, who was put in his position due to his incompetence. There's been surveys conducted about his inability to do his job, and he's still here. When I was a junior employee, I had this person as a manager, and there were issues, fortunately we had a exceptional supervisor who offset his incompetence.

I now have to liaise with this person because they have him in an infrastructure position, because people threaten to quit if he's in charge of then (I've never gotten involved in any of those grievances, I grew up in a military-old-schook family and always taught to have manors and stay out of the workplace political scene.) We have to go through him if need different tech and equipment. The issue is, he does not understand tech, and has admitted it openly. 

The pilot project for our unit is starting, and we are nowhere near ready. We are nowhere near ready because he is not fulfilling his obligations. I have email chains going back to last April enquiring about things that need to be done, and said I would take care of things if they're required more assistance from me - no improvement came of that. When I decided to just go ahead and get things done, I was spoken to an told to ""know my place."" I've requested meetings to discuss my issues and nothing gets followed up on. I've spoken with HR about the issues but explained I needed advice on how to navigate these issues and was not interested in filing a complaint - as our organization is in turmoil because of our senior leaders not addressing issues. I received an email this morning from a third party company seeking info to coordinate installing a service we require for the unit. No response. Called and sent a follow up - no response. Then I see a long winded email from this manager promoting his volunteer work.  

I've tried in person communication, emails, I've asked my boss for assistance, and I've gone to HR. Now we have another manager off on stress leave, and I am being told to cover her portfolio now. I do not want to file a formal complaint as there's a proven history of managerial retaliation (there's an outside body involved right now, so I'm not the only person fearful, many victims have come forward). We're also short 30% of our workforce on stress leave. 

I take a lot of pride in my work, did not take any time off last year because of staffing shortages (when I could have) because I don't want things to fall behind. I am now coming to work frustrated, tired from being stressed out, and it's impacting my performance and worse, my attitude (I don't vocalize my frustration at work, it's mostly in the comfort of my home and with close friends/family). The stress is starting to bleed into my personal life. As mentioned, it's affecting my attitude and making me ""grumpy.""

I'm not in a position to relocate my family and seek employment elsewhere. But I'm also not sure what to do.",howUdoinBahd,1,1.0,0,1707245906,2024-02-06 18:58:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1akhgb2/communication_issues_with_leaders/,2,2024
1akhe18,Boss keeps rewriting my work,"I work in finance and part of my job is writing financial disclosures about our company. My boss is always rewriting my work even though I believe what I’ve written is completely acceptable and quality work. To preface our relationship, he seems to never take my input unless another coworker also agrees with me. For example, we have 1:1 calls where I will make a suggestion and he’ll say “no it’s fine the way it is” or give some other reason. Later in a group setting, his boss or another coworker (lateral to him) will make the same suggestion as me and he’ll make the change for them. 

The most recent interaction was that I wrote new a paragraph in our financials and asked him to review. He messaged me each sentence one by one, changing what I wrote. I told him I would make all of those changes except for the last one bc I thought what I wrote added value. He pauses…types…pauses…types (we work remote)and he’s not used to me standing my ground. He finally says “ok we will leave it in but let’s ask Sam to review. People like the less is more approach around here.” Sam reviews and says it looks good. My boss is not happy with this - he then highlights the section and sends it to Sam again and says “this isn’t really necessary is it??”. Sam says that he doesn’t mind it either way, so feel free to delete if you want. My boss deletes it.

Just to add a little to my credibility (because I’m sure you might be wondering if my writing just sucks) - last week, my boss was out for the day and I was asked to draft several sections. All reviewers (my boss’ boss and directors lateral to him) said it was great and made no edits to my work. 

We do upward reviews at our company that are taken fairly seriously. What do I call/how do I explain this behavior in a constructive way? He makes me question my intelligence and it’s starting to feel toxic.",Wise-Exit-9849,8,0.7599999904632568,16,1707245749,2024-02-06 18:55:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1akhe18/boss_keeps_rewriting_my_work/,2,2024
1akh36s,Lunch with the president soon. Should I say anything about my upcoming career change?,"Hello /r/careeradvice. I have a pretty specific question and I'd like to thank you in advance for reading it and for any advice you can spare!

I work at an educational nonprofit, which matters because our contracts are based on academic years, ending in June. In March, we submit our intent to return forms (or don't).

For personal reasons, a couple years ago, I bought a house in another state that I plan to make my permanent residence next summer (can't move before then, again, for personal reasons). The house and the move are general knowledge among my colleagues.

Since I'm going to be moving anyway, I've taken some time to reflect on whether I want to continue in my field at that point, and I've decided that I want to undergo a career change. I've quietly been taking some classes in another field and have a certification test scheduled at the end of this month. I feel confident that I will pass, and at that point, I plan to apply for hybrid or remote jobs in the new field, the idea being that I could build experience and hopefully keep the new position when I move. That's not set in stone yet of course, so for now I'm remaining open to the possibility of remaining at my current position for one more year.

Later this month, I'm having a one-on-one lunch with the president of my organization. I'm looking forward to this. We have a positive relationship and I know that she thinks highly of me, because we've worked together on a couple of key projects in the past and because I won what's essentially the employee of the year award last year. I like and respect her very much as well.

I am wondering what, if anything, I should say about my plans at this lunch. Like I said, the fact that I'll be moving eventually is general knowledge, but I haven't mentioned anything to anyone about exploring this new field at all. Our president would be an invaluable reference for me, and I don't want to blindside her at all if I do leave this year, but since things are still foggy at this point, should I not bring anything up? Any advice would be very helpful. Thank you!",lunchwiththebigboss,1,1.0,5,1707245031,2024-02-06 18:43:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1akh36s/lunch_with_the_president_soon_should_i_say/,2,2024

1akgkc8,Annual career review when im trying to leave the industry..,"What the hell do I do. I’m 4.5y into this industry and just started applying for grad schemes in a completely different field - that I def won’t hear back from in time. The career development review (where you talk about what you wanna do/achieve in the next 12m) is this month. I’ve also been super keen about getting professional chartership including getting paid training for it, until I suddenly gave up on it about a week ago. So they’ll clearly know something’s up. 

I was extremely lucky getting this job and def want to keep on good terms meaning I’ll have to be truthful to a degree, but I don’t want them taking this as an early resignation before I even have anything lined up. My previous two directors did not (NOT) take my resignation well and I’m not sure if that is standard lol. 

The reason I’m leaving is I can’t take the stress, I design building structures. Can’t take the stress of things I’ve designed hypothetically collapsing on people and it’ll only get increasingly worse as I get more senior. I can take normal stress and overtime stress but not this lol. So really my only option is to get out but I’m not sure they’ll understand at all.

1akg89h,Government job vs. Private sector?,"To keep this short, I started a job with a large private company a couple weeks ago and I just received an offer for a state gov job I applied/interviewed for before accepting this current position. Should I quit the private job for the gov. job?

My main question is will the government job be significantly less stressful/have a better work life balance/benefits in general to justify the pay cut? I'm 90% sure I'm gonna have to work OT for this current job(I will be paid my reg. hourly rate) and I really just don't want to do that. Also really hate the whole time keeping of private companies, feel like I'm always pushed to be more efficient/spend less hours on tasks, I'veno clue if the gov. Job would time keep the same way... Main differences are;

- gov. job pays 7k less annually
- gov. job is closure to home about 7 miles less in 1-way commute or 30-40 min vs. 45-60 min for the private job
- both jobs are hybrid but gov. job has 3 days WFH vs. 2 at the private job

Please any input/advice would be appreciated as I've been banging this situation around my head for awhile now but now that I got the 2nd offer I need to answer. In case anyone has specific career experience both positions are design engineering occupations, but any advice regarding Government vs. Private work I will greatly appreciate!

1akg19z,Company pushing me towards “easier” role. Help :’),"Okay so… I have been at this job for about a year and a half. It’s a start up and I really love the company and what we do. I went to school for cs and we do research. Admittedly I’ve been struggling because a lot of statistics is required and my foundation in stats is not the best, but I want to get better because I’d like to work in machine learning/Ai.  On top of that I started working from home a few months ago so I could move in with my long distance partner(they were very kind to allow this as I know it wasn’t ideal).  Wfh made things a bit more difficult for me… I had to figure out how to communicate online with my coworkers which proved rather difficult, had the stress of leaving home and being somewhere without my family as a support system, learning to focus while working from home(adhd does not help), and going into winter with seasonal depression starting it all just piled up and I was struggling with my work.
Recently I’ve been taking a break with the research to help create a database and api for the company. It’s been a nice breather as I was stressing a bit with the research and with the breather I wanted to do some independent learning for stats so I could come back after the project a bit more sure of myself and better able to work.

My boss just told me they want to offer me a new position as a ‘data curator’. Which other coworkers supported me getting. This would be a full time position and I believe also mean I would no longer do research. 
The thing is while I like the database work, looking at the description they gave me as well as online… I’m not sure it’s what I want.  While the role is necessary, I feel like they’re offering me this role because they don’t want me to go back to the research side of things, but they like me as an employee and want to keep me on.  Looking online at the average salaries of the two roles there is a definite pay cut for the new role. Which even though I don’t think would cut my current salary I think could affect future raises.  Then also if I wanted to leave the company at any point my experience wouldn’t be toward the kind of job I’m looking for. 

I’m kind of freaking out because I don’t know how to talk about all of this with them. How I can go about turning it down if I wanted, and if I did what that would mean for my position…",bees54,7,1.0,5,1707242487,2024-02-06 18:01:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1akg19z/company_pushing_me_towards_easier_role_help/,2,2024
1akfjoc,What are companies looking for?,"After typing this up I realized it’s a bit of a rant but I am really looking for some guidance or advice. 

I’ve been struggling to find new work since April 2023. I’ve been aggressively looking and applying to roles since June of last year, with multiple different resumes, talking with different recruiters, and applying to various roles from entry level to more senior positions. Of the hundreds of applications I’ve submitted, I’ve heard back from maybe three or four, and it’s rarely ever gone past the second set of interviews. 

At a certain point around the holidays, I just started assuming it was me and either I’m not qualified enough or I’m not the type of person they’re looking for to fill these roles. I have a BA in Applied Math and will have a Bachelor’s in Accounting at the end of this year, which simultaneously lines up with my getting my CPA by this time next year. I have four years of management experience, and four years of team lead experience in the financial sector for various institutions. I’ve been working remotely, but would like to get a local role where I can go into an office and really get my roots into a place and grow and develop. Right now I just feel stuck. 

What are companies even looking for with their job postings? I know I’m not the perfect candidate, but I feel like I check most of the boxes on both academic and professional experience. I also know it’s a tight job market right now, but coming up on a year of actively looking for a new role is really starting to wear and beat me and my confidence down.",ChevalierNoiRJH,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1707241287,2024-02-06 17:41:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1akfjoc/what_are_companies_looking_for/,2,2024
1akfey7,Started New Job/ Not Working,"I recently started a construction job with a better rate than my previous job. Going into it, the guy that hired me told me a bunch of stuff about the job that just isn’t true. I also was sent to my first site without any PPE I paid for through the company that they were supposed to supply. Thursday night I asked my foreman where I will be tomorrow and he said job got canceled and to call my hiring manager in the morning. I called and he got back to me saying there is no work for me and it is completely unusual that that happened and I will be back Monday.

     Well Monday came, apparently the Manager got demoted and my foreman didn’t know what I was supposed to be doing that day. So I called everyone and got no answer as to what was going on. My former manager got back to me saying that my foreman had a job without me, and gave me the contact info for the new manager. So I texted and called him to no avail. Well he got back to me Tuesday morning about 2 hours after the shift started, asking over text what I am talking about. I answered immediately explaining I needed to know where I will be working. Hours later and no answer still so I call him and he texts back that he’s s still working on it. 

     I think this job is a good opportunity and I sympathize with the new manager having to deal with this, but I also have bills to pay and can’t afford to be taking a 5+ day weekend.

1akf50q,what changes should I be making in life?,"I am 24 (male) from the United Kingdom. I have severe ADHD and was made to feel stupid my whole life, for maintaining average to decent grades most of the time. However, I couldn't get into university, and this deeply hurt my pride. I kept trying to get into university because I felt like I could never be proud of myself unless I did. Finally, I got diagnosed and medicated; the medication made a phenomenal difference and I got into King's College London to study a bachelor of arts in Political economy at 22 years (pretty much political science and economics). The grade requirements for this course were high and the university is world class.  
  
I will be 25 when I finish this degree, the plan initially was to work for the civil services or multi-lateral organisations like the UN. Since studying however I've learned a lot about myself; firstly I only wanted this degree because I was put down by my parents and peers growing up for being stupid/unmotivated and I wanted to prove them wrong i.e I was choosing this degree for reasons different to what I want for myself. Secondly, while I am still deeply interested in Politics and Economics, I am not sure I would like to make it the centre of my life anymore; the more I learn, the more I realise that I will never know enough to be ""informed"" as there is always another angle to consider.  
  
So where does this leave me? I am in the second year out of 3 years in my course, I have approximately £110,000 in savings, and I am starting to become more motivated by money. I really want to leave the UK, not because I hate the Uk, but its my dream to live elsewhere as I have had enough of this country and want something new. I like the idea of a start-up, but don't know what I would start in right now. I also like the idea of developing new skills which are in demand. More than anything I would like to do something positive for the world, which can be anything I decide I guess.

1akday8,23m feeling lost career-wise,"Hey all,

Im 23 and have been in the working world for a couple years now, with a pretty erratic CV. I graduated with an undergrad in electrical engineering and have since done a couple short stints as a QA analyst and a systems analyst. I left the former last year as I didn't enjoy the job at all. By a stroke of sheer randomness I now work in a startup doing content design which pays well (very well for my age category).

Issue is, I don't enjoy this job at all anymore. I've been in it a year, which has consisted of doing basically the exact same thing day in day out and it's worn me down. I'm out of creative ideas, the office is small and no one talks to each other or hangs out which is something I like in an office environment. I find myself chronically lonely and no amount of leave seems to refresh me or bring back that inspiration. I've just found out my next project will be more of the same stretching into summer. I've voiced that I feel I can do more in the company but I've been told to stay put because in spite of my woes I'm doing a stellar job.

Here's the curveball - I have a small stake in a company which is acquiring this company. My contract stipulates that should I still be in the company by the end of 2024 and should the acquisition be successful I'll receive a payout in the low 6 figures - enough for a downpayment on an apartment. Regardless of whether I walk away, should the acquisition be successful I'll receive annual dividend payouts large enough to eclipse my current salary. So I do recognise I'm in a very fortunate position. I've been told that after the acquisition goes through I'd move to the business side of things as we scale and expand.

Those are the positives, and I recognise what a lucky position I'm in currently to have this financial freedom. But my mental health is suffering at the moment. The lack of social contact, the location, the lack of inspiration - I find myself unable to focus and worried I'm chucking away my youth. I'm a people person and a massive extrovert so I like the idea of my job involving lots of social contact. For reference, before uni I considered becoming an estate agent, so that level of social contact.

I guess the question I'm asking is actually two-fold. should I walk away from this deal in favour of my mental health and pursuing a career I feel fulfilled in (and thus will invest a lot more of myself in)?

1akd6dx,I feel so cocooned in safety it feels like I will crash hard one day.,"This is not to brag and I am not sure I will get any sympathy from this: Late 20s - I have worked in a Fortune 500 company doing various bullshit jobs, on a permanent, hard-to-fire contract, my entire career, that's paid me above expectations every year (110k now in Randstad area, NL) and it's nothing to do with my major (engineering) but still tech enough to not make me feel like I'm burning my expensive piece of papers (diplomas). 

I work from home most days, I have a manager in another country that also works from home. I have a girlfriend and no kids, in fact I almost never see kids, or old people, or disabled people, or any suffering of any kind, no noise, no arguments no discussions. I live in a country with non-dangerous weather. I don't have stress at work or any stressful conversations. Good quality of life. Good infrastructure. I get great work life balance. 

I see what goes on in the world, whether it's pandemics or wars or earthquakes, atmospheric rivers, tornadoes, and I'm not a doctor, nor a fireman, nor a rescuer, lawyer, diplomat, politician or pilot etc. And it all feels so distant. Like the adults in the room have given me a sandbox to play in and everyone else is out there hustling and bringing me food. I don't feel like I deserve any of this nor do I think it will last in its current form much longer. 

Is it normal for highly qualified young people with high salaries in bullshit jobs feel completely disconnected with the world and feel guilty? Or should I just stop whining and just enjoy what many wish they had?",TA-1111,80,0.8299999833106995,52,1707235336,2024-02-06 16:02:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1akd6dx/i_feel_so_cocooned_in_safety_it_feels_like_i_will/,2,2024
1akcmyg,junior credit analyst interview,"
I don't really have a financial background but I somehow got an interview with an electronics company as a junior credit analyst. Responsibilities posted are 

Review credit hold reports and use your excellent analytical skills to determine the best course of action

Input, update, and retrieve information required for credit applications

Use credit report software to evaluate customer's financial status

Use your exceptional communication skills when responding to credit inquiries

I'm past the initial screening interview and am supposedly doing a more ""technical"" interview. I did some cursory research on the questions to expect but a lot of the old threads seemed mostly with banks. What should I expect/research as someone who only has basic Google knowledge of credit analysis?

1akabkj,Career Change Advice Needed,"I am 37 years old, and I am the sole source of income for a family of 4. I have been working for my current employer for 14 years and I am currently in middle-management at a fortune 500 company with 2 direct reports in inside sales and am also the business manager for 2 regional segments. My company pays well, has good benefits and is very safe (the company is slow to replace exits anyway, and I'm doing 3 distinct jobs; plus they payout terminations at a very generous rate). 

That being said, I'm getting burned out with the triple responsibility, my career development has stagnated since 2019 and my areas of responsibility are not viewed as priorities for the company, leading me to feel under appreciated at work.

I currently have a job offer at another company in a completely different industry. This role would be an actual Senior Manager position, with 4 direct reports and 40 2nd-level reports, representing about 7% of the company's total workforce reporting to it. The role would report to a C-suite officer. 

The base pay and bonus structure are roughly equal to my current job, and the benefits appear to be cost-neutral, though the health insurance provider at the new company is ranked much lower than my current health insurance provider. 

The big differences are that the new company would contribute significantly less to my 401(k) - approximately $10k/year less - and the new role has 12 fewer days of PTO than my current role. 

Since the salary, bonus and benefits are all basically comparable, I'm having a hard time deciding what to do. I'd probably be more fulfilled at work at the new company, but with less PTO I'm concerned about work-life balance; and with the lower 401(k) contribution it might push my retirement back several years. 

I don't like job hopping (obviously) and I'm not sure if I'm comfortable taking this role for 2-3 years and then using it as a launching pad to a Director/VP role at another company down the road, which is probably what most people would do.  

Any advice would be appreciated. ",Quick-Information329,2,1.0,1,1707227793,2024-02-06 13:56:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1akabkj/career_change_advice_needed/,2,2024
1akabir,Advise please: stuck in a negative loop at work,"Some back story: last October 10% of workforce was made redundant at work, including my husband and few members from the team I belong to. My manager is a former colleague who was promoted to the position, he is a good friend and his wife (also works in same company) is a very close friend of mine. I was given a large rise in pay in Dec 2023 when I was offered a position elsewhere to keep me at the current company. And in last 12 months I went through a major illness which meant I took regular time off in the first half of 2023. After the major illness I definitely prioritise my personal and family life above work at all cost, and my trust for my employer is rock bottom after the recent redundancy. 

January has been a hard month. I made couple of errors at work which I was given feedback via zoom call, and today I had more negative feedback this time about timesheet entry (we have to log every task we do as we are billable to clients) this time via a messenger. 

I am feeling utterly dejected, I'm in tears writing this, feeling useless and gripped in fear of being the ""next one out"". How do I get out of negative loop I'm stuck in at work? It's not productive, I hate myself like this. 

&#x200B;

When I had the zoom call earlier in the month when I was given a feedback about lack of detail and attention in one project (not a repeat offence though) I spoke to my manager about lack of security afterwards. His response was that they didn't give me the upped pay for no reason, it was because I am valued. Well, from two negative feedback in as many weeks, I don't feel like I am. I know my work is appreciated by others in the company and I've been told I get good feedback, I still don't feel valued or safe because it's not them who would make the decision to keep me.

My job has different ranges of tasks, some I am an SME of, other I can do the task perfectly fine but it's not like I can offer innovation/improvements on it like I would for what I am an SME for. And I have zero enthusiasms about anything but my SME subject.

My manager is mostly good, but he can project his annoyance with other parts of the work (e.g. project manager not doing things right) to us, saying I should be telling the PMs what to do or ask questions, but that is not my problem is it? I will always help any colleagues I work with but what he is saying is to cover their shortfalls, surely he should be speaking to PM management is there are issues.  He can also be emotional which doesn't help. But he was there for me all the way during my treatment, he supported me every way he could and he is good at separating work and personal relationship with me. So am I the one with issue, taking it too personally?

I had health issues but also realised it didn't interest me much, and I was let go from my last job (also my job before that, I was fired from it), so all of this accumulated into me joining a bootcamp on scholarship. I did that for six months. In some regards I could have done better, but I did otherwise try to the best of my capabilities and thought I was on par with other students in the cohort. Some of the companies hiring directly from our bootcamp didn't select me. I figured it's okay I'll find something. Now I regret not working harder towards that role. Since the market has been bad, there hasn't been many junior software dev roles advertised and I barely get call backs for interviews. The few I did, I blew them. Mostly cause live coding is still hard. I am also a while out from my previous career so I don't think I can go back to it either, but I knew I didn't like it. Most importantly I'm worried I can't keep down a job. I know I have some mental health stuff that gets in the way and makes me overwhelmed with keeping on top of tasks/being able to prioritise, but I think I can do fine with some support. I base that on the fact that I did alright with internships where I had at least some support. But as such so far I just feel like I'm not meant for the world I live in, and won't survive long.

1ak6y2z,Thoughts on education for a career change?,"Hey everyone, 

I’m looking for some advice here. I’m currently in the IT field working as an ISSO and would like to transition to what I’m passionate about -aerospace/astronautical engineering. I have a B.S. in Space Studies with a concentration in Aerospace Science from American Public University and am looking at expanding my education further into the aerospace field but don’t really know where to begin. I’ve got a few trains of thought though that essentially boil down to:

-Pursue an online M.S. in Aerospace Engineering and apply for engineering positions while pursuing this degree. 

-Pursue an online PhD in Aerospace Engineering (one from the University of Alabama, Mississippi State University etc…) and apply for engineering positions while pursuing this degree. 

-Get a graduate certificate in a topic like Spaceflight Mechanics, Mechatronics, Hypersonics or something similar which would help fill in more of my background knowledge and potentially help get me into an engineering job. 

Ultimately, I’m just trying to get into this field and do what’s actually engaging work for me as opposed to being bored with the IT world. Additionally, accomplishing a PhD in Aerospace/Astronautical Engineering would be the goal for education so if I pursue the certificate or M.S. option, I’ll still look at pursuing a PhD eventually.

1ak6u4t,Just got an offer lower than my current salary- how to negotiate when I intend to accept?,"I’ve just received a job offer that is about 12k lower than my current salary- I intend to accept the offer regardless, as I’m looking to leave my current workplace due to a poor cultural fit (not quite a “toxic” environment, but definitely not sustainable for me long term) & the role really appeals to me. How do I negotiate so I don’t leave money on the table? 

My plan is to reply with something along the lines of “I’m very excited about the opportunity to join the team & I see a lot of potential for growth with this company-  is there room within your budget to bring the starting salary closer to my current salary, which is X?”

During the first interview, they mentioned that another candidate had inquired about part time work- their preference was for something full time, but they would consider part time for the right candidate. Should I suggest in the same email, that if they do not have the budget to increase the salary, I would also be open to a 4 day week? 

Some notes:
- it’s a very small agency of 4 people, so the budget is really theirs to set
- the salary offered is dead centre of the advertised range
- I was selected out of two final shortlisted candidates after 3 rounds of interviews
- This is an entry level position, and I have about 2.5 years experience in this industry

1ak5spt,Master's degree in Germany,"Hello everyone,  
  
I have decided to pursue a master's degree in Germany for many reasons including the I already speak and understand German at level B2. First, a bit about my background, I am from Egypt and I graduated from Mechanical engineering with concentration in Mechatronics. I then worked as a Commercial Analyst at an Oil and Gas company. During my year and half work experience, I managed to pass CFA level I and II.  
  
Now, in order to pursue a master's degree in Germany, it has to be in Engineering. (No problem so far other than this mumbo jumbo CV)  
  
I have been admitted into the following two degree programs after applying for almost 10 available for next summer semester:  
  
1- Sustainable Energy Systems & Circular Process Engineering at Ruhr Uni Bochum  
  
2- Automotive Production Engineering at TH Ingolstadt.  
  
Both are 3 semesters taught in English, yet, very different career paths. I am a bit familiar with the booming trend in sustainable clean energy, and I lean more towards a managerial position later on or a consulting job. I am reluctant and since my current salary is almost 200 USD, I am trying to find the best paying job.  
  
If you have any insights about Germany, Europe, both career paths, things to consider, or any questions, please drop them.  
  
  
  
Many thanks  
  
TLDR:  
  
career choice, economics difficulty, master's degree in sustainable energy vs automotive production.

1ak5guv,Should I Switch Careers Before It's Too Late?,"New to this subreddit, but I figure I would ask for some advice on career change, how people chose the careers they are in, etc.

To provide some background I am 23 years old and for the past year and half I have been working in public accounting, graduated from university with my degree in accounting and have been studying for my CPAs but have not taken them yet.

I have to be honest, I absolutely hate my job. I used to love accounting in university because it all made sense and all the classes were relatively easy during my undergrad. Yeah I had the couple of challenging courses but once I got it, everything clicked! I chose accounting because I was not sure what I wanted to major in after I graduated high school. I thought about being a dentist but dint feel like it was right because I didn't believe I was smart enough nor did I believe that I would be a good fit because I wasn't ""passionate"" about teeth. I liked business and accounting seemed like a good path with lots of opportunities that could provide a stable career, I was not exactly passionate about it either, but after doing my first internship, doing well in classes, getting a full time job offer, I felt unstoppable. 

Now I just hate it. I get so much anxiety at work. It got to the point that last month on the way to work my anxiety was so bad that my arm felt like it would go numb and I started to experience heart palpitations. I just hate it, I feel like I am underpaid, I work so many hours, and at the end of the day the work I do, doesn't really matter. Ive been considering leaving the industry as a whole. For those who dont know this is actually a big trend in the accounting industry. Ive been looking into coding bootcamps, going into healthcare, nursing, dental school, even law school.

Its not the amount of work that is driving me away from this industry, its the bs work that I do, the depressing sinking feeling that I work 13 hour days, making the same as those who work a regular 9-5, and at the end of the day my work is meaningless it feels like it has no real genuine impact.

1ak4hpm,"Laid Off Last Week, Mid 20's – Can I Afford to Take a Break?","Hi everyone, I'm having a rough time as I was laid off last week from my film marketing job with a 30 days notice. I'm considering taking a month-long break this spring to visit my parents & see my partner who are all in East Asia – but I'm extremely torn between the need/desire for a break and staying in Los Angeles to securing a new job.  
I’m not sure if I can “afford” this break because I can't predict how quickly I'll be able to secure a new job and I don’t have much savings.  
I'm in my mid-20's and I’m aware that job markets are in a tough place. I plan to job hunt and network like crazy until I would leave, while still applying when I’m away, but I’m just not super confident that I can land something by June. My lease ends on July 1 so this is the big “what if” – what if I can’t find a job by then?   
At the same time, I feel like I would sink back into debilitating depression and burn-out if I just stay home until I secure something new – as I live with ADHD, anxiety, and major depression. This was my highest paying job yet but I was still living month-to-month in Los Angeles, which has not been good for my mental health (which is not in a great place now). My body is screaming to rest and relax a bit before going back to work, but my brain keeps having second thoughts because of the amount of uncertainty ahead. I’m feeling paralyzed by indecision so any thoughts would be appreciated.  
I got a 30-day notice and my financial situation looks like this:  
\+High Yield Savings: $11200   
\+Severance/PTO: $7000 at the end of Feb +   
\+401k & Roth IRA: $10000 combined  


\-Estimated Travel Costs: $2000 round-trip–Hard   
\-Monthly Expenses (in the US): $1200 rent + $750 car, health insurance, phone bill + 200 personal needs (can be reduced)  
Food would be much cheaper (maybe $200-300/month) and I would stay for free abroad, so I would probably spend less in East Asia on a weekly basis than I would getting groceries here in LA. I'm also planning on getting medical treatments in Korea that are way cheaper because I'm Korean. Am I crazy to prioritize my well-being in these circumstances or should I follow my intuition to go? I'm having a real hard time trusting in my skills and abilities to navigate this situation I've never been in.

TLDR: I’m terrified of not being able to secure my next job and can’t decide if I can “afford” a break from work.

She’s good at her job and tries to be supportive for the most part, but frequently makes mean comments about others and has intense mood swings. The company has a toxic culture and I’ve been applying for jobs so I can get the hell out of there. 

In our last 1:1 meeting (on the company video platform), she talked about having a recording she took on her phone from a meeting where she fired one of my teammates (this wasn’t a surprise to anyone, including said teammate). I was curious why she wanted to play it so I agreed to listen. It was honestly one of the saddest things I’ve ever heard and has bothered me ever since. She really got a kick out of this person’s pain and was laughing about it. I see her differently now and the trust is completely broken.

I want to quit anyway, but I feel so wrong about what transpired that I don’t know that I can let it go. I’ve told a mentor of mine at the company, and he basically said this behavior is why he’s no longer in management, but I didn’t receive any sound advice.

My father is already retired. So we can't go with the streams which is very much expensive.
  So I want some suggestions. That which stream would be best for her. She will appear in NEET may be but as I know that field is also expensive may be. And all I know is She is not that passionate for being a doctor so I think she can go for combined science stream also. Where you have to study 2 of the subjects of pure science and others are nutrition, computer applications or environment like this. I know some of my friends who are established now , they did BCA, or MBA, or engineering from private universities. But all I know is private universities are expensive too. I don't want her to stop her studies in middle because of the financial reason. So I want to plan, what would be appropriate for her, where scope is also good and the field is not that expensive too. As i wanted to do PhD after my masters but couldn't pursue because of financial issues. Sometimes I feel sad but I gathered all my courage together and started preparing for govt job exams. I don't know when I'll get a stable job but atleast I want her life or career would be stable. 
She doesn't want to go for govt job like bank or ssc or psc in future and doesn't want to take arts as she is not that interested in geography or history or political science which are common subjects in arts.. I'm not that much awared about the scope of commerce. She is in dilemma between science or commerce. She would take commerce if the scope is good in future..
So yeah, if anyone understands the situation and aware of the scenario of educational field's scope and expenses please provide some insight.

1ak3ns5,Got Laid Off,"I’m 29F and got laid off at the beginning of October 2023 after being a new hire in July 2023. So exactly 3 months later. They pretty much dissolved most of the company with 2 mass layoff rounds BEFORE they hired me and because of this, what would have been a 7-8 person team turned into 3 people with 1 person not wanting to pick up any of the slack and the 2nd person being hourly and not allowed to work OT. All of this to say allllll of that extra work got dumped onto me. I would work from 9 AM (with sometimes my insane ex boss calling me at 8/8:30 while I was commuting to ask me random questions) until anywhere from 9 PM to midnight. I also gave up several of my weekends to work too and was burning out pretty quickly and crying myself to sleep every night from the pressure. Their reason for laying me off was that I wasn’t working fast enough for them and that I was “drowning” in work. 😑 They offered me a lower titled position (straight back to hourly after climbing my way up to salary for 3 years) or getting let go with a severance package. To note, right after this offer they laid off another employee on a different team too. I took the severance bc I know my worth and after a decade in the industry and 40K worth of student loans to pay off I didn’t see why I should stay to be demoted and get a huge unlivable pay cut. I also had some impressive brands poaching me in my LinkedIn DMs a year prior to getting this role so I didn’t think twice about not being able to land a new job and was actually relieved to not have to work those insanely hours anymore. Long story short the unemployment benefits didn’t hit my account in time for when my lease renewal was set and I still hadn’t found a new job at that point so I had to let my lease end and move back in with my parents who live in another state. This is where the true drama starts and where I need advice. My current industry pretty much only exists in NYC or LA and I need another few years of experience before I can make a better salary in my field to be able to afford living comfortably in these cities and also be able to save. It makes the most sense to me to work remotely and save a ton given the circumstances, pay off my loans, save for a house etc. and not move at all until I have more solid ground to stand on instead of throwing my money down the drain on rent and living paycheck to paycheck again like I had been. The problem is NO ONE wants to hire me unless I move back to one of the coasts and I am backed up against a wall bc I don’t want to be broke again trying to survive in these extremely expensive cities. I actually am enjoying being around my parents again too after living alone for the past few years. My mental heath always goes to sh*t when I live with roommates I do not know so that’s not an option for me either and all of my friends who I would live with are married so there’s that. It’s been extremely difficult trying to find a remote job and there’s nothing I can find in my industry here in my parent’s city (despite it also being a major city). I’m seriously worried about this gap in my resume too. I have no problem landing interviews but none of them yet are willing to let me be remote. I took a break from applying from October to the mid half of January so while I’m getting interviews coming in, nothing is the right fit yet. I’m worried about going too long without working, looking like a red flag to potential employers, having this work gap and I obviously understand I can’t live off of my unemployment and severance forever. I have always had an entrepreneurial mind set and I despise working in a corporate office. It was SO rough on my mental and physical health that even only being out of it for 3 months I feel better than I ever have. I’ve thought about flinging myself full force into starting an online business while I have the time and space to do so OR changing industries completely to one that has way more available remote positions and flexibility (digital marketing?) but I don’t know what that would look like interview/portfolio wise. I feel like I’m in a really strange time in my life right now and my self esteem has shrunk a lot since the lay off. I feel like everywhere I turn there is a road block stopping me from moving forward and I feel frozen in this sort of stand by mode. I am finding myself more broke and lost than I was 3-4 years ago prior to moving to these huge cities (high cost of living drained all of my cushiony savings) plus I was living in constant survival mode. I thought I would be at a way different place in life at the end of my twenties which has been really discouraging to process. I thought chasing a corporate career was the right move this whole time but I got super screwed over and now I regret even entering my field at all and my undergrad degree. Can anyone relate to this or give me some guidance? I don’t know how to move forward and I don’t want to lose the hope of being able to fall back on my corporate career if I needed to. Thanks for reading all of that if you made it this far. 🙈",SafeFun6836,1,1.0,0,1707202093,2024-02-06 06:48:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ak3ns5/got_laid_off/,2,2024

1ak30dp,"Commercial real estate is taking a hit, I expect my salary will too. How are people’s salary discussions going?","Story below but the short end of it is what are people in banking / finance / commercial real estate seeing as a raise for 2023/2024 (% of 2023 salary)? I hear 3-5% is average but various reports I’ve seen suggests companies have been paying more and keeping up with inflation recently requires about 6.5%-8.5%.  While discussed more below, sounds like I should expect 2%.


Details/Story + Questions:
I, 26M (US), have been working at this company (a publicly traded bank) for 4+ years now.  Started right before COVID 19 after getting my undergrad (double in Accounting and Finance).  I’ve swung above my weight and while my very first year I was screwed out of a bonus/raise (made up for shortly after) have largely been treated well since.

Over those 4 years, I’ve made two lateral transitions internally, been promoted twice and have generally been treated well by the company.  I’d argue I make what most people hope for in this line of work and while I hate a lot of it (would rather be outside, doing something hands on) I’ve got a brain that just sees the world as numbers and I’ve capitalized on it.

Outside of my general success, I’ve had to pick up a lot of slack from attrition on various teams, most of it natural.  Unfortunately, we haven’t backfilled and in my current position I’m privy to information which we 1) aren’t backfilling, 2) expectations are rising to meet the lack of staffing and 3) the company needs to “trim the fat” further.

Top it all off with a 2% “across the board” raise expectation and it just feels like despite the crazy amount of work I, my team, hell - even my boss did, is going completely unrecognized (by the company, c-suite and upper management at least). 

I recognize I work in commercial real estate and we’ve had a hell of a year… getting hit from every angle (and things aren’t getting better any time soon) but with all the attrition and work we are all putting out it feels like 2% is extremely low.  Before I have my discussion with my boss, I wanted to poll fellow reditors in the same realm and hear what they’re experiencing.  Is it better in your world? Worse? How did your bonus / salary discussions go? 

Final background items:
~ I know my boss has little to no say on raises.  While there’s discretion here and there on who gets what (and I recognize my boss will likely do her best for me) I feel like I should still have some form of discussion expressing my discontent with the company’s policies on hiring + efforts for retention (especially with no backfilling and not paying up for the extra work)… then again it’s above my pay grade, hers and probably even her boss (love the c-suite culture!)
~ the last 24 months I saw a 12% and 15% raise, over each year, respectively.  Those are above average no doubt… but I was a top contributor and we also had great years.  I don’t expect this every year (as I recognize that’s extremely unrealistic)
~  while I know markets have performed well in general (in some respects, at least) CRE is taking a hit and I didn’t expect what I saw over the last two years…. But 2%?  Feels like 3-5% should be the minimum… hell my landlord tried to raise my rent 20% in December… (Denver Colorado; I moved out of the city and am now commuting)
~ current messaging suggests they’re trying to make it up in the bonus but that’s taxed differently + they aren’t funding bonuses to our target / plan anyway (even though we hardly missed our target and plan)

Appreciate everyone’s opinion and stories here.  Would love to hear from everyone, not just CRE!!!",Jaded-Delay6925,1,1.0,1,1707199686,2024-02-06 06:08:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ak30dp/commercial_real_estate_is_taking_a_hit_i_expect/,2,2024

1ak0wkn,Wayward graduate,"Hello!

I just turned 25, I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in sociology from a fancy private university in 2022. When I was in school, I thought I wanted to be a teacher, social worker, or journalist. But then I changed my mind, mostly because of the low pay. After graduation I took a part time barista job, which allowed me to travel and take online classes. I earned the Google project management certification. I also finished a domestic violence Counselour certification because I want to help survivors on the side. I’m still in the process of getting my TEFL certification to teach English as a foreign language. I’m very people oriented, but I want a higher salary, so I thought Project Management or HR would be a better fit. I don’t have a lot of work experience, so I haven’t felt confident in applying to roles. Honestly, the whole job application process makes me nervous, so it’s been a year and I’ve barely applied to anything.

My health insurance is going to run out in a year, and the only way I’m able to feed myself right now is that I get to live in a relative’s basement for free. At least I don’t have any debt.

This isn’t where I saw myself at 25. I blame my Covid gap year, and my limited work experience (due to anxiety and depression I chose to not work and study at the same time).

1ajzsmp,Needing advice. My boss asked me to micromanage a colleague,"Hi. The owner of my work (actually my boss's boss's boss) just asked me to ""pop your head into"" a colleague's office once in a while to see why he's behind in his work. He's literally always behind in his work, but he produces good work even if it turns up to me last minute. His dept has been downsized from 4 people to just him over the past year and he's been with this employer for 6 years while I've been here less than 1.  
  
This is going to feel like micromanaging for both me and him. Do I just bite the bullet and create the only toxic environment in this otherwise drama-free workplace? Or is there a better way to handle this? My direct boss is usually open-minded, so if there's a better way to address this with them I'd prefer that.  
  
My boss and their superiors are under the impression that my colleague is on his phone a lot and sometimes (or often) hides in the bathroom to avoid work.

In company 2 we had an initial discussion then I replied that I would not be available at this time maybe next time and offered to refer someone for the job.

1ajxmfp,Help Please,"Hello, I am making a post for some guidance.  
28 turning 29 in a few months.  
I only have my high school diploma and my recently completed google data analytics cert.  
I have adhd  
I have my own business in the trades, but its hard not making a reportable salary and spending so much on the business its making me depressed.  
I'm not sure what path to take? so many people say to stick it out with being an entrepreneur and work those hours , which I've been. But its just... I don't know anymore if its worth it.  
is data analytics my desired path? I don't know but it seemed to be the most interesting path I've found.  
Should I get a degree at Sophia - WGU ? is that a good school?  
should I just improve my portfolio?  
Should I get more certs?  
The reason why I chose data analytics is because I took the time to reflect and I found out that I really enjoy asking deep questions about things and finding the answers that's why I chose data analytics.  
I think tech would be an interesting area but I'm very overwhelmed with coding.

I was completely caught off guard today- she basically made it seems like although I had made large strides with the role, nothing good was enough to overpower the few things I had no accomplished. She had a few tasks that were not yet done mainly bc they fell more into the roles and responsibilities of other roles (who are more senior and make more $$).

1ajuydt,Can I ask for a raise as an independent contractor?,"Am I allowed to ask for a raise even though I’m considered an independent contractor for this small digital marketing agency?
I desperately needed a job after the pandemic so I found this remote social media job in April 2022. The pay is only $13/hr but I needed a job so I took it. I’ve been with this agency for almost 2 years (it’ll be exactly 2 years in April). But now I need a raise..$13/hr isn’t enough.

This was basically the contract in the email in March 2022..I don’t think I even signed anything, I just said “yes that’s all fine” in the email:
“1. This is an Independent Contractor Position
2. Pay is $13 an Hour
3. You must be available to work Monday - Friday at least 1 hour a day. You can work ahead, but all your work must be completed by 7pm PST Fridays.
4. Required availability: 15-20 or 20 - 25 hours a week (you can confirm). More hours may be available in the future!
5. You must be able to do the majority of your work M-F between 8am and 7pm PST.”

Also, when I first started there in April 2022, I only did 1hr of work a week because they didn’t give me enough tasks to do. I finally started getting 15hrs of work just this past month..in 2024!

So in April, I want to ask for a raise..I want to try to get at least $15/hr..I feel like if I ask for more, they’ll immediately say no. This small digital marketing agency has a bunch of clients and I have 20 clients that I do social media content creation for. I believe I do a really good job creating the posts and writing the copy for all their social media. Plus, I think I’m the main social media content creator since I have the most clients…which is 20. There are 2 other content creators and they each have 10-12 clients. 

I know most will say I need to get a different job..and I’m looking (and I do have another side job for extra money), but in the mean time, I still want to try for that raise. Do you think it’s worth asking?",Alternative-Hat1341,1,1.0,1,1707175479,2024-02-05 23:24:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ajuydt/can_i_ask_for_a_raise_as_an_independent_contractor/,2,2024

Another benefit to the step down position is that i would be part of an organization that was originally my top choice a couple years ago when i was interviewing. By “getting my foot in the door” I could spend my time learning the organization in preparation for when a more senior level position becomes available again.

Please Advise.,"I currently work for a startup company and am meeting with my boss on my 2 year work anniversary to discuss potential salary increase. I want to go into the meeting with a general idea of a fair raise for where I am at, and would appreciate advise.

Background: 22M, Graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science, Worked for this company for almost two years. I make $70,000 USD a year. This is the salary I started with when I joined, with promises of raises (havnt had one in almost two years.) The company is based in the U.S. and I work remote. I am 1 out of 4 people at the company. My boss, who is the CEO and Senior Programmer is the only other software dev.

My boss also recently showed me the financials of the company. The company is completely self-sustaining (no stakeholders, investors, etc.) and is doing very well.

My job involves developing new features, bug fixes, and customer support, and I work in / familiar with all areas of our codebase.

I knew starting this job that its fair to start with a lower salary as I learn and get up to speed with my job. Now, I feel confident in my work and I keep track of the things I have done that show my worth. Now, going into this meeting with my boss, I am wondering what the market rate is for someone in my position, or if anyone has experienced a similar scenario. How should I approach asking for a higher salary?

P.S. For now, I am not sure I want equity (although he mentioned it as a possibility).

1ajt1x4,Getting considered for a job that is out of my experience range,"I (27f) received a call from a recruiter regarding a city job for which I did not apply directly, but it is in the same department as another job I applied for. With only less then a year of experience as a data analyst, I was surprised they even considered me since the advertised position typically requires 4 to 5 years of experience. Despite knowing I only have 9 months of post-college experience, they seemed keen on discussing my candidacy. The recruiter spent about an hour and a half on the phone with me, followed by a call later in the day to confirm a few details, they followed up this morning with a panel interview for Wednesday.  
  
I found the situation puzzling since I've applied for city jobs previously without hearing back. It appears they might be struggling to fill the role, which is for an HR data analyst — coincidentally, it mirrors my current role. This opportunity would double my salary, and the tasks would align closely with what I'm doing now, but without the guidance of my current boss and with new software. While I'm eager for the job, I can't shake the feeling of imposter syndrome. I attempted to highlight my skills during the phone call, but now I'm second-guessing myself.  
  
Despite having this interview lined up, I wonder if I should even consider the role. It's essentially the job I've been dreaming of, but four years earlier than expected. I don't feel entirely prepared, yet my current role feels stagnant, requiring me to constantly seek tasks from my boss. There doesn't seem to be much room for growth where I am currently, as far as salary goes, and this new role would give me a lot of responsibility I am not sure I am ready for but would double my salary.

My goal is to make at least $60k and ideally have a hybrid schedule. Any advice on expanding my job listing searches?

My education/experience:

* Master's in Education from an Ivy League, BA in Arts & Humanities from a state school
* 3.5 years classroom experience (1.5 full time teaching English, 1 year student teaching, 1 year AmeriCorps)
* 1 year nonprofit experience (intake and data entry)
* 2.5 years working part-time as a creative consultant at a media lab (Adobe Suite, Microsoft Suite, large-scale printers, risograph, etc.)
* internships/trainings/certifications in restorative justice, victim services, trauma-informed care, LGBT+ politics

1ajrcgu,Role Changing With No Raise,"I didn't really know how to search for this, but I did the best I could and didn't see anything recent, nor much that applied! 

They're restructuring my department and seem to have greatly upped my job description. I molded the role from a typical office assistant more toward project management over the last 5 years that I've had it; therefore, I don't 100% know what my old job description actually says in order to compare it to the new one I've received. (I've asked for it and am waiting to hear back). 

Last year, especially, I took on a bunch of responsibilities outside my role as I understand it. At the end of the year I made a case for a raise and didn't even get a whole percentage point (.5%).

The new job description is surprisingly formal (in a good way) about the project management side of things but also includes things that I haven't officially done before and that don't really fit into that role.

It also says on the job description that I'll be expected to perform any duties as dictated by my manager, in addition to the standard (as I've seen), ""your responsibilities include but are not limited to...""

I've never experienced such a change before, and I'm disappointed (but unsurprised) that I'm expected to just go along with this with no added compensation. I'm looking for perspective and advice on whether this is the norm and if I should ask again for a raise after having received such a pitiful one so recently (they knew this was coming when they gave me this raise; they told me about the two in the same breath).

1ajqwyq,Wonder if I'll be happy with this decision to work 3rd shift stocking groceries again like I did in the past,"I've been feeling really burned out lately after doing grocery by myself for the past 7 years during the day. I used to do 3rd's for 16 years in the past and just told my store managers that I wanted to go back to that.

I really don't see how I can relive those 16 years all over again. Maybe I'm making a really bad decision here.

If I stay here I may end up hitting that 50 year mark as a grocery clerk, but at the same time I'll prolly end up alone for the rest of my life, but at least I'll have a steady job and a roof over my head. Hopefully that would be enough.

I keep going back and forth on this decision. 

If I could find some inspiration maybe I would look for a career change, even though my father did groceries for 47 years between two companies, but I don't think I wanna be like him.",Historical_Rock_6516,1,1.0,0,1707165556,2024-02-05 20:39:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ajqwyq/wonder_if_ill_be_happy_with_this_decision_to_work/,2,2024

I am avoiding applying to big companies because they reject me left, right and center probably for not having an integrated masters (MEng) or for not having any placement/internship experience?

In my situation, what should I do?

I have considered volunteering but even that’s hard to find?

I have considered going back for an MSc in mechanical engineering if I haven’t found a graduate role within two years after graduating?

Should I work on personal projects like building a radio o based robot for example? Or build my own Stirling engine?

1ajpz1u,Illegal Hiring Practices?,"Hey guys.. I should probably just let this go, but injustice is hard for me. So I’m going to ask your opinion on whether or not this was wrong. 

I applied for a job as a Logistics Coordinator and did hours of research on the company and the role requirements (according to the listing).

While I have never held a title specifically in logistics, I received my BA in Global Logistics Management and have worked as a manager in a retail good environment for 7 years. 

I carefully read the job description and everything about it appeared as an entry level position. Here are some quotes:

“An interest in global supply chain and
global business, we can teach you the
function. This can be a great career entry
point into global business”

Education:
Associate (Preferred)

Experience:
International and/or Domestic Logistics: 1
year (Preferred)
• Microsoft Office: 5 years (Preferred

I waited 15 minutes for the HR manager before I picked up the phone and called her. She was obviously frazzled, but I was very respectful and offered to allow her to reschedule if needed.. she exclaimed “it’ll only take a few minutes, that’s okay.” 

She asked me the following question: “Do you have experience in international business”? I stated, honestly, how I never held a title in an international role, but I have studied the relevant concepts and could probably relate my experience in the workplace to any specific questions. She quickly replied “I’m sorry, we can’t move on because this role requires experience in international business”. I then asked if I could present my experience from my studies to her questions, but she said no. I then stated how the job description described it an entry level role, but she again told me no and ended the call.

I reviewed the job description and again could not find anywhere that said “required”.. 

I am the first one to admit if I believe I bombed an interview and gladly take responsibility if I don’t feel I am qualified. I also am completely fine and content if there is a better candidate, but if I feel like you are being dishonest, I take that personally.

For this role, I felt like I brought exactly what they were wanting to the table but perhaps had already found a candidate and instead of saying that, they just waisted my time and lied to me.

What would you do in this situation? Am I being over reactive?

I got 1 job offer, but it required me to move to a new state for less pay than my current job so l declined.

I then decided to try my hand at Data Analytics and got some certifications in that and built up a portfolio the 2nd half of 2023, but all the jobs l've applied to want people with experience and l've only had 2 interviews that led nowhere.

1ajmj5i,Can I get advice regarding demanding for an increase?,"Hello, So I have been working in this company as a Full stack Web application developer since September, 2009, which has been around 1 year and 4 months. Including myself, there are only two of web developers in this team and the website project we have been creating and maintaining is almost complete like 80% so far, and it's always really a hard and long work since the website they requested is a really huge one literally, that must process and manage all important information as data and help the other department's workers in this company with the greatest ways.

&#x200B;

Nevertheless, I and my partner have been doing great job for everything that needs to be done(can't describe more detail for privacy matter, but it's really complicated and tough works for entry level developers like me and my partner.). The biggest problem since I started working here is the salary, which I can't tell exactly but is definitely much lower than the average amount the other full stack developers usually get paid and deserve, as I inspected via job market statistical results. To be honest, this company's owner and managers don't really understand neither how complicated and thorough the programming and developing works should be done nor how much the IT technicians like us normally should get paid based as the value that most of the other companies do.

&#x200B;

Not only that, because there are only two of us and no one else who can solve a problem and issue when it comes to computer setup, Internet disconnection, printer not working, etc, we always have had and still have to keep helping technical issues like those while we are focusing on our no.1 priority work for the web development.

&#x200B;

However, they have never mentioned or given us any suggestions for our salary increase, so I strongly believe that enough is enough and I have to try that deal myself because I have always done all these hard works including some of them literally not relevant(moving stuffs, cleaning coffee machine, etc) to the main role I got employed for at the first time.

&#x200B;

But just in case, I want to ask here if you also think that I'm ok to demand a raise even if I'm still working on completing the website, which is also used by some of the workers depending on completed parts already, and most of the other things are just ready and waiting for being tested by other employees and getting feedback for more update or debug or something like that. Some of my friends said that I've waited enough for asking about it, while some said that I would better wait a little more to go for it like until my current project work is fully done.

&#x200B;

It is not only because I believe I'm ready to ask for a raise now, but it is also because I need to get more money to prepare for movement this summer and to take care of my family since I'm the only one making money for now.

&#x200B;

If I'm ok to demand a raise, could I get advices to do that with strategically good ways of talking to the HR department?

The work was brutal and hectic as our team managed multiple accounts and we're required to work with massive amounts of Advertising data, I did my best and performed well in the important areas but didn't meet certain business KPIs that lead me to being let go. 

I really wanted to stick with this company for at least 6 months but they didn't allow me to let it happen, even though I had some great connections that had tried their best to vouch for me as well.  

It sucks that corporate America just examines  everyone through a magnifying glass and doesn't look at their successes and accomplishments and is only concerned about their greedy profits. 

I'm going to try and apply direct hires now rather than working with these Indian IT companies where the workload is high and the job security is so low.",netsurfer79,43,0.7900000214576721,30,1707154529,2024-02-05 17:35:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ajma70/just_got_laid_off_today/,2,2024

1ajlss4,What would you do?,"I feel like I’m stuck at a crossroads… I got fired from a job I loved over a month ago and got a new job that I feel like I’m very at home in… the schedule is great, the people are great, but the pay… not so much. I feel like in certain times I could be going paycheck to paycheck, but at other times I’d be ok. But I have a schedule that at any other place I would have to be working there for 5+ years to get. It gives me lots of time to spend with my child and have lots of bonding time. I was concerned about living comfortably, so I applied to a few other places. I got an interview at a place that is a closer drive to home, but I would have to start on the bottom when it comes to seniority, and could probably make just as much as the job I’m at working part time, but then again I would have to wait for it. I applied to another place and they contacted me back and I believe I’m going to get an interview for this place as well. This place is about an hour away and the position makes over six figures but then again I won’t live very comfortably. I’ve talked to my parents about this and they told me that they always regretted not being able to spend time with me and my brother when we were children because they were always working. My brother says that the seniority thing will only be temporary and I need to pursue a career and stop thinking about the immediate future and think about what kind of life I can give my son and I with the income.

1ajlfwl,Career Change Advice,"Hi everyone, I'm at a bit of a crossroads here. I am a strength and conditioning coach and have been for a decade or so. I have a lot of extensive experience training athletes, professional and amateur. I have a bachelor's in Exercise Science and a minor in math, as well as a CSCS (those in the sports performance world will know what that certification is). A few months ago I was fired from a private hockey training facility. I was not fired for my performance but for disagreements I had with the owner of the company (don't really want to get into all of that on here). Changing jobs in the sports world is tough outside of the spring time when there tends to be a lot of turnover, so I am considering changing careers. The sports performance world is very unstable, there are a lot of shady owners, and the pay typically doesn't justify the stress or the effort to stay educated.  


I am here asking for advice as my experience and education feels extremely niche right now. I don't really have any meaningful experience outside of my field. I'm at my wits end as my unemployment has run out and I am living back at my mom's house. I am going to begin doordashing tomorrow to make some ends meet but does anybody have any ideas at good career paths for me?

I haven’t really been happy at work for awhile but to add to that I just got a new boss and they are absolutely miserable to work for. I really dread working there now.

My friend drives a truck and delivers chips and stuff to stores and some stores he stocks the shelves, others he just drops off the chips and leaves and someone else does it.  He says it’s not really that stressful and he makes about 15k more than I do.

I kinda want to apply to do that but after working in an office and having weekends off for so long I’m nervous. I’m also nervous if I do it and hate it I won’t be able to find another job in an office that easy.

So, I was in a situation where I had to learn things quickly and also it felt like I had to be independent and responsible for my own decisions"".

1ajkyrf,"New job, nothing to do","I started a new job in mid-December (full time remote/WFH if that matters).  I have cleared my 30 day probation period without any issues.  It's now February and I have received barely any training and often have hours and hours of downtime. 

My manager is super busy and I think overwhelmed, and while we have weekly check-ins and she's stated that she has a 90 day plan for training me properly she has yet to share that plan for me or even implement it.  While I wait for things to do I have asked my teammates repeatedly if there is anything I can do to help them, and as a result have been given a few one-off projects that I have completed successfully.  My manager has indicated she is happy with me just based on this alone.

But I am bored senseless.  I don't have a clear sense of what the normal cadence of work is day to day, week to week, month to month yet.  I don't know what responsibilities are going to be assigned to me long term.  I keep asking for stuff to do and being told to sit tight, they'll get to it soon.  I don't do well with this much downtime and I feel like I'm not really contributing anything and that that will bite me in the ass at some point; that said I honestly don't know what more I can do beyond volunteer to help the team, and most of the time that doesn't result in anything fruitful as it seems me team doesn't know what my manager has planned for me either.  

To top it all off, my manager got sick last week with COVID and was understandably MIA as a result.  She did keep us updated on her situation as the week went on, but this just resulted in a full week when I did literally nothing.  

Maybe I shouldn't complain about sitting around doing nothing and collecting a paycheck.  I have been using my downtime to get house chores done, excersize, etc.  I keep Teams open on my phone when I'm away from my desk so if someone reaches out I can run back up to my office and respond.

But I feel this constant low-grade anxiety about this situation.  I don't understand why they hired me.  I don't understand how my manager can claim to have a training plan for me and not implement it.  There are limits to what I can volunteer to help with because I am not trained up yet.  I want to grant my manager some grace because I do know she is overwhelmed (it is a huge part of why they hired me) and obviously she cannot help getting sick, but I just feel so lost.  

What should I do?  Continue to sit tight and wait?  Am I making a mountain out of a molehill?  Should I just enjoy this paid downtime for as long as I have it because eventually, hopefully, I will have an actual workload?  This is beginning to feel ridiculous.  My previous job was a toxic cesspool of doom and I'm so happy not to be there anymore but going from that to sitting around for eight hours a day with nothing to do just feels weird.

Would appreciate some advice, even if the advice is to chill out and stop being so anxious about this.",newstar7329,2,1.0,3,1707151462,2024-02-05 16:44:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ajkyrf/new_job_nothing_to_do/,2,2024

1ajkogh,Should I accept this job?,"Hey,
I am a technical person in medical/diagnostics.
I am mid-career and had finally landed my dream job about 5 years ago. This job is I would say is a bit of a challenge to get in my field. It's looked at as something above average it's looked at as an achievement.
So I've been in the job and I have excelled but the job is heavy on travel almost 100%. I also arranged my schedule to get home on Thursday night instead of Friday and I only work Fridays for few morning hours.

We do get every weekend at home as well as random weeks at home and every holiday but most of the time we are flying to different places or driving somewhere a few hours away.
I am a mother and I just had a baby and he is 4 months old.
I've been back to work now for a month. It has been hard to leave the baby and one week I took him with me because his dad is staying at home so is able to come to the hotel with me.
The job is very demanding of time to say the least.
I have had my eye out in my company for a remote position for a long time and one finally came up when I was on maternity leave.
I've been talking back and forth with that team and I've interviewed a couple of times but I'm feeling really really apprehensive about switching.
During my first chat with the manager he told me the job would probably be be days but it could possibly be second shift and he listed off a bunch of times none of them getting off at later than 8:00 p.m.
In my first real interview with the supervisor panel they said that the job would be day shift and introduced me to the day shift supervisor.
Just last week which was about a month since the last interview they told me that the job is actually second shift after all and it's from 1:30 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. everyday including Saturdays. Off Sunday and Monday.
In my previous job even though I worked long hours and I did a lot of extra things when I wasn't technically working, I did have freedom to go to a doctor's appointment when I felt like it, arranged my travel when I wanted to and to just stop and go eat when I felt like it. I like Independence and freedom and this job sounds very not free and the hours are so horrible I'm not sure that I'll really get to spend very much time with my baby anyway.
I've already said yes but I said it so quickly as soon as I found out that he was offering it to me I didn't think about these hours I don't like this and I was already feeling a bit sad about leaving a job I love because I know that that level of travel is not sustainable for me and a family for the long term because I want to be involved in my kids life but I'm not sure this is the right fit and I don't know what to do.  Which job sounds more doable?
Keeping in mind that I really like my travel job except for the family time aspect.

I also have a side business Airbnb that needs my attention to finish and the remote job would allow me to work from home and from the site of the side business which is amazing.
But otherwise I kind of feel like I'm not going to like this remote phone job.",tuffgrrrrl,1,1.0,0,1707150769,2024-02-05 16:32:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ajkogh/should_i_accept_this_job/,2,2024

However, I haven’t studied computer science and always worry that will affect me. I have heard it’s better to do certifications on the side and it will help me gain product knowledge. 

My company has its internal application that I am studying and understanding connections etc. but at the same time I’m learning SQL as I have a very basic knowledge of it. I would also add I have done a certification course for business analyst. It was more of techniques methodology understanding which has helped in the role.

1ajjyp6,An Early Career in Hong Kong,"Hi! :) I recently graduated as a Part 1 Assistant Architect and am eager to kickstart my career abroad. I've noticed that the job market and the overall mindset in the architectural industry in my home country seem stagnant, particularly in terms of construction innovations and collaborative creativity. Sure, there are opportunities, but I'm curious to see what's out there and crave a more dynamic atmosphere for my early career adventures.  
  
After looking around certain options that lean toward the more fast-paced, challenging environments, places such as Singapore and Hong Kong catch my eye. I have visited Hong Kong recently and through a tourists lens, everything from its urbanism to very localised and informal culture intrigues me and also feels like home (I'm from Malaysia). I have spoken to people and done some research on the work culture, types of offices and so on and a place that I see a potential in hiring and providing that opportunity is in MNCs such as ARUP through their graduate programme.  
  
So I guess what this post is for is to ask for any advice or food for thoughts from anyone with a perspective that I could learn from in regards to this and whether I should jump into this direction, specifically through the cultural lens of Hong Kong.  
  
How is working culture there? Is the place welcoming people who genuinely want to learn? So many questions but any input is really appreciated on my end! ><

I (29, M) have worked in student/youth ministry since I graduated college in 2017 with a BA in theology. It has been time to make a change for a while, but the part I struggle with most is what jobs to look into. It is hard to explain unless you've been in it, but when you are in full-time ministry, you are indeed in your own little bubble and don't have a sense of what the corporate/for-profit world looks like.

If I can get personal for a minute, my dad commited suicide 3 years ago and ever since then I have lost the drive/ boost to do better or look for more exciting opportunities. It's hard to explain and I'm not suicidal or anything like that, I'm a happy go lucky person who loves to laugh but career wise I just don't have it and just let life happen/ pass me by ever since that happened three years ago.

1ajiqbr,I work in financial consulting. Make a good living. I’m extremely unhappy. What else can I do with my background?,"I work in finance/consulting and make a good living. I am extremely unhappy. What else can I do with my background?

I have been working in finance/consulting since I got my Mater’s degree in applied economics in 2016. I’ve worked for big banks, big five accounting firms, and now work with financial consulting for engineering and utilities. 

I find no fulfillment in my work. In fact, the prospect of doing what I do has caused me anxiety attacks like the one I am having now. I make good living, just over 100K, and feel like I have potential to make more in this field, but I don’t know if I can keep on working with financial analysis and sitting in front of spreadsheets for 40 to 50 hours a week. 

I think that because of this, I have been losing focus and the quality of my work has suffered from it. Which only causes me more stress. 

I would love to explore other career options, but I don’t know what I can switch to that would keep me around the same level of income with my qualifications and experience. I recently had my first child and the pressure of providing for them is what is keeping me going right now.  

I’m willing to seek more education and certifications, depending on cost. I think that I might like to do things that involve more movement, more than just sitting in front of a computer. And definitely more human interaction. I was a high level athlete through college (that’s how I could afford to go, even), and appreciate being physically tired. I also have a good amount of knowledge about plants and landscaping, on the side I’m currently getting a Master Gardner certification. 

This is a bit of a rant, a bit of an ask for help. Does anyone know of any kind of careers, anything, someone who has 8 years of professional experience, project management certifications, and a graduate degree can switch to that maybe doesn’t involve being best friends with Excel?

Let's just get into it. After graduatung high school, I was so excited to join culinary arts, applied to a few institutions and got accepted too, my parents were okay with it too, everything was going well, until a month after graduation, my mother suddenly switched up and told me to do something else, and that I was just gonna be ""wasting my time"" doing culinary arts, I was completely heart broken, I couldn't even go against her because she's the one who's gonna be paying for the fees and all, so I started looking into something else, by this time I was completely lost, because I have never thought of something other than culinary arts, then a week later she randomly told me to apply for bachelors in psychology, and I was too lost to even argue and just agreed with her, I later found out that some of my extended family members were the ones who brainwashed her about how I'm gonna be unemployed if I did culinary arts, so they suggested psychology (my extended family members are mostly in the medical, engineering or business field) my mother told ne that I should just finish my bachelors in psychology and then I can do whatever I want after that, but alas, even after that I was forced to do a masters degree, I agreed and wanted to go for either Counseling Psychology or Industrial Psychology, but every one was against it, they told me to apply for Clinical Psychology, and I did, I know that whoever is gonna be reading this post is gonna be like ""you should've fought for yourself"", ""you should've done something"" but I can't okay, I can't go against my mother, I'm too weak, maybe it's because she had a difficult past, but I really can't go against her, so here I am now.

1ajhld9,Employment Until I Reach 70,"I (68F) am currently working full-time and will begin collecting SS in 21 months when I turn 70.  I have a long career in Instructional Design and technical writing.

  
In 2018, the organization I worked for merged with a larger system and my role has changed several times since then.  For the past 3 years, I have been very happy with my job developing educational content in support of the organization’s goals.

  
Everything changed last fall when new leadership discontinued my department’s initiatives and I was essentially demoted to a role of administrative support.  I am unhappy with this decision to say the least. I have shared my disappointment with my manager, letting her know that I would prefer work better suited to my skills. I also wondered aloud why they choose to keep me as opposed to replacing me with an admin person in who costs less.  Her response was that they value my skills but cannot afford an admin person. 

  
The organization is aware that my retirement is imminent. Perhaps they hope I will proceed with retiring as opposed to their laying me off, which would require them to cover my unemployment or offer a severance package.

  
I need income to get me through until I can receive SS but am very unhappy with my job. I don’t want to spend the next 21 months in misery – I am too old for that. I have been unsuccessful in finding freelance or parttime employment via Fiverr, Indeed, and LinkedIn.

  
With so many resourceful people in this group, I am hoping someone can offer ideas that I haven’t thought of regarding how I can find meaningful work that will get me through the next 21 months.

1ajgig1,"Working in Higher Education, even though I never obtained a degree myself - Dealing with Imposter Syndrome","For some context, I am 30, based in the UK, autistic (diagnosed at 5 years old) and was a typical shy, introverted kid at school for most of my time there.  
Academically, I would say I did pretty average, if not below average (got mostly C's in GCSE) and at the time, I dropped out of my A Levels because I hated the experience of repeating school all over again, which is what it felt like to me. Once I left school for good, I went on to do an apprenticeship, which allowed me to gain an NVQ in Customer Service, and several years later after working from job to job, I decided to gain a HND in Photography whilst I was working part-time in an NHS office job (for context, a HND is the equivalent to 2 years of a degree and is a specific qualification gained mostly from further ed colleges in the UK as far as I know). To date, this is the highest qualification I have.  
Fast forward to the present, and I have now worked in higher education for the last 4 years. I've worked mainly in professional services (so not as an academic, i.e not a tutor or lecturer, but more support staff) and my current role which I've worked in the last 6 months has had me working as part of the digital education team, which I thoroughly enjoy.  
The reason I post this is because I feel there is quite a sense of irony in the career path I have chosen; working for a university, but having never gone to one, or even graduating with a degree. There is always this voice in the back of my head that tells me ""Who do you think you are, working in a University when you never even completed your own education!?""  
Personally, I try to look at it in the sense that I love learning, and that's why I chose the job that I have today, but throughout my life I always hated school for a different amount of reasons. (i.e the bullying, the drama, uninteresting subjects we were all forced to learn, etc.) So I'm wondering if anyone else here has ever felt the same way about their career? Perhaps didn't do so well academically, but works in an academically succesful area, such as higher ed?   
TLDR: I work in higher ed, but never obtained a degree. Love my job, but still feel like I don't belong as a result of my lack of a degree. Also, hated school in my younger years and wasn't exactly academically gifted from the beginning, which also sets the Imposter Syndrome in pretty well. Anyone else feel this way? How would you advise overcoming this anxiety?",ChocobroMoglord,1,1.0,1,1707139742,2024-02-05 13:29:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ajgig1/working_in_higher_education_even_though_i_never/,2,2024

I graduated in ‘22 with a BA in genetics. There was a legitimate plan with that, but it fell through for health reasons that made my original career plan not possible. Not a great rug to have ripped under you, to be honest. 
I’ve been able to land a pretty good tech job with transferable skills (still in healthcare, trying to get out of it I think). It’s pretty corporate, too (project management, but a little untraditional) I feel like that was a good step 1 in changing what I’ve got going on. I’m lost now at what step 2 should be. I still need to decide what direction I really want to go in, but when I do, how do I convince other jobs that I do have the skill set to jump over from healthcare?

on the other hand, i'm no good at STEM/ cs. i took physics, chem and math in high school, and hated it (math not as much but physics- oh god- it was all so abstract and theoretical; but maybe it was the way i was taught idk). i love writing, and i've been drawn towards journalism for a long time. personally money doesn't matter much to me, i'd rather cook at home and donate whatever's left than eat out.  
  
and at the end i'm scared i'll look back on my engineering career and wonder what it was all for. so-- are there any such people who struggle at phy/chem/math and have different callings, but are still in/ have done engineering? do you guys regret not majoring in something you like? or does that paycheck make all the pushing through and feelings of emptiness worth it at the end?

1aj81vo,Is this the norm?,"I started a new job last year. In my interview process I had been told that there was a busy season where I might need to pitch in extra hours occasionally. However I found this to be an extreme understatement. I was regularly working 12+ hour days and was so stressed out I got a stomach ulcer and needed to increase some of my medications. I love the job but I don’t think I can handle that three months again. Is it normal for a job to have periods like that? I work in Data Analytics and my prior experience had been political but I had never seen a busy season like this even in election years…

I honestly have never felt this way about a job before. long story short I used to have a front desk job at small doctors clinic for over a year and a half now and now I took on this new job at a hospital where I am on my own and have my own office, I was very excited plus with the pay I was getting I took it because I help my mom a lot and I plan to go back to school this year. well management is poor, the staff are not welcoming or friendly to help new people. I know not every place is perfect but lack of communication drives me crazy. it has only been my third week and I have been losing sleep over this job and almost feel I have lost some self confidence which is not like me. I am very strong and adamant about  keeping work and life separate but now I find myself thinking about what I am walking into tomorrow instead of trying to enjoy the rest of my day after work. I love the healthcare industry I love patients I love administrative work but these people have really made me feel like running away from it. anyways my plan is to either stick it out for my probation period of 6 months or 2 years until I graduate from my program and move to east coast (which idk because the workload is crazy and with the stress I already feel for this job i just idk) just wanted to hear peoples opinions (:",Severe-Key-1014,2,1.0,1,1707103917,2024-02-05 03:31:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aj6vi2/cant_believe_im_regretting_this/,2,2024

1aj5uqp,Would leave a company you really like for more money and better hours?,"I have been with my current employer for over 7 years now, it's the longest I've ever stayed at one place by far, and I am overall very happy and comfortable where I am. But there are concerns, like there are with any job. Pay and benefits being one of them. I make pretty darn good money for what I do and where I do it. I run an auto shop, it's a smaller shop and I make a little over 5% commission on whatever the shop does which is converted into an hourly pay which equates to around 33-34/hr. I work 6 days a week (49ish hours) and am making around 85k a year. 

But I want to stop working weekends because I just had a daughter last summer and I feel like I'm missing out on time with her, time I cant get back or put a price on. But it's hard to completely give up the extra hours Saturdays pay me, it nearly completely pays for daycare (400 a week, of which I pay 250). 

My plan is to talk to my owner and see what he can do for me to keep me comfortable, but based on previous annual discussions of raises, I don't think he is going to be anywhere near accepting of the jump in base pay I'm looking for. I'm currently guaranteed 28, and this is likely to go to 32, with my avg going to 35-36, but I'm looking for more of a guarantee of 34-36 with an avg of closer to 40. 

I do over a million in sales every year and the shop is doing better than ever before. But I don't see my owner going for a 20% raise + 2 extra weeks of pto (I want 4 instead of 2, 2 of our other new hires get that now). Plus the 401k match is an absolute joke. Last year I contributed around 7k, they matched around $400. I'm a new dad so retirement is especially on my mind, and I know there's nothing he can do about that.

I have looked at government fleet management jobs, but with my felonies that might be hard to get until I can get those expunged in another 4 1/2 years. But there is another big name shop some other techs I've worked with have left for hiring. They arent even open on weekends and are looking to start at 110k, at 40 hours. This would be an absolutely massive raise and change for me. But I'm also unsure about potentially leaving a company that has never done me wrong and an owner I truly love working with. I've had bad experiences at shops before with butting heads with ownership, but I'm curious enough that I want to talk to this owner. My resume is pretty outstanding and they were very quick to respond. I'm going to schedule a call with them next week sometime but if they offer me something, would you even take it or use it as leverage with my current owner. Or not even tell him my intentions and put my 2 weeks in. If I leave on good terms and this new place doesn't work out I could very likely come right back, but not necessarily viewed in the same light I am now. Plus, like I said I'm a new dad, and job stability is incredibly important right now, but so is making enough money to save for her and us to be able to not work until we are 75. 

The fact that I've even considered looking around is almost an internal sign that I'm worried about other things going on inside our own companies ownership and where I will be standing when all that dust settles. But I also can be self destructive, especially when everything is going so great for me, and I worry doing something like this is just more of that. 

Would you take this risk, use it as leverage, or hardly even bother?",Zathamos,3,0.800000011920929,1,1707100692,2024-02-05 02:38:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aj5uqp/would_leave_a_company_you_really_like_for_more/,2,2024

1aj5amo,CxO at a $X0m company or VP at a $X00m company?,"I'm facing a decision in my career and could use some advice, considering the lack of clarity in this situation. Currently, I hold the role of Vice President at a company valued in the mid $x00 million range, and I'm contemplating a potential move. I want to weigh the long-term benefits of two different paths:  
Exploring a lateral move to another Vice President role in a larger organization with thousands of employees, generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, and a global presence in a well-known industry.

  
Considering a shift to a CXO position at a company with only 1/10th of the revenue, a smaller team, and operating in a niche market. It's not a startup, but it lacks a global reach. The CXO role would likely involve a more significant equity component. Both options come with notable increases in salary and bonuses, and the CXO role might also offer a more lucrative equity package. Importantly, the second option is expected to sell earlier than the first.

  
I'm leaning towards the CXO position, enticed by the exit opportunity and associated financial gains. However, I'm wary of getting stuck in in the smaller market, and I'm also not keen on staying within a large-scale organization without sufficient decision-making authority.

Thanks for checking this out!

TLDR; Just spent the past 3 years for my BA in software dev. It's impossible to gets jobs and interviews in this market and I'm just burnt out now and tired. I want a career. Should I stick it out or say screw it and look into other careers that might need a certificate of some sort? If not software dev, what careers / certs do you recommend?

I am finish up my bachelors using my GI Bill in Software development. I've spent the past like 3 years programming and learning, but not sure if it is worth continuing on. I love programming, but don't care for the stress mentally or on my personal life with the amount of time dedicated to this. 

I am thinking of looking at other career fields. I rather not go to college again if I don't have to; I already am finishing the Bachelors in soft dev and will essentially just throw this away. I just want to make a decent wage to buy a house in 2024 and not life paycheck to paycheck lol. I'm okay with doing certifications.

1aj1qmh,Looking for mental health-related career advice,"Lost my job. Now I know why. Not sure what to do.

This is a bit of a weird question...

I work in tech and after nearly three years at a very large company, I lost my job for violating policy. I was also banned from ever using any of their products for the rest of my life. Yes, I did do something very, very stupid. The whole thing feels like a dream and I couldn't figure out why I would do something so uncharacteristic of myself.

I ended up moving home, getting back on old meds, and keeping a more regular schedule with a mental health professional.

Well... Fast forward about 1.5 years and my psychiatrist believes I was suffering constant mania for about a year due to side effects of a medication I had switched to months earlier.

She also thinks it was exacerbated because I was in a poor living situation that ruined my sleep. And I had previously been prescribed Ritalin (then Adderall) for 25 years of my life.

I sent all this information to the company because I want to try and save my reputation. But it continues to be this dark cloud hanging over my head every day. 

So many people told me I wasn't acting normal in that year. But I kept shrugging it off. Now, in hindsight, it's all so obvious. There are so many things I did that were uncharacteristic of me.

Should I go to Japan to work as an ALT despite my parents being against it?,"A couple of days ago, the moment I had been waiting for so many months came and I got my Certificate of Eligibility to work as an ALT (Assistant Language Teacher) for a dispatch company in Japan.

To give a little bit of context, I am a 25 year old engineering graduate from Europe and since I graduated, I have spent the last year and a half doing side hustles in sales to get by. My plan is to go to Japan for a timespan of 1 or 2 years to do ALT teaching, and then leave Japan and go back to my home country, or any other country abroad to pursue my career in engineering.  
  
However, my parents don't let a day go by without reminding me what a waste of time it is to go across the globe to do such a low-paying job in a field that is not related whatsoever to my degree and has no beneficial work experience to offer me. Basically, they think that going this ALT route is a career suicide and it is bound to bring irreversible consequences to my career and to my post-Japan life. Even though I keep reminding them that it is only for a little while and it might even be for as little as 1 year, they insist that it will destroy my carrer and future life.

Please help me, I need all advice I can get. I really love my family and I don't want to leave and disappoint my parents/grandparents and make everyone feel depressed or feel like I abandoned them and disregarded their feelings.

1aiz5ka,Advise on If and How i should approach management for a raise.,"I work in management reporting for a specific department that reports on both income and expense lines, as well as has various sub departments under it that require reporting for each individual sub department. 

Other members of the reporting team are paid 2 and 3 x my grade and only look at expenses for one department. 

Recently we went through management change and as a result last month end was late.

I have been told to pull my socks up, push harder, work smarter and know absolutely everything in the p&l. Thats fine, i agree i could approach tasks in a more efficient proactive way and have taken steps to ensure this month end is smoother. 

My issue is the expectations dont match up with the grade scaling in our team. My immediate supervisor and FC for our department is 4 grades above me and i feel im expected to perform at that level. And if we were to compare to the other team members it can reasonably be argued I do a relatively decent job reviewing expenses accross maybe 40 sub departments for my lower grade.

Am i just being an entitled whiny brat or do i have a case to argue for better benefits?",Ok_Junket1793,1,1.0,0,1707082233,2024-02-04 21:30:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aiz5ka/advise_on_if_and_how_i_should_approach_management/,2,2024

1aiy4cv,Leave State Government or stay for pension,"I am a tax auditor for a state government with approx 15 years of service. I can retire from the state in 9.5  years at age 51 and draw roughly $2k a month pension for the rest of my life. Have access to health insurance but it's expensive. Would be roughly $900 a month as my kids will be teenagers at that time and then $500 a month when it's just myself. And it's not even that good of insurance.  I plan to continue working for a private company upon my retirement for at least another 10-15 years. 

My quandary is that with 15 years experience, I make $58k and the department has hired beginning auditors (with no prior experience) that will be making approx $1k less than myself after they get off 6-month probation, so basically my value as a senior auditor is diminished and has gotten me thinking about looking to see what is available out in the private industry. Also, note there aren't any major promotions that I could pursue within the government. 

I could leave state government and take a consulting position position where I would make approx $40k more a year. In my current job, I have no worries about layoffs, travel is nonexistent, great work-life balance, etc. The consulting position would require some travel, more hours, etc. but pay $40k a year more. 

Also, if I leave state government right now, my pension would be approx $1400 a month starting at age 65.

Just thought I would get thoughts on this as I'm torn on whether to pursue the $40k extra per year now or stay put in my current job for the stability plus the $2k pension payments here in around 10 years.

1aivj2v,"Teammate doing tasks that are my responsibility, what to do?","Hello, I don't want to give too specific details since I know people from my job use Reddit.

I work in tech, a couple of months ago my team went through a reorg. As a result, my scope of responsibilities changed, I stopped being the lead of a whole vertical, but in return I'm now in charge of another one. In the past all the team members were somewhat involved in tasks of this new vertical, but now they decided that a single person should manage it. They assigned it to me since 1) it's very related to the other vertical I manage and 2) I have extensive experience in this area.

I had a meeting with the rest of the team and explained which would be my functions now and how we were going to be working together. Everybody agreed. However, since then one of my teammates has done some projects that I should've led. What usually happens is that he starts the project and half way through I have to get involved because a stakeholder said that they needed someone with more expertise. Or they finish it and realize later that they didn't take into account some important things how it'd affect other verticals and now we have to start from 0.

I have already asked them to get me involved in these projects and reminded them of our new way of working. Our manager has also told them that they need to get myself involved in all of these. However, there hasn't been any change since then. 

I don't know what to do because I've already talked with both my coworker and my manager, but nothing has come out if it. Also, this person has more seniority than me and is close to our manager so it seems like a losing game.

1aive7j,"Need advice, I feel lost as an engineer","Hey! 

I hope this makes sense. I am going back at work after taking a week off due to burn out (although at work it was officially just a vacation week) and I am terrified. 

I have finished my degree last year and have been at this job for almost 6 months now. 

My degree was a series of ups and downs that really torn my mental and physical health apart. It was incredibly difficult but after changing major and taking a semester off while working full-time for a year, I ended up finishing it in 7.5 years (instead of the normal 5). I wish it was in a triunfant note, but my masrer thesis was a mess, I have ended up with a good yet average grade on it and it was just the cherry on top of the cake of my failures: not being able to produce a coeherent work, having a subpar text, feeling pretty ashamed of myself. The fact that it has been almost a year and I still hit my head on a wall because of it does say a lot. 

So I have ended up finding a job in analog IC design in another country. I liked the area of RF/analog, had 2 or 3 courses about it in my masters (which was on general electronics engineering) and was excited about taking this opportunity. Maybe this was it I thought, maybe I was finially going to prove to myself that I can do this and that I was going to finally be able to participate in projects, understand what I was doing for once, feel accomplished at my work. 

Couldn't I have been more wrong? Every day st work is a nightmare. I never undeestand anything, I lack the fundamentals. And this is not a case of imposter syndrome I really don't know some basic stuff, and then when I try to study it at home, solve some issue with my circuit and think I am finally getting it, I suddenly tealize that I don't and back to zero. There is so much that I need to learn, yet so little time, and I don't know where to turn myself. Indeed I never read one of those main books like Razavi, Baker or Gray & Meyer, as my classes only used some slides and had some projects. Perhaps I should start there but then I feel that the circuits presented there differ from work and I get lost again. It is hard to find documentation on the subject or to het organized. I was advised to keep like a work diary to register my learnings so I can keep track of everything and will start doing this now that I am back. 

But I am so anxious, I feel like I will never be able to do it, to reach any expertise kn the topic and become a good engineer. On practical terms, I feel like I will never be able to progress in my career, even financially (which has been a stress since forever), or worst case I feel that the company will fire me... I feel mentally blocked, this week it really felt good to disconnect and avoid thinking about it, but now that it is time to go back it is truly terrifying. I feel like I never should have been hired which makes me feel even worse. Any help is appreciated.",Key-Independent-8467,3,1.0,2,1707073084,2024-02-04 18:58:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aive7j/need_advice_i_feel_lost_as_an_engineer/,2,2024
1aiuu59,Data Science or Finance Masters?,"I am a junior with a 3.1 GPA at a T25 university studying Computer Science with a minor in Statistics. I’m currently deciding between 2 masters programs, one for data science, and one for finance. I have completed all the requirements for admission to both programs and can afford both without debt. (Both programs are at my current university)

The data science program is a lot closer to my current field of study. I think that it could give me a leg up in the job hunt, especially with the worsening job market for software engineers. I have heard the program is difficult for beginners but I have experience with CS and statistics so i’m not super worried.

For the finance degree, I’ve become a lot more interested in pursuing a finance career in the last year as well. I’ve been admitted into a couple different selective events from commercial banks and am applying to a number of different finance related positions for summer 2024.

In the future I see myself working in a business position rather than a tech related position. If I go into software engineering I plan on getting an MBA after 3ish years of work. So I am worried about getting a redundant finance degree then getting an MBA slightly later. Is it possible for me to get the data science degree then go into the financial sector? 

Which program should I pick?

1aiu2dv,AI resistant career options?,"A little about myself first! I’m 31, have a bachelors in Geographic Information Systems, spent a few years in a GIS role after college, transitioned to healthcare IT in more of a training role for a few years, and now work in healthcare software in an odd consultant/semi-technical role. 

I’ve been wanting to change careers for a while now, but AI anxiety is making it feel a bit more urgent. I know AI is going to penetrate most industries, but it would be nice to do something where AI is more of an ancillary tool, or less involved. 

I’m open to going back to school, but I want to be sure I’m going back for something “safe”. I know trades are an option, but I’m goofy and uncoordinated so I’d probably end up hurting myself and getting yelled at lol. I know patient care options like nursing would be an option as well, but having been in their environment I don’t think I’d be cut out for it.

1aimnoc,How do you hold a full time job while battling mental illness ?,"Hi Guys,  
  
So just a bit of background. I have been diagnosed with depression and OCD 2 years ago. Since then, I have done battle every day of my life. Sometimes gaining ground and sometimes losing ground. I'm very, very tired. Currently only relying on medication to stabilize me and no therapy involved as I gave up on it 6 months ago when I realised that they can only help those who want to help themselves. And I had given up on myself so they couldn't do much.  
  
Anyways, the main point of this post is this : How do you juggle a full time job while fighting this disease ?  
  
For context, my first job was 2 years. It was in a small startup that had no business whatsoever. Despite that we still didn't shut down, I have no idea why. The workload was very little as there was next to nothing to do and I somehow managed to stay afloat. I was prepared to stay here all my life to rot but eventually there came a time where I thought I might be able to get something better elsewhere... So I tried to venture out into an MNC and well...it has NOT been smooth sailing.  
  
It has been 2 months since I joined and midway through my probation period I had a performance review where my deficiencies were highlighted for me to work on. They company and my boss is very nice and really do seem like they want me to improve. But...given my OCD I was still frequenting job portals in case I had to exit and I didn't want to be caught off guard. Today, I stumbled upon the exact role that I was in. Granted, this was a generic, bottom level role that had around 30 members and the posting was accompanied by a few other postings within the company, but to me it was all to certain that my fate was sealed. I texted my boss to ask him how I was performing since the performance review and he gave very vague answers.  
  
I really don't know...

1aikpge,Journey to leadership & management,"Hey,

Just a short intro, i am on my fourth year in my career working as a IT application specialist, working with a lot of different consultant firms and internal stakeholders in the company, had the chance to co-lead a whole transition of our IT processes to map them more towards ITIL and align with regulatory requirements. I am confident in the skills i have gained and now i am feeling ready to pursue my next goal, leadership. 

I had a development plan discussion with my current manager and i said that i want to focus on developing my leadership skills in order to take a management position at my current company or in the same conglomerate. I was also going to think about what future roles / areas and we'll sort out a succession plan / career plan. 

I already know some of the areas where i know i can improve such as public speaking, coaching and so on. But there will also be an anonymous survey going out to partners and internal people i have worked with to get med feedback and hopefully digest more on the weakness i need to develop on. 

I am just asking if anyone can get some feedback what i should think about, consider, avoid or even share some similar experiences?

1aij4pg,Recommended certification as specialisation when finishing Master's,"Hi everyone, I have a quick question and I would greatly appreciate any input or insights from a more informed crowd such as you guys! Here goes:

Approaching the final stretch of my Master's in Business Management, just one semester to go. The thing is, my major is in business management and leadership, but it kinda lacks a specific focus for what I'm looking for: I am further interested in a career in finance / investment / investment analysis / banking / equity, that kinda area.  
Given that my last semester will be rather free (did most of the heavy lifting in the previous ones), I'm thinking about putting some work into a certificate or course with the goal to put a specialization on my CV, something that stands out and directly appeals to employers in the area I'm looking for.  
So I'm here to ask for any suggestions or insights, particularly if you have any recommendations that would make my CV shine in the finance and investment are. I know a certificate does not replace any kind of experience, but it might help and seeing as I will have the time to do it, I might as well.

In terms of certification / courses, I have been considering the following options:

* **Harvard Business School Online**: they provide a three course / certificate track in [**Finance & Accounting**](https://online.hbs.edu/subjects/finance-accounting/) ending in **Certificate of Specialisation in Finance and Accounting**, which sounds  exactly like what I'm looking for. The only issue is I don't know how good HBS *Online* sounds on a CV, otherwise the courses look good to me (I have experience with Harvard's teaching method).
* [**CFA Institute**](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa/)'s certification: either [**CFA Level 1**](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa) (what benefit is having only level one when getting employed?) or their [other certification](https://store.cfainstitute.org/certificates/). My issue with these is that it feels like a very professional certification that would be taken with a specific job later on, not doing school as specialisation, what do you think?
* The [**CAIA**](https://caia.org/stacker?cid=6edee2a5-e575-45f7-a6de-c0471aa76344&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAiP2tBhBXEiwACslfnr_FYrwlIOYLbd0HLhrH6YxxYooTeym7hLRYiyQEqYlhrfKQC18_BhoCcfoQAvD_BwE), as this looks also very close to what I am interested in! I don't know much about what impact it has though.

Essentially, I have around 8 months to put into this, which is very manageable for every option.

I would greatly appreciate any thoughts on how to approach this ideally and what would have the best impact on employers would be!

Now, I'm paid very little($420 USD a month) for a 30 hour week. My contract entails a starting amount of $300, then $340 after the first few months. It is also in the contract that after a certain date, my hours will increase to 40, for a total of $440. We are well past that. Some time later, my boss tells me he's pleased with the hours of work(30) and does not want to increase it, but he will raise my pay to $400. 

  
At the end of Christmas, he gives me a raise to $420 for performance. That leads us to today where he claims I've been being mispaid and I'm to expect my pay to be $360 for the following month. I contest this, and he's said he won't ask for me to return the money, however ""per the contract, it will be $340 > $360 with the end of year raise. 

  
What response do you recommend? This may be a legal issue, however I'm not quite sure about that given it is a remote job and contract. It is likely null and void as it does not hold up to my local law, nor were the terms respected.

1aigiq8,Stuck,"*Also posted in r/startups

 about 2-years into my career and have had success landing great opportunities (fellowships, contract work, etc.) at large companies and heavy hitters in the industry that I'm in. 

I just recently landed my first salaried position at a company that, on paper, should be my dream job... but it's not. The work is really cool, and the name will literally get me anywhere I want, but those are the only true benefits of the job. The hours are long, my boss isn't what I expected them to be, employee morale is low, I'm not fitting in, etc.. In reality, they know there's 100 people waiting behind me that would die to be sitting where I am.

I recently got an offer at a startup in the same industry that has had some success. It's been around for a few years, has a decent amount of employees, and has made a name for itself. The position pays a little more than what I'm making now, the role would allow me a new skill set (not to mention a higher title), and will allow me more autonomy than where I am now. Plus, in theory, I'd be able to move up faster. 

I'm not necessarily concerned about the runway the new company has, but more concerned about leaving my current job after so little time. Regardless of where the startup goes, I'm not sure if I could ever go back to this company or any of its affiliates (let's just say it's the most well known company in the industry). Yet, on the flip side, I feel as if this new company wants me now, maybe they'll still want me in the future? 

Another part of me thinks, well if I hate this company 2 months in, then who knows what time will bring? What if I rage quit, get fired, or even worse, get laid off down the line? Then I'll feel really dumb.  

I know that whatever I choose I have to own. If I stay at my current job, I'll need an attitude adjustment and live with certain things I don't agree with. If I join the new company I'll have to work my ass off and drink the koolaid to make a name for myself, and if it crumbles, need to have a game plan. 

Those are just a few of my initial thoughts, but there's a lot going on that I'm not quite sure how to articulate here. I apologize if I haven't provided enough clarity, but maybe you all could help me synthesize my thoughts better.",ifitisntthe,1,1.0,0,1707024909,2024-02-04 05:35:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aigiq8/stuck/,2,2024

1aicyqv,What should I do to get a better performance review and protect myself from harassment and unprofessional conduct?,"So basically for 6 months, I kept getting harassed by two developers. I was hired as an intermediate (0-3 years of experience, salary was the same regardless of experience) It started out well, and after the first 25 commits, I was told that code reviews for my tickets were no longer needed. Then one of the developers became super toxic against me, screaming at me for causing a bug, only to find out that the bug was caused by his code and he didn't read the error log properly. Then again he screamed at me for one line of code I removed that triggered an onPageLoad validation, which seemed to be a bug, because there was a bug entered for a similar bug, calling it a feature, I tried to deescalate the situation asking the other developer to talk it out, and then he complained to one of my supervisor, and I was reprimanded and delayed my probation period.  
  
I kept working hard despite this, and I slowed down after a bit, because I was told to work more slowly, and follow instructions, and I did, they started ghosting me, and I just worked on until my probation period was over, they didn't tell me it was over and got no feedback whatsoever. Then two weeks ago, those two tell me imply I am not working fast enough, and he completed a task in 5 min, when the team appraised it at 5 hours, I didn't even start and he claimed I would have taken the whole 5 hours to complete the task. I did 3 tasks appraised at 10, at 5 each. Then they kept attacking me, and he seemed to have made a threat saying something might happen if I keep working slowly. The supervisor seemed to have said something to him, and the supervisor told me to not take his comment seriously.  
  
Then a week later, the same guy talks about having a bug, I couldn't reproduce it, because he showed something getting called repeatedly, and he threatened me of talking to my supervisor if I kept being defensive about it, saying I can't reproduce the bug. One of them gives me a little more details, and I was able to reproduce the bug. Then they kept mentioning a code I pushed like 4 months ago, and I tell them it's not me and I identified the commit that was causing the bug. The next day, the guy keeps talking about the same bit of code, implying the code I wrote was causing the bug, I keep answering that it's not my code, and he kept accusing me of being defensive and not trying to fix the bug. The guy ends up giving me the task of fixing the bug, because he couldn't fix it, and I fix it.  
  
Then I noticed that my supervisor gave me a bad review, giving me 2/4 for every aspect, and the comment was ""he did a lot of tickets, but they weren't complex, the code is good, but he's not fully integrated with the team, and we've never seen people not get along"" something along that line. I looked at the commits I've made, and I did 70% of the commits, 60% of the lines of code added, 65% of the tickets with 100 lines or more, I set up the unit testing since they asked me to (I am guessing they didn't know how to do this).  
  
The code is a mess, and there are too many tech debt, and because they told me to fix things quickly and not refactor the whole application, I try to quickly fix some issues, but I noticed they use this to pick on me, and find issues with my work. It's really ridiculous. Also, I've shown the chat transcripts to HR and they seem to agree I am on the defensive, and I should be more assertive.  
  
They were a lot of instances where I ask a question, and one of the guy says ""do as you want, I don't care."" or made some sarcastic comment when I ask for some assistance with a merge commit that wasn't going through or try to make it sound I didn't understand something easily understood when the description in the ticket was contradictory and I couldn't understand exactly what he wanted. Is there anything I can do to protect myself from them? I am thinking I shouldn't even pick the same tasks as them and do easier tasks since they are more senior and I've been working there for more than 6 months.

1aibjjp,Job gave me a starting offer however their pay is extremely low given the position and the experience that i bring. How do i handle this?,"There are 2 numbers in my head right now:   
  
1.) Is what i would expect someone with my work history to be making given a decade of experiece and the field of work that I've been in competitive markets.  
  
2.) what I would consider accepting for this job as an introductory ""trial"" period to prove my value to the company.   
  
\#1 is far higher than #2 but #2 is still higher than what i think anybody is making at that company including the people who interviewed me (i didnt ask of course) its not something you do in an interview so i have to assume.  
  
I havent responded yet becuase I thought it would be an unreasonable demand, but I do see some potential in the company it is a small but quickly growing business.  
  
To be more specific, here are the numbers breakdown:   
  
1.) its a typical 9-5, 40 hours a week job with health benefits. I dont really care about this that much. I already have good medical coverage.  
  
2.) Starting pay is above minimum wage but given my expenses i cannot consider working full time for under $24 an hour. (ideally I would want that to be much higher but I can SURVIVE on 24/hr)  
  
3.) They want to start me at $18/hr.   
  
4.) I have thought about asking for a written contingency stating that I will accept these terms with a performance re-eval at the end of the 3 or 4 months to bump it up to 24 an hour.

5.) all 3 of the managers that interviewed me explicitly stated that I was overqualified for the position that I came into interview for. (I got this impression as well) they really like me and extended the offer almost immediately during the interview and I inverviewed with several managers with the business. Its a very small company (under 100 people) so that doesnt mean much.  
  
5.) They interviewed me for a few different roles so I think there is a possibility to jump up to junior management (or other roles with more responsibility), but this is of course a gamble. why would they promote me over someone else with more seniority unless I just happen to schmooze perfectly and just knock every key metric out of the ballpark? 

in my experience there are too many factors that can go wrong (many out of my control) that can be the reason for someone else to get promoted before me. I'm not opposed to working hard, but I am realistic about office politics.  
  
Would it be uncouth or outrageous for me to come out and just say hey I appreciate your time, but I couldn't see myself working here unless I make at least $24/hour minimum? or do i just ghost them and keep looking?  
  
 I will say that human capital should be expensive and i should be able to demand what I reasonably think my skills are worth since I've been working for many years and what I need salarywise to keep up with my expenses. I don't think this is that crazy to think or say.

1aiaeu1,Pathway help.,"About to graduate high school and I know two things; I need to be able to modify and own multiple cars one day, and I can sit down and study textbooks If I want something bad enough. I want to avoid school after college if possible, even though I've always dreamed about the college experience. I'm here to ask for insight onto the different fields I'm contemplating going into to help me make a better decision. I currently attend a charter tech school that teaches me trades, so I'm proactively learning about machining and cars.

The way I see it I have a few routes which I will list from most realistic to least realistic, for me.

Mechanic (seemingly a horrible choice after weighting pay and time)

Machinist (cnc, factory, ideally contractual or automotive fab)

HVAC

Flooring

Electrician (don't know shit about the field, nor am I electrically inclined)

Food industry, bartender.

Sales (I doubt my charisma)

My main goal at the moment is to put my foot in the auto industry. After thinking about it, I don't want to risk being burnt out on cars and trucks. It's my true passion and obsession. After talking to a buddy that works at a tire shop, what the hell am I trying to get myself into? I wouldn't be unhappy working on vehicles but I'd certainly be unhappy working my way up to any position I can imagine would pay worth it. All I want is to own my own performance auto shop one day.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I had my year end review last week and have mixed feelings. Need your input to help me decide if what I feel is valid or it's overthinking. 

Hiring salary -150k
Moving bonus -10k 
Role - Data Scientist
Past experience -1 year(chatbot dev)
Masters in AI 
Fully in-person job with few remote days

Year end review remarks:

 We had 8 individual categories. I got a strong performance in 7 and low performance in 1 (organizational skills). Overall is however meets expectations (this was expected since boss already said he is going to give this since it's our first year). 

Salary hike -20%
Bonus -30k

I was however expecting a 30% salary hike, since this was promised mid year when a third person from our team quit and we presented a united front to take over the job and requested for compensation in the end. I understand corporate games and realize that I am the victim of one so I'm going to shake it off. 

However, in our team of two, my peer (data engineer) got the same bonus and a 8% hike but that still puts his salary above mine. He has been here for 6months while I have been here for 1 year. 

Now, before we talk about performance difference, I have been awarded top performer this year and my review was raving. My boss has multiple times( even when we were discussing negotiating when he saw that I wasnt as happy) suggested that I'm better and my skill set is way beyond. 

Now I understand that my hike % was higher and since he was hired with a bigger salary, he makes more. But I feel like the difference could've been shown in many ways but they decided not to or felt this was fair.

1ai8bpo,Bombed a performance meeting not sure what to do now. Feel like I’m going to have a nervous breakdown.,"As some background I had some missteps last month at my remote job. One of them she asked me to take care of while I was at lunch. I didn’t see it until I came back 25 minutes later when I also received an email asking if I was working. She proceeded to say she handled it. It wasn’t life or death was just data that transmitted not corrected when I thought it was. 

She then called a performance meeting almost 2 weeks ago where she basically said these errors can’t happen and how she asked me to do something and I didn’t do it. She asked if I felt overwhelmed. I said yes and she proceeded to list off things I could be overwhelmed with. I told her data entry an essential part of our job. She proceeded to tell me my data entry count was lower than standard. Then she asked about my home life and if I was dealing with any issues there. I stupidly admitted I had personal issues. She said maybe work could take my mind off them. 

2 days ago she transferred a client to someone else and my work load is extremely low. So much so I’m spending half my day waiting for work to come in. She’s also scheduled someone to shadow me via teams to see my “flow”. She shadowed me twice and will potentially have to shadow me again. 

Since then my company announced my department is being let go in 7 months in favor of computers doing our job. 

Can anyone offer any advice before I have a nervous breakdown? I’m actively applying to jobs but I want to stay the full 7 months if possible. 

When do I ask for more work? I feel like since it’s not even been 2 weeks since my performance meeting I can’t ask for more work  but I don’t feel right sitting around waiting for work. We’re technically supposed to reach out to our department if we’re slow but people reach out 1x per month or less. If I reach out multiple times per week it won’t be a good look. 

Everyone I’ve talked to says I should just actively apply to jobs now during downtime and get out but I don’t want that.

The new company has upped their offer to the starting rate the promotion will give me. They have a pension plan.  I have never been exposed to a pension however I know it is a good thing.  They offer the same educational bonuses and benefits are very similar.  In addition they offer profit sharing I have not confirmed if it is quarterly or yearly.  I would be changing industries going into textiles which I have zero experience.

The current company is offering a 30k raise.  They 5 percent rrsp contribution that I only maintain after 2 years. (Being there 3 years I only keep the first years RRSP) they provide a 10 percent bonus with the promotion based on the corporations cash flow and profit.  This year paid 167% however the year before was 50% and 10% the year prior.  I have rapport and respect with this company and I am aware that promotion if i get this one could be swift.

1ai6cbi,"Urgently seeking advice on job offer, need to give decision by Monday.","Hi,

I need some urgent advice on a job offer, I have been asked to give my final answer by Monday. 

I am 32 years old, I have a background in Accounting and Finance (Degree wise), work experience is varied from finance to consulting. 

Most recently, I did a conversion masters in Computer science, and had since struggled to get a foot in the door in the computing field. End of last summer I took up a role at a company, multi departmental, as kind of an office assistant for now. The pay is minimum, progression looks to be barely here, and very very slow. I tried negotiating to be bumped up pay a bit, but it was not fruitful. I do like the workplace, and the people I work with, and coming to work isn't particularly stressful at the moment. So I could have dealt with the slow progression I think if they'd just offered a bit of a higher salary. 

At Christmas I had applied for an Intern role in the computing field with a University near me, the pay is also minimum, and the Internship is for a year, with no guarantee of permanent offer, though they say there is potential for extension depending upon budget. However, I feel this would possibly help me get my foot in the door into the computing field if it goes as I imagine, an opportunity to work on some front end development, sql etc, though it's hard to predict. I could just end up doing basic intern stuff. 

Neither of these roles are the end goal or ideal at the moment, unless the internship was good and turned to permanent, then I would stick around for a bit to build my experience. Or if my current role put me in a department I am interested in at the end of the ""scheme"". My manager and my colleagues like me from what I can tell, and want to keep me around, and he has offered to put me on a project for the implementation of a new ERP system across the company in a years time, which also has the potential to be interesting and useful. At current rate if I stick around, I think it will be 3-5 years before I even hit £30k. While I feel the potential risk of moving, building some experience in computing, then jumping form there, could help me progress quicker salary wise. 

I am just very uncertain on what decision to make. Do I stick it out, at the current workplace with slow progression. Or make some jumps to try speed things up, and in the process potentially risk myself having no permanent role in a year when the internship finishes. 

Advice, guidance and insight would be very appreciated. 

Thank you.",Bills-on-bills,1,1.0,0,1706994701,2024-02-03 21:11:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ai6cbi/urgently_seeking_advice_on_job_offer_need_to_give/,2,2024
1ai5iig,Being bullied at work and not being helped by management,"I desperately need advice. Please excuse the word vomit as I’m just going to lay it all out there as it comes to my brain. 

Where I work, I’ve always been singled out and targeted by a couple people but mostly by one girl. I have never in my life had a single issue with anyone I’ve worked with until now. My manager plays favorites on the regular. A few major things that have happened:
 
- The third shifter, who is constantly bullying and harassing me, split a second shift with me one night and she had to wash a few dishes from dinner. She was screaming and yelling in front of our disabled residents about not wanting to wash 4 plates and 3 cups and I “better be staying late to wash them”. I told her she needs to not yell in front of our residents and said to her “get your shit together”. Should I have cussed? No, I’ll accept that. After saying that it caused her to run up to me with her chest pushing mine saying “cuss at me again x10, see what happens”. Obviously meant to be threatening. Let me remind you that all of this was because she had to wash a few dishes. I reported this to management, we discussed it and she said she would write up a report and have me proofread it. That never happened.

- Third shifter again lost her mind when I told her she needed to count controlled meds as she was regularly forgetting or refusing to do so. She screamed and yelled and threw insults. I have this on recording. I was recording because she had done something similar a dozen times while I tried to train her (she was very new). I sent this video to management, she won’t do anything because it seems like I was pushing for it to happen by secretly recording in the first place. I explained that I was only recording because it had happened multiple times previously and I felt defeated and overwhelmed. Nothing happened.

- My manager did something with my set schedule without notifying me which I wouldn’t even care about BUT the way she changed it made 2 of my shifts a significantly lower hourly pay as she replaced 2 of my regular shifts with 2 sleep shifts. I’ve always been lenient with my schedule and always pick up or switch shifts to make her life easier, but I wasn’t okay with making less hourly for 2 shifts. I brought this up to her and her response was essentially “too bad the schedule is out”. Now, manager’s boss has told me multiple times to go to her with anything if I feel like I can’t go to my manager. I’ve never done that before for fear of retaliation (witnessed retaliation happen with another employee who went to a higher up), but I decided I needed to this time. My manager must have been chewed out pretty good because she changed the schedule. Which is great right? Wrong. She’s immensely upset with me. Cold shoulder and making my life hell because of it. I feared retaliation but had hopes it wouldn’t happen. Now because of this she is no longer allowing overtime, or so she said. What she meant is her BFF third shifter (the bully) gets it all and I get nothing. She said to me previously that she has to be fair with OT and that’s why she couldn’t give it all to one person, but she’s doing exactly that with the girl who harasses me. 

This third shifter also laid out a tissue on my work table and said “this is for in case you want to cry over losing your overtime”, kept repeating that with a mocking tone and slammed the door on her way out.

This is the most hostile work environment I’ve ever been in. I go home crying every day wondering if I’m actually a terrible person that everyone hates, because why else would I keep being treated like this? I feel so defeated and at a loss. I love my residents dearly so leaving is not something I want to do. All I want is a fair and less hostile work environment. 

So my question is, what are my options? I can’t handle this bullying anymore, but every time I report it to my manager I’m ignored. The next option would be to go to the higher ups again but with how badly it was received over the schedule, it’ll be worse for this. My hands feel tied. It feels like my only options are to put up with being harassed/bullied or have to deal with the repercussions and retaliation from reporting it.

1ai4k8f,Need Help Badly,"

I was recruited by an old boss from many years ago. I was way over qualified for this role and thought that taking this step back to manage smb sales would better my career route. 

Instead my style of sales and just vibe isn't a good fit and both me and my boss that convinced me to leave are on the same page. I called my old company asking to come back and that seems promising 

The issue is I’m a manager that’s about to put their two weeks in and within that two weeks I have to meet my team in real life for an event. 

Don’t know really what to do I don’t wanna go to this even and then say bye… seems wrong especially if I’m basically being asked to leave since I’m not a good fit… would they actually make me go?",LoveplayingGdragon1,1,0.5,3,1706989988,2024-02-03 19:53:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ai4k8f/need_help_badly/,2,2024

1ai42ys,I don’t know what to do?,"I’m currently a loader operator even though my official position with the company is store associate, I started with this mulch/gardening supply company about 2 weeks ago.  

This past Wednesday I got a call from a sand processing plant for an interview as a loader operator. 

I went, I got a call later that day saying that I got the job.

The new job pays $20/hr
The schedule is 4 days on 4 off
The hours are 7pm to 7am
The job is 18 miles away from my house
The pay frequency is bi-weekly

My current job pays $16hr
Current job I’m off Thursday and Sunday
Current job is 6:45am to 5:00pm
Current job is 37 miles away from home
The pay frequency is weekly

Like I know the clear answer should be to take the new job, but for some reason I’m having a bad feeling about this new job offer. The current job is so chill, like compared to what I’m used to, this job is a cake walk, I literally do nothing unless there’s a customer to load. Every person here is nice, no drama whatsoever.

I’m supposed to start that new job on Monday. 

In the interview they said that they do a competency test because they’ve had people lie about their experience before and couldn’t even turn the loader on. And if they fail they offer a position as a helper at a lower rate of pay.

I can run a loader, I’ve run a 938, 966, 988 and I’m currently in a 908.

My only fear is not operating good enough to their standards and end up stuck on a shovel with nothing else to fall back on because I already quit the other job.

I don’t want to burn any bridges if I do take the new job. But company policy is that a 2 week notice must be given in order to be eligible for any future employment. 

The start date can’t be pushed unfortunately.

I don’t know what to do.

Do I just call out sick on Monday, and go to check out that new job and see what it’s like?

1ai3zfb,Deciding to leave job & move on?,"Advice on taking a leap & moving on?


Hi Reddit,

I have spent the past 4.5 years pursuing a career in an industry that I chased as a dream for years. The job I’m in now at an ad agency doing social media management is destroying my mental health (getting through the work day is often debilitating), and I have completely fallen out of love with the industry I’ve dedicated so much of my life and passion to.

>>Quick about me: turning 30 this summer, 8 years experience in field, 4.5 years in specific industry, mid-senior level, NYC based and looking to relocate somewhere calmer. I have about 4-5 months living expenses saved. 

I have been applying to jobs since October and have gotten *1* interview after ~75 applications. Things at work are only getting worse, and my health is suffering. I would pretty much leave at the first job opp I could. I have a mid-senior title, though another big problem is my current field, social media, is not the area of marketing I want to continue in due to its toxicity and demanding hours. But my expertise in it is the only thing standing out to recruiters. 

I want to quit to try and save myself mentally and physically, but obviously the market is garbage right now. I am looking for temp work so I can have some income while building a freelance career and move out of NYC, but none of the pieces are falling together. It would be mercy to get laid off, but they have proven with other coworkers they’d rather drag them through the mud instead of losing the dead weight. 

I know the obvious answer will be “stay and care less,” but the personal nature, crisis-laden, and huge workload I have is not sustainable for me anymore. I am in therapy and psychiatry and this not something I claim lightly. I would appreciate advice on ways to kick start a freelance career, or what kind of temp work to go after (no recruiters will respond to my inquiries directly). If you’ve gone through something similar, I would really like to connect and do a coffee zoom if you’re available. 

Thanks all.",SuperSeaStarSavior,1,1.0,0,1706988455,2024-02-03 19:27:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ai3zfb/deciding_to_leave_job_move_on/,2,2024
1ai3kod,Good way to become a diplomat?,"So, a bit to me. I am a duel U.S.-Greek citizen. I grew up in the U.S. but I now want to attend college in Germany. I also speak fluent German and have connections in Germany. I also won a German-language debate competition in 2021.

I have decided that I would like to go into U.S.-German diplomacy (or any sort of diplomacy but due to my skillset U.S.-German makes the most sense.) I am wondering what a good degree for that would be.

I am considering getting an industeial engineering degree. While it is not a ""traditional"" degree for diplomacy, it is still around 50% economics, 50% computer science. Economics is important in diplomacy and technical knowledge is also useful in a world that keeps getting dominated by technology.

Combine that with perhaps doing an internship at a U.S. embassy/consulate in Germany, my inherent intercultural knowledge of growing up in one country and now living in the other, and perhaps learning more languages on the side while in college, do you guys think this a feasable way to get into diplomacy?

What makes me heisitant to get something like an international relations degree is that if diplomacy doesn't work out, there are not that many too attractive back-ups. With this degree I could still go into buisness/tech if it does not work out.

Thoughts? if there are other suggestions for how to go into diplomacy while still having good back-up options I am open for them.",CyberWarrior45,1,1.0,1,1706987345,2024-02-03 19:09:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ai3kod/good_way_to_become_a_diplomat/,2,2024
1ai3b9c,Seeking advice from therapists - considering the field!,"Hi everyone! After working at various organizations for those struggling with trauma/different social issues, I am inspired to pursue becoming a therapist and currently applying to MSW programs. Specifically, I have a lot of experience working with adolescents and love connecting with them. I've also taken trainings on trauma-informed approaches.  
But, I've been met with a lot of doubt about pursuing therapy, both externally and personally. It's a big sacrifice; graduate education isn't cheap and I don't want to rush into anything-- choosing a career is scary! But it is also hard to survive working at Sociology BA-level jobs in somewhat similar areas of work. I've also tried some other careers, such as legal aid, non-profit admin work, and teaching, but I find myself wanting to work more face-to-face and with more young populations about trauma/mental health/etc. Sometimes my brain is like, ""why not try HR!"" and ""why not try x, y, z!"" (echoing my parents' comments) and is a little exhausting. And, of course, I have a lot of learning, training, and practice ahead of me, but I sometimes get in my head about not being able to know what to say, etc. It is also important to me to be financially stable and provide for myself; I don't need a large house or fancy vacations, but I want to survive without stress and likely have a family later on. PP/PP group practices are of interest to me.  
I guess my questions are, what advice would you give to someone seriously considering the field? Did you have doubts as well, or did you feel 100% confident this was the path? Do you wish you had taken more time to explore other jobs? What type of person, in your experience, excels in this type of work? How did you become confident in your work? Are you overall happy with your career?  
If this is important, I graduated from my undergraduate program in May 2023, but I have been working at various nonprofits/organizations since 2019.

1ai399w,I had 5 breakdowns at my job,"(Sorry if there’s bad spelling bad grammar)

I work as a dishwasher for a nursing home and it sucks. The kitchen is dirty and messy. They used dirty water to wash the tables and the floor. They’re supposed to sweep the dining floors, but they don’t do that. 

I’m the only in 3 years that have done that. I’m the only one using clean water for the table and floor. I’m the only who cleans spills on the floor. I’m the only one who put down the mop in the right place. I’m the only one who made sure the dishes were actually cleaned. 

I had to prep the drinks and the desserts, then I give them to the residents with silverware. I made sure the right residents get their right drinks. After I got that I prep more drinks for tomorrow. Then, I clean the dining tables(all the plates, tables, cups, desserts cups, trays, silverware and sometimes bowls). Then I started my the dishes and putting them away. Sweep and mop the kitchen floor, putting away the mop. After that, I sweep the floors in the dining rooms. Finally, that all of that I leave.

This my first job so I don’t know if this normal or not. I don’t know if I’m being a baby or not nothing to do the work. But, I don’t if I can do this anymore. 

I’m already going to left my job, I put in my letter of resignation. But, I just want to quit right away. My mom didn’t want to do that and now I have a few more days to work. I just the job at 16 and I’m 17 now. (Started in December and my birthday is in January) 

I don’t if I’m selfish or I just don’t want to work, but I get want to do done with my job. I had like the title said 5 breakdowns at it. Only one time someone helped me. The others times I was alone, crying on the dirty kitchen floor. One of the cooks one time see my cry and he didn’t even help. The other one(who was the cause of it) don’t even bother to apologize. Well, to be fair I did yell at him so maybe I should have said sorry for it. Maybe then he would have said sorry.

The cook was the cause(let’s call me Jay) was always very fast. I was just trying to keep up with him and he could clearly see I was not doing good. Did he stop? No, he did not stop even when a nurse took him to slow down. Another nurse said this was failing when made me feel like a failure because I was going slow. I left as quickly as I could but Jay comes back and tells to do the hot drinks. I ignored him but I feel like a failure and was about to start crying. I was crying on my way back to kitchen and the other staff saw me. But they didn’t even ask if I was okay and can I check in with me. 

I just felt so bad and terrible. To be honest I want to end at all right then. I had troubles with thought like this for a long time. I told my mom about it and it led to getting this job. I don’t think my mom understands what I’m going through.

I just don’t know what to do or want to say. Or, even if I can quit after putting my letter of resignation in. 

I don’t know what job I’m going to do after this. I thought a stocking job since I doing an internship. However doing the repetitive motion of stocking, cost me to go to the doctor. Long story short I broke my collarbone a lot when I was little. Stocking reaping cause it pain, I was in pain for 4 days(today is not as bad). I had tendinitis and I’m going to physical therapy next week.

1ai0yp3,Crippling doubt ruining my barely existing career 24F,"
Hey guys, here is a little bit of background on me to provide appropriate context. Bachelors degree in psychology (started BSc, realized I hated math and switched to BA a month before graduating) and I currently work in Talent Acquisition. I don’t *hate* my job, but I have enough dislike for it to keep me up at night. 
Recently, I got into a car crash that has made me ruminate over this issue more than I usually do, which made me realize that the reason I really dislike my job is because it does not implement any of my strengths, there is nothing about me in what I do - it feels as though anyone could do it and I am not particularly good at it for any reason. 

Now, I don’t plan to quit my job anytime soon, but I would love to explore other options to complement what I currently do (and maybe if I prove to be good at it, eventually pivot completely). I have wanted to write ever since I discovered I could, I remember being in Grade 6, my friends started writing their own books and I joined in. I could never fully finish writing one book, because halfway through I’d get an idea for another one and begin again (the cycle would continue for a few more months), until finally ideas for fictional plots took over all my thought processes and I would constantly have scripts playing in my 12 year old mind. I have ADHD, so articulate speech is very difficult for me, and I have always found it a lot easier to just write down what I mean instead.

Even after I switched schools, I kept writing physical books until my mom made me stop to focus on school, and someone got into a fight with a copy of one of my books & destroyed it. That ended my relationship with creating written literature, and ever since I’ve been plagued with the idea, without ever being able to fully execute it. Like I said earlier, I was shit at sciences growing up (as an African immigrant, science was the default expectation) and after 5 years in university, I realize all of my A & A+ grades were in philosophy & social sciences. This is not to say I got an A in every paper I wrote, I got a few Cs too. 

Anyway, I am also very interested in the intersection of fashion history with news & cultural events, so I started a blog a few years ago - built the website, created and promoted its social media accounts, and even launched it. Then anxiety struck when I thought of what would happen the day I happen to run out of topics to write about, so my blog never fully launched.

My problem is that with finding out what I’m good at, I always seem to circle back to writing, but I might be being delusional because I never would’ve started writing if not for my friends that were doing it (so am I holding on to childhood nostalgia?) and it keeps haunting me because whenever I read a really well written non fiction book, I feel a smidge of jealousy for the author being able to put in the hard work to string together a set of ideas, but mostly for having enough faith to publish it. 

Once again, I don’t plan to quit my job, and I do have hobbies (I am learning to play the guitar), so I know it is unnecessary to commodify all your hobbies - but I feel like I have more to give, I just don’t know what it looks like. This is quite long but any advice would be appreciated!",WaltzGroundbreaking3,1,1.0,1,1706980435,2024-02-03 17:13:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ai0yp3/crippling_doubt_ruining_my_barely_existing_career/,2,2024

1ahzlnk,Should I join this entrepreneurship course???,"Hi there. I’m a first year student studying a bachelors of computer science and commerce. I’ve been recently trying to decide whether I should join HEX Professional online course starting 4 March or join it later. Can you possibly take a few minutes and validate my hypotheses and give your unbiased opinion as to whether I should join March 4 or later? I understand if this may be too personal, but I think your opinion would still be very helpful. (My hypotheses may be wrong and I may be missing other points)

HEX Professional online course overview https://www.startwithhex.com/program/hex-ed-innovation:

Topics:
-Problem statement, Solution hypothesis Risky assumptions
- Market research, Customer persona
- Revenue and finance, Business model and structure
- Tools for prototyping, Creating a prototype
- Pitching skills Story telling

Cost: $1100

Services:
- 1hr mentoring sessions each week with mentors from leading companies such as Atlassian
- 1hr workshops each week including interactive vids and info from founders and ceos of recognised startups and employees from google.
- Checkpoints to complete consolidating learning.
- credit transfer to university available

The reasons for not joining on March 4:

I feel like the HEX course focuses on building a business plan for a startup instead of actually building the product and YC recommends to start by building the product and worry abt business aspects later.

It will allow me time to learn coding and ai and try building something myself, which would allow me to gain some knowledge and ask better questions during the mentoring sessions and come up with better ideas if I join later.

It will also allow time to explore my other interests such as design, painting, blender, photography instead of startups, but I can do this later.

I feel like the content can also be found online for free or cheaper, albeit time consuming.

I can use chatgpt as mentor.

Reasons for joining March 4:

It will provide me with knowledge and skills to build a startup business and save me a lot of time trying to find the content online. It may also make the process of building a startup easier with the skills gained.

The HEX course would look good on resume and the skills can transfer into my future job.

I may have been wrong about the disadvantages of the mentoring sessions above and actually gain insightful knowledge from it.

I will have a network of knowledgeable and experienced people earlier.

1ahyqxv,Should I do it again?,"Hi, I'm currently working on a startup company with <15 employees.

Compensation is mediocre and there are no company benefits whatsoever.

Main reason for staying was about career growth -- 

This is because in my past job, I was really stagnant with routinary workloads and excel (to the point where my skills are not really marketable) and I've been in this job for 2yrs due to the fear of not having a job during pandemic.

I managed to land a job as a system analyst (current work) -- even though this is not my line of work, I started as if I'm a fresh graduate.

Even though the compensation is lacking, I did gain a lot of skill here in the IT consulting industry. There are no micromanaging superiors, the bosses are very hands on with their employees (especially on nurturing) and I'm in good terms with all my colleagues.

However, inflation starts to hurt and my salary can't cope up anymore so I've been actively seeking for my next role in job posting sites. -- even though we're lacking in manpower + my role is quite crucial within our organization.

About a month looking for a new job, I received a job offer, I've notified my boss for my exit attempt but he countered the offer (matching the compensation but still no benefits -- also the offer is 2x my salary) -- I've decided to accept his offer and stayed.

Now its been 3months since my attempted exit, I've  updated my resume and also tried entertaining some job opportunities -- I've been doing interviews and got a job offer from another company.

Here's my current status now:

I've learned most of my duties and only need to sharpen my skills to do better. 

Feeling quite ashamed when I think of leaving my current company for some reasons like:

1. Its been only 3months since I was counter offered,
2. Bosses and colleagues are great (non toxic) -- and I also feel valued in the org.
3. No micromanagement

I still feel like the compensation is lacking even though it was doubled because it was low to begin with. 

And now I'm receiving offers with almost 2x my current compensation with benefits. Getting my urge to leave again.

So my question would be,

Should I do it again? and what are your thoughts?

1ahy28d,Dealing with passive aggressive manager,"I am in sales, and my manager comes across as fairly passive aggressive in emails and texts, and I am wondering how to deal with it.

A couple examples:

A lead will come in to him, through marketing or web for someone looking for a price on our product. He will send it over but will typically add little comments like “I know you will close this”, or “should be a slam dunk”,  when after talking to the lead is actually a guy looking for pricing at the bidding stage of a project. Meaning it is months away from closing, if this lead even gets the job. 
Often, if the lead is good or sizeable, my manager will field the inquiry directly.

Another example is he will ask me a question for my opinion on something, let’s say a competitor in our industry who he will say “ is looking to make a move over across, thoughts?”
I give my thoughts only to find out that the person isn’t actually looking to make a move, making it seem like he is just gauging what I know. 

It just feels like mind games and lack of trust.

Not sure what to do for now as I don't want to be in the same jobs while building the business up. I don't know if it's best  to work abroad maybe in sports science or switch jobs, save u, then move abroad?

Also what are some of the best paying jobs in sports science?

It's weird because this job was just a job until I got into a government job. Now it's becoming a career uncontrollably. I went from $29k, to $35k, to $42k, basically being a security guard, and now a corporate type of position that pays $52k with bonuses.

1ahwxo9,Should I go into sales?,"Should I go into sales?

I live in London and currently hold a low-level managerial position in a fast-paced logistics company. My pay is £40,000, including all benefits, before tax. The next step up is an area manager position, which would increase my salary to around £48,000 before tax. This promotion might take between 6 to 18 months. Advancing beyond that level could take an additional 2 years, leading to a salary of £60,000. However, further growth seems limited due to a lack of certain qualifications and the limited availability of higher positions - I've seen colleagues stagnate at this level for over five years.

I'm planning to start a family soon and aim to earn a minimum of £80,000 per year, so my partner can be a stay-at-home mother.

Recently, an acquaintance suggested I consider a career in sales. They mentioned they could get me a job in sales that doesn't require qualifications or experience, offering a base salary of around £35,000, plus benefits and commission. This could potentially bring my first-year earnings to about £45,000. They also suggested that by the second year, I could be earning double that amount, and possibly £100,000+ in the third year.

I'm at a point where I’m frustrated with not being able to provide sufficiently and am eager to start a family.

1ahwhw0,I need help!! I'm deciding between two job offers and have no idea how to evaluate the monetary value of culture and work life balance.,"So I hope this isn't too confusing. I've been very unhappy in my current job and when I set out to find a new job I took the time to evaluate what is important to me in a job. I've found two companies that are both offering me a position and they both could potentially or not potentially fulfill the parameters that are most important to me.

The most important things to me are:

1. Culture and Growth (reciprocative, collaborative, supportive, innovation and creativity, training and development, leadership opportunity, and measurability. - Weight is 45%

2. Prosperity - (Health, Freedom, and Financial) Work Life balance is a huge part of this and this is the category I'm struggling with most. - Weighted 30%

3. Instinct - This is basically just me listening to my gut and not over riding my feelings.. I think I might be failing at this part lol but it's complicated. - Weighted 25%

So I've scored the two companies based certain parameters, Company 1 scored 55% and the other scored 64.75% (they initially scored a lot higher but I re-evaluated after I realized some things)

Now I have a separate spreadsheet where I compare the financial benefits and costs of each company including a financial calculation for the time I'll be commuting to each job.

Here is where the problem lies..

Company A - initially offered me a salary of 87k and they are about 10 minutes away so I would spend about 1.5 hours of my week commuting. They're also offering 120 hrs of paid time off (used for vacation and whatever else) and 10 paid holidays. It's salary so I don't get official sick time but I can call in if I'm sick.

Company B - Offered me a salary of 100k but they are 45 minutes away, so I'll spend 7 hours (a whole extra day a week) just traveling to it (this is a massive sink on work life balance if I take the job with them.. and I didn't realize it at first.. They're also offering me 80 hours of vacation (40 hours less than company A) plus 10 holiday days, and same thing with sick time. BUT they seem to be a much better cultural fit than Company A. My instinct told me to go with them and I did.

But Company B countered and are now offering me $100K and my recruiter is advising I also throw out a fuck you number so I could potentially get even more money..

Them countering has made me look at all these finer details. Company A is a much better cultural fit, but they won't offer me any more money, additionally it's a 7 hour commute per week (I could move either eventually or I'd have to break my lease.. and also they give me 40 hours less of time off...

To complicate things I have depression and anxiety, I spoke with company B about time off and explained I have a health condition that results in me missing work sometimes, they said it isn't common for anyone to miss work there unless sick sick with the cold or flu.. They did mention I would be available for FMLA in a year and asked if I wanted to have a conversation about my health stuff because they are understanding people (there's a guy there who has cancer and they do seem really really kind, open, and caring. So it might not even be an issue if I'm in a work environment that's good for me and makes me want to go to work..

Bro I just don't know. I'm so fuckin lost on how to evaluate this.

At the end of the day, my spreadsheet calculates the value of Company A as a value of $108k and Company B calculates as a value of $96.5K.. That's kind of a significant difference in monetary value. And I've partially gotten those figures by allotting a monetary value of $2k for each 5% above 50 on my scoring card.. but I donno if that figure is accurate or reflective of how important culture is and the impact it will have, and the commute is a massive problem for me.

1ahwc04,"Chaotic Life, Kinda need an outside perspective","29, m, Germany here.

I have a degree in economics, and I have worked within the field for a few years doing marketing and finance. I liked the work, especially marketing, but I did not enjoy the lack of work life balance.

Come 2020 covid, I was laid off, and found a job working with people with autism before pivoting to nursing. I enjoy nursing, but our crazy shift schedules (I do work 2 out of 3 days in nursing school, it is how our system is set up) and the physical demands ( I am a tall guy, and I always end up fighting with colleagues over bed height) have really startet to get to me over the years.

I am almost finished with nursing school, and kinda regret taking it up since it feels like a last minute decision. I have a couple of ideas on how to proceed:

\- try finding something with my old econ degree, perhaps even combine it with nursing and find something with hospital admin

\- finish nursing school, move into psych nursing or sth else less physical and slowly build up a base from there

\- start a masters degree, take up internships and slowly move back into econ that way since it has been two years since I worked in the field.

I have a habit of starting and not finishing things, but I finished econ. What do you guys think? I need an outside perspective.

1ahv8kw,An odd situation of office politics/drama happened to me last week,"This might be a bit of a long post because I need to provide backstory...

The backstory: I am currently working in an office where my boss is 800 km away in a different branch of our company. I have been working here for about a year and a half and, as far as I know, my work has been satisfactory and my boss has never given me negative feedback about my work. Unfortunately, due to my role (engineering) there is sometimes a good amount of animosity between myself and the sales team. A few months ago, a new manager stepped into the sales team after we lost the old manager. Everything started off great with this guy, I had a great relationship with him. Everyone liked him more or less, he was really bringing people together and was even greatly improving my relationship with the sales team. However, over the last 2 months he has been changing, and changing fast. His behavior towards me has become more cold and I can sense he has ulterior motives. I have overheard him and been told by others that he is talking negatively behind my back to the people working under him. This wouldn't be a problem if we had a large sales team, but our sales team is only comprised of 5 people. One of which is his friend which he got hired at the company 2 months after his arrival and is now reporting to him (clear conflict of interest).

So why am I making this post? Because last week he pulled me into his office and had a talk with me. I don't remember how long exactly. It could have been anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour. He started by buttering me up and speaking highly about my skills and how much potential I have and that I can find a job anywhere, that I should leave this company because it is not good, etc... At first I didn't think much of it, I thought he was just offering some advice or whatever. The more I thought about it the next day, I sensed something was just off and I thought that maybe he was warning me to look for something else because I was about to get laid off or fired. So I spoke to my actual boss (who is in another branch 800 km away) and I told him about this conversation. He was not happy and told me that he is satisfied with my work and if there were any problems he'd be the first to tell me and that what the sales manager did was a fireable offense. The next day, the director of our branch (who is also the direct superior of the sales manager) called me and had a talk with me about this situation. He told me that he will be speaking with the sales manager and also questioned me about the conversation (this happened yesterday). I tried to be as truthful and professional as possible with him and overall I think it was a good conversation.

Unfortunately, I have no recording of the conversation and no evidence. I have a feeling it's going to be a ""my word against his word"" situation which is something I want to avoid. 

Do you think I did the right thing? What should I have done instead? What do you suggest I do now?

I’m planning on not signing the performance form and have another conversation with my manager because this is unfair.

1ahs7jw,Would I make a target for myself if I asked management why I was passed over.,"Throwaway account because many coworkers frequent Reddit and I’m not sure if anyone knows my main I apologize in advance for this long post but I have nobody else to ask but Reddit. I’ve been with my company for 9 months. I know that’s short but it’s a tech based job and I can say for absolute certainty I have tried my hardest everyday, showed up to work early, ready to work and kept opinions to myself. Even during my most recent evaluation with my super and management I was recommended for a leadership position. I have learned a massive amount of since I started and feel I have at least a general understanding of 85% of our total scope on our projects and a 100% understanding of our day to day. We’re contractors for the government so things don’t always happen everyday which is why I know in 9 months time there’s things I haven’t seen. Part of the reason Ive excelled so much is because the supervisor for my shift left for personal reasons the week I started so it was just my lead, me, and supervisors from the other shifts filling in. Well finally 2 months ago my lead was promoted to the supervisor for our shift. Emails were sent out informing everyone applicable that a lead position was available from the one my new supervisor left open. The email was sent to me and I submitted my resume and waited for the follow up on when interviews would happen. When I got into work this week for the start of my shift everyone was congratulating someone from the crew we were relieving and he told me he had gotten the lead job. I am in no way jealous or think the person who got it doesn’t deserve it. He’s got 6 years here, knows that 15% more than I do, and was the absolute right choice for the job. What I don’t like is how management told me to apply and how they would be interviewing everyone because of how our contract is worded they have to and I have heard nothing. He showed me his email where they needed more information to process his promotion. In our weekly meeting with management 30 minutes later they blatantly said nothing had been decided yet. I decided to not act rash and ask what I wanted to at the time. I just want to ask management why they pushed for me to apply and didn’t do interviews and just promoted someone, I still wanted and currently want to know what I am lacking to be seriously considered to help progress my career so I can improve those things. I also don’t like the lack of respect of the blatant lie and having to find out what is really happening from someone outside of management. Is there a way to do this without risking career suicide? I also partially don’t care if it is a risky move because I was lied to verbally twice during the interview process about what my starting hourly wage would be, 35.25 told 18.75 actual non-negotiable because we’re government contractors and that’s what our contract pays us.

I (22F) started my dream job fresh out of uni in September working in a laboratory. However I’m 4 months in and I’m ready to quit.

I got thrown in the deep end with having to go to another site and run that site all by myself for 2 months and then train all the newbies as well. I am basically in charge of this site despite being the youngest but I get paid the same as my colleges. 

It was going ok but now I’m feeling the stress and strain and when anything goes wrong I seem to get the blame or the nasty emails directed towards me.

I thought I had a good relationship with my boss but her recent email makes me think otherwise.

I do have health issues ongoing which they are aware about and I’m now thinking that there is a possible correlation between me telling them I need time off to my boss becoming nasty via email (she is fine in person to me). She did make a comment yesterday saying they always have a problem with people at this site but I thought she was referring to my other colleagues who we have issues with.

1ahqgah,Come across as lying on my resume?,"Hoping to seek advice from the community. I applied to 'Role A' at a company with a resume that was tailored specifically to the role. My resume highlighted my relevant experience for 'Role A’. I went through 5 interviews, but ultimately didn't get the job. The recruiter told me ""the door was open"", and to keep in touch throughout the year and to let her know if I was interested in other roles.

Well, over the week, 'Role B' opened up at the same company for a completely different department. I'm planning on reaching out to the recruiter to let her know my interest in 'Role B', and sending an updated resume that would highlight my relevant skills and experience to this specific role. I have the genuine experience and skills they're looking for, but wondering if it'll come across to the recruiter as me padding my resume, or worse, lying to get the job. I've always heard it was best practice to adjust your resume to the specific role, and I'm not completely changing my resume as I'll only be adding/removing a couple of items.

1ahqfqp,Potential career implications of public sexual harassment / retaliation case,"I was terminated in retaliation for going to management and HR about repeated sexual harassment form a co-worker, the harassment was never corrected and I was fired 2 weeks later citing a pretext reason that my ""misconduct "" was the reason for my termination because I "" freaked out"" over him, talking about my private parts. had only worked there 4 months. I would like the advice of people who have gone through this process, I have since retained a lawyer, exhausted my legal remedies with the EEOC and have filed a formal civil complaint. I also have a question as to the possible problems I’ll have in future jobs now that this is on a public docket. I have noticed that my lawyer doesn't communicate well with the questions that I have so I am hopeful that anyone here with helpful information can help.

The employers lawyers contacted mine and made an initial offer of 5k.. is this amount common for discrimination/retaliation claims? I have proof of my reporting the harassment even though they lied and said I never did, then they changed their story and said, I did but I told them not to address it which was also a lie.

Should I not entertain any low ball offers and go to trail on this? Any advice would be extremely helpful .. the employers lawyer also brought up how l'm not a high wage earner (retail) and I didn't work there long, does that even matter? The harassment was on a nearly daily basis with no help from the company whatsoever, and then I was terminated.

1ahp5hw,Career Path Change? Ft. Office politics,"Hi all, story time:
My skip level manager informed me today to inform about the organisation restructuring due to which my current manager will no longer be reporting to him and there would be a new manager- cost centre for my skip level and manager will change due to this.

I was initially NOT supposed to be aligned under my current manager according to higher authorities but since we were all under our skips umbrella he somehow managed to place me in the team I am in right now.
Now, he asked me to speak with my manager and let him know that I am interested in working with teams that are under my skip level. 
Skip level’s benefit: He gets to prove this head count to his superiors. Gets me as an asset/resource. 
My benefit in making the change of being with my skip level: Get to work on better technology with more future prospects.

I spoke with my manager and explained to him that I would want to do the work that  one of the teams does under skip level. To which he said that we will be getting that kind of work few months down the line but no commitment as such from his side. 

Neither of them will speak about this change with each other because they don’t want to burn bridges between themselves. Skip level urging me to speak with my manager again and be adamant about the change.

My take: I am a fresher aligned to technology A when I joined. I would be glad to work with technology B that my skip level is offering. But this will never be at the cost of me lying or burning bridges with my current manager. He will be sitting on my floor just two blocks ahead of me (will see the whole team everyday). 

I told my skip level to speak directly with my current manager and sort things out between themselves and align me whatever is best for all. He seemed adamant , not sure what he thinks is right. Skip level also told me to speak with my current manager again tomorrow.

Question: what is the right thing to do here?
Should I speak with my current manager again about this?
Any predictions what will happen😂? *Trying to stay positive b/w all this😭😌*",peace_1234,1,1.0,0,1706939846,2024-02-03 05:57:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ahp5hw/career_path_change_ft_office_politics/,2,2024
1ahoxyu,I’m not sure what to do,"So, I am 25 years old. Right after I graduated from college with a B.S. Operations and Supply Chain Management (no debt) I worked in a warehouse/office for a few months. I did not like it so I left because I was super drained. I got into a biomanufacturing program and got a certificate in biomanufacturing. I worked in a lab for a few months. Did not like it and left again, i was stressed out and felt drained. I found a job in a library and have been working there for 2 years. I love it but the pay sucks and at this rate, I don’t think I will be able to live on my own (That’s my dream. I have a toxic family). While working, I joined and graduated from an I.T. Program and got few certifications but I am having a hard time finding a job in the industry and I get denied for lack of work experience. I don’t even know if I want to work on I.T. to be honest.

&#x200B;

  
I did realize how much I hate working, perhaps it was the reason I keep jumping from one job to another. I am aware of the reality of life, I just wished I knew what path I should be taking and be content with it. I always compare myself to others because they are doing well and I’m not. I want to be like them. I want to be successful. I am not exactly struggling with money but at the same time, if i want to achieve my goal, i need more.

  
I really love working in the library even though it’s part-time because it’s very peaceful and I don’t really do much. It’s something that I could definitely don’t mind working for a long time. The pay just sucks but the benefits are really good.

  
TLDR: I keep jumping from one career to another. I don’t know what career path I should take. I like my library job, but the pay sucks. I am envious of other people who figured out what career they’re taking and getting a decent amount of money to support themselves.

1aho2h8,"Quitting job, college or new job. please help","This is a throwaway account, as I dont want any current coworkers seeing this.

I don't quite know how to begin here, so I'll start from the beginning. I'm currently turning 27 this year. I attended college after high-school for mechanical engineering. I maybe got 1 or 1.5 years completed and had to drop out as I was completely unmotivated. Since then I have jumped around jobs all in manufacturing type settings. All of these jobs I hardly lasted long as they were to say the least horrible places to work.

Flash to now, 4 years at my current place I'm a lead in my department making 60k/year. In the last 2 years our previous owner sold and now we are controlled by a much larger (failing) company that is owned by an investment firm. Since selling, the company has been changing more and more, my biggest complaint was essentially being forced to take salary (I was working 55+ hours a week)
 I loved working the overtime and we were strongly encouraged to (it a very non typical manufacturing setting) 

Now it seems I'm back in the same position as all of the other jobs I have worked in my life. My effort and time is neither noticed, cared about, or rewarded. I manage our very expensive machines and go about repairing and troubleshooting. I am currently the only person on staff who can troubleshoot and repair them, and In the last month have saved us well over 20k in potential repair costs. This does not even take account of machine downtime and loss of production.  I told my supervisor and floor manager and all I got was ""cool, I did somthing similar in the past"". This is only a small part of my complaints as I hold many hats, training new staff, directing other staff to prioritize projects, among a few. I am generally the person majority of new staff (and old) come to for help or to answer questions.

At this point I have set a deadline for myself, July this year is when I plan on quitting and going back to school, or will look for other jobs. But here is where I'm struggling.
-What are some careers that will truely reward or encourage excess effort 
- what would yall suggest for college, As I am torn between engineering or some sort of finance.

I am very very ready to be done with this current job, but I really don't know where or what I can do. I know I enjoy the mechanical aspects of my job, but I equally love teaching and dealing with people.

1ahnvni,How do we navigate coworkers who don't take feedback well?,"I was asked to work on an existing training cohort with a few others in the organization. We were all asked to give feedback about our experiences and what can be improved however it seems like the feedback we gave wasn't being received well. So much so I felt uncomfortable speaking up when it was my turn so I kept it brief in fear of being labeled as a complainer. The one person who did speak up in our group made valid points which coincides with a lot of the sentiments and experience i had going through the cohort but he was quickly was ousted and shut down on our call which made me  feel like we can't give constructive criticism. This type of behavior fosters a toxic work environment where employees feel like their feedback are not valued or trusted.

24F if that’s relevant. I am a single mother of a son (he’ll be 5 in May and will be starting kindergarten in the fall). I had him when I was living in a shelter, and have been able to put myself through college, have savings, and secure long-term housing. I just want to build a meaningful career for myself though and, if possible, ensure my son never experiences poverty again. I just got laid off right before the holidays and have been working two part time jobs since then while I’m applying for full-time work. I’m unsure whether to continue in my current field, or pivot to something completely different. Going back to school is not an option. 

I graduated college in May 2022 and earned a paralegal certificate online at around the same time I was finishing up my Bachelor’s. I have a degree in Liberal Arts with a concentration in classics and African-American studies, received several scholarships, and graduated summa cum laude. However, I didn’t do a lot of relevant internships in undergrad because I was working just to keep food on the table and pay for school and daycare. For what it’s work the, paralegal certificate is from an ABA-accredited program and I completed the course with a 4.0. In July of 2022, I began working as a paralegal, mostly doing case management work.

Since getting laid off (there were mass layoffs ), I’ve had difficulty finding full time employment and it’s kind of made me panic. I’m working a part-time paralegal job at a civil rights org and doing grant writing for them when I can—basically anything to get more hours. I took the first offer I got. I’m also working at a hospital as a patient services representative. I’m good at customer service and love bonding with people but I also want to do something that’s intellectually engaging. 
I’ve done volunteer work coordinating continuing education and job training programs, basically partnerships between local businesses and schools, at the shelter where I used to live and I consider that my greatest professional accomplishment, but I don’t know what that enables me to do. My former social worker says I should go into social work but I don’t have the time or resources for an MSW.

1ahmoce,Is going into businesses analytics a good idea?,"This might be a bit long, but you'll be doing me a huge favor if you can comment. Thank you in advance.   
I live in Pakistan, the economy is shit. I'm in my early 20s, I'm an ACCA student, I'm at skills level, my studies (acca + obu) will be done in less than a year and a half and then I'll start working in an audit firm (hopefully one of the big 10). Coming into accounting seems like a massive mistake, I could've done much better, it all went wrong when I was in high school, I was dumb and stupid, and I made stupid mistakes bcz I didn't knew any better and ended up where I am. I regret it every day, I cannot focus on anything for even 15 mins, I can't live with myself, I can't forgive myself, I don't want to live anymore, the only reason I'm alive is I don't have it in me to do the deed myself. As a kid my stupid ass was one of those ""sensitive kids"". I was beaten as a child all the time, for more than a decade, by my teachers, my parents everyone, over trivial things, once in 3rd grade My teacher beated me for the whole period for not doing homework and I didn't tell anyone bcz this was pretty normal for me. It sucked, and I was miserable, and I hated everything, cherry on top, my father died when I was 10, and those were the better days. I saw uni/career as redemption, I thought I'll do well and I'll run away from here and put everything behind me, I was on my way until the 2nd year of high school, when I got desperate that I'm not doing well enough, and I ruined it. I hate accounting bcz there's so little money in it, there's so much more money in fields like IT, analytics, data science etc and I could've easily gone into those fields.   
To remedy this, I am considering doing a master's in business analytics, it's an analytic field and they let in ppl from business side, it seems it pays better, there are a few good programs in my city, my job will pay me enough to finance it. I've read in some articles that a lot of accountants go into BA, plz guide me can going into BA help me do better? Am I better off just working in an audit firm, get the charter and save up some money that will be useful later? are there any qualifications that might be a better choice after ACCA? CFA and FRM are sadly out of question bcz of the exchange rate. like the master's will cost me 2.5 times less than CFA. is the worldquant university masters any good?    
I love math, I love it man, I'm not some Hawkings or newton but if I put myself to it, and study hard I can do okay in it. I don't really hate coding too, well not as much as accounting!!! I got into online BSCS from a shitty university, I didn't have any real schooling, though I did okay in multivariate calc and DEs, I couldn't pass the CS courses, so I discontinued it, plus ACCA and BSCS didn't make much sense to begin with. I think if I'm going to study something like this, I'll do it properly. I want to work hard in life. I always have it in my mind that I'm not doing enough, that's actually what screwed me in high school.   
The only 2 goals I have are having a good career and leaving Pakistan for good and never coming back, first reason is everything I've said above, 2nd, the economy is really bad, it's a third world country. 3rd and the most important one is I'm an atheist, I was born and raised as a Muslim, but I left when I was 19 (I don't think it'll be hard for you to imagine why), you can get killed for leaving Islam and it's a very real threat here, I have obviously kept this to myself.

1ahmlcl,What career would you pursue if you were me?,"I am 31F. I have a BA in Communications, 2020, and a history of work in corporate customer service and supply chain support.

I currently make 52k a year in a Midwest city, not high cost of living but not necessarily very low. I live alone and rent an apartment.

I want to make more money and also progress in a career. As I’ve gotten older I desire a career I feel proud of and respected for.

I have an interest in marketing communications but am not too familiar with it. I can’t really find any entry level positions, or if I do they are very low paying for marketing. Marketing is a very broad field. I have a bit of an aversion to it too though, I like the creative and empathetic and strategic aspects, but dislike the manipulative and capitalistic sides. I don’t have any hard skills in marketing, obviously. 

I’ve considered sales as a career, as many with a customer service background move into, but also dislike the idea of it, plus I am very introverted and a bit burned out on customer service and pleasing annoying customers (some of my current ones are very demanding and unreasonable).

I have a good foundation for beginning a better career in supply chain, I actually have an interview for a Buyer Planner role on Monday that I am looking forward to, with a company that has great reviews. The pay should be about 68k. I work with buyer planners daily, they are my customers. My sister was also in supply chain and studied communications, so it makes me feel like a copy cat to pursue the same career. I like how the results of this work are quantifiable, plus the job is always interesting and never boring, you get to solve problems constantly, and work with people. I feel like I have wasted and chosen the wrong degree for this type of job, though.

The challenge revolves around the pay structure.

I currently make $180k salary and usually add an additional 40-60k in commission. The new position offers only a $130k base but the company says the lowest paid person in this position made $240k last year while the highest made over $1m.

1ahld2q,I left my job at a bad time. What are alternate careers for software engineers?,"Hi everyone,

  
I may have really messed up, and am looking for alternate career paths or other strategies.  I'd greatly appreciate any advice or insights here.

  
I left my current job as a software developer so my partner could move closer to their family in Northern Scandinavia. The plan was that I was going to work remotely and they would pickup a local job. Fast forward two years, now I am struggling to find a job with my (5 years of) experience.

  
Clearly made some mistakes here:

* I did not double check the remote job market before executing our plans.
* My tech stack is broad, I have been employed in R&D where I was expected to play a lot of roles. My CV includes technologies in embedded all the way to full-stack web development. I'm not sure HR or recruiters know what to do with me, or maybe they think I'm BS
* My web development experience which I am most employable in, appears to be irrelevant now. I know Python/Flask/jQuery, but everyone is asking for node.js/React.
* I have a bachelors degree in science. This has been serving me fine up until now, but maybe I being excluded because I don't have a CS masters degree.  
I'm not sure what to do here. I am moving, I can't go back since things are already in motion. I had some ideas, but I am not sure how realistic they are, and I would live input.
* I could study node.js/React for a few moths and try applying again. Although I am not sure how picky recruiters will be on non-professional experience. Maybe there is a cert I can pickup, but I am also not sure how relevant these bootcamps are any more.
* I could learn the local language fast (\~600 hours) and get a job locally. Personally I am not opposed to this, work is work, but I probably would not be utilizing my existing skills at the pulp mill for instance.
* I could a lateral career move, and try to market myself as an Application Engineer, or Support Engineer (remote).

1ahjcvz,"New manager at work, what would you do?","Like the title says, a new manager started at my job and I don’t know what to do. 
I left a company of many years because of a very toxic work environment. I apply for a job and come interview time, I meet with the then manager and the entire team I’d be working with  and it goes so well, it seemed too good to be true. Obviously, I took the job. 

The kicker here is, a few months in, my direct manager (the reason why I accepted the job), announced they were leaving. A new manager has taken over their role. And I’m unhappy to say the least. He’s the opposite of the last manager; he’s a micromanager, over bearing, nit picky, not flexible, not open-minded, I could go on. Anyway, we have the option to work from home, the company does not enforce any type of monitoring for remote employees, but this week they announced that they want to implement a new system to track our activity when we’re home. This already sounds like a manager that I don’t see myself growing with. 
Now, I know this sounds opinionated, but it’s not just me. My coworkers have felt everything I’ve described too. So, it’s very safe to say that the environment that I accepted to work in was now gone. 

I feel like I’m torn. The company is amazing, the benefits are decent, perks are good, but my new manager is a nightmare. The job I accepted is not the same job anymore, the management I met is not the same anymore.

1ahiy6u,"If I don’t get promoted this time, should I look to leave ASAP?","I’m a late 20s engineer, been in my field for 6 years and have a Master’s of Engineering degree. I make exactly 100k. I’m on a team of engineers who are all a level above me and make 140k.

In our department, it’s very easy to see who’s doing the lion’s share of the work and who isn’t. In 2023, despite being paid way less than my peers, I was put on more projects and did far more work/more impactful work than anyone else on the team. We’re talking 15-20% more work than the next highest person. This was also true in 2022, but the margin got even wider in 2023. I’m also asked to put together and present ad hoc presentations throughout the year for our department (key project accomplishments for every quarter) since my manager thinks I’m our best presenter. 

Last year I was head hunted for a manager role that would’ve given me a 20k raise, but I turned it down because of the lack of benefits and long commute. Plus, I do like my current job. I just don’t believe I’m being paid fairly right now. 

I have my performance review in 2 weeks. I’m expecting the typical shitty 2-3% “raise” and for my boss to say “keep up the good work”. If that happens, I’m planning to say that I’m very disappointed I’m not being promoted and there is objective evidence which shows I’m actually performing ABOVE my peers who are a level above me. I had this talk with her in 2022 and she said she’d “see what she could go” which amounted to nothing. 

This is a top company and I really like my job, but feel I’ve been taken for granted these last couple of years and don’t want to wreck my earning potential by continuing to wait for a promotion that may never come.

1ahf764,Is it worth being underpaid for valuable experience?,"
Is it Time to Leave?

I graduated college in 2022 and immediately got a job as a process engineer at a company that was local to me. I took much less than what other companies were offering me (15k difference) because I really liked the processes that the company had and I have really enjoyed the work that I do here so far, so in that regard it has paid off.

Last summer, the company went through a restructuring and I was moved into a continuous improvement engineer position. This position was part of an entirely new continuous improvement group being established. This role however is not what you would expect an entry level continuous improvement engineer would do.

My personal responsibilities are as follows:
-Manage and track project progress for all global improvement initiatives.
-Track financial impact of all global improvement initiatives.
-develop lean programs for all global production sites
-Develop, prioritize, and assign ownership of new continuous improvement initiatives.
-Develop company wide automation strategy
-implement automation initiatives

In addition to those responsibilities of my new position I am currently responsible for all of my old process engineer duties as well as assuming the responsibilities of another process engineer until people are hired to fill the positions left vacant by the restructuring. I think it is safe to say that I should be making more for the work that I am doing than an already uncompetitive salary for an entry level process engineer.

I spoke to my boss about increasing my pay in accordance with my increased responsibilities and his response was that I would be receiving a 6% increase. I would’ve have received this increase even if my responsibilities hadn’t changed at all so I feel as if I am being taken advantage of.

There are two reasons I haven’t left yet. One is that my company likes to hire internally for management positions and I know that I will be first in the list for one once I complete an MBA in a couple years. The other is that despite the fact that I’m not being paid well, I am getting invaluable experience that would never be given to me at this point in my career at another company. I do enjoy having the responsibility and would miss having it if I went to a job with less high level responsibilities. It would be borderline impossible for me to be hired in a position at another company that would give me this much responsibility.

Do you think I should stay or should I just move to a company that will actually pay me a fair wage for the work that I am doing and prove myself all over again there?

It might be worth noting that I currently have no boss and I report directly to the director of engineering until one is hired. The other members of my team have just been told to keep doing their old job for the time being and I am the only one who has actually taken on any new responsibilities. The other members of my team have way more seniority than me but way less high level responsibilities and less overall to work on.

I want to express my sincere gratitude for extending the opportunity to join XYZ as a ABC. The entire application process has been nothing short of exceptional, and I am genuinely thrilled about the possibility of becoming a part of the team.  
  
I would be honored to work with your team and would like to explore a slight adjustment to the base pay. I believe a base salary of $$$ would better align with my skills, experience, and the value I am confident I can bring to XYZ. If we can find common ground on this adjustment, I am more than ready to finalize the details and sign the agreement promptly.  
  
My extensive background in quality control, coupled with proficiency in process improvement, data analysis tools, and dashboard development, positions me well to address the unique challenges the role entails.

1ahef3s,What is a reasonable asking amount?,"So here’s the deal. I’m currently working at a business making $37,000/year 

I have signed a contract for a seasonal position elsewhere that pays $30,000 in 5 months and with employment insurance in my area it will bump yearly salary up to $48,000/year but includes 7 months of no work. 

I have good reason to suspect my current employer will show interest in hiring me on as seasonal for 6 months a year. With my current wage it would only be $400 extra over 6 months which is completely not worth it. The amount I pay in gas just getting to and from would offset that cost and I would potentially be making less working for them. 

I also would be so bored on 7 months no work that I want to work somewhere but in my area without a degree more than what I currently make is hard to come by with my experience level. I was thinking that I could ask for a significant raise and/or a company vehicle to make the deal better. 

My question is what amount should I ask for. I understand that I should wait for them to make the offer and I will do that. But if that amount isn’t worth it what should my counter offer or minimum amount be. 

I was thinking that I would want to make $5000 more over the course of that 6 months so that in the very least it offsets the cost of rent for the period I am working there. This I think equates to $4-5/h raise

I'm unsure which choose if offered the Special Assistant position since the timeline is tight and they are planning to interview and fill the position late next week (not sure why the crunched timeline).

I greatly value work-life balance, especially since I have a dog, but feel that being an assistant and advisor to the CEO is a really great career and financial opportunity. Additionally, the position emphasizes “travel 50-70% of the time with short notice” which I see being an obstacle with my dog who is not very friendly with other dogs (so no boarding) nor strangers (difficult to find a dog sitter on the fly if there is short notice travel).

1ahch5k,Pursue a career in my degree field or find something fun?,"I graduated about 2 years ago with a Bachelor’s in marketing. I found a job in a sales position that I enjoyed and did very well at, however, the branch closed a few weeks ago and now I’m looking for a job. 

It’s slow going so far and I’m not seeing really any success. I believe I shot myself in the foot by not finding a marketing internship while I was in school. It may be time that I try to abuse my schools alumni network to be more proactive in my job search.

To be honest though, I’m still on the fence if I even want a desk job. It was fine the past year, however, it’s just so much more fun doing something stimulating like retail or labor. The tradeoff, of course, is that I can likely make more if I stay on unemployment and pursue a job in my field of study.

I would love to pursue a career in Fire or with one of the government agencies but opportunities are too limited to pursue those exclusively.

Any advice from folks with more life experience than myself?",XIFOD1M,1,1.0,0,1706903428,2024-02-02 19:50:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ahch5k/pursue_a_career_in_my_degree_field_or_find/,2,2024
1ahc99w,What's the closest thing I can get to learning languages and traveling as a job?,"I'm 26 with no degree, and I find myself with i think good set of skills and not sure what to pursue. I'm a musician by night, so that is a strong passion of mine, but that's something I know I can't go for full time as of yet, it'll always be on my backburner though. I've worked as a recreation coordinator/music therapist at a memory care facility, and taught music lessons with kids, both of which I was very good at. Connection to people who are, I don't know if there's a good word, but ""outside"" of the average. So kids, old folks, people with mental health issues, people with disabilties, people from different countries etc. I find it far easier than most to connect with folks like this, and enjoy it. I've also got a really good knack for learning languages, (spanish, japanese, somali) and it's how I spend most of my free time, along with inevitably learning about the culture that goes along with it; it's very satisfying and I love it. While I know everyone would love to travel for work lol, I mention because I do get restless easily as far as my environment. I work and quit lots of jobs, move around a lot, and have always enjoyed my jobs that allow me to do minimal travel and/or be outside rather than being in the same place everyday. This could be more of a mental health type of issue, but i won't get into that. 

Basically I'm aware that translators and interpreters exist, but I'm looking for something a little more broad, and where I can use my personal skills a lot rather than something more static like translating. Maybe I just have some strong hobbies, but I'd like to know if there's something out there that I'd really excel at. Thanks for reading!

1ahbu2c,Advice needed,"Sorry if I post this in the wrong group,please redirect me if so.

So I need advice, I’m 23 I’m currently a cleaner I go round to houses Monday-Friday with between 2-3 clients a day. My wage is £10.92 and I feel stuck, This job is slowly killing my body, I’m on naproxen to help with the intense pain I’m experiencing since starting this job. I don’t feel like the amount of work I do as a cleaner is worth the money, my boss has very high expectations even on standard cleans…

Anyway, obviously I don’t want to be in this job forever, the only reason I was staying was so I could get a year in and start planning to have a family and go on maternity leave. (I’ve been wanting to start a family forever, constantly on my mind, I get truly deeply upset the fact that I may have to wait longer to have my dreams come true) I have had my hopes up for so long to be in my current job for more than a year so I could pursue being a parent I desperately want.

Obviously with the low wage and a job I hate, I would never be able to pursue becoming a parent, with the stress of hating it, little pay it just wouldn’t be liveable on with a child.

My partner has mentioned starting a course towards a career in early years practitioner, which I am partly into it, however I still can’t budge the feeling of wanting children so soon. To do this course complete it and get a job for a year would take me another 3 years before I can even start to think about having children. Plus I don’t like the idea of either going full time course (quicker time to complete it) with no job to support with income. (My partner said he doesn’t mind, he works and we will somehow get through) but then I’m also not keen on going part time and it taking longer. 😩

I don’t know how to ease the wanting children soon, I know I am still young but I have never been career driven I’ve always been family driven.

Please can someone help me see some sort of light or positives towards this, having children young has always been important to me but having a career to support having children is probably the most suitable.  I just really don’t know what to do or distract myself from thinking this way 😩",Every_Ad_1845,2,1.0,0,1706901766,2024-02-02 19:22:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ahbu2c/advice_needed/,2,2024

Well Friday he made an eye appointment and had contacts mailed to him on Monday while he waits for his glasses.

Today he gets a call from HR lady and says that boss has been out all week and she will contact him on Monday. I told him he needed to go in person to talk with someone.

1aha153,Low level engineer being excluded from work,"Hey everyone, I am so hurt about this I actually cried on my way home. In public transport. I work as a security engineer. I am the lowest level in my team. Every quarter my manager assigns everyone goals to complete during that quarter, and I had been assigned a project but it got cancelled because of budget. So I was left with no project where I am the sole owner or leading. So I have been trying to find things to work on, like supporting others and lending a hand. Now there is a new project that is being done that was just introduced last week. It's a development project, a very big one and there are only 3 people who can code in my team, including me. My manager said I can work on this but the staff engineer will be leading and I'm fine with it. We had an initial meeting and I was present, I didn't contribute much but I asked questions. In the end I offered to work on the documentation for this. Today in the office I saw everyone heading to a meeting for this project and I wasn't invited. I was so confused and thought maybe the email got lost. So they had their meeting and did all the requirements gathering without me, while editing my documentation. After that the other 2 engineers(the staff and senior engineers)are already planning meetings for next week to do system design and they aren't even including me in the invites. 

Now I understand that I am a low level engineer and sometimes the things can be a bit complicated for me to understand but I want to learn. And I admit I am quiet and more of a listener. How am I supposed to learn if I am not being invited to the key meetings. And still, for me to be able to produce documentation I have to be present at the meetings. 

TL;DR
I really feel like the senior engineer goes out of his way to exclude me. He is the one who created the meeting and invited everyone except for me. When I was hired I was given a dead project that he had been working on and got it to work again up to the end, and presented an MVP. I was always asking him questions in the beginning and asking for help and he would ignore me countless times. In the end I just stopped bothering him. Then we hired the staff engineer. As he is more experienced, my manager gave him the project I had worked on so that he makes it production grade. Only when I stopped working on this the senior engineer was now interested, he is now super active in the project but when I was working on it he acted like he didn't care. Him and the staff engineer have constant conversations on these projects and I just feel left out. 

I understand that I don't have as much experience as them, and maybe my presence does not add any value, but I am truly hurt.",trenton-zw,2,1.0,10,1706897187,2024-02-02 18:06:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aha153/low_level_engineer_being_excluded_from_work/,2,2024
1ah9m2j,"Recently hired, already considering applying for better position","I recently was hired as a customer relations specialist with an insurance company. I've gone through all the hiring steps, and start my training for the new position in about a week. During my interview I expressed a little bit of concern with the salary range as I have two bachelor degrees in different areas and wondered if this would be leveraged at all. They said that I was overqualified for the position I applied for, so not to worry, they see me moving up in the company quickly. 

  
Fast forward to almost being done the hiring process, completed all paper work and background checks, and I see a job posting for the same company, same location, that my degrees perfectly qualify me for, with a 15k higher salary. My peers have given me the advice that I shouldn't ""push it"" and to wait until I am in the company and trained before applying for different jobs internally. ""No one likes an employee that immediately asks for more"", I have been told. 

  
I guess maybe I'm being an eager beaver, but I just thought maybe someone with management or hiring experience would be able to pipe in on their thoughts on this situation. Does it hurt to submit an application anyway?

  
For context the 'better' position is a disability case manager, and one of my degrees is in psychology.

He worked with ICEE installing and repairing machines and then as district manager for 25+ years. In November 2022 he got a job with Loram, he was supposed to be a repairman for their Aurora trucks but they ended up having him work odd jobs and sent him all over the country for months installing cameras in employees trucks that the company uses to pretty much spy on employees while they’re driving company trucks. When he wasn’t doing that he was working in a shop servicing and testing the Aurora trucks. He’s only been working in the shop again since the beginning of January, and he just got fired this week for not making sure a part was snapped on good after removing it to oil underneath it. Someone else had to go behind him and do it and his boss found out, and he was fired soon after. They were under a lot of pressure to get these trucks serviced in less than two weeks and he admitted he was rushing because of that. He’s absolutely crushed right now and he thinks his age plus the fact that he was fired for sloppy work is going to make it almost impossible to find a good job.

Though I have a solid foundation in computer maintenance and kind of jack of trades with fabrication, construction, and mechanical work. Generally hard worker, very fast learner.

So for my ""story"": I spent about 7 years in manufacturing, starting from age 21. I worked my way up pretty quickly, and within a year, I was in a technical role working on the machines themselves. From there I chased promotions and money, and for a time things were good. I had money and a job I enjoyed, however the overtime finally burned me out (50-80 hrs a week constantly). From there I got into construction for a couple years, doing a little of everything. And then finally this last year driving a forklift (local job, decent pay, low stress). 

But frankly, I'm just tired. Tired of living by some corporate schedule. And tired being treated like I'm property during the hours the company picked for me. 

Financially, I'm pretty flexible right now. I paid off the last of my debt in december. I pay pretty low rent (relatively speaking). I could easily make it work on 25 hours a week. Or good paying seasonal work.

The problem is that every single job posting I can find is 40 hrs a week with ""some overtime,"" whatever that means. So, what gives? Where are these flexible jobs that people on reddit talk about?

1ah7yqn,Which career after graduation?,"Hey,

I'm a 24 and recently graduated with a bachelor degree in Applied Linguistics. And after some aimless job applications in different career paths like marketing, hr, business communication, I don't really know what to pursue as a profession. I'm fluent in English, German, Italian, French, and have intermediate skills in Japanese. Did two semesters abroad with different points of emphasis like writing, intercultural communication, and language courses. 

I feel like most jobs require a degree in economics, law, computer science etc. I don't know if it just an emotional reason, but I feel like I'm not a great fit for most jobs.  Also, I don't know if I want to work in research, translation since those jobs are underpaid in my country. 

I'd be really grateful for any suggestions or any advice from people that have been in a similar situation.

1ah7e92,Should I transition from QA to Product Management/Business or Project Management after being laid off and whilst still searching for a role?,"Hey All,  
I wanted to get your opinions. I was made redundant at the end of October 2023 as a Senior QA Engineer and have struggled to secure a role since. The market is slowly picking up though but sometimes I have doubts if it's the right field to be in. I have good experience in Automation & Manual testing (6+ years) but every role I apply to seems to have 100s of applicants, so it's quite competitive at the moment, which naturally gives me those doubts.

  
In the past, I've had thoughts about transitioning to being project management or product manager, but I guess it's difficult to do that currently whilst I'm laid off right?

  
So what strategy do you guys recommend: Should I focus on landing a role as a QA Automation Engineer/Senior QA Engineer and then focus on transitioning to those roles at my next company? Or is it good to focus on transitioning to those positions whilst I'm searching for a new job?

1ah5ylb,Career Advice for my Wife (which affects me),"A brief background.  I (39m) been married to my wife (40f) for 7 years and we have a few kids.  I have worked for the same company for 11 years and barely make 6 figures.  My wife also works for the same company as me for about 6 years and is a temp/part time and typically brings home $30-40k annual.  Due to market conditions, her hours have been cut to practically nothing for the past 2-3 months so all her bills have fallen on my already-strained budgets.  We are ""wise spenders"" and watch our money carefully.  We don't eat out or have subscriptions, but groceries for 2 teenagers is very significant.  Utilities also are higher and I am paying off a large amount CareCredit loan (to keep 0% interest promo).

My wife emailed her boss a few weeks ago to ask if she was being ""pushed out"" since no work has come her way.  She feels limited to look for another job because her existing job may give her work via email ""at any time"".  He replied something very vague and nothing changed.

She doesn't have high-value skills and has turned to continuing education to change careers to grade-school special-needs education as we have a 6-year-old with special needs.

Problem is, her job pays her $23 an hour and they are flexible and 90% work-from-home.  Any in-person job won't pay near that and will need set hours.  Her existing job could turn around soon in the next 1-2 months and give her hours again.  In the meantime, our savings is being drained as I desperately try to avoid using credit cards (with interest charges).

Should we try to stick it out with her existing job and hope that I can manage keeping our house afloat just with my own wages (which I'm currently failing), or should she put in her 2 weeks notice and push to find a full-time job that will likely pay half of what she earns now per hour?

1ah5lt4,Engineering job turned purchasing nightmare! Need advice,"
Hey everyone, 

feeling a bit lost and frustrated here. Landed a new engineering role a month ago, super excited! But plot twist: they stuck me in purchasing, even though it wasn't part of the deal. 6 weeks in, I'm a one-person army handling everything from orders to shipping to factory drama.

Remember that promise of it being a short-term thing? Yeah, about that...  Plus, the last few people in this role bounced after a month, tops. Not exactly a confidence booster.

My boss? Picture a drill sergeant who expects free overtime and spams my phone after hours. Not exactly the chill work environment I signed up for.

Now, the company itself is impressive - looks great on the resume and could be a career booster. But honestly, I'm burnt out and feeling like a tiny cog in a giant machine.

Been job hunting, but the fear of missing out on this ""opportunity"" is holding me back.

1ah4w06,Talked down to at work,"Yesterday my boss' assistant waited until I was alone to follow up on a question I had asked at the morning meeting.  Without getting technical, he kept repeatedly explaining the most basic level of the answer, which I understood.  All the while he was ragging on me that I should already know this stuff. Having recently been told that I am ""too aggressive"" for refusing to be talked over, I told him that I don't appreciate him coming in and picking a fight, and I left to go do a routine walkaround.  He followed me out of the building, and blocked me in on a catwalk and continued to lecture me for over an hour about how to get along with people.  I asked him several times to leave me alone, he did not.  Afterward, I ended up curling up and having a breakdown in the restroom.

Last time this happened, I had to push through him talking to explain that I do understand already, and asked him to stop, but this man will not let anyone get a word in edgewise. As a result, I was later called into my boss's office and gently reprimanded for being to aggressive.  I thought retreating would stop that from happening again, but no.

1ah19sr,How do I tell management they’ve screwed me over without sounding bad?,"How do I tell management that they are screwing me over politely?

I have been so frustrated lately with my job and I don’t know what to do. Management has changed in January, we got a completely different person for two roles of the management team and now everything has gone haywire the last month. 


I’ve been frustrated mainly because it took my manager an entire month to release the schedule for this month, our old manager would’ve had it out three weeks ago, even at the beginning of the month at the earliest. So my team had to wait, and wait, and wait some more, hoping it would be released when it finally was. I reviewed my schedule and I am… Screwed over. 

I talked with management a few days ago because I wanted to go full time. They said I could and to write them a note about it so they could remember to adjust the schedule. Well, apparently they either forgot entirely and didn’t review my note, or they felt the need to screw me over anyway. When the schedule was released I had NO HOURS at all except for three days this week and then one day a week every other week. I’m literally working like only 28 hours this weekend and then it drops to an occasional 12 here and there? Like what is this? I’ve told management time and time again I am so comfortable with working full time as well as if they want me working 7 days a week, I can. I do not have any other obligations tying me back from getting hours but for some reason they think this is completely okay. 

I just worked 16 days consecutively for my company, no day off at all, I had to beg for Thursday off practically and to top it off I was called to see if I could cover for Thursday. I told management no, you gave me this day off so I’m taking it (this was done politely) and then I received my schedule. I feel like this is retaliation for them being pissed off i couldn’t cover yesterday even though they said I could have Thursday off. Or it’s just a coincidence that they screwed over my hours two hours after they received the text I couldn’t cover. 

How do I tell management that they’re screwing me over in the politest way and that I need these hours and I don’t understand why I was moved to one day every other week despite me telling them I’d like to move to full time?",anonymousquestions56,1,0.5,4,1706872216,2024-02-02 11:10:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ah19sr/how_do_i_tell_management_theyve_screwed_me_over/,2,2024

I posted a little while a go I had contract concerns with a new job. I received really helpful advice so here I go again

It's been 2 weeks post training I emailed them asking when I can come in to sign the contract (I have it with me I just need to take it back and they need to sign too)

They rang me after ignoring me for 2 days saying my references aren't sufficient etc my current boss just lost a family member then half an hour later found out they have cancer so they're unable to currently sort my references out and I didn't want to push they're at the hospital. I managed to supply them with couple of character ref which they were happy to use. I emailed asking that one of them is struggling to access the pdf but will sort it shortly I had an email they received it and they want more (I was sat with the said person helping them to figure out the pdf so how could they have received it?)

They told me to complete some online training I also send other enquiry and asked other bits I never received a response nor the training link I sent a follow up email again yesterday telling them I didn't recieve the link for online training. I also asked my last reference if they ever got in touch they said no. They made it sound like I can't start the job without them references which I have now supplied them with and now they're ignoring me.

It's been a month since I got the job offer and I am clueless what my near future holds. I want to stick it out and presue this as I wasted my whole month but I'm getting no where. A whole month I could of been applying and interviewing for other jobs.

I spoke to another person from my training and they are set to go and work everyrhing has been completed for them and they're waiting for their first shift. I don't know what to do.

The answer was no due to how early I am at the company. Planning on job searching, rebuffing the resume, and rethinking the choice I made at this company.

1agzjyp,Career change. Where do I start?,"This is my first time posting on Reddit so hoping I’m in the right place for some advice. I currently work in the third sector for a large charity in the UK. I’ve been in this industry for about 8 years now but starting to feel the strain of the type of work and don’t enjoy how unstable this industry is. I have been toying with the thought of doing something completely different and making a total career change. My personal and professional background around learning and development is psychology, counselling, life coaching and all that fun stuff. I want away from front facing support roles and dealing with people and their feelings if I’m honest. I’m at a bit of an emotional burn out so need a change. I love gaming, I’m relatively IT literate and a quick learner. Love to learn new skills and want to get into something new that will allow me opportunity to develop which my current industry doesn’t really offer. 

Some areas I have been considering are web design and software development. I’m under no illusions that I will have to really up my knowledge and spend some serious time studying and learning as I have no clue really about what goes into these to actually get a job and make a career. Im keen and ready to take on a new challenge and learn a new field but have no idea where to start. 

I have looked into some courses on udemy, but if I’m honest I can’t really make sense of what I need as a beginner and what is realistically going to contribute to my portfolio to make me competent enough to actually get a job. It’s a bit of a minefield and don’t want to spend money on courses I don’t need and won’t help. Suggestions of courses from beginner to getting a job level would be helpful. 

Here’s my ask: Firstly, can people give me some ideas or info regarding the two areas of interest I mentioned previously. Such as likely hood of employment opportunities in each area, pay scales and what is required for gaining employment. Secondly, what courses should I look at doing, where do I start and what should I consider as part of my development to get into these industries.

Please be kind with comments, I’m genuinely trying to make a fresh start and find a new career path. I appreciate I sound like a total noob but that’s because I am. Would really appreciate some feedback from those with lived experience and have maybe been in a similar situation. Where do I begin?

Lol ok asshat. Also I'm at the dext next to them they've called me over about bs problems I made, going *did you download the pdf the customer sent? Did you? When I can't remember what I did 3 hours ago and I'm too honest. I did. And I told them to send me the ticket, they said nah it's already resolved. Luckily I read the ticket and found indeed their whole thing they called me over for was bullshit. They tried to fool me into thinking I posted about the wrong topic because the customer sent a message confused and mixing up two tickets, not showing me the next message where they apologize for misreading what I had said. My anxiety still makes me cave into this pressure and believe it's real for a moment and I always give then what they want feeling like it's real, desparately trying to correct them. Fuck I looked like an idiot. Well this has only happened twice. And I was an idiot and confronted them asking why they lied on my performance review. Was wondering if there could be a oddity in metrics reporting until my coworker came out and told me the boss got on him for not doing things I *also* wasn't doing. I'm done giving into it and can ignore it fine going forward. But how can I make sure I'm up to speed when the 3-month window comes?

1agxcw5,Figuring out next steps for a career change,"Hi all, I'm fortunate in that I do have a well-paying job at a good company in my area. However, we often have layoffs and lately, that means additional workload for me (+entire team) and new responsibilities that I'm not as excited about. 

I want to move into a more technical career, where the growth opportunities can remain as an individual contributor rather than move into management. 

I graduated with a Bachelors in Math back in 2017, worked as a finance analyst in the higher-ed and defense industries, and now I'm in operations in the tech industry. Overall, I feel like I've been all over the place and have a well rounded background to get into something new, but it's been hard for me to determine what, and creating a plan for that. I have tried taking Masters courses for data analytics because the curriculum does interest me, but it's difficult, even part-time, to have the mental energy and even just time to focus on these courses. I also think it would be difficult to do a Masters full-time, because I need my salary to survive. I'm not particularly set on being a data analyst either, but it seemed to be a good entry point into a more technical role based on my background. I was thinking of maybe taking some online community college courses for CS and seeing how I liked that.

Does anyone have advice for navigating this sort of situation? How did you find your interests/next career, and what plan did you make to move into that?

1agta8i,A guide to $100k/year without degrees. (bit controversial),"I \[32M\] made a career in Digital Marketing without a degree. I started at age 23.  


It took me about 10 months to hit 10k a month for the first time.  


Here's what every career jumper should know. It is not too late, the party has just begun.  


Marketing and AI markets will grow by a trillion USD in the next few years.  


So whether you're 18, 38 or 58, there's no reason to not consider such a career today.  


By the way. Here's why I said ""controversial"" in my headline:  


I don't recommend working for agencies. Yes, you can get a job in marketing fairly easily.  


However... Let me tell you, you can make SO MUCH more money as a freelancer.  


It won't make any sense to work a 9-5 in marketing because finding clients is simple.  


Literally -every- company requires digital marketing nowadays.  


Digital ad expense is projected to grow by XXX billions until 2030.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
Before we dive deeper into this, ok WHAT do you sell as a marketer?  


Could be marketing services of all kinds: Help a business run ads on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Google, LinkedIn, you name it. Help them make sales, or just raise their brand awareness. 

&#x200B;

**Now let's get to the Juicy Part of this post.**  


The financial aspect of digital marketing is what got me hooked.  


I got no romantic story about my great passion for running IG Ads for a Gym. :D  


Here's the revelation that I felt was mindbending to me when I started though.  


A job will pay you 1 salary by 1 company a month. Right?  


A marketing career could pay you 5 salaries by 5 companies a month.  


Consider this. Some marketing jobs in the US pay 50k/year on average.  


Imagine you charging $2000 a month for your marketing service, which is 24k annually.  


Company saves 50% by hiring you -> >You make 24k a year, per client.  


Finding about 4-5 clients is all it takes to make 100k a year now. If this is your first time reading about 

digital marketing, you may wonder:  


""Ok how long would I keep such a client? I mean they won't stay forever, right?""  


Right. Agencies keep their clients for an average contract length of about 9 months.  


From my personal experience, it's closer to 2 years than it is to 9 months. Now you know a single client 

could yield you $2000 a month or more.  


Here's the best part. To get started building a skill in Marketing...  


You could literally start getting free marketing certificates.  


There is a ton of good stuff out there, and it's totally free.  


If you google ""free marketing certificate"", you'll find it.  


Google itself has great trainings that teach you how to help  


a business rank on the number 1 page of Google for example.

If you wondered how you could make six figures from home, get into marketing. Source: me, agency owner for 8 years, 100% remote, traveled the world and made six figures in his 20s. Hope this helped someone

1agspao,Shit day at work and general vent,"Hey guys, throw away account. 
I just had a pretty bad day at work (my fault) and thinking about the way I handled it had me spiralling into a bit of an anxiety loop. 
To start of with the day, i was informed of a new admin task that would need to be done daily, starting today. My direct supervisor informed me of this, but I couldn’t access it as I didn’t have log in details. I asked her whether she knew how’d I’d be able to do it, but she didn’t and said I should ask a manager (not in a mean way). 
The work I do is pretty solo and we usually rotate, think like a reception. I’m fairly new and she said i was free to call or text if I needed any help. 
After she left a manager asked for me to do something I’d not done before. There was another colleague of mine in the building that knew how to do it, but I couldn’t get ahold of him. In my need to get that done for the manager i gave her call which she didn’t pick up at first. But in the time it took her to call back I had already managed to speak to my colleague who helped me out. (Upset not because she took too long to call back, but because I looked like an idiot by calling her in the first place). 
Then I had to call her again as my manager requested i use her log in details to complete the admin tasks i mentioned earlier. 

And then again at the end of the night because of a careless mistake i made and needed advice on, but managed to sort myself ( she said she’d call back with a solution in a few minutes). 

I know she said she’s happy to help but i just feel dumb. I don’t know why i keep asking for her help only to sort the problem myself. 
The work’s solo as i said so if you don’t know something you have no choice but to call/text the supervisor which is accepted at the company and standard practice, but i just do it too much. I panic and don’t think i can handle it and impulsively reach out. Now im worried she’ll think im incompetent and spread the word, which is probably what’s gonna happen as it’s very much a gossip environment and my mistake at the end of the night was pretty kind of stupid and due to inattention. 
Not just today but in general, i tend to always ask advice or opinion if im unsure and none of my other colleagues do that as far as i can see. They’re all sure of themselves whereas i feel like im just fumbling through, and worse still, i feel like people think it as well. 
Sorry if that didn’t make any sense, just needed to get it off my chest. My anxiety’s through the roof and im beating myself up.",Tight-Carrot8178,1,1.0,0,1706840337,2024-02-02 02:18:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1agspao/shit_day_at_work_and_general_vent/,2,2024
1agsm8r,"Passed over for an Internal Promotion, Next steps?","  
I have been in my position (and at the company) for 2.5 years. Six months into though, I started to feel bored in role. So for a change of pace, I started volunteering to take on extra responsibilities that are of the next-level role. Obviously this was above my pay grade and I wasn't being compensated, but I wanted to get the experience and show management that I wanted to take the next step. My supervisor recognized this and started giving me extra responsibilities, saying that this would set me up for a promotion when an opening became available on the team. This is a small company with about 30 people. I've been doing these extra tasks, on top of my actual role, for the past 2 years. No one else on the team with the same job title as me has been was going above and beyond they way I was.  
Well a position opened up on the team, so I reached out to my supervisor and let her know I was applying for it (it's requirement at the company), and she was really happy about it. I was the only internal candidate. My supervisor and her boss were the interviewers, so I felt very confident during the interview and prepared for it of course. In the end, they decided to pick an external candidate who has experience doing the role from 2009 to 2015 and who has been unemployed since 2015 (they took a career break apparently). I asked for feedback and was told I did really well in the interview and it was really close, but went with the person with more experience. They said they want me to continue doing what I'm doing because I am a great employee, and to continue to do the extra responsibilities. I was told yesterday that I have to train this new person. Am I awful for being really angry that I'd already been doing the job all this time, and they go and pick someone unemployed over me? I'm feeling pretty discouraged and unmotivated and don't know if I should quit, or stay and keep doing these extra tasks and hope they'll pick me the next time there's an opening?

1agsk9f,Requesting interview with PI before accepting contract,"Hi everyone,

I have been interviewing for a Senior Researcher Coordinator position, and it is very likely that I will get the offer tomorrow. The Project Manager reached out to affirm the good things my references said about me and requested a meeting to discuss the offer further.

My plan is to request the offer in writing so I can review it carefully and request a meeting with the PI to ask questions about the culture, meeting expectations, and what mental health support looks like within the team, from his perspective of course, before I make my final decision. I briefly met the PI 1:1 for the second round of interviews but I didn’t have a chance to ask questions; it was a 30 minute interview and he had a meeting right after, so we mostly spoke about my research experience and my interest in the position, so I ended up leaving like I didn’t get to know him well. The position seems like a good fit and I met a few staff from his team; they seem nice thus far. 

So I am reaching out to my reddit community to see whether this is a good or bad idea. I worked with a micromanager before, and I have depression, so having a positive, supportive working environment is important to me. Here’s what I am thinking of asking:

1) How is success measured in this role? And how will I know if I am meeting your expectations?

2) What does having a positive, supportive working culture look like to you?

3) What would your employees say about your leadership, mentorship, and guidance?

4) What is the number 1 problem or challenge I can solve in the first 30 days of the position?

1agrbd0,For Those Starting Their IT Journey: Avoid These Pitfalls,"Since lurking around I’ve seen so many new people looking for practical “how to get the skills and get the job” solutions. Thought I’d share some wisdom from my journey and help others avoid wasted time, wasted money and spare a few others the discouragement so common when starting out 

1) Be extremely weary of expensive instructors and boot camps. There are no shortcuts. There are so many trainers out there who have never worked in IT, selling courses promising six figures in 6 months. They are predators. Stay away. They will take your money and offer little support. Network and interact with people who do the job you want. The amount of money required to pass these exams and learn these skills is very little. Udemy is really *almost all you need. 

2) What you want to look out for when starting to study for a certification or going down a certification path are the fundamental concepts that will shorten your learning curve. What do I mean by that? What I mean is that there are certain skill sets that are ubiquitous across almost every aspect of IT. For example: networking, Linux, automation/scripting, cloud. If you build solid knowledge in these core areas, you can branch off easily into any branch of IT. CompTia may not like me saying this but, I do not think that the A+ is a good certification unless you’re young and a teenager looking for their first part-time tech job at Best Buy. You’re much better served to jump right into the network+ and Linux+ certifications. Those two right there will get you your first job. If you really feel like you want to do the A+, just take an online course but skip taking the exams it’s expensive and most of the things you learn on that are not going to provide you with the depth of knowledge that you need to do well in an actual job.

3) Cyber security is regarded as the sexiest job in IT, but just know there is no such thing as an entry-level cyber security role regardless of what all the LinkedIn influencers tell you (they’re probably making money off people like you). Cyber security is a very complex multifaceted career that requires a large amount of experience managing, architecting, maintaining critical enterprise infrastructure. Nobody in their right mind is going to hire somebody who doesn’t have experience touching that enterprise infrastructure. Security is a great career path but you need to give yourself time to learn the necessary skills to get there. And you can make plenty of money and do just as well before you get to that point. So don’t sell yourself short by trying to skip steps just because you wanna play Mr. robot. Focus on getting those fundamentals down and getting into a job where you can build out projects that correspond to security objectives. If you can do that, you will absolutely land a security job.

4) In your early studies and early certifications, you do not need to build out extensive PHYSICAL labs but you should include plenty of virtual labs and hands on exercises. Your job right now is to learn the theory of IT fundamentals so you can get that first job. Chances are any physical labs you build will be insufficient as a reference point to the infrastructure you will manage on the job. That infrastructure costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. You just can’t build something like that at home. You can practice things in the cloud or using virtual box, and that makes sense a lot of the time but as far as on premise infrastructure goes with switches and expensive servers, skip that. Focus on passing those initial exams of network+ and Linux+ then learn python or go and code a few projects. Once you get one or two years of experience under your belt, you will have a really good idea of the skills that you need to develop to take the next step in your career. That’s when it makes the most sense to start to invest in a physical home lab. What you should be doing is practical hands-on exercises. There are so many platforms out there that will walk you through setting up cheap virtualized instances of the infrastructure that you’re going to be learning. Places like a cloud guru or kodecloud. 

5) When you land that first IT job, identify the most competent person on your team and emulate that person. Be their friend. Watch how they perform their job duties: what is their process, how do they go through an investigation, how do they take notes or how do they track complex issues? But a big caveat in the following point… 

6) IT is filled with know it all jerks. Be the nice guy/girl. Be kind and genuinely interested in others. Besides the moral value of being a good person, your success will be largely predicated on your ability to connect with others (yes, even the jerks) and express complex ideas while driving solutions with people who are having an emotional response to a stressful situation. Being a jerk or arrogant destroys your ability to do those things—people won’t listen to you. However, building political capital and rapport will serve you just as much as your technical expertise. 

Who am I? I’m a cloud engineer who started in support and worked my way up to where I am now. I code all day, manage multi-million dollar infra and build out observability tooling in addition to my other responsibilities. I touch containers, serverless/cloud native, security, virtualization, some networking, IaaS, and mostly work in AWS. I have worked in dedicated storage and security roles as well.

I graduated in 2021 as a computer science engineer and worked for one and a half year at a global mnc as a data engineer and resigned which created a gap of around 15 months till date.. I dint try for any job or upskill during these months cause i was trying out a business of my own which dint work out but now i want to get back to doing a job so i started to upskill myself back in data engineering domain but every job post that i see in data engineering domain is asking for a min of 3 year experience which i unfortunately do not have.

I see 3 scenarios put forth in front of me as of now

1) I continue to upskill in data enginnering domain and find a job organically

2) I upskill in DE domain but put fake experience and find a job which is deemed risky though

3) I start to upskill in full stack development and start searching for a job cause full stack has lot of opportunities

4) This would my final option that i just give up hopes of getting a job and find myself doing masters.

1agj16t,I hate my new job already & it’s only been 6 weeks. Do I look elsewhere?,"
Little background: I’m a project engineer at this new job. During the interview process, I was very specific with my questions (my past jobs were pretty toxic so I’m learning from that) about travel, additional work, working hours, etc. all the answers I received were reasonable and acceptable in my pov. 

Fast forward: 

- This employer provides $100 (pre tax so about $92 actual) for car expenses based on travel. A question from the interview I asked was “how many times can I expect to travel to job sites?” And the answer was “it’s up to you and your workload”. From day 1, I made it clear I would travel every two weeks (based on mileage for this job location, 2 trips a month put me right around $100 for gas and wear and tear on my car based on the IRS $0.63/mile). Now, 6 weeks later they’re pressing me to go to site more often (1-2 times a week) but will not cover mileage/wear and tear passed the $100. This means between $100-200 depending on how many times a week I go, will be out of my own pocket. 

- during the interview process I also asked about day to day work for this position. I was never told that the office they’re sending me to is a “developing” office I.e. an empty office. I don’t mind a helping out with a few office tasks here and there, if someone needs me to scan them something or whatever. This has developed into an office b**ch position and I brought this up to HR (if we’re getting someone to alleviate these tasks), I was told “we’re not hiring a front desk person so I hope you’re okay with that” 

- the new hire that I’m working closely with (to the point of setting up his iPad because he doesn’t understand technology at all), is a felon. Openly told me in detail about what happened during his charges and how prison was for him. As a female, this is concerning knowing I’m working alone with him frequently. 

Obviously there’s other factors (the usual) like no training, manager snapping at me, people throwing me under the bus yadaa yadaa yadaa.

1aghw1t,Wanting to go into archaeology but have been studying Criminology.,"Hello all,  
Currently I am halfway through a bachelors degree in criminology and sociology (BA). Currently working towards an alternate exit path on my program which is Criminology and Quantitative Methods (BSc). This degree is never the path I intended, I always planned on something more geological or biological science related however COVID-19 meant I never sat my GCSE's and therefore was provided predicted grades of B in each subject respectively. This meant I was unable to pick Biology at A-level (my school required you had an A in order to pick it) and therefore I ended up following a different path.  
Quite simply I've never lost my desire to follow that route and am now considering trying to find a way to still make it into archaeology or paleontology (or at least just some field related to it). My university has an available MPhil or PhD in Archaeology and Paleoecology and the only requirements asked for are a high second class honors which is what I am currently projected to graduate with going off my current grades. I currently also have a short course qualification from Uni of Alberta in early vertebrate evolution and am actively looking to grab some more short courses or work experiences etc that might be relevant. I will be 21 by the time I have graduated my current degree.  
I have heard of others getting into archaeology masters degrees from completely unrelated courses in the past, so I know that part is not absolutely impossible. and I know that a considerable number of individuals who do archaeology degrees end up in police and detective work which is what my current degree has been working me towards, so even if my pipe dream of archaeology doesn't pan out I by no means think I would struggle for work. What I want to know is if I am being absolutely ridiculous even considering this or if it is something you all think is potentially doable. any advice or recommendations on what I should do would be heavily appreciated.  
Thank you in advance.

I read a lot of back and forth here about ""*the grass is always greener... where you water it*"", ""*office jobs are soul sucking*"" ""*trades keep you on your feet and provide a stable income*"", ""*get an office job if you can, my body is broken at the age of 40/50""*. It all depends, all jobs suck, I get it.

After several years working on my feet as a cabinetmaker, with a great job and work-life balance... I found myself wanting out. The job was enjoyable but repetitive and not great pay. I did let the job just be ""a job"", and invest myself in hobbies outside of work... but I just started to dread coming in to work every day and being another *cog in the wheel*.

Now that I'm out, I'm considering a career 180. Ultimately, with the goal to learn a more profitable skill. I have a unique opportunity to spend the next 2-3 years re-educating for whatever it is I want to do next while living pretty much for free.  


* I have a Bachelors of Fine Arts
* I have a 1-year cabinetmaking certificate
* I've spent the last several years working as a cabinetmaker / furniture maker

**I like:**

* Factual & realistic
* Objective & analytical
* Structured & decisive
* Reserved & introspective
* Computers & technology
* Working with things in a predictable orderly manner
* Uniformity, procedural, perfectionist stuff
* High attention to detail

**I don't like:**

* Long daily commutes by car
* Working in a loud dusty environment
* Highly repetitive tasks (fine for a few years, but then I find myself wanting some more problem solving)
* Having a job with no room for growth (cabinetmaking is a trade you just get good at, and there's a very low wage cap / little appreciation)
* Working for a company with no real structure for reviews/raises, etc

**Some career / personality tests reveal the following options which spark my interests:**

* Industrial engineering technician  
*sounds good, but would still involve a lot of commuting time I imagine, to industrial area*
* Environmental Technologist  
*good money, half time spent outside / desk. Would probably involve relocation across country for government work eventually. Sounds awesome, though the jobs seem pretty much ""water treatment plant"" and ""field technician (sounds sick, and would be cool to move to a remote area maybe""*
* Programming  
*seems most in-line with my work environment goals, but not something I've played around with yet. Would get to spend more time in my community and take daily breaks etc, not spend years commuting.*
* UX Design  
*I've done some web design work and find I'm naturally able to figure out good flow/design sensibilities. Seems like it would tie in best with my background from a hiring managers perspective.*
* Drafting  
*Seems like it would be okay for a while and pay the bills, but pay is not great and would probably require permanent commuting. I would be really good at this, but why be really good at something if can be even better at something else and get paid for it?*
* Business analysis / management  
*I think I would be good at this, and my experience setting up a business would tie in well, and I would have endless opportunities. Hard to say if this would be right for me, but might be an easier path than learning another technical skill like programming?*
* Electrician  
*Seems like a secure way to make an income, but I don't know why I would choose going back to school for 2 years to become an electrician and start out with pennies when I could simply take up any cabinetmaking job which I'm already skilled at*

They wanted to talk about what they could do to get me to stay and why I wanted to leave so we did a meeting today over Zoom. I have put 7 years into where I am currently and I do love what I do, but this new job would eliminate a lot of issues I’ve been having.

1aggg0e,Seeking Advice on Job Transition Dilemma: Balancing Ethical Considerations and Professional Image,"Hey everyone! I'm currently navigating a tricky situation in the job transition process. I've received a job offer from a larger company, and they're keen for me to join within a month, but my current startup employer insists on the full two-month notice period. While the new company is willing to pay off the notice period, I'm conflicted ethically.

My initial plan was to serve the complete notice period and take a week break before joining the new role. However, the dynamics have shifted, and I'm torn between maintaining a good relationship with my current company and not starting the new job on a sour note.

Please note that I have informed the HR that I have 2 months notice period during the notice period itself. I want to know whether it is common for HR to push for quicker join dates or is it an real emergency, and how can I navigate this situation without burning bridges on either side?  Can the company revoke my offer if i choose to join the company after 2 months?

1agfsfm,Job of last year with startup has been a joke - now it’s getting serious. Please advise?,"This time last year I joined a new startup in my field who had snagged some lucrative government contracts. Unfortunately I did not realize at the time their business model is to do everything on less than a shoestring budget, fake what they can, and brownnose for the rest. 

It’s bad. But I’m paid ok and I need the job. Without giving too many details, I am on a team of a half dozen guys. I am the top performer and produce something like 60-70% of the teams total output. Despite this I am not the highest paid on the team. 
They’ve had trouble finding and keeping good people so the company is happy to look the other way on the low productivity and many infractions by my teammates. 

In the last year I have had three seperate bosses come and go. None of them had any background in what we do, and so couldn’t provide any support whatsoever besides “shut up and do it”. 

Now we just found out our latest boss quit and they replaced him with - get this - the son in law of our program director. Because he needed a job. 

I’ve applied for the role three times and been overlooked every time. The last time they verbatim said “you’re too important to lose where you are, you do good work.” Bitch I do most of the work. 

So now we have a nepotism hire with zero skills or experience. He’s already struggling. Now I just get a call from our Program Director (the dudes father in law) saying we have a huge technical problem they don’t know how to solve and they want me to solve it. 

It’s not my job. It’s been the job of the last three bosses and none of them bothered to address it. 

The funny thing was a year ago I saw this coming and came up with a possible solution. They rebuffed it. I used it privately and personally to do my work and it’s cut my total work time by more than half. I’ve submitted reports and recommendations more than four times on this technology. At their request. They always ignore it or rebuff it. 

Now they want me to pull a miracle out of my ass to save them from a years negligence, nepotism and stupidity. 

So tomorrow I have a meeting with the Program
Director where he is basically going to ask me to do his son in laws job for him. After a year of my being fucked over and passed over. 

How do I politely tell them to go to Hell while keeping my job?",Late-Potential-8137,1,0.6700000166893005,10,1706806919,2024-02-01 17:01:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1agfsfm/job_of_last_year_with_startup_has_been_a_joke_now/,2,2024

1agex1q,I Took An Adult Gap Year… 8 Months In & It Changed Our Lives,"**Background:** I am 33 and my husband is 40. We have no children. We have been married for five years and together for 8. We both subscribed to the grind culture and took it to the extreme from the moment we graduate college. We both have demanding careers where we were both on call 24/7. We were your classic workaholics and literally everything took a backseat. Nothing came before work and career advancement. Our lives were essentially waking up at around 4 to 5am every morning, coming home late, grabbing a quick bite to eat, then finally making our way to bed where we would both zone out on our phones in an attempt to decompress. On the weekends it would not be uncommon for me to stop by work and then us both play “catch up” with household chores such as grocery shopping, yard work, laundry, etc.   
  
**What Happened:** We were both incredibly burnt out. We realized we were missing out on so much. Things we both wanted to accomplish in our personal lives were perpetually put on hold. After much thought and consideration we decided I would quit my job and my husband would continue to work, but greatly reduce his overtime hours. So, we both pressed the pause button and it changed our life immensely and for the better, but not immediately. It was not easy and there are so many things I wish I knew upfront. I went through an immense period of grief and loss and was severely depressed for a good few months. Who was I without my work? What did I enjoy doing? What did we enjoy doing together? Who were we as a couple? What was I going to do?  Would my husband resent me? We also received criticism and backlash from family and friends who casted judgment on our choice. We were inundated with questions, “Do you just sit at home all day? When are you going back to work? What is next?”. We both immediately sought individual therapy and couples counseling to help us work through this process. After that dark period passed things went uphill, and uphill quickly.   
  
**The Pros:** Basically, we got our shit together and tackled things on our to do list we have been meaning to do. No, I didn’t just sit around all day. I went to work and “project life improvement”, as we called it, was well under way. We sat down and made a list of things we wanted to accomplish during this time. We created a solid plan and designed our life from scratch. We were now in control and said what do we want our life to look like? A few of the major highlights include doing a massive renovation our second floor of our home and creating a more organized structure and flow to our lives. We also just booked our dream vacation to Europe for this coming April. From this entire process, we have really learned what we value in life and we now make that a priority.  
Both of our health (mental & physical) has improved dramatically. We eat take out way less and I cook homemade meals and lunches every day. After my husband comes home we take long walks together with our dog, talk, laugh and reconnect. We even occasionally have lunch dates now during the middle of the week and my husband will work from home for the rest of the day. We are also both off all anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication. I even stopped vaping. We both now have time for hobbies. He enjoys reading and working out with his VR headset while I love volunteering and tackling home projects.   
  
Our marriage has done an 180 thanks for couples counseling. We now have free time on the weekends to spend quality time together and go out on dates or just explore things around town. Our communication has improved dramatically and we overall just have a more loving and caring relationship than we ever could have imagined.  
  
Financially we learned we could live on much less than we expected. We sat down, and created our own budgeting app from scratch. We no longer subscribe to lifestyle inflation and find we enjoy a frugal lifestyle. We cut out all the extras such as subscriptions, Uber Eats, changed cell phone providers and downgraded our Internet, just to name a few. We are actually putting more money in savings and investments now than we have in the past.  
  
**The Cons:** This was way more of a mental process than we ever anticipated and we overcame a lot of societal pressures and gender norms. We stopped caring what other people thought and frankly don’t give a damn about people’s opinions anymore. And trust me, there were a LOT of opinions and commentary on our choices. I was called lazy, unmotivated, and a glorified housewife. I was told my husband would leave me for having no ambition and not contributing to the marriage and that my career would suffer and I would never recover professionally. There was such a period of grief and loss for us both and we did a lot of internal work individually and as a couple to counteract this.  
**Summary:** This has been an absolutely amazing experience overall with a ton of ups and downs along the way. I am so grateful to my supportive husband and could not of done this without all of his love and never ending support. We tackled this experience as a team. He encouraged my to try new things and experiences. (Who knew I would enjoy picking up power tools?!) I am so much more than just my professional title and am capable of more than I ever thought. I am more than a work horse. The pros greatly outweighed the cons, at least in the end. There are way more things to unpack from this experience than I have room to write, this is just the tip of the iceberg. I’m so thankful and fortunate we were able to take this opportunity as we realize not everyone gets this chance to take a gap year. We have a much better understanding of what we truly value in life and who we are both as individuals and as a team. We now have a solid plan for the future and what our lives will look like moving forward. My overall advice is if you can take a gap year, go in with a plan ahead of time then smash that pause button as hard as you can.",itskatfinn,4,1.0,0,1706804748,2024-02-01 16:25:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1agex1q/i_took_an_adult_gap_year_8_months_in_it_changed/,2,2024

1ageeid,Can you advise on these next steps?,"Hi folks,

Hope to get some advice from you redditors. 

Bit of background

28m in UK, have a bachelors in music (first class) with a particular focus on a very relevant technology and how that could be used to structure business models within the music industry - this tech is now being used in tech companies, along with artificial intelligence. I've worked different jobs before and after graduation: operations focused role, sales roles, business development, market research, however disliked all of them. Currently work in an account manager role earning £35k and absolutely hate it. I find the work menial and not intellectually stimulating, to the point that I get so frustrated with myself that I'm sitting in an office doing this job (understand this may be ADHD, however I haven't been diagnosed). I'm often thinking the grass is greener and yearn for stability, both financially and general career path, in something that interests me. My current UK city is where I came for uni, and I recently broke up with my girlfriend before Christmas, so don't feel like there's anything keeping me here. I'm quite lonely if I'm honest. Have 16k in a LISA and have 4k in general savings.

Moving forward

I applied to a graduate program for a large management consulting firm who work in the aforementioned technology sphere and got the job. It doesn't start until summer 2024 and it's in a different city to where I am now. I'll be taking a paycut to around 34k euros, however I've seen through evidence that promotion is yearly and so is increase in salary - I also know a senior consultant there who confirms this. When I think of the years working after graduation, I've had no idea what to do, however, I've always wanted to be in some sort of consulting in something I enjoy, and I often dream of being able to rectify business challenges through the use of tech, and become an absolute expert in a particular field, solving problems for different businesses, in different sectors. This is something that I haven't found in the jobs I've held or industries I've already dabbled in and I know that working in various different industries, which this company does, would cure my thirst for knowledge and the world around me. 

Apprehension

I'm really reluctant to take this job (even though I know I'll regret it if I don't) due to having to start at entry level, in a city where the cost of living in so high, and where I don't know anyone. I know it may sound like I'm having a third life crisis but I feel so inferior that I'm this age and don't have a girlfriend, am renting on my own now, and will be renting alone in this new city, without being able to save. I've never had an issue with finding girlfriends or one night stands, however now that I'm older, I want that stability and for ME to feel like I'm worthy of handling a family etc etc. I feel embarrassed telling people what I do because I loathe the industry, what I do on a daily basis, and just know it's not me, as if I'm not where I want to be and I know it deep down. I just don't know how to get to a place where I live a normal life. I feel like maybe putting in two/three years of graft to this new job would have me on a brilliant path, both for myself and for future prospects. 

Thoughts

I have been thinking of leaving my current job and going travelling for a while on my own - this is something I didn't do whilst growing up and although the thought of 'finding myself' isn't something I think will definitely happen, I know I need time on my own to think and to plan my next steps - I'm actually miserable and dread getting up everyday for work. Maybe part of this is because I haven't had time to regather after the relationship ended - I started a new job and moved into a new flat to get out of our flat together. 

I know it's quite an extensive overview of where I'm at but I honestly need some advice about what to do here. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

1age1lu,"Have a career gap, I upskilled as a dev and have a few options I need to choose?","Hi,  
So I have 14 years in SaaS working with customers, customer success, onboarding, some sales, support (it was very technical but not officially tech support).  
I took a career break and left a job due to medical reasons. I'm all better now and during my absence I did a 1 year diploma in full stack software development. I got my diploma yesterday! I still don't feel job ready and I want to continue my studies. I feel like I'm mentally done dealing with customers on the phone and would rather do Tech Support, problem solving, handling tickets/emails and all that side of thing. So I'm also starting a shorter course in IT (A+ certification) to aid in my applications for tech roles. Then I can study up software development further while having a technical job.  
However, recently a relative reached out and connected me with a partner company of theirs, they're a very very small company. Providing software in accounting. They need someone to man customer support for them, onboarding new clients and all the stuff I was doing before. It is partially remote with some physical meetings with clients.   
I feel like if I do this, I may end up moving away from the tech path I'm trying to go down. So I have a few options.  
1 - Do this job interview, get more info on salary expectations. I havent even seen a job add, it's more of a casual job posting through a relative so they don't have an advert. So my knowledge is limited. Should I email asking for a salary range? Do I even accept the interview? Since the company is small and probably don't utilise modern SaaS methodology, I also feel like the experience would be lacking for my future career.  
2 - Continue my studies as mentioned in A+ Certification and search every day for an IT support role to utilise said certificate.  
3 - Start applying for Junior Software Dev roles now? I feel like the market is tough and  with only 1 year experience via the course... even tougher for me! I have a lot of experience in tech companies working with devs and so on but I doubt that matters a lot.  
Overall, I really feel like I'm restarting my career completely. I'm not sure how to feel about it. After being unwell for so long I've lost a lot of confidence even though I'm only 37. I'm not financially under much pressure which is taking pressure off this decision and I'm very lucky for that.  
Of the 3 options, which has the most prospects for my future career?",CreativeUserName709,1,1.0,0,1706802535,2024-02-01 15:48:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1age1lu/have_a_career_gap_i_upskilled_as_a_dev_and_have_a/,2,2024

1agd9bw,Applying for a position within a different department at my former workplace. Any suggestions?,"Hey everyone! 👋 

I'm sort of new to reddit, so I hope this post is within the guidelines of the subreddit. 

Context: Back in August 2023, I resigned from a position as an animal care technician at a research facility. For some context, I have been an animal care technician for the last decade, but this was my first time working with animals in a research environment. To be fully honest, it was really mentally taxing going from working with animals in a shelter/rescue environment to working with animals in a research setting. My passion lies within rescue work, but the profession I work in isn't sustainable financially and I needed something that offered more. I will spare all the grueling details, so let's just say the research facility wasn't very ""humane"" in their treatment and this was pretty difficult for me to process. However, seeing as how I'm dedicated to providing the best care to every animal possible and the position offered great pay with an amazing benefits package, I was willing to put in the dedication and hard work to try and make this role fit. Now here's where the real issue comes in-- the facility has one person designated as a training specialist for this department; we will call her ""C."" C was an absolute nightmare to work with and made my onboarding process a living hell on Earth. The experience was so bad, infact, that I only worked there for about 3 weeks before I couldn't take the toxicity anymore(more than happy to discuss how awful working with C was in the comments, but for the post, I'd rather focus on getting advice). When I reached my breaking point, I contacted a supervisor in the department, who we will call H. H was extremely taken back by everything I disclosed and confided in me that this is a reoccuring problem with C. H told me that everyone has echoed these experiences with C and that it's been bad enough to cause new hires to quit, much like I was thinking of doing. H advised me to contact the head of the department, who we will call B, and so I did. I was upfront with B about my issues in working with C; disclosed all of my concerns and the treatment that I received during my short time there. I asked B if I could transfer to a different department as the facility was huge and had alot to offer employment wise. B tried her best to work with me-- the department I was hired in was extremely short-staffed and they needed people to do the job. B offered to have me finish out my training under my actual supervisor as C wasn't meant to be my permanent supervisor to begin with, she was just the training specialist. Unfortunately, I was done at this point-- my onboarding with C made me extremely discouraged about working for the department I was hired in, so I was adamant about asking B if I could transfer. Sadly, transferring was a very complicated process that B couldn't assist with, and there weren't any open positions that I could apply for. I was told that I would have to reapply like a normal candidate if a position opens up. With my options being ""tough it out"" or resign-- I resigned. I reached out to HR after the whole ordeal who later encouraged me to keep an eye out for position openings so that I could reapply once again. Fast forward to now, I applied for a new position last week that was under a different department. It's still for an animal care position within a research setting, but the conditions are more aligned with my vision and the job is a much better fit. It involves expertise with felines, which is what I have specialized in for the past decade. Needless to say, I was thrilled to throw my name in the applicant pool. I have been working at a feline only animal sanctuary since I left my previous job-- the pay is awful, the commute is too much on my car and the hours are near non-existent(I worked two days a week); it's not sustainable. I checked in with my application via the online portal today and excitedly, I've been routed for consideration already, which is a good sign as the hiring process for this facility is lengthy.

So here is my question: I have been through the interview process for this facility once before-- they interview you infront of a panel and they ask you a long series very generic, as expected interview questions. I already know that they will inquire about my former employment there. How do I professionally tell them why I left my former position? The last thing I want to do is ""trash talk"" C, so how do I re-sell myself in this new role? Any advice helps.

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read and respond to this post. I've been in recruitment hell for awhile and could really use some sound advice!

However, it happened multiple times that he and another approver advised payments cases that require further treatments via emails behind me, and sometimes casually looped me in after everything has settled and it requires my approval on paper to pay.
It is annoying because I technically going through motions in approving payments that were already advised/decided by him. 
I have talked to him twice and he promised he will include me so that I’m well aware and able to input my opinions.  He thinks I’m being dramatic to bring this up as an issue. 

It still happened today as the junior forwarded the chain email to me and asked if I need anymore additional information after my boss has advised as email below.
I’m damn pissed off, I’m once again not being included and no respects whatsoever given by the them.  What’s the point of approving something my boss has technically approved unofficially?? What if it goes wrong? Am I going to be his scapegoat?

I don’t know if I should bring this up again, it seems he might be thinking I’m being dramatic for an issue that’s not existing to him, again. Should I just quit?

1agcgje,Getting a job after being fired for poor performance,"My son was let go of his job that he had been at for almost 2 years for poor performance. The first 1.5 years he was doing fine, they even promoted him. Then in the last 6 months they said he was making mistakes and fired him. He isn't a great communicator (but at this point, I think that applies to 80% of our population) so I am sure he did make some errors. However, it sounds to me like they wanted him to take on some additional duties and did not provide training. His direct supervisor did not want to let him go as he did a very good job for her. 

I am hoping this won't affect his ability to get a different job (this time I would like him to stick to his degree) but again since his communication is not great I am not sure how well he can explain the situation. It wasn't really something he did, it was a bad fit to begin with when they tried to morph the job and I think they just ended up making him bear the consequences of that decision. 

Has anyone else been let go for something beyond their control and how was finding a job afterwards? Did that have a big impact or are employers understanding that things don't always work out?

1agb7db,Quitting my job on the spot okay?,"Hey everyone,

I'm asking for your opinion if what I'm doing is right. I want to quit my job because I've been treated like shit by many co workers and the boss. I also want to switch career pathways to another trade.

An example from the boss is, not too long ago. I told him I have covid-19, I sent him rat test results, and got a letter from my local GP saying I cannot work for 5 days.  

He calls me all pissed off and shit saying how he just took my on recently and how he's disappointed because of how many days I have taken off recently. When he said that I had a deep thought, I've only taken 1 day off work last year because of digestive problems. I have been at work everyday since that problem. I feel like it isn't right how he is complaining since I feel like my reason for being off is completely valid now.

I felt so guilty just staying home and recovering. 

I decided from that point, it isn't right for me anymore to work at a company like that. I'm planning on quitting tomorrow after I grab my tools back from the site. 

What's everyone's opinion on this?

1ag9xvd,Struggling to make a decision on new job offer and current job.,"Hi,

I have a background in Accounting and Finance (Degree wise), work experience is varied from finance, to consulting. 

Most recently, I did a conversion masters in Computer science, and had since struggled to get a foot in the door in the computing field. End of last summer I took up a general role at a company, multi departmental as kind of an office assistant for now. The pay is minimum, progression looks to be here, but very very slow. I tried negotiating to be bumped up pay a bit, but it was not fruitful. I do like the workplace, and the people I work with, and coming to work isn't particularly stressful at the moment. So I could have dealt with the slow progression I think if they'd just offered a bit of a higher salary. 

At Christmas I had applied for essentially an Intern role with a University near me, the pay is also minimum, and the Internship is for a year, with no guarantee of permanent offer. However, I feel this would possibly help me get my foot in the door into the computing field if it goes as I imagine, an opportunity to work on some front end development, sql etc, though it's hard to predict. I could just end up doing basic intern stuff. 

Neither of these roles are the end goal or ideal at the moment, unless the internship was good and turned to permanent, then I would stick around for a bit to build my experience. Or if my current role put me in a department I am interested in at the end of the ""scheme"". My manager and my colleagues like me, and want to keep me around, and he has offered to put me on a big project for the implementation of a new ERP system across the company, which also has the potential to be interesting and useful. At current rate if I stick around, I think it will be 3-5 years before I even hit £30k. While I feel the potential risk of moving, building some experience in computing, then jumping form there, could help me progress quicker salary wise. 

I am just very uncertain on what decision to make. Do I stick it out, at a work place I like, with slow progression. Or make some jumps to try speed things up, and in the process potentially risk myself having no permanent role in a year when the internship finishes. 

Advice, guidance and insight would be very appreciated.",Bills-on-bills,1,1.0,0,1706790774,2024-02-01 12:32:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ag9xvd/struggling_to_make_a_decision_on_new_job_offer/,2,2024

1ag6mps,Need Career Advice: Withdrew from Master's,"Hey fellow Redditors,  
  
I find myself in a bit of a bind and could really use some advice on my current career situation. I pursued my master's in Data Science in the UK, but due to personal reasons, I had to withdraw from the course just two months before completion. To add to the challenge, I didn't manage to secure any internships during my time there.  
  
Now, I'm back trying to get into the job market, armed with a bachelor's in computer science, a handful of projects showcasing my skills, and some experience from a 3-month marketing associate internship during COVID. However, despite my confidence in my data science abilities, I haven't landed a single interview after applying to numerous internships.

1ag5q9b,I don’t know where to go from this point professionally,"The background: I was working In the hospitality industry when the pandemic hit. I got knocked out industry and struggled in the pandemic in-between jobs from 2020 - 2023. I was let go, laid off, offer rescinded, or RIFD at least 5 times in three years. I have’t held a position down for more than 1 year at the most. I got into the tech field as an admin and found myself working my way up to an executive assistant. I was on my way to be turned from contract to permanent when A.I. took off and demolished my contract along with rescinding about 100 other people’s offers or temp to perm job offers.

I left on good terms, my previous boss even gave me a referral to tech recruiter to continue in data science. By that point I figured if I was going to continued being let go regardless of what field I got into, I’d rather it be in something I at least enjoy a little / less corporate soul sucking. And I got so fucking fed up being the low man in the pole “first one in the door, first one out.” So I went back to hospitality where at least I had a lot of experience and knew I could succeed.

Today: Now the been in my position for close to seven months for a small venue. The ownership is unorganized and uncommunicative. Which I will say, I was aware of this from the get go just not to the extreme I now know. My boss owes me over 2 months worth of back pay from over 60+ days ago. Kept saying he’d pay me back, but he never followed up. I texted him with another manager (we'll refer to them as manager B) asking if instead of Venmo the other manager could write me out a check which to Manager B responded ""they were not aware of this.""

Which is frustrating in itself as Manager B is the one who does our payroll. So my boss hadn't even had the conversation with manager B in over two months regarding my backpay.

This then led into a text back and forth with myself, manager B and my boss about how I was missing pay from my last paystub in addition to my back pay. Manager B piped up stating I don't get paid for time off... Even though I got paid for my time off on Christmas because (and I quote) ""we knew everyone was working really hard over Christmas so I just let it slide."" 

⬆️which I got really pissed off about because if you're gonna ""let something slide"" communicate to your staff so they don't assume.

After all that: I’ve been ghosted my boss for over a week. he will text me when he needs something at the venue and that's pretty much it otherwise.

I know I did this to myself, I saw the red flag and chose to ignore them because of a few things:

- I walked in and told them I saw a need for their venue, I asked if they would hire me part time to see if I could improve their income for their events. I did it in under 3 months, so I essentially pulled out a job from thin air.

- it’s really close to where I live, like my commute is five minutes from my house

- it was nice not to be in a corporate environment for the first time in my adult career.

- I hit my numbers every month, which is why this is so bizzare to me. Don't you want to talk to the person who's bringing income into your venue?

I can’t quit as we need the dual income to pay out bills. The only options I have is: continue with this until they find a valid excuse to let me go or struggle until I hit my one year so at least I have that on my resume. Or lie and try to apply back into the world of data science saying I took a venue job soi handsome Income coming until I find another data science job.",Denver_to_Delco,1,1.0,0,1706773716,2024-02-01 07:48:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ag5q9b/i_dont_know_where_to_go_from_this_point/,2,2024
1ag5pvq,Stuck at a job,"Hi all
Pouring it all here after months of anxiety and depression.
I’m working for mid level MNC in their Marketing department with a total of 4-5 years of experience.
My first job was in SEO profile and got laid off dur to covid then got this current job in the marketing sector but it turned out to be a data entry job rather than a marketing job. I stayed because of remote work opportunity and as it was covid most companies never called back.
After 3 years here my profile is ruined and when I sit in interviews they ask what have you been doing I tell them the job and it isn’t just enough to beat the competition in the market. The job sidetracked me from the career path I thought I was following when I started in the SEO industry.
Now all the calls I get are offering lower salary then I’m currently getting.
Don’t know what to do plus the manager is also not considerate in this. She openly told us in corporate one looks for their own interests. I want to switch but not getting any opportunities.
Any advice would be helpful, please.
Don’t want to continue down this path.",chauhankartik,1,1.0,0,1706773665,2024-02-01 07:47:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ag5pvq/stuck_at_a_job/,2,2024
1ag5jmn,"[WA] Overheard boss discussing my termination, how should I address it?","Basically what the title says. Have worked for the organization around a year. Generally have enjoyed it and have had no concerns brought to my attention. Have met most deadlines (outside one or two out of fifty that were set during a vacation I have had planned for a year and clearly communicated going back to my interview).

A few days ago, I overheard my boss, the department director, and a senior employee in a meeting. I was not trying to eavesdrop, but I have a loud boss and his office (even with the door closed) has zero soundproofing, or even walls that reach the ceiling (cubicle farm). I don’t hear much, but I do hear my boss, “then we have to fill [my first name]’s position.” It sounded like he was talking about open positions in the department - two long time senior employees retired and a third left for a very high level position outside the organization (all on good terms), so there has been some shuffling in the organization, so it wouldn’t surprise me that they would be talking about this topic, but it did shock me that they were considering terminating my employment.

I’m a pretty direct person, and my first thought is to confront my boss regarding what I overheard. After all, as it is pretty clear they intend to fire me if they are already discussing filling my position. So my question is how would be the most polite way to bring it up. My primary goal would be to get some honest feedback as, again, this is a shock because every person in the meeting has given me very positive feedback, I have been given increasing responsibilities, more complex projects consistently, and otherwise everything seemed to be going well. Obviously, I’ve made mistakes, I think most people in my field make the occasional mistake, but none caused major issues. My only thought is that my workload has gone down a bit over the last month, but this is a project-based industry and January is typically the slowest month of the year for new projects, so I just assumed that was the cause, but obviously looking back it probably should have been a warning sign.",This-is-Redd-it,4,0.8399999737739563,9,1706772975,2024-02-01 07:36:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ag5jmn/wa_overheard_boss_discussing_my_termination_how/,2,2024
1ag510l,Wanting to change careers to something remote and social anxiety friendly,"So I’ve been a speech therapist for about 3 years. I enjoy working with kids but it can also be quite a demanding job and as you can imagine, very social. It’s more so the meetings with parents, trying to speak with teachers, etc. that make me anxious and so that becomes exhausting. I’m really really considering transitioning into a different field, even if it’s part time. I just can’t commit to full time speech therapy anymore. Ideally, it would be something I can do remotely as I don’t drive (more anxiety). My thoughts of what I would like in a position:

• remote
• not constantly talking
• nothing litigious (part of my anxiety is always the fear of litigious/demanding parents)


I know there would be some degree of stress and/or anxiety in any job, but certain jobs I’m certain would at least be less triggering of my anxiety. I haven’t done much research but some of the first things I’ve looked into are:

• medical coding (but I’ve read it’s really hard to get into at entry level)
• instructional design


Does anyone have any other potential ideas that would fit my criteria? From what I’ve gathered it seems a lot of tech roles do. But I don’t know the difference between them yet so not sure what would fit the best.",kjack991,1,1.0,0,1706770843,2024-02-01 07:00:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ag510l/wanting_to_change_careers_to_something_remote_and/,2,2024

How do I navigate?","My department was reduced by over 50% 4 months ago while I was an intern. Almost immediately, my hours were increased to full-time and I started covering as an executive assistant. My boss gave me a verbal offer a few weeks later to bring me on full-time in the new year.

1ag3yds,Research scientist or startup?,"I have always been a jack of all trades master of none type throughout my life. I loved exploring a wide range of topics (neuroscience, physics, finance, math, philosophy, business, stocks, economics) and always saw myself having an entrepreneurial spirit and business ambition (the desire to create and build a product/service, solve problems, network w founders, etc ). These past few years, i worked on an undergrad thesis and I have also been really enjoying diving deep into one field (particularly ML/math), it takes much more discipline, but I find it extremely satisfying when I take the time to learn and (eventually) actually understand what underlies ML (but it could also be an ego boost thing — understanding something complex that the general public would not. — idk, either way I like it). Furthermore, I really love the intellectual research group setting (intellectual convos w other students about the research, brainstorm sesh, chalkboard talks).

My question is this: Should I become a research scientist (in industry) or a startup founder? (i.e should I go for a PhD or not). I have began to love the challenge of learning new things that are very technical, and especially love brainstorming and discussing about cool new ideas or theories or concepts with other grad students. Being on the leading edge of new science and tech knowledge, I feel ambitious to tackle on new problems and discoveries. (My true interests is the appeal of super intelligent AGI and creativity to solve greatest scientific problems— but obviously that is more a wishy washy fuzzy vision, I know real research is more practical than that)

On the other hand, the idea of a startup sounds extremely appealing to me, not only just working a product you envision and see practical applications, but also the business parts of it (meeting with investors, networking, connecting with other founders, connecting with customers to see what can be improved) , and ofc the appeal of working to grow profits from the results of ur tangible efforts. Ideally I would love to do a cool neuro AI startup (as overhyped as it is nowadays), and then perhaps dabble in venture capital. 

I’m asking because I know that if I don’t get a PhD, that closes a lot of research scientist roles at tech firms (google brain, deepmind, openAI, etc) — but on the other hand if I do a startup, 4-6 years of my life in academia could have been spent way more efficiently, I am thinking about the opportunity costs (fail faster, more experience).

1ag3hgw,Feeling Lost at 26,"

TLDR: No degree, maxed out at current job, looking for work with growth potential, and something I believe in. Feeling lost. 

I (26 M) am feeling lost in the career department. I currently work at a Unionized Electrical Contractor as their Warehouse/Field Services Manager, and I make $30/hr ($62,400 gross) in Iowa. 

I am grateful for my wages and the benefits that come with being unionized, but I am already over my wage cap and there is no career path in this position. 

I do not have a college degree, but I have a good resume (mostly admin/client relations/logistics). 

I feel like I can’t afford to go to school, I’ve applied to dozens of jobs, revamped my LinkedIn, and everything I can think of with no luck.

How do you find gratifying work, a good company, and a career path without a degree or generational wealth? I want to do something that helps people, makes me even a little bit excited, and has growth potential.

1ag2wtw,Navigating overwhelming success in early career?,"Hi everyone, so as the title suggests, I am what people would consider to be an extremely successful individual/job candidate in my industry for my age.

For context, I am in my junior year of college and I have done 6 internships across NASA, Fortune 50 corporations, big tech companies, and other reputable names in my field. I am extremely grateful to have had these opportunities and acknowledge there was a great amount of privilege and luck that went into me achieving these things as well. 

I have 2 main questions regarding what my next steps might be. 

1. Since I still have about a year and a half before I graduate, I don't really have to worry about job-hunting yet. And even when that time comes, I feel fairly confident that I won't have trouble with it. My original motivation for my career was coming from a financially-volatile family background and being scared to death about going broke and unemployed postgrad, but now things are much more stable and I feel myself falling into a sort of comfort zone because I know I'm good at what I do. If you are someone who became very successful very quickly as well, how did you maintain your drive/motivation? 

2. Second question is less of a career issue and more on social life. My industry is extremely competitive and majority of my college peers are struggling to get their feet in the door. Some have 0 internships/experiences and the ones that do have a few are usually at lesser-known companies. I always do my best to not center my life around my accomplishments and be down to earth (I don't brag/never bring up my experiences unless 100% necessary), but I often still feel that my peers are wary of me or feel threatened when school projects/presentations come up. It almost feels like they silently form this Them vs Me dynamic, which makes me feel a little outcasted. I've also had people ""joke"" out loud about how I'm out to destroy all my peers/competition and that I think I'm better than everyone bc of my accomplishments (which is not true) in front of large groups of people, and it basically continues to reinforce that idea that I am somehow different from them. I worry that my everyday concerns to them are unrelatable, because in their eyes I ""already have it so good."" I also feel pressure to live up to my accomplishments, which gives me anxiety at times. Any advice on how to feel less like a pariah in social situations or any alternative perspectives would be greatly appreciated! 

Again, I am super thankful for the career experiences that I have had and I apologize in advance if this post comes off as tone-deaf in any way. These are just some thoughts I've held in for a while and I haven't been able to find people who can relate and give me guidance, so I wanted to reach out and see what the community has to say.

1ag2j3d,advice on seeking another position within the same company,"So basically I’ve been working at my company for over 4 years. just some background info., I’m 29, I have a bachelors degree in my field and over 7 years of experience. I excel with my performance and my boss is very pleased with my work ethic, etc. 
The issue is that my company only allows 3 tardiness per year. I have to be there at 8:00. i can’t clock in earlier than 7:57 or later than 8:03. 

We get 3 tardies per year. Not that these are excuses, but I suffer from narcolepsy and ADHD. basically, I am on my final written warning for punctuality. Again, my performance is over the top, but I’ve always struggled getting there within this window as my commute is also an hour.

my main question is, the company is HUGE. I am interested in another position within the same company. It is a hybrid/ remote job as well so I also think this style of work would suite me better regardless for a bunch of reasons. 
When I apply/interview for the new position are they going to know i have the warning? Or is that more with HR? Is this dumb to try to change positions while having that? 
I got the written warning in august 2023 and it’s now Feb 2024 so it expires in 6 months. 

I am sick of feeling stuck.  I am absolutely miserable with my job right now and it’s time to move on. Not to mention Im getting paid 42k and getting completely robbed while I live alone and also live in a city that’s not cheap. i’ve been barely getting by for years and im no longer happy so im going to go for another position since i am qualified and able.

I know these are questions i should ask my employer but I wanted to seek some advice first. I’m hesitant and I don’t want it to look like i’m trying to get a new job. I want to stay with the company it’s just time to move on. 

I understand that being on time is required but this is also an entry level position. i’m working with 22 year olds fresh out of college that are getting 65k offers since they’re getting hired during the raise of inflation :) 

I also had to file a sexual harassment complaint about a guy that has tortured me for YEARS and i finally spoke up and guess what? then apparently i’m smacked with my one and also final warning out of no where.  (other employees on my team are late once a week at least, but since they don’t clock in and out because they were hired after me, (new badging system), they don’t get disciplined)

1ag27py,My teammate makes $3/hr less than me and we both want to ask for a raise,"I want to get a raise for both of us, it's wild to me (25M) that she (23F) is making that much less than me. Here's some context:

Both of us are marketing coordinators on an in-house marketing team. We do the same work for the same people working the same hours and we're both underpaid. We both have side jobs to help us pay the bills.

The only real explanation I can think of as to why there's that much of a difference is this:
I came in with previous marketing experience and negotiated a higher rate than what they initially offered me. This was her first job out of college.

My teammate hasn't gotten a raise the entire time she's worked here. She's a bit naive and nervous to ask. We have a good relationship with our managers and she doesn't want to upset that. (Aside from the pay, they're honestly the best bosses I've had. A bit out of touch, but still kind and understanding)

I've heard that we could stand a lot stronger together. I definitely don't want to ask for a raise without knowing that she'll get one too. 

Our bosses approve of our work and they're planning to give us both more responsibility and independence soon. I think if we're going to try to make a change, now would be the time.

1ag1sjj,"Got my dream career, worked, and now unhappy. Any advice?","Started working in 2018, have been working in mostly start ups during this period. In 2023, had a chance to join a bigger MNC company with bigger pay, better benefits, bigger prestige as well.  
  
During that time, I was really excited for the big step in my career. Finally a golden ticket to becoming a master in my industry.  
  
When I started, I couldn't help but feel that something was ""Off"". I couldn't explain it, everyone was nice and all but I didn't feel like I fit in as easily as I did in other companies. I crossed it off as maybe I was new and it would take time to adapt, 6 months later and I still feel like I don' t belong and don't have a coworker that I feel I can lean on for support/advice.  
  
In terms of work, it's been the hardest I've had to face. I expected the heavier workload given the bigger company but I've never felt once that I really ""Achieved"" anything -- even if coworkers congratulate me. It didn't feel like a success after accomplishing a project but more of an offloaded burden. I've also been very slow in terms of work, I work as hard as I can but still get called out for delays. At this point I don't know what else I can really do more aside from my best and accept whatever happens.  
  
It just feels like I'm forcing myself into a mold that I can't get myself to fit in. Even after 6 months I still feel the frustration of my first weeks, the ""Ick"" in going to work that I can't shake away or explain. I don't know if I should tough it out and wait for work to get easier, I don't know if I'm being too much of a snowflake, I just don't know what else I can do to make me and this job be in sync.  
  
The rational part of me tells me to stay, that I'm throwing away an opportunity a lot of people work hard for, and if I want a bright future I should just tough it out - another part of me is screaming to leave and find something I actually like",Altruistic-Pound-958,2,1.0,3,1706759705,2024-02-01 03:55:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ag1sjj/got_my_dream_career_worked_and_now_unhappy_any/,2,2024
1ag1q7k,What are my options after working 4+ years as an Automation Tester?,"I am 26 yrs old, working at a big 4 as an automation tester for 4+ years, earning around 17 lpa. I have always disliked working as a tester and wanted to know what are the options that I have going from here? 
Some options that I am considering on the technical side are switiching to a SDET role or to a purely development role like a backend or fullstack. This feels scary as I have zero development experience and will be treated as a fresher if I switch fields this late.
Another good option on the non technical side is to do MBA from a reputed college with Program Manager specialization. I have postponed doing MBA for the past couple of years as I always wanted to do something technical but now I am confused. I do have good communication and analytical skills and my peers always have been saying that a MBA would suit me.

1ag1fp1,Gave a reference and found out my friend said I was middle-management. Concerned about my job finding out...am I overthinking? How can I correct the lie without loosing my friend the job?,"I've provided a reference for a very good friend of mine. I worked with them many years ago, and then again in more recent years as I referred them to a position with the company I'm still at. They were made redundant recently and didn't leave with the best of relationship with their manager. 

I wrote a great reference for a new job application, but just learned they told their potential new employer that I am middle-management. I think I'm going to let it go because they need a job and have been struggling, but if the HR rep calls to confirm my position, then I feel I'd have to correct this.

In the past it wouldn't have bothered me, but that was with jobs I wasn't still currently at and wasn't super serious about... I don't know if I'm reading too much into this and feeling anxious over nothing. I guess I just know due to my companies professional work ethics that they would not let this lie slide, they'd probably fire me...but if I correct this lie then my friend won't get the job and it will be a shit go on my part because they're struggling to buy food.

1ag13q4,Does a written warning affect your ability to move to a different job/department within state government?,"I work for my local state government and I was recently given a written warning for kind of bs reasons (when they were going through the list of events that led to me getting the warning either straight up didn't happen (and there's evidence that contradicts what my supervisor said happened) or where heavily edited versions of what happened to cover up my supervisors wildly unprofessional behavior).

There are multiple other roles in the state that I'm probably qualified for and I'm kind of feeling like the best thing I can do is to try to move to a different position within the state, but I'm not sure if such a recent written warning would make that challenging or if that's something that would even be seen.",OkCanary7354,1,1.0,1,1706757595,2024-02-01 03:19:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ag13q4/does_a_written_warning_affect_your_ability_to/,2,2024

1afzicr,My usually very supportive boss ignored my message about being close to burnout,"My boss is usually very supportive and fosters healthy communication on our team. I was promoted to manager a few months ago and have been given my own small team to supervise. 

I’ve been feeling very overwhelmed lately balancing my workload, training responsibilities, projects, & internal/external calls. At our last 1-1, he asked me what he could help with because he could see my plate was full and to his credit, he did take a few temporary tasks on for me. 

Today, I completely hit a wall - I received negative feedback from our director, I was glued to my desk all day with back-to-back calls, I could not get my inbox even remotely manageable, and I have been staying late every day this week & last. 

After my 5 minute sob-fest at my desk (I wfh so it’s not weird or disturbing to anyone else except my cats), I wrote a draft to my boss explaining how I was feeling. I deleted that completely after I calmed down & rewrote it several times before sending it once I had a cooler head.

I basically just asked if we could chat quickly tomorrow to discuss how I could shift things around (maybe he sees things that I don’t) and that I was struggling to balance everything at the moment. He immediately read it & never replied. 

I feel like I made a mistake and am tempted to delete it out of embarrassment. Usually this manager is extremely understanding and easy to talk to about things like this. I guess I’m just surprised at the lack of response and am regretting being vulnerable. I’m worried he shared it with our higher-up and that this could put my job at risk. 

Anyone ever experienced something like this? Am I a dummy for sharing this like that?",newplantswhodis,2,0.5600000023841858,10,1706752945,2024-02-01 02:02:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1afzicr/my_usually_very_supportive_boss_ignored_my/,2,2024

1afyw2v,“Vanishing” sign on bonus from potential job offer. What do I do?,"Hey all, first-time poster looking for some advice. 

I’m in the final stages of applying for this particular job, and something kind of confusing has happened. The recruiter has expressed to me that the company wishes to proceed in hiring me, and she will be e-mailing me the official offer in the next 24-48 hours. I AM very much interested in this position, as I don’t currently have any other offers and the salary is a good deal better than my current one. 

Here’s the problem:

In the original job posting, it was advertised as coming with a $15,000 bonus. Their very first email to me requesting an initial phone interview referenced this amount as well. 

In a follow up email for (what I understood to be) the same position, it said the sign on bonus was $10,000. I think during my initial phone interview, this number was mentioned as well. I have it written down in my notes, but the email is the only “official” mention of it.

Today, when I spoke with the recruiter on the phone, she said that she is not sure there is a sign on bonus anymore, and that she thinks it was a “limited time offer”. Nowhere on any of the job postings did it say that the sign on bonus was time-sensitive. 

What would you do in this situation? I plan to address it, if it truly is not included in the offer they send me. Not sure how to tactfully go about it without sounding like I’m whining or accusing them of cheaping out on me.

Thanks!

TL;DR Original sign on bonus listed in job posting as $15,000, then dropped to $10,000 now possibly gone altogether. What the heck do I do now?",_littlepuffin,1,1.0,2,1706751151,2024-02-01 01:32:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1afyw2v/vanishing_sign_on_bonus_from_potential_job_offer/,2,2024
1afydtq,Small company posted an open role; has been up for months-- should I nudge them?,"A small company (fewer than 20 on staff) posted on LinkedIn in November that they were hiring. I applied for the role through their site. I'm pretty confident that I am an excellent fit for this rather niche role. Lots of experience in the industry, similar previous roles, slightly overqualified if anything.

Now, nearly February, job post is still up on LinkedIn and company site. LinkedIn says they've had two applicants (I realize through the site it could be any larger number). 

I am really interested in this job. I don't mean to assume I'd get an interview, but again-- niche role, very qualified, few applicants. 

Seems odd for them to be collecting resumes for this long. Many who applied back in November might not be available at this point. I am, though... and I wish I could tell them that. Would a comment on LinkedIn (""I would be a great fit from this role and will be eager to hear from you whenever you begin interviews!"" etc) be a bad idea? Applying twice seems a little insane. But I do want to keep my resume at the top of the pile, and it has been some time since I applied... feels like my application would be a bit stale now. 

Keep waiting? Take a bit more initiative? Thoughts? ",emsiemilia,1,1.0,1,1706749704,2024-02-01 01:08:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1afydtq/small_company_posted_an_open_role_has_been_up_for/,2,2024
1afy4x3,Need your suggestion 🙏🏻,"Hi Folks,

I need some suggestions from you guys. I've been working as a web developer for the past 2 years in a Gurgaon-based company. I'm not satisfied with the work culture here. The manager assigns us random tasks that don't align with our goals. I'm considering resigning, though I currently don't have another job lined up. However, they are paying me 4LPA, which means I could likely find another job with a higher package.

1afxvmp,Is asking for 70k too much?,"I’ve had an untraditional career path I guess considering I’m in science lol 

I worked as an EMT for 6 years, then in scientific research for another 7. I’m finally going to finish my BS in Bio next year. I’ve been making around 45k after taxes and my Roth. I accepted and expected that amount for all of these years because I didn’t have my degree

I plan on staying in human health research and I’m hoping to get a job as a research scientist. And now that I’ll have my degree, would shooting for a starting salary of 65k-70k be asking for too much? I feel like even though I’ll be a new ‘new grad’ I’m not new to the field, so I should shoot for a higher salary than I’ve previously had. But am I being unreasonable?

I’ll try to be brief about my experience. Last job I was a cell biology specialist and I mainly tested drugs on human donor organs for one year (we conducted research on drugs that companies like Pfizer and other companies produced to test their effectiveness), before that I was clinical research intern and I wrote a review article on how using capnography can help achieve ROSC both in and out of the hospital, research assistant for two years on a tick study funded by the CDC/monitored the prevalence of Lyme disease in my country in field collected ticks/PCR for the genus Borrelia, two years research technician on an obesity study conducted in mice/measured how difficult fat quantities in food effected leptin levels, lab assistant for one year running PCR tests for Covid and grossing placentas",Lumpy_Card_476,1,1.0,3,1706748285,2024-02-01 00:44:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1afxvmp/is_asking_for_70k_too_much/,2,2024
