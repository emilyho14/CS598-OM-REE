1afwt5g,Need advice - job posting at Corporate Level,"I’ve been in my position as a Regional Manager for just over a year.  This was a newly created position after Corporate decided that some responsibilities could be managed at the Regional level.  They hired one other Regional person when they hired me and are in the process of hiring one more - there are about 15 Regions altogether - so they haven’t been really aggressive about filling the roles. It’s been a huge challenge to get the Corporate team to let go of the responsibilities I was told I’d be doing and it limits what I can contribute to the company.  I do like the job and I get paid fairly well.  

I found out today that Corporate is adding another position to the group that I work with.  It’s basically the same job as what I do now with a little more responsibility.  It’s not a new role - it’s an addition to the Team. 

Would there be any risk to my current job if I applied to the Corporate job?  I don’t want my supervisor at the Regional level to think I don’t like my job or make it weird if they choose someone else for the corporate position. 

Would it be inappropriate for me to reach out to the Corporate manager to ask if I should apply?  Or would it be better to just submit an application to the company website like everyone else?  I work with the Corporate manager frequently and he interviewed me for my current job. 

If I applied, would my current supervisor find out?

Would Corporate reach out to me if they were interested in me, or would they generally expect me to apply on my own?

Sorry for the rambling.  My current position is fine although a little frustrating at times.  If I got the Corporate spot, I’m sure it would be frustrating in other ways.  It’s not about the pay - I’m sure it’s similar.  It’s about the possibility of moving up in the company.  I DON’T want to jeapordize my current job if they don’t want me for the Corporate position though.  (Probably should mention that I’m approximately 5 years from retiring, but could work longer if the job was satisfying.)  I should also mention that this is a huge Fortune 500 company so all hiring, etc.  is very formalized.",pobalita,1,1.0,0,1706745392,2024-01-31 23:56:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1afwt5g/need_advice_job_posting_at_corporate_level/,1,2024
1afwq96,MS Student Looking For Career Advice Post-Graduation,"Tldr: I’m feeling a little lost on what exactly my options are in the future. I’ve got a strong idea of what I enjoy about science and what kind of career I’d like to pursue. It’s just given the current state of the job market/hiring situation, I’ve been feeling extremely pessimistic about things and I’m terrified of what will happen after graduation. 

  
To give a little background about my current situation, I’m in my second semester of my MS thesis, and I’ve got about a year left(ideally graduating sometime in 2025). Things are going great. I have a strong relationship with my advisor, I get to design my own projects, working with mostly B cells and mouse research models. I’m sure the techniques that I have developed and will continue to hone will help later down the road. I’ve gotten to learn flow cytometry, ELISAs, general lab techniques and cell cultures, etc. I’m a current TA, and even that has been extremely rewarding in terms of teaching and I am staying financially afloat because of it. 

  
Albeit things are going well, there’s just this uneasy feeling that I feel occasionally that always bothers me. And that question is summarized into: “What do I do after I finish my thesis?” I know I still have a year left and a lot can happen in a year, but occasionally I end up as an anxious mess thinking about my future. I feel like an imposter and I constantly worry about whether or not I can even find a job after graduation. This is mostly exacerbated by the fact that everywhere I read is just posts/anecdotes about the job market being extremely bad and that finding a job in this discipline is currently difficult. 

  
I’d just like some advice on how to approach things. I pursued this MSc degree as a means to transition from my previous field(clinical research), to wet lab/bench work since I did not have any wet lab experience prior. I really wouldn’t mind staying in academia/research hospitals for a few years just to gain some actual work experience before attempting to go into industry, though I am based in the Rocky Mountain region(CO specifically), and I would preferably like to stay within state due to family+I own a home here already). Am I just overthinking things?",Kisnei,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1706745170,2024-01-31 23:52:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1afwq96/ms_student_looking_for_career_advice/,1,2024
1afwfva,What is a good Software Engineer Net Pay Range?,"I have been a software engineer for about 3 years now and the title seems to come with an insane range of salaries. It confuses me immensely. I'd like to make a judgement of if i'm being paid fairly but I constantly get thrown off by reported medians and ACTUAL jobs im seeing on Indeed. SE jobs in my area are advertised 80-110k, some of them even senior roles. Yet sites like ZipRecruiter say the median for an SE is 130k. I really don't get it.

Everyone hears those stories about 150k/175k job offers that wonder kids get right out of college too. Is it only a FAANG thing? What is a good net pay?

1afw0si,Two bachelors but can’t afford to get my master’s degree- is it possible to find a living wage?,"I have two bachelors degrees; a BA in Communication and a BS in Public Health. I chose those options in college (earned them concurrently) because I thought that they would give me the widest range of opportunities for grad school, since I wasn’t sure yet what I wanted to pursue.

Unfortunately, it’s almost two years since college and I’m still not sure what I want to pursue. I desperately want to go back to school, but right now, a combo of financial and mental health issues means that’s not an option for a while.

I was able to graduate from undergrad without debt, which is a huge bonus, but I’m not in a position to drop potentially 100k on a career option I’m not sure about. I really enjoy psych, but for mental health reasons above, I don’t feel ready to enter that field without working on myself a little longer.

I did behavioral health at a private SPED school, and now work for a hospital network in pediatrics doing health outreach, and I. get. paid. shit.

I KNOW I need to go back to school in order to get a decent salary in my fields, but that’s just not an option this year. Also, unfortunately I studied communication science/theory instead of mass communication/social media, so that limits it even more. I’ve been considering trying to get a certificate of some kind from a local college, but again, I don’t have that money to drop for even a couple classes.

I know people who make more than me in my city bartending two or three days a week, and I would honestly transition there at that point if the area where I live wasn’t already overflowing with experienced service industry workers- I applied to several but couldn’t even get a response.

Does anyone have any thoughts about what I can do to fill in the gap while making a little more money? I’m barely surviving at this point- any advice welcome",txxxwxxx,1,0.5699999928474426,7,1706743351,2024-01-31 23:22:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1afw0si/two_bachelors_but_cant_afford_to_get_my_masters/,1,2024
1afvwwx,How do I deal with complete and utter apathy towards my job?,"I'll be the first to admit that I have a pretty cushy job. It pays pretty well, the hours are (usually) very good, it's fully remote, pretty good team culture, and the company is even driving towards something that I think is ultimately good for the world. Basically, everything I could want in a job. 

HOWEVER,

I truly do not give a single fuck about anything in my job. I don't find anything about my job even remotely interesting. Of course, I keep on a shit-eating grin during my cameras-on team calls. I turn in all my work on time and with little to no mistakes. I can shoot the shit with my teammates whenever we have our offsites and meet in person. Somehow, I'm even getting great reviews from my supervisors and I'm about to get a raise and promotion in the next couple of weeks. 

But still, it's incredible to me how little I care about this job that's paying my rent. I look to my coworkers and see they're very interested in the subject matter and want to learn more and seem to be really engaged. I just don't have that and I don't know if I ever will.  I. just. don't. give. a. fuck. 

Is this something that everybody feels and hides too? I feel like eventually, the jig will be up and I'll lose my job because I won't be nearly as good at my job as someone who actually cares. Especially as I continue to get more responsibilities and continue getting promoted, I don't know how I'm going to handle it when I have no passion or interest in the job at all. 

I've considered switching to a different industry or something but I don't think there's anything out there that would get me to care. Does anyone else feel this way? How do I deal with this?

Indeed I got lots of opportunity but felt something was missing.

I switched many jobs hoping to find one perfect environment where things goes well for me. But everywhere I went I found a new type of challenges.

 With every challenge I use to think the next job would be better. And my hunt for perfect job went on and on....

And I just realised dream job is a Myth.
Every office is going to be same.
Same boss, same issues in getting leaves approved, same toxic environment where everyone hates everyone, same competition where people plays dirty politics.

1afuj9i,Should I take over my family’s business? (20m),"So my parents own a company that I have worked for off and on for about 5 years during high school and while in university. If I wanted to I would be able to take it over in the future. Right now the company is pretty small and they make about $50k a year each so I would have a lot of work to do if I decided to go that route. While I find the work tolerable as it isn’t terribly hard but also not super challenging I’m just not sure if taking it over is something I am truly interested in even though I feel like its an opportunity I should be jumping at. I have never had any pressure from my parents to take it over and they make it very clear I only have to take it over if I want. I also enjoy spending time working with my old man but I’m never really excited to work its just something I show up and do. Thats whatever but I feel like maybe theres a future for me where I am at least a little excited to go to work everyday. I am currently in college and will be finishing in the next year and a half ish so I at least have some time to think about what direction I want to go in.

1afu8np,I said I quit my last job (in possibly 2 previous interviews) and just found out they'll call for referrals as the last step of the process. Truth is I was laid off How screwed am I? Should I just drop out?,"I had the reflex to instead word it as ""I left"" with previous potential employers, forgot to word it that way for this new potential employer. I'm halfway through the interview process and found out in an email today that there's gonna be referral checking.

Just realizing as I typed out option 4 below that I also gave elaborate reasons for ""why I left my old job"" that didn't at all include being laid off, and they have these interviews recorded.

My options are to:


1. Respond to this email and immediately clarify that I was laid off (which makes me look guilty)

2. Wait a day or two, then email saying ""I should mention that I was laid off at my past post, I didn't mention it during the interviews because I still am working through it. sorry for any confusion that may cause"" or something along these lines. (Note that these employers are young and friendly and have told me they appreciate honesty).

3. Say nothing and hope that the layoff doesn't come up, or that it won't shock them if it does.

4. Pull out entirely, because I gave elaborate reasons as to why I changed from my last job that do not involve being laid off (really kicking myself here...)

Either way I learned my lesson and will not make the same mistake.

1afts5b,"My guide on how I landed a 6 figure salary FAANG job, with the cards stacked against me, and how you could too.","In this post I will explain: what I did, how I did it what you can do to increase your odds of landing a job(with some visual data), I warn you this is gonna be long if you don’t wanna read it all scroll at the end for crude tips.  


**My background:**

International Student (European) | Bachelor of Arts (non STEM Major) | 3.6 GPA | White | CISgender Male | No connection in the industry | Top 1% Public University (non Ivy League).  
**Previous Experiences:**

\-Summer intern ad a small VC (When I say small I mean small not BoUtiQue)  
\-Convinced a friend how created a small portal online (virtual reality) to let me write that I worked there as a marketing intern, no this was not a VC backed startup that raised millions in fact it never raised anything at all it was just him running it from his dorm and it had absolutely no customers or investors, more of a side project, I don’t even think the site is up as of now.  
**In the 3.5 months of job applications and interview I:**

\-Tried every Ai tool Under the Sun (Will list pro and cons of the major ones to keep it short but feel free to ask my opinions on any other tool in the comments).

\-Got 3 different certifications to increment my chances of getting hired.  


\-Paid to have my resume edited and proofread as well as my cover letter.-Paid multiple people to apply for me.  


\-Applied to 900+ Jobs | 10 Applications Daily | USA Only.  
Job Selection was limited to jobs that do hire international students, I applied to absolutely anything that would fit a business undergrad, as well as internships.

  
**NO NETWORK NO NETWORKING ON REACH OUT OF ANY KIND ON ANY PLATFORM.**  


**Why I had the cards stacked against me:**

12% of international students are able to stay in the US after graduation the vast majority of international students are in STEM(50.4%), me being in Business which makes up for 16.2% of those 12%, meant that only a 1.94% of international students with my degree are able to remain and work in the USA. This percentage amounts only to the number of people that due to my visa are able to make it through to finally join the USA job market, which is a whole other beast in itself.  
(THIS IS NOT TO BRAG, although I am proud of myself for landing this job I shared this info in the hope to give those who read this post a bit of perspective, if someone like me with a meh GPA and with little to no odds to work in the us at ALL managed to land a FAANG job you can easily find a job for yourself)  
I divided the whole process in tranches of 2 weeks each where I would add something or fix something to see If it would increase my odds off getting an interview.  


**Tools utilized:**

 **-Notion(**free version, utilized the template “Job Applications” to track the application process(the template is free as well).  
**-Calendar** to structure a schedule that would allow me to keep up with the quantity of applications.   
**Format**: Google “Harvard Resume Template”   
**LETS START:**  
**1st TRANCHE Week 1-2 | START.**  
**STRATEGY**:Same Resume-Cover letter, created a template for the cover letter that I would fill in, paid an expert to optimize the template as well as proofread my resume template.  
**RESULT: 140 Applications = 84 Rejected 56 No Answer**  
**2nd TRANCHE Week 3-4 | INTRODUCTION TO AI - 1st Interview - Getting Extra Certifications.**  
\-Started to take a look at forums and reddit asked opinions, implemented AI.  
\-Obtained free certifications for the following: SQL, Excel, Google Analytics. (All of these took few ours to obtain and were all free, there’s an abundance of sites that do offer certifications online)  
STRATEGY:Tried different AI Resume Scanners(also paid for the premium service when a free trial was not available), scanned each resume and then tailored it better on ChatGPT, this one took A LOT of time, it took me 10x longer to do one application.  
Here is how I divided the tools based on the applications to test them:  
40% Teal.  
40% Kickresume.  
20% Various others that I still wanted to test regardless.  
**RESULT: 140 Applications = 97 Rejected 42 No Answer •1st Interview•**  
Out of all the AI platforms I tried there are the main two, Teal and Kickresume, later one you will see how I ditched both.The issue with every single AI platform for jobs is they do give you a score and what to fix but ultimately you will have to do the fixing yourself, there is no automation is just a Scan that does claim to pass ATS scans, I don’t know how true is that(Could be), ultimately they offer some slight improvement (through ChatGPT) but no real “tailoring” per se, and “Templates” which you can easily find on Canva for free, on top of that when I was researching the tools I figured out most of the companies out there do make fake posts on reddit in order to gain traction, in some cases I was not really able to find a legit post and review that didn’t seem shady.  
Regardless I still tailored each application to get at least a 90% score on the scan.  
**Personal Reflection:** I have the impression that tailoring each resume based on the score of any platform might undermine the outcome, there the need of the possibility to keep the same format in the scoring as well as the re writing to be more impactful in the application process.   


**3rd TRANCHE Weeks 5-6 | PAID SOMEONE TO APPLY FOR ME**  
As I was busy with school and had to optimize my time I decided to hire someone to do the work for me to keep the momentum and quantity of application per week, also I had little to no trust in the AI platforms and tools to help me optimize the process.I hired different people across different freelance platforms(Fiverr and Upwork), across different prices, I talked with 20 freelance “professionals”, some of them seemed like bots for some reason, I narrowed down my selection to 4 candidates that seemed promising and matched my requests as well as having a proven track record.  
4 Freelance total applications 140:

1-Cheap: 35 Applications  
2-Mid: 35 Applications

3-Mid: 35 Applications

4-Expensive: 35 Applications  
**RESULT: 140 Applications = 57 Rejected 83 No Answer**  
The most expensive and less effective, most of the applications were meh some were straight up incorrect and full of grammatical errors, also the vast majority of applications were the exact same, I suspect they use some kind of tool or app that does automate part of the job, I mixed feelings about this because I felt like I missed out on opportunities but with school In the way I would have not been able to apply to as many applications.Pros:”Time effective”  
Cons:lacks quality, cannot track the execution, expensive.  
**4rd TRANCHE Weeks 7-8 | BACK TO THE ORIGINS - Studied the game and paid for lessons.**  
**RESULT: 140 Applications = 98 Rejected 36 No Answer •6 First Interviews•**  
Went back to the origins to get some control over everything also I had more time, went above and beyond online to find how to perfectly tailor my resume for better outcomes, also paid to get lessons from the person that would proofread my resume at the start to get more insights on how to tailor it better. Structured my day in a different way to I would have resume and cover letter prepared (which is 80-90% to the application process) using the calendar was HUGE in helping me structuring my time more efficiently. This was grueling and non sustainable I do not suggest to to this, but ultimately It was helpful because it led me to my last idea which was the one that made me succeed.  
**5th TRANCHE Weeks 9-14 THE FINAL RECIPE - PAID AN EXPERT TO APPLY FOR ME I CRACKED THE CODE**  
Expectedly got really busy with school again, knowing that I decided to talk with the person who gave me lesson and would proof read my stuff and asked if he would apply for me, and do the whole process for me(applications only no interview). Negotiate ad price and did the deal, it was far from cheap and considerably more expensive than the most expensive “expert” on freelance sites.   
**RESULT:**   
**9-10      140 Applications = 105 Rejected 24 No Answer •11 First Interview•**  
**11-12     140 Applications = 93 Rejected 39 No Answer •8 First Interview•**  
**13-14    140 Applications = 82 Rejected 45 No Answer •13 First Interview•**  
**Personal Reflection**: This was the most expensive by a long shot overall, but it came back paying in spades. Also for clarity I negotiated a bulk price for a number of applications amount/week, I had to pay NO percentage of my employment rate.  
  
**TLTR and CRUDE TIPS:**

**-tailor each applications to the job.**  
**-schedule your applications time to stay on top of it.**  
**-all of the ai apps around might help but wont really automate anything or make you save too much time to be worth it.**  
**-stay away from freelance that offer to apply for you for cheap.**  
**-hire someone knowledgable someone that necessarily doesnt offer the service of applying for you and try to negotiate with them a way to do so, is gonna be worth your money.**

1aftos3,Fired instead of promotion,"The company I worked for is small and has had a lot of changes over the last few years I’ve been here. I can say there were warning signs like some people leaving after being there for years, a manager went back to their old job, people moved to freelance. I should’ve seen it coming. But the last time I spoke to management seriously was that they wanted to promote me and offer me a raise. Not only that but they suggested I negotiate a higher raise too. I was probably underpaid though but it was still a good enough salary for my lifestyle. The company has benefits and great PTO which I loved which makes this harder.

But apparently there have been other talks behind my back and today I was fired. Offered a small severance which I’m grateful for but still feel blindsighted. The company culture was disorganized but seemed friendly/casual/“family-like” which I should’ve taken as a red flag too. There were also some major changes like remote to hybrid then office location changes. But I moved to be closer to the previous office. Now that I’m taking off the rose colored glasses I can see there were red flags I ignored. But as my first adult job I guess I was really naive.

Because of the area we are in (somewhere in the Northern US) 90% of our clientele Is from the same country of my dads manager or speaks similar languages. so they will come in and once they realize Im Born American they give me this look of disgust and sometimes will say I would like to speak to a (other nationality) employee, not even hiding the fact that they don't wanna be helped by me because I'm American. They have even pretended to not speak English to not deal with me, It's starting to feel extremely insulting being that its my families name on the business. I have tried learning the languages numerous times rosetta, babble, classes and on the go but its bad haha. Some have been here for 30+years and dont speak a word of english and will wait an hour just not to talk to me....... but im getting off point. My Dad knows i hate the job and the customers and ive told him hey let me work from home ill take calls and phone calls(of people that will converse with me) my co workers can get the info send it to me so i can get it all set and the customers deal with them, At this point it feels like I'm a glorified secretary half the time and would be much more efficient from home than here in office dealing with people i wanna beat half the time i do the exact same things i could do from home but with no pants and hate but he's old school and says we need bodies and ""pick it up"" when i dont know how when i cant communicate with most clientele when another of our employees who has worked for him works from home since covid cuz shes scared of germs now. There is alot of other Jobs I'd like to do but they need Degrees that i know ill never get. I barely got through Highschool i graduated with a 1.42gpa partially Because I knew i was joining the Marines(shoulda joinged the airforce) and didnt care outta Highschool planning on being career and didnt care. I had already passed the ASVAB with a highscore and only wanted infantry. so paying for college is a non issue. But my freshman year i was ran over and it messed up my knee pretty good but lied my way into the service and it was my downfall. Because the way that pretty much everywhere tests or grades and teaches does not sync with me. When i have dumped knowledge on people they look at me Baffled and ask ""How the fuck do you not have a PHD in Astro-Physics, Quantum-Physics, Astronomy, Rocket Science or not an Engineer on Next Gen Fighter Jets or work as an Aviation mechanic"" and my answer is Degrees and Math as I'm Dyslexic and Dyscalculic. I figure out alot and cant explain how or the steps to get there but its like I can see it in my head. Schools dont give af about that and have tried making it into programs so i can show my true skill but no takers. while working on my Harley I have no issues working on it alone or my car but if i try and explain what im doing to someone or something they have no idea what im talking about and neither would a mechanic until they saw what i was doing. Forgive my writing skills as it is 1 of my weaker skills like i said its hard for me to translate my thoughts onto paper for most to understand it the way I do. but either way i feel stuck and dont know what to do space and military aviation are my passions im good at working on my bike but would be hard to get certified to open a shop and dont wanna start hating something i do to wind down im also good at working on computers but even my buddy whos in the industry says its had to get your foot in the door without some kind of computer related degree.",Red_Alert0394,2,1.0,1,1706736762,2024-01-31 21:32:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aftcwo/i_hate_my_job_but_dont_know_what_else_i_would_do/,1,2024

1afsvym,Should I change my location on LinkedIn to my physical location as a remote worker?,"I've been working remotely at a great job since the pandemic began, and my company has let me not only keep working remotely permanently, but also from out of state. I've moved halfway across the country, but I've kept my LinkedIn location the same. This is mainly because the industry I am in has a healthy presence there, and is pretty much non-existent where I have moved to. I like to keep tabs on what's going on there, and be open to other remote jobs in my industry (of which there are very few).

Now, I *know* LinkedIn is trash for the most part, but recruiters use it, and I would be open to working locally - in an adjacent industry - but only for the right salary. Does anyone think it's worth it to change my location? I am connected to numerous people at my company that know I have moved, but part of me wants to avoid reminding them of that (of course, they would have to look at my profile to do that), so I'm not sure that's an irrational fear.

1afsbx2,How to tell team that I am leaving?,"I have recently been transferred to a new branch, which has been easy on me. I don't love the hours, but I like the job. This manager has given me full run with me taking over quite a lot. He has shown belief in me and knows I can be great in the job.

However, I don't think the overall company will be able to help me long term. (I am in smaller company with not a lot of roles to move up).

I am anticipating an offer for a decent but hard working position at one of the Big 5 banks.

Long term career wise, I should switch over now, I think, but it will be a lot more demanding.

The offer I am expecting is a 15% raise plus bonus.

So, I don't think it makes sense to stay, unless I plan on throwing my career away here forever.

I am new to this team and they all like me a lot.

1afs1mn,"""Join a Trade"" - Union vs Non & Misinformation","There is a lot of misinformation going around in this and the jobs subreddit regarding the trade, so I wanted to just address a few of them.

1. When trades are recommended, the people recommending them often mean the **unionized** trade. You can join trades as union or as non-union (private). Union pays **far** better. For example, an IBEW electrician in my area makes 123k *take-home* pay **on top of** annuity fund retirement, pension retirement, healthcare, etc. Total package probably around 200k+. They also pay for your 4-5 years of schooling while you work. Source: [https://unionpayscales.com/trades/ibew-electricians/](https://unionpayscales.com/trades/ibew-electricians/)
2. Bodies break down. Whether you're staring at a computer screen and destroying your posture or your handling heavy equipment, bodies will break down... **if you don't care for them.** If you down beers, smoke, eat poorly, don't exercise, don't use correct gear (good chairs for office, kneepads and such for blue collar), then *obviously* your body is going to break down. I know a 60 year old man at my church who is a union electrician who is in fantastic shape and enjoying life. It's about how you care for your body. 
3. Job advancement. I've seen people say that once you top out as a journeyman in trades, you will never get paid more. Besides the fact that you're already getting paid a shit ton more than most office jobs, you can go into desk jobs, foreman, general foreman, etc. There is room for career advancement should you choose that.

This is not to say office jobs or trades are better than the other... but a lot of people are shitting on union trades when they are some of the best paying jobs in the world.",HonkaiDayOne,3,0.7099999785423279,7,1706733582,2024-01-31 20:39:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1afs1mn/join_a_trade_union_vs_non_misinformation/,1,2024
1afrsbf,To pip or not to pip,"So I'm a 27M working in a large corporate company and was recently told I am being put on a PIP after my year end review. I'm trying to make the decision of whether or not to take on the PIP or to deny it and get terminated at the end. I've heard of PIP's before and seems like a general consensus that it's a huge red flag, but a couple things to note that I think make this different:

* This pip is driven by new organizational changes (thanks and F\*!@ you newly hired in Amazon Execs), which essentially amounts to them **simultaneously enforcing quotas** for people who have to be put into lower performance tiers and **automatically putting those in the lower tier on PIP's**
* The company is actively trying to downsize, and has been doing silent layoffs since last year
* The reason I have been put into the lower performance tier (and subsequently PIP) is because of the need for quota's, and some bad blood with one of my skip level managers. I however have a good relation with my direct manager, and the director above my skip level

As a note, my options are to either go on the PIP after which point (60 days) I'll be reevaluated. Or to reject the pip, in which case I'll stay on for 60 as essentially pto then get terminated. In both cases I'll get the same amount of severance. 

I'm currently leaning towards participating in the PIP as my manager has essentially confirmed that there is nothing wrong with my performance and she would mark me as passed on her end. **So my question is, is there anything I'm missing by choosing to go on the PIP?** Like will I be missing out on future unemployment, or other consequences. I'm pretty confident that my manager will pass me on the PIP, but I'm not as confident that will prevent me from being terminated as the organization is still looking for a way to fire people regardless. Am I losing something by taking a shot at trying to keep my job instead of just throwing in the towel?",Yummycaptaincrunch,2,1.0,3,1706732969,2024-01-31 20:29:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1afrsbf/to_pip_or_not_to_pip/,1,2024

I have been assigned all the existing task maintenance and BAUs in which I cannot add any value also whenever I have suggested something’s they keep refusing them which makes me demotivated and eventually I have stopped suggesting only because they never take suggestions. Also eventually they come to my suggestions only but they never acknowledge or appreciate. 
This has been a pattern now. In reviews they keep telling me to perform I keep telling my interests but they don’t acknowledge that keep pushing me to dead end.
I had to get the mid - year review after so much talks with them but was disappointed with the feedback. I don’t think they want to offer me new opportunity rather they want to lay me off in next 2 months because they keep mentioning about the HR n all.

1afqxlk,HR lied during salary negotiations. What do I do?,"I interviewed for a company that did not post their salary range in the job description. During the interview, I asked for the salary range and they gave me a range for that role. I was making a bit more than that range. They offered me the job within that salary range about 15k less than what I was making.  Now, I really thought there was no way I’d take this job. But I was very interested in so I was willing to take a little bit of a paycut. I countered wth a salary above that range but less than I was making (as much of a paycut I was willing to accept), still fully believing they would say no or counter again, seeing as my counter was outside of the range they gave me and typically in my industry, negotiating doesn’t get you too far. Maybe a few extra thousand. HR responds with that offer sounds great, we’re sorry we made a mistake and your original offer was low. 

This is where I made a big mistake. Instead of countering my counter, I accepted the position. In my mind, it was like okay well once I get in there and show I’m a good employee, I’ll be able to climb the ladder and get decent raises and promotions. Additionally this is a pretty unique position and one I was unfamiliar with so I really had no idea what a fair salary for it was. 

Once I started employment a few things became clear to me. 1. There was no career ladder meaning there was absolutely no promotion I could work towards. 2.  HR does not give out raises outside of very small merit raises. 3. After attempting to get a raise after I proved myself to be a great employee and took on many additional responsibilities, it was clear the salary range for my pay grade was much much higher than my current salary. And definitely much higher than the salary range they gave me for the position during my interview process.

Company and Optionee both desire rewarding Optionee for long-term employment with Company; 

Grant of Options and Option Term: 

Subject to the terms and condition set forth in this Agreement, Company grants to Optionee five percent (5%) of the Company based on the vesting schedule and terms below: 

Cliff.  All option grants are subject to a fourteen (14) month cliff (Cliff).  The purpose of the Cliff is to ensure that any options being granted reward Optionee for long-term dedication and commitment to the Company.  

Cliff Period.  The Cliff period is from November 1, 2023 to December 31, 2024.  After the Cliff Period is satisfied, the options become eligible for vesting as outlined below in the Option Vesting Schedule. 

Vesting.  The Options shall vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule below.  If the Optionee’s employment with the Company ends, the Options will not vest further. 

Option Vesting Schedule.

1st Tranche, 1.5%:  eligible to grant on January 1, 2025; eligible to vest on December 31, 2025
2nd Tranche, 1.5%:  eligible to grant on January 1, 2026; eligible to vest on December 31, 2026
3rd Tranche, 2.0%:  eligible to grant on January 1, 2027; eligible to vest on December 31, 2027

Sale Of Company.  Should one hundred percent (100%) of the Company be sold (Sale), all tranches fully vested at that time will participate in the net proceeds of the Sale on a pro-rata basis based on the ownership interests set forth in the Vesting Schedule above.  Any unvested tranches shall not participate in the Sale.  Should a person or entity invest in the company, such investment shall not be deemed a Sale.  Company in its sole discretion may accelerate any unvested options (in whole or in part) in the event of a Sale provided such acceleration is memorialized in writing to Optionee.   

Unvested Options. There shall be no partial vesting. Should Optionee’s employment with Company end for any reason, any tranche not fully vested at that time shall be forfeited in its entirety.  The spirit of the vesting schedule is to ensure equity is granted to employees who are committed to the Company on a long-term basis and who continue to promote the best interest of the Company. 

Documents. Upon all three option tranches becoming fully vested such that 5% of the Company has been earned, Company will update Company’s corporate documents and licensing to reflect Optionee’s pro-rata ownership.  Company will defer to its attorneys and accountants at that time on the appropriate company documents to be updated.  
Nontransferability:  Optionee’s options may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee. 
Entire Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  

Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws blank state . 
Employee At Will.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer or be construed to confer on the Optionee any right to continue in the employ or service of the Company or interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate the Optionee’s employment with the Company at any time, with or without cause. 
Amendments.   No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by both Company and Optionee.

1afnn7v,MS or MBA? 34-year old IT Professional with 10+ years experience asking.,"Hey everyone,  
I am a 34-year old IT professional with 10+ years experience in BI and Analytics. I have a bit of experience in Data Engineering as well, but none with Data Science in particular. I am currently in a hybrid role as a Data Engineering Manager / Data Architect, and am looking at following this career path going forward. I do also have a B.Tech majoring in IT.  
I am very much interested in pursuing either an MBA or an MS in Analytics going forward, but I am unable to decide on which one I should go for. I am hoping to get inputs from all of you based on my pointers below:  
Type of roles moving forward: Techno-functional leading towards a CDO role (I do understand that I would need to keep myself updated as this progresses, but I'd like to know which of the 2 degrees would offer a better and a quicker chance of getting there - whether statistically or otherwise)  
Financial Constraints: I don't have a whole lot of money and I do not have sponsorships from my organization, so I'll be going forward with either of the 2 options on my buck. So I can only afford an iMBA from University of Illinois (or similar), or an online MS degree from Georgia Tech and the likes. I do not think I would be eligible for any scholarships as I haven't exactly had a stellar academic record either. If it matters deeply where I do my MBA/MS from and the above options do not cut it, please do let me know!  
I am not closed to the idea of pursuing both options one after the other over a longer period of time.  
I am definitely not interested in entrepreneurial pursuits at all (in case you believe that an MBA is more suited for someone of that calibre).  
I also understand that I may be under-informed or misinformed even, and I look to you gurus to help me choose an appropriate path.",Echo-Victor,1,1.0,1,1706722977,2024-01-31 17:42:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1afnn7v/ms_or_mba_34year_old_it_professional_with_10/,1,2024

1afn7sk,Should I tell my coworkers?,"So, I have sort of a dilemma. I work for a small university as a social media coordinator. 
I'm in the communications and marketing department and we do a lot of features on students and do photoshoots that often feature students, and we obviously like to get some diversity in our photos. 
There is a student on our campus who is of a minority and we have used him in a variety of publications and photoshoots. 
However, I am younger and went to school at this university not too long ago (I graduated 3 years ago), so I still know some students that go here.
I was out with some of my friends, who attend the university, and they know I'm in communications and marketing. They asked why we use this student so much, because apparently around campus he has been accused of assault on multiple occasions. 
I had no idea, I didn't even know his name until my friends told me. We have him plastered on our website and social media channels. 
Although this isn't necessarily public knowledge and I don't believe he's been charged with anything, he's also going to be featured in a major upcoming publication and I personally believe this is quite a bad look upon our university should this information become a legal issue. 
His face is literally everywhere because he's a ""star student"" and a racial minority. Like, there's photos of him in the presidents office. 
I don't know if I should tell my boss about these accusations or just let it go considering at this time they're ""baseless"", though my friends say it's well known on campus that he is an abuser.

I'm not sure how to interpret these bands, though I understand that the max is a rarity and definitely not something to expect.  
My background:  
Masters in a preferred degree field. They're only asking for a Bachelors but everyone else working at the company in this role has a Masters as well, I looked them up.  
3.5 years of total work experience out of school, but also had semi-relevant jobs and internships as a student.

I haven’t been pleased with the field of architecture as far as what I do day-to-day as it seems to be more engineering and project management than actual design. This isn’t unique to a particular firm. That along with a low pay ceiling in the industry. Architecture school did not at all set me up with the right expectations for the industry.

I’ve looked into UX/UI design, video game design, and some other related design jobs.  It’s worth noting I recently completed Google’s UX Design Certification. I’m finding that even though I love creativity and problem solving, a design field may not be for me. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for career paths I could look into provided my experience? I’m completely wide open to suggestions and don’t want to limit suggestions to something directly related to design.

All these applications for other companies also share the same application portal as the company I was terminated from. Ive started applying to positions that are either entry level or over qualified for to test if i’m basically just blacklisted. I cant even get a recruiter to give me a screening call. I know its not my rusume or experience thats the issue because I have no problems getting interviews with other smaller companies in the defense contracting space.

1aflvnk,Interview-how to explain recent slightly chaotic career moves?,"Last year I accepted a new job (Job B) after being in my last position (Job A) for 5 years. I loved job A but I was recruited for Job B and felt it would be good to get some new experience and dig into other areas of my field that I couldn’t in Job A. Once I started it was immediately clear the job was misrepresented and a bad fit. 

Long story short, I wound up going back to my previous position and have been back here for a few weeks. I just got a call about interviewing for a position that I am very interested in. (These are all government jobs so the process moves very slowly-I don’t even remember applying for this position but looked back and I applied last May before even moving to Job B.) 

Anyway, how can I present all this without sounding like a total flake? I do love Job A and I’m enjoying being back. I truly enjoy the work and the people I work with and feel respected. I could probably happily work here for many years, but the position I’m interviewing for is double the pay (from $50k to 95k so pretty life changing). I don’t have a lot of opportunity for career progression at current job but it allows a lot of flexibility and I’m more of a “work to live” person anyway. OTOH the salary is obviously falling so far behind market. We have our needs covered but “wants” feel out of reach. I have a masters and 7 years of experience and market rate is closer to 85-100k. This is a government agency so big raises/promotions/bonuses at not a thing at all.

Idk why, and I can’t quite explain it, but I don’t really like the environment.  It’s not that it’s toxic or that my boss or coworkers are bad people, they’re quite the opposite.  There are just some things I don’t like.  I don’t like the office politics, I don’t like having to fake being sociable and outgoing (the dynamic of our office and field of business is very social).  Its also a small company so I see and have to interact with executives often which is stressful at times.  I don’t like how sterile the environment is, I can never really get comfortable.   

I know it’s a lot of bitching, and most family and friends would tell me to get over it and just deal with it.  But it’s hard, and I really just don’t enjoy my job, I definitely feel like an outcast.

The issue is, I can’t tell if 1. This is genuinely a me thing that I need to get over, 2. This is just a specific company culture thing and not an office job general thing, or if 3. This is an office job thing and I should pursue some other type of career.

I’m still young and know that I need experience, and this job is at a stable company and pays excellently.  Pay is important to me, but I am living at home with my family and my only expense is a $200 car payment, so I guess if I ultimately switched careers  for a pay cut at first it wouldn’t be the end of the world, if I was happy and felt like I fit in more.

1afl1fr,How can I tell my boss I don’t want to relocate anymore?,"I currently work from home from another state and have been working at my job for about 6 months now. When I applied, it didn’t specify if it would allow the option to be fully remote. When I interviewed with them, I mentioned that I preferred to be remote but don’t mind relocating if necessary and most of them said it would be fine. A lot of their team is remote anyway.

I seriously didn’t mind making the move at first but now I’m very skeptical. I’m not sure what would be out there for me socially. There was also some layoffs a few weeks into me starting that got me spooked. The VP did meet with me to let me know, that they chose not to lay me off on purpose, they don’t want the layoffs to affect my decision in relocating and that they see me as a value to the company. It didn’t hit me at the time, but now that it’s getting closer to me having to move. I’m starting to feel that anxiety a lot. There is a new CEO and they have a reputation of ruining company culture and more. So I would absolutely hate moving to the other side of the country just to be laid off where I don’t know anyone or the area. I would want to move back. So I just feel that it would be better for me to just be fully remote where I am. 

And I am not trying to take advantage of anything. Id rather be in person for at least some days to really get to know people. I just mostly don’t feel to good about moving there with all the lay offs happening. 

Also, there are about 5 of us all together on a team. Only 3 of us are out of state. And the other 2 are in office but for in office people, it’s 2 days in office only.

I'm actually excited, because the studio had become a constant strain on me, stressing about a business owned by someone else, and being made responsible for the success of the business as a mere 1099C (wage theft, amirite?).  The substitute teacher deal has been a means to an end, because I needed flexible work so I could keep studio business a priority, but...this, and all the other sacrifices/compromises I've had to limit myself by for the past 12 years are no longer relevant, and I find myself finally able to look at getting a regular job.  My girlfriend and her son are elated.  As am I, honestly.

Only issue is that I don't know what positions to even look for.  The FT jobs I would have applied to in the past feel...not beneath me, but I'm 2 degrees later, there's gotta be something better than call center tech support, right?  I've looked into A/V work, but late hours and weekends means I'd have to sacrifice my cover band, which has become successful to the point where it is a legit secondary source of income, sometimes bagging me an extra $1500 a month, so I'm not willing to give that up.  A M-F 9-5 sounds ideal, I just find myself severely out of touch with the current job market.

1afjdsq,Work nemesis following me to new job??," 

Hi,

So I am currently serving my notice since I got a really good offer from a different company which I already took. At my current work place I have this nemesis in the department - we do not get along at all. It is very hostile and we ceased all communication last year. We had an altercation 2 years ago where we were placed in the same apartment by our employer for like 3 months. The short story is she disrespected me constantly and even approached my partner when he came to visit and asked him to leave! It got so bad that I had to tell my boss I will be moving out and luckily he understood. This is easy, I can get over this and I did, no problem. My biggest issue with her is she is so lazy and combative at work, and since we work on projects together we do have to rely on each other's intelligence and shift ideas back and forth. She is the kind to respond with ""that's not my fuction, that's yours"" to basically anything that would require her to think! I can't work with her- and the other colleagues share the same opinion. She has also instigated the other team members and leans heavily towards influencing them to dislike me, and other bullying tactics. Basically my quality of work life at the moment is at like 40% with regard to my relationship with the rest of the team purely because of her. She is toxic and vile!

Now, after accepting the offer (which is 100% raise) I find out she is also serving notice and will also be going to the same employer in the same department. My current employer wants me to stay and they have given me a counter offer of 50% raise (which is the highest they are allowed to give). What do I do? I can't imagine enduring what I was so excited to get away from. I'm stressed.",PsychologicalCow1744,10,0.9200000166893005,7,1706712142,2024-01-31 14:42:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1afjdsq/work_nemesis_following_me_to_new_job/,1,2024

He’s basically admitted as such. The PIP basically says “well, we changed”.  I haven’t heard from HR at all, haven’t signed the PIP.

Financially and benefits-wise, I’ll be fine. I have health care through my wife.

I don’t really see a future there, but I don’t want to necessarily make things easy by just exiting on my own. Nor do I want to be terminated for “performance”, especially if that makes any difference.

1afgsi8,Unexpectedly unemployed 50F finds job training: which training will be best through my retirement?,"I might leave a lot out trying to get to the point of my ask of y’all so if you need more details, please ask. 

Quickest version: I am newly unemployed at 50 & I have 20 weeks of unemployment pay/benefits (meaning through end of May). I just found a state employment training website chock full of training opportunities for what I think is free and I plan to learn more ASAP (beginning today). 

I’m in my 31st year of community development: the most consistent & productive employment I have had was an 8 year war in a part university/part county job as an Extension educator. In the role I had to generate annual revenue (salary savings), and I ended up generating almost $2 million in local-to-national community-engaged grants and contracts on different areas (biggest one was getting a state contract to bring a national returning citizen training program to our statewide leadership, next was a partnership with 4 communities across the US to build a series of local-to-national  grassroots entrepreneurship and leadership building projects). Yet, I don’t find joy or peace in public service jobs - almost all of my supervisors have been very poor managers. I only left the 8 year job because after a staewide restructure, leadership couldn’t promise we would have jobs for several months (even though they told me they were working on funding for a center to house the new program we’d earned the state contract for). While this happened, a coworker in another department became a state appointee & asked me to apply for her job. I did (mostly since I hadn’t begun to research the job market), and over 50 other candidate the offer came to me & it doubled my salary. I asked the my job could not counter, so I bet on myself and accepted the offer. Totally not the right fit & I quit 8 months later, sold my house to a broker (breaking even), and relocated back to my hometown for a job I thought was a great fit. 8 months later, it was also irreconcilably toxic (way too many toxic areas to address alone), so I asked to be fired so I could rebuild and my request was granted (gratefully). 

I’ve had to build my career with very little personal professional development after asking in every job, and I am proud of several things i was able to do. But, I am not wedded to public service any longer. I have forgotten more than I remember how to do, and I am ready for a less-life consuming career in this next phase of my life through retirement. 

I have 3 degrees: a bachelor’s in urban & regional planning, a master’s in social work (community org administration/macro practice generalist, no licensure needed), and a PhD in higher education administration. 

**Ask 1 of 2: Of these trainings, with the little I have told you, would serve me best?**
• https://detroitatwork.com/training 

My immediate attention was drawn most immediately to 2: 

1. the PMP-Scrum Master-Lean Six Sigma cert, and, 

2. IT - but I don’t know which IT training would match best not just with my experience, but most importantly, which could open opportunities for less public engaging/more focused positions that are not always expecting “60 hour weeks including evenings and weekends”. 

3. **A related state site has a cert on Workforce & Career Development to become a career coach** - I would love that if I can find a job with a pension/immediate vesting (like at a local college or university, & but I’m open). 

https://www.michiganworks.org/training 

My previous salaries were public information so I don’t mind saying the 8 year job began at $55K, ended at $68K, the double salary job was $115K, and the last job was $70K. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Due to circumstances across the 3 jobs, unpaid unemployment previously & paying expenses for relocation, I no longer have any retirement savings & am rebuilding savings & my 9 month emergency fund. 

My goal is to start a job at $60K to $80K (preferring starting at $80K). 

If it’s not too much to hope for a 40-50 hour a week job that is semi-structured or structured, little to no expectations to supervise (although I am a good supervisor, I have been in roles that had unrealistic operations/administration + project lead coordination slapped on top of supervision and I might still be naive but I don’t want to work two jobs in one position if I don’t have to any longer). 

**Also: Ask 2A & B of 2:**
• what salary expectations should I put next should I earn either cert over the next 20 weeks?

 • What titles of jobs should I look for?

1afgqea,What to do in this situation?,"Hi folks,

Bit of background

28m in UK, have a bachelors in music (first class) with a particular focus on a very relevant technology and how that could be used to structure business models within the music industry - this tech is now being used in tech companies, along with artificial intelligence. I've worked different jobs before and after graduation: operations focused role, sales roles, business development, market research, however disliked all of them. Currently work in an account manager role earning £35k and absolutely hate it. I find the work menial and not intellectually stimulating, to the point that I get so frustrated with myself that I'm sitting in an office doing this job (understand this may be ADHD, however I haven't been diagnosed). I'm often thinking the grass is greener and yearn for stability, both financially and general career path, in something that interests me. My current UK city is where I came for uni, and I recently broke up with my girlfriend before Christmas, so don't feel like there's anything keeping me here. I'm quite lonely if I'm honest. Have 16k in a LISA and have 4k in general savings.

Moving forward

I applied to a graduate program for a large management consulting firm who work in the aforementioned technology sphere and got the job. It doesn't start until summer 2024 and it's in a different city to where I am now. I'll be taking a paycut to around 34k euros, however I've seen through evidence that promotion is yearly and so is increase in salary - I also know a senior consultant there who confirms this. When I think of the years working after graduation, I've had no idea what to do, however, I've always wanted to be in some sort of consulting in something I enjoy, and I often dream of being able to rectify business challenges through the use of tech, and become an absolute expert in a particular field, solving problems for different businesses, in different sectors. This is something that I haven't found in the jobs I've held or industries I've already dabbled in and I know that working in various different industries, which this company does, would cure my thirst for knowledge and the world around me. 

Apprehension

I'm really reluctant to take this job (even though I know I'll regret it if I don't) due to having to start at entry level, in a city where the cost of living in so high, and where I don't know anyone. I know it may sound like I'm having a third life crisis but I feel so inferior that I'm this age and don't have a girlfriend, am renting on my own now, and will be renting alone in this new city, without being able to save. I've never had an issue with finding girlfriends or one night stands, however now that I'm older, I want that stability and for ME to feel like I'm worthy of handling a family etc etc. I feel embarrassed telling people what I do because I loathe the industry, what I do on a daily basis, and just know it's not me, as if I'm not where I want to be and I know it deep down. I just don't know how to get to a place where I live a normal life. I feel like maybe putting in two/three years of graft to this new job would have me on a brilliant path, both for myself and for future prospects. 

Thoughts

I have been thinking of leaving my current job and going travelling for a while on my own - this is something I didn't do whilst growing up and although the thought of 'finding myself' isn't something I think will definitely happen, I know I need time on my own to think and to plan my next steps - I'm actually miserable and dread getting up everyday for work. Maybe part of this is because I haven't had time to regather after the relationship ended - I started a new job and moved into a new flat to get out of our flat together. 

I know it's quite an extensive overview of where I'm at but I honestly need some advice about what to do here. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Cheers

1afgals,Company wants me back after making me redundant,"Work in IT. Salary was 85k at a fintech scale up that has been around since 2015, backed by a large finance company. I had worked there for 1 year. Market downturn caused redundancies. I was the last one to join my team, and as they had to make cuts I was the first one out. I had a great relationship with my team and direct manager, we’re basically friends at this point and have kept in touch since I was made redundant. It was clear that my manager had no role in my redundancy and it was something that came from the board.

Immediately after I was made redundant, shit hit the fan. The teams productivity was considerably lower because I wasn’t there, and my managers manager apologised to my former team for letting me go, acknowledging the mistake they made. 

Additionally, HR didn’t follow the correct procedure when making me redundant which meant following an ACAS negotiation, a CoT3 agreement was signed that meant that I received 6 months additional wages on top of my notice period pay. 

During the negotiation, my direct manager who I am friends with asked if I could come back, with increased salary and a signing on bonus to acknowledge their mistake. I declined as I had found another job, and felt it was too soon to go back. 

However, approximately a year since i was made redundant, they are still wanting me to come back. The salary would be around the 120k mark with the potential for bonuses(25k on top of what i earn now at my current job).

I am strongly considering rejoining because I loved working with those guys and the work was fun. Additionally there is a new CEO at the company which makes me more comfortable with returning. The company is also quite profitable now.

1afexml,How do you know you are acting authentic?,"
I am currently having mixed feelings about the things I am ABOUT to pursue. I also felt the same way about my last endeavor. It didn't feel valuable, even when I 'achieved' milestones. Other people did feel proud. I didn't. So I read about this and concluded that I may not be acting my authentic self. Because whenever I am talking about the things that i do, i dont feel as if I am talking. It's a bunch of cliches I would say, that I am speaking and describing the things that I am pursuing, a career or something.

Then the other confusion was, that to be authentic you need to start detaching yourself from your thoughts. But what I experienced was more of a feeling than a thought, right? 

Is there something wrong with my value system? As in I am not valuing things correctly. And that will come under my thoughts. And should I change that and criticize myself less?

Or is this my conscience speaking and I should not pursue what I am about to pursue because I do not FEEL I am being authentic? Or maybe I feel this way because my last decision went wrong.

If someone can help me how to approach this situation. I mean, what should I ask myself? What should I not let impact my decisions? Should I go with my feelings and not do this thing? But then I don't have any other plan. 
Or should I think less about it and do it anyway, regardless of how I feel?",Tall-Explanation-476,1,1.0,1,1706697238,2024-01-31 10:33:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1afexml/how_do_you_know_you_are_acting_authentic/,1,2024

I’m at my ends wit finding a career to peruse. I enlisted in the army when I was 17 which had been my childhood dream but was medically discharged at 20. I’ve had a few different jobs since then, primarily real estate for two years which I left 4 months ago. 

There’s not a whole lot else I can see myself doing, similar jobs to the army (police, border force, ect) I can’t take on due to my injuries. 

Has anyone found themselves in a similar position & what resources did you find were available? I’m hoping for a careers advisor like in High School but none seem available to adults unless you’re a dole bludger & are more focusing on prepping you for entering the work force with resumes & mock job interview

1afek04,Looking to grow my IT Career - Current role and employer doesn't want me to grow,"Hi All,

Looking for some advice, I am currently working as best described as a ""Blended Desktop and Network Support"" role. In this role, my day-to-day work consists of the smaller Password resets, adding to a printer that can scale up to Firewall changes surveying new/old sites, planning infrastructure implementations or upgrades and fixing network issues.

I am looking to move into a primary Network Engineer role, I have had several interviews with other companies to which I haven't had severely negative feedback back and it has been along the lines of ""Other candidates have a little more experience, but if another role comes out we will sure have you back""

I wonder if it is my way of explaining myself in interviews, I wonder if it is my title as it doesn't mention network engineer in it at all it is quite a broad ""Technology Engineer"" role. I have had my CV reviewed and I always get through the initial hiring phase so I know that isn't the issue.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice for these interviews on where I could be going wrong? I know it is a bit ambiguous but any little tips or techniques would be greatly appreciated",Mobile_Valuable_2409,1,1.0,0,1706695636,2024-01-31 10:07:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1afek04/looking_to_grow_my_it_career_current_role_and/,1,2024

1afdock,Negotiation advice,"I was offered a role with a huge company (Company A). I am due to join the company (in March). I have another offer from my current employer (Company B) albeit in a different team for a role which is completely remote. I value that the role is completely remote and the role is interesting to me too hence inclined that way. My current employer doesn't know about me having another offer in hand? Would it be wise to go back to employer A to see if they can offer a complete remote role even though I have already accepted an offer from them ? Also while negotiating with my current employer would it be foolish to reveal the other offer in hand. Employer A is offering a significant pay bump (~25%). The recruiter at my current company mentioned they don't offer a raise for lateral moves.

I will be graduating this year with a double major Bach degree in psychology and gender studies (yes, I know, looking for honest answers not jokes about what I majored in). I don’t want to change the psyc degree because I care about that and will be finishing up that this year. However, I’m wondering if it would be best if I dropped the gender studies degree. I already did the classes for that so I have nothing left to do for it other than finish up my psyc degree, but I’m wondering if, job wise, it would be more of a hindrance than a benefit for my psyc degree. I’m mainly focused on just getting a job after I get my bachelor’s without doing more for a masters or PhD. I know that won’t exactly pay well or mean I’ll do something related to my major, but I’m fine with that as long as I get a survivable job.

With my current role it is all warm leads so it is not hard to achieve high sales.

My dilemma is that in my current role I am worried I have hit the ceiling in terms in terms of growth at my current role and would benefit from expanding my skills in a different form of sales, my worry is I very much enjoy what I currently do and going into something I could potentially not enjoy.

1af8z2v,Engineering of any type after 40?,"Was about to ask this in the askengineering sub, but decided it might be better here. That said I turned 40 last year and have been driving semi trucks full time since 2010. I barely graduated high school and then went to community college in both CA and NM off and on since 2001. Barely collected any useful credits/units in the past 23 years.


That said I've always thought about engineering of any type from time to time. I felt I always had some modicum of mechanical inclination. But just never had the right guidance/mentorship growing up to put it bluntly. My math skills when I was younger were laughable. But I felt when I last gave algebraic classes a shot back in 2019, I felt I understood the material more(either more developed brain, or countless exposure to the subject via fail/repeats of classes).


With that out of the way, would engineering in any discipline be right for my caliber if trucking became automated/license taken away due to future medical issues? Or should I just look into something like Airframe and Power plant, diesel tech, or something more vocational? I've got working in a meatplant as a cutter as an immediate fall back option in mind(better pay/hours for no college). And I'm unmarried and no kids to be responsible for.

1af8q2g,Navigating close friendship between boss and team member,"I relatively new to a company where I work on a small 5-person team, all reporting directly to a VP. The VP and her second-in-command on our team have a very close personal friendship. They don’t exactly advertise it, but really hide it either. I don’t get romantic vibes, just very good friends who socialize together a lot outside of work. They’re both women, and live in the same city (whole team is remote and scattered except for them). The second-in-command outranks everyone else on the team, but nobody reports to her.

Initially, I had no concerns, there’s nothing wrong with colleagues also being personally close, and the Second and I are in different areas and so I’m not competing with her for a promotion or anything.

Lately, though, I’ve seen some instances that rub me the wrong way. When we have company retreats, the two of them will skip team activities to hang out. VP has criticized my team for a poor work product on a project Second managed, immediately jumping to conclude the issue was with us and not the project management.

And just recently the VP removed a member of our small team who was of equal rank to Second, and replaced her with someone of equal credentials, but reporting to Second.

None of the instances thus far are unjustifiable from a business perspective. I’m sure the VP would argue, not inaccurately, that Second understands her thought processes and has her trust, and so empowering her makes sense from an organizational/business perspective.

But more and more I feel like VP’s default is to empower and support her best friend, which creates blind spots and forces the rest of us to work around the two of them, because we’re uncomfortable raising any issues and trusting an objective and fair assessment of the situation.

No major conflicts or issues have happened because of this yet, but it feels like just a matter of time.

Any tips on how I can navigate this? (Don’t say report to hr bc we basically are HR lol)",ahbane,1,1.0,0,1706673935,2024-01-31 04:05:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1af8q2g/navigating_close_friendship_between_boss_and_team/,1,2024

For the last 2+ years I have been working with child sex abuse victims and their families.

My grandfather who passed a year ago founded a credit union. Job posted about 5 days ago, something that would work for me & i think I’d get hired for. I ironically only saw it today as I was scrolling and dealing with this internal crisis of what I really want in life.

I have romanticized the idea of working a semi-normal job. 

If I applied for this new job and got offered/accepted it - it would be devastating to my agency. The agency I’m with now treats me great, good benefits and pay. But mentally exhausting. 

Do I be selfish/put myself first and apply to the credit union??

1af6wgk,Workplace Harassment -> PIP Retaliation,"My team, at a large consulting firm, assigned me a manager who I butted heads with; including a long list of justifiable reasons.

I set a call with HR to maturely address the issues. Instead they put me on a PIP and another project with that same manager.

I have a formal letter (unsent) documenting everything my manager has said and done constituting a pretty strong case for workplace harassment. 

#1 Curious if it’s an awful idea (kiss of death) or very wise and methodical idea (I have more than enough incidents of misconduct) to submit it.

#2 has anyone ever successfully got a company to redline and create actionable steps on a PIP, the plan they gave me is super subjective and setting me up to fail

1af5sq2,I made a $13 million error. Am I fired?,"I’m really not sure how big of a mistake I made.

I work in customer service, and was “receiving” a drop ship order in our system, so it could invoice.

Another CSR had originally entered this order, but left the company. She entered her order for 56,000 grams, which we normally only do KG or EA (boxes).

When I received the order, I put 4 EA as I was instructed to always enter orders in EA. However, someone this messed up the order, as the order I believe was in grams, so it changed the order to 56,000 EA totaling $13 million. 

The customer received an invoice for $13,000,000 on an $800 order, and let us know that the units were off.

Normally, our billing department reviews and catches each error, and will place the order on a hold before invoicing is something is wrong, down the the penny. This morning, they held up an order for 15 cents, but seemed to have missed the $13 million mistake.

My boss had to sit on the phone with IT and many in accounting and my department heard about my mistake, if it was a mistake. The system could have just acted weird on the back end due to the order being entered in grams which is not standard, we think it messed up the conversion table.

I have climbed the ladder from the bottom to where I am now (Asst. PM). I recently moved companies to lose my 1.5hr drive one way, receive a pay increase, and go from Asst. Superintendent to Asst. PM for a smaller GC. The company I work for now lacks management rolls, that I currently fill (Project Manager, Scheduler, Superintendent, Safety Manager, etc.) and it has caused an immense amount of stress on me. After conversations to discuss a change, there will be no change/improvement made. I am now considering where I can take my skills that I have gathered through the years of management, scheduling, many forms of tech, etc. I enjoy commercial construction, but the hours are heavy and the stress is high. But the pay is good. I would be willing to take a pay cut for less stress. I am considering a career change, to something less stressful that will allow me more time at home with my wife and daughter.

TLDR: Construction is stressful and the hours are long, but the money is good. Where can I take my Superintendent/PM skills to possibly change my career?

1af5hvw,Did I Mess Up by Admitting to Forgetting?,"I've had 1 proper employee review since I started my (remote) job where I was told that I worked great but lacked some communication skills. (Forgetting to respond back to messages, not talking enough)
Since then, I managed to get bumped up from associate to assistant and began to cover two properties instead of one. Things have been going alright, but I covered a conference two weeks ago all by myself that left me drained. I basically worked for two weeks straight, as it was over a weekend. Last week was honestly a blur to me; I was burned out completely.
Today, I was brought in to a call because my communication skills have been lacking again and there was a task that ended up taking me too long to do and it affected a coworker last week. I kind of saw it coming but all I could manage to say was that I genuinely forget tasks sometimes.
I think I really fucked up by saying that and am wondering if they're actually going to see if I improve or if I'm just going to be fired. They already said we'll check in again in a week.
I really like this job but have been majorly struggling for the past year or two with untreated adhd on top of family issues. I always get my work done but it takes me what feels like forever to do it; just starting something as small as writing an article feels like pulling teeth for no reason. Since being moved up to working on two properties instead of one, I genuinely forget certain tasks due for the other property when I'm working on one at times.
Again, I'm just really afraid that what I said basically translated to ""they're clearly not capable of this job now"" in their eyes.

1af4cvs,I Got Fired... How Can I Spin It?,"I've been reading a bunch of other similar posts about how to get through the applications & interviews. The overwhelming advice is ""Leave it off your resume,"" ""Don't tell them you were fired"" and/or ""Say you signed an NDA.""

I was working a government job, still in the probationary period, about 8 months in (at 12 months, they can't fire you unless you did something really bad). I didn't especially like the job, but it was a good job, and an excellent stepping stone to the job that I did want. I was doing bi-weekly Personal Improvement Plan meetings with my direct supervisor and my actual boss. One day, instead of having the meeting in my boss's office, I got an email telling me to meet upstairs in HR. They dismissed me. 

In that exit interview they told me that I was a hard worker but it wasn't a good fit. I asked what I could have done to keep the position and they said some things about being late (which was documented among my PIP notes, but I was told previously that I had shown improvement in that area), and not completing my daily/weekly workload (this was in regards to one piece of paperwork which I had asked for help with because I hadn't been trained how to process it yet. Then when I got help, I was told it was done and that I should file it in a drawer with about 200 others, where it got ""lost""). The boss was clearly disappointed to see me leave and looked almost on the verge of tears. My direct supervisor was cold as a stone. 

Interestingly, 2 days before this, I caught some typos in documents that were released to the public and mentioned that people who struggle with basic English should not be typing documents for public  dissemination. My direct supervisor said something to the effect of ""What if I typed that?"" and I thought better than to backtrack my position. I responded with ""Then you should know what areas aren't your strong suit and have someone else who is good at that do it for you."" This was not brought up in the interview with HR.\*

When the job I wanted opened up less than a month later, despite being a shoo-in and knowing the department manager, I did not receive so much as a call back. Just the boilerplate email from HR that someone else had been selected. I'm sure there was a discussion as to why I didn't work there any more and I'm guessing what they told each other is not what I was told.

Now I'm applying for other government positions in different sectors. They require thorough background checks, so I can't just leave this job off my resume, nor can I skip the section that asks if I've ever been fired.

\----------

**TLDR:** What is a good way to phrase that I was let go during a probationary period and they chose not to keep me on permanently without sounding incompetent, uncooperative, or insubordinate/disrespectful? 

&#x200B;

===========================================

\*I still stand by this. If you're the face of your organization, anything you circulate publicly needs to be spotless and above question. If punctuation isn't your area of expertise, hire someone who will catch those typos and have them proofread it for you. If you can't take constructive criticism from a subordinate, maybe you're not suited for a supervisory role.

Credit Karma and Navy Federal have it at right around 630 while Bank of America's FICO score has it around 670. All my income goes to paying down my debt and simply existing. I’m lucky that I don’t have a car payment since my work provides me with a work vehicle that I can use personally. I’m not exactly truly paycheck to paycheck since 10% of my income goes to my 401k but essentially my debt doesn’t feel like it goes down and I’m always out of cash by the time my next paycheck rolls around.  
  
Now here is my current dilemma. I had a company reach out to me to interview me for a position that is a promotion to my current one. I would increase my salary from 90k to 140k and move from Boston to Chicago which is much cheaper to live in ergo making the increase even greater. Rather than a company vehicle, the new company does vehicle stipends as well as reimbursing for work mileage. The role is the logical next step in my career path and the company is very well regarded in my industry as well as Chicago from what I can tell. If I were to get and accept this job (I have one more interview that they’re flying me in for) I would lose my company vehicle from my current role and have to then move halfway across the country for my new job. This is of course not a good combo to have with me having very little available credit, a poor credit score, and non-existent savings.  
  
My question is how would anyone recommend handling this situation or even where to go? I would need to find a vehicle ASAP and then pay for a move and find a new place to live with almost no way to actually afford any of that. The company provides relocation assistance but from how my last job went it’s all retro pay meaning it wouldn’t exactly be useful other than them putting me in a hotel for my first couple weeks of work while I wait for my new paychecks to start. Ideally I can time all of this so that once my last paycheck from my current job comes in, my first paycheck in my new role would come in two weeks later.

Any advice or experiences is vastly appreciated  
  
TLDR: I’m a broke debtor with a can’t miss job opportunity but can’t afford to purchase a vehicle and move across the country for it

1af3xej,Transferred into a new role and hate everything about it,"Hey everyone.  I find myself in a bit of a snafu, and wanted to see what advice you might have for me.

I have been working in HR for the past 6 years, first 3 years as an administrator (entry level) and then I moved into the reporting/analytics space at a new company.  Things were going great, and my company even retained me with a pay raise, title bump, and the ability to work from home indefinitely about a year and a half ago when I secured a new role.  Things were going great for a while, and my CHRO asked if I’d be interested in joining the business intelligence team as a data analyst.  This seemed like a great opportunity as I’d be working with more business wide problem solving, and accepted the internal transition.  This new role didn’t affect my compensation, if that matters at all.

It’s been 2 months since I transitioned into this new role, and I absolutely despise it. It just doesn’t mesh well with my career plan, and I feel so out of water doing it. I don’t have the technical chops to even make sense of it half the time, and am having major regrets at this time. There isn’t much support for this new role either, as I’m with 2 other analysts who have been doing it for a few years and all the training I got was a week course on SQL. It’s even began to affect my mental health, and I’m desperate to go back to my old role.

So that brings us to now - I have a meeting tomorrow  with my old manager who’s also my CHROs right hand man. I’m just going to lay out how I feel about the new job, and ask if there’s still room for me on the old team, along with some new areas to explore if they’d have me.

I guess my question is - what would you guys do in my shoes?",Ih8reposts,1,1.0,0,1706660132,2024-01-31 00:15:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1af3xej/transferred_into_a_new_role_and_hate_everything/,1,2024
1af3sr3,Contemplating quitting,"This is so long, but I’m hoping someone will be able to help 🥹🤞

My current job is taking an immense toll on my mental and physical health. I feel like a shadow of the person I used to be. I joined the company 7 months ago and it was a red flag already when I joined and things just keep getting worse. I like my work itself, but it’s my boss that makes everything so difficult and I can’t ask to work under someone else either. I’m just stuck with him.

I want to walk away, but in this economy it’s a scary decision 

I do have a lot of savings to keep me afloat but I feel like I don’t want to touch them because they are for a rainy day(like if I get unexpectedly fired) or for when I want to buy a house or something. Does this count as a valid enough reason to dip into these savings?

I’m 24 for context. No kids and I don’t pay rent. But I do have a good paying job in the web3 industry. Right now, I’d say I am being paid pretty handsomely for my level of experience especially since I’m not based in the US but I am earning in dollars. It’s hard to find a job that matches my salary being based in Europe. 

I feel like I can’t really “silent quit” because I’ve set a good standard for the way I work and if that changes, my boss will be on my case about it. I’m attached to my job as well, I don’t want to just do the bare minimum because I actually like what I do and want to do well in it. My boss literally makes me cry like every second day (and I work fully remotely!!). I’ve never worked in such a toxic, horrible environment before. 

I guess I’m worried if I will find another role that will pay me the same amount. Since I got this job, I’ve been applying for other jobs because this one has been a red flag since the start. But my applications haven’t gotten me very far, a few interviews here and there but nothing really caught on. (And I work in hiring, so I know my applications are good) 

Or if I take a chance on myself and set up a business, how long will it take to build to a place where I earn what I earn now? Or is the freedom of working for yourself so good that you don’t mind earning a bit less maybe? 

When I meditate on the idea, my mind keeps bringing forward the idea of starting my own business. I already have an idea and have started on it as a side hustle a few weeks ago but I had to put it aside due to how much I’ve been working. It feels like it is something that deserves my full attention rather than a side hustle.  I’ve worked 2 jobs before and worked while studying so I’m not scared to work hard on it. 
 (Without sounding too woo, it almost feels like the universe is showing me signs to quit my job and work on my idea and that’s why I’m not getting any new job offers either) 

I’m looking for advice here, am I being totally stupid to give up my job without another lined up? What is my mental and physical health really worth? Do I take a chance on myself? Any tips to make it more manageable until I do get another job? Is this my quarter life crisis? I’ve been an incredibly hard worker since I left high school, went straight into uni, worked while I studied, then worked 2 jobs, then been a full time remote volunteer with an NGO as well. So my work ethic is there, I’m smart, hungry, ambitious. I’m years ahead in my career than my peers. I see myself as a career woman but now things are looking so blurry because my job is so bad. 

I just don’t even know what to think. My work has me so messed up 😫",Narrow_Distance8190,2,1.0,3,1706659792,2024-01-31 00:09:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1af3sr3/contemplating_quitting/,1,2024

1af36np,"I'm Leaving Teaching, but What's Next? Please Help!","This is my last year teaching. I mean I'm planning to live in my car that's how much I hate it now. This issue is I want to avoid everything that went wrong in my teaching career, but I don't which career is good. This is what I want:

* A job that pays at least 6 figures. The economy is crap and this is new middle class.
* I want to enjoy it to a certain extent and be able to grow in the field. Meaning I want to be able to see my hard work pay off instead of staying stagnant like in teaching. I knew a colleague had been teaching 10+ years and was making the same as me when I first started out. 
* I don't want a lot of student loans. ( I know this one is iffy, it won't be a deal breaker, but I want to avoid it if I can) 

It's not all about money. That's not really why I'm quitting I love kids, but they are getting worse and I can barely afford to live in a two bedroom apartment. There are other factors as well. Long story short I have anxiety everyday going into work and I have fallen into such deep depression. 

I've looked into Business Admin, Finance, HR. But I want to be sure and not waste anymore time. **I'm open to anything.** When I say this it's not brag, but I graduated high school with a 4.3 gpa and AA degree, this is not what imagined my life like. I knew being a teacher will have low pay and to be fair it's never been satisfactory, but I use to love the kids so I stayed. I knew I made difference. I've only been teaching for about 5 years now and it has went dramatically downhill. Also, new laws and regulations have made it impossible to enjoyably teach any kind of history.  I hate everything about it now and I know I'm not going anywhere in this field. 

**So please tell me what you know and your experience in jobs that meet the bullet pointed criteria. I mean really lay it out. Step by step (if you can). The ups and downs. What exactly I have to do. Give me multiple options I beg you! No matter what I'm not doing another year and will probably end homeless because I can't keep living like this.**

as of october, ive been building out a new department, spent a lot of late nights making client websites, taught myself how to make edits and contribute on wikipedia (this is surprisingly more difficult than you’d think) and even wrote a full wikipedia page, i’ve spent hours with our csuite and founder putting everything together (contracts, presentations, messaging, target audience, etc), worked through weekends and have an INSANE turnaround time. we have a press release coming out on friday, but already have 5 clients. ive been doing all of this just to be told today that there isn’t going to be a pay increase for ANY of this, and im the only person in the company who has a grasp on what this whole thing is and how to do it outside of our ceo & our founder, who obviously don’t have the time. 

here’s where i need the advice. im so so so so aware of how valuable the experience of building a department and spearheading it is. i know if i was in a massive company, i realistically wouldn’t get this opportunity - and obviously there is some give and take. i’m still young in my career (24) - so my question is; do i suck it up and take the experience for what its worth and not make a fuss over it? i currently have the 5 clients that nobody else in the company can take and i don’t want to leave anyone hanging - but i feel super disrespected for them to have me doing all this extra work, that nobody else even could do, and expect me to be doing it ON YOP OF MY OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES, for free, when they’re charging clients 5k a month for something i had to teach myself how to do with no company resources. 

is that valid or is this just something im going to have to get used to? i am obviously grateful to not be affected by layoffs - but i have absolutely no idea how to proceed anymore. i’m obviously not going to do anything stupid and just impulsively quit or anything - but is this crazy or just part of life? would love some advice from people who have been in this realm for longer than i have.",ayesquared,1,0.5,12,1706655713,2024-01-30 23:01:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1af286t/im_building_an_entire_new_department_at_my/,1,2024

1) I complete TAFE qualifications at a Diploma level and become a qualified library technician. This would take a year to complete, and gives me plenty of free time to work at my current job (retail). The course requires 70 hours work experience towards the tail end. After the diploma, I’ll have a good qualification to get into a job, and there are a decent amount of openings to get one where I live.

2) I’ve been offered a traineeship position at a library near me. This position lasts two years, which gives me significant work experience, however it gives me a qualification two steps lower than the diploma - a certificate 3. From what I understand, this isn’t accredited by the ALIA (australia’s library association), however I can probably still get a job through experience.

Both options pay roughly the same amount, however I’ll be working full time for the traineeship and only 2 - 3 days a week (alongside studies) for completing the diploma.

My manager routinely blames vendors and consultants for his own actual mistakes in the code. Like literally added some code then blamed the vendor for not telling him exactly what it would do...but really the vendor did, he just didn't understand. 

Then also just blames then over and again saying ""we did it to their best practices specs"" and that's just like nonsense since those specs don't exist anywhere, so no way to verify or not that they were done to best practices. Only evidence is what's there, and what's there is clearly wrong.

The other manager is in analytics, and legit I have no idea how they still have a job. They use metrics like Visits per hour then sum them, and expect to equal the sum of visits for a day...or comparing the wrong date ranges constantly...or my favorite: 

""we can't go forward with this change because this metric went up""  
""Do we know if that's accurate or not?""  
""No but we liked it prior to this date when it was at X""

Further, would future employers know I was laid off? Do I have to tell them if I don't want them to know?

1aezlji,I’m a secretary and want to get hired on,"TL;DR I’m 25, and have a secretary job with virtually 0 responsibilities, and nobody here seems to have the time or interest in me/teaching me about the role I want to obtain for a job with mostly on the job learning 

Apologies if you end up reading this and it comes off a bit dramatic and whiney, I’m writing it at work feeling bad about it at the moment lol.

 My best friends dad works at a very prestigious company, doing a very prestigious job and makes a living that reflects that. He’s always said that when I grew up if I was interested he could throw my name around at work. For a while going through school I was looking into what he did and found it really high level and intimidating. When I finally graduated, he told me he could probably get me an interview for one of the positions, which sounded insane to me, because according to the internet, the job has very demanding requirements and preferred qualifications etc. I suppose if you know someone, that changes, and this was my first real life example of that. Anyway, I did end up interviewing for this position, and I felt like a fool the entire time I was in the interview. I got a business degree with fairly uninspiring grades, and I have no real job experience. All that insecurity probably shown through, and I did not get that job. But my friends dad ended up getting me another one for a slightly lower level job, in which I felt similarly and performed similarly- no job. Finally, he asked me if I would be willing to interview for a front desk position in the office. He sounded sheepish offering it to me as if it was below me or something which I thought was funny, and of course said I’d love to. I interviewed, got the job, and started in July of last year making more somehow than I did at my sales job at a phone store. In this job, my friends dad told me to talk to people and try to learn from them etc. He hasn’t been in this office for some time since he was transferred to another city, so I haven’t been able to lean on him. Additionally, my cities office is being slowly closed down. It’s a giant office with maybe 15 people in it, most of whom work remotely half the time. I’ve now been here for 7 months or so, and I have not been able to get any traction here. Everyone is really nice, but don’t have the time/interest to teach me or spend time with me. It has been a real struggle because I don’t have hardly any responsibilities here because of the shrinking office, and I can’t see any clear path to impressing or learning since I’m mostly unused. I’m terrified every day that I’ll be fired once they find out how much they’re paying me for how little work I’m doing and I’m terrified this colossal opportunity will go up in smoke when this front desk office job is done with, leaving me with a year or so of useless experience on my resume. I should also mention that I’ve wanted to do some self teaching for the role, but it’s so incredibly obscure, that not only can I find next to no information about the job itself, but the people I’ve talked to here said the only way they ever learned was doing the job/working in the field. It just feels like I’m stuck in some bizarre paradox or purgatory.  

Am I being driven paranoid/crazy by the lack of responsibilities and I should just be patient, or is there really concern here/things I should be doing to better my situation here. 

Forgot to mention this, the most concerning part is that everyone here I’ve met asks me the same thing, “so are you just here as in between type of job, or do you have an interest in making a career here?” And I always emphatically express my interest in a career only for them to give me the “that’s awesome, well I’ll let you know sometime if I have something for you!”

1aezfm4,Job search automation tactics?,"Hello all,  
I'm trying to leverage different source of passive job hunting to supplement my active hunting. Has anyone managed to come up with some kind of hack / automation for searching and applying to job offers?  
My problem lies not much in finding offers (I have plenty of notifiers here and there), but in how many offers I can physically manage to apply to per day, to make up for decent numbers statistically given the average job search funnel.  
I'm not a programmer or a hacker by any means, I can talk tech but have no coding skills at all. So I'd like to summon you geeky guys here to brainstorm possible hacks. Some ideas off the top of my mind are:  
\- Is there maybe a way to automate at least ""eays applies"" on Linkedin? Ex. via stuff like Zapier / Python libraries or any other kind of similar software? Did anyone create some kind of similar service or can guide me towards building it?  
\- Are there any AI solutions on the market to help with this?  
\- Reverting to human-driven solutions: is it maybe better to just hire a freelancer / virtual assistant, give him a specific goal and just have him apply away at tons of stuff? If so, does any specific service of such kind exist?  
Curious to hear about your ideas and/or solutions. Thanks!",rizlobber,1,1.0,2,1706648961,2024-01-30 21:09:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aezfm4/job_search_automation_tactics/,1,2024
1aezb8s,35f. Looking to shift my career into graphic design or UI. Desperate to untangle my confusion about next steps.,"Currently, I work in the field of instructional design. I'm very unhappy with this role. I'm unsure if it's just my team culture that is so repulsive or the field itself. I have been in my role for almost 3 years. I mostly produce video for my team as this is part of my professional background. 


I had a very traumatic childhood full of abuse. I left home at 18 and had to fend for myself. I'm a creative person and when i got more on my feet a few years later, i elected to go to art trade schools instead of college for a degree. This feels worth mentioning because i struggle with immense regret for not getting a degree when i was younger and instead being in a survival mode mentality.

I've jumped back and forth between entrepreneurship and odd jobs. 

It's also worth mentioning I'm neurodivergent, i have a hard time processing through this kind of stuff and figuring out my next steps. 
I feel pulled towards increasing my visual design skills. I'm absolutely lost though. Here's what I'm trying to sort through:

1. Graphic Design or UI?  
2. Boot camp or degree? I don't have any credits. The idea of taking gen-ed classes makes me want to cry. I don't have time in my life to invest in things that don't interest me. I have a learning disability with math. I am completely uninterested in taking these kinds of classes. Also if i do a 4 year bachelors degree in design i will be 39 when i get out of school. I don't want to be launching my career then. I want to be launching my new career by like the end of this year.  
3. I can't imagine taking out student loans!!!!  

I feel like a stupid child and i can't believe im finding myself in this position at my age. I feel i have regressed in my development because of how stuck i feel in my career. I'm deeply unhappy and i need so much guidance and support in untangling all of this. I'm ready to do the work and take the next steps to improving my circumstances but *i don't know what the next steps are*. I'm going crazy. I do so much research and i will feel like I've figured something out and cracked it, but then i come across something completely contradictory and it destabilizes me. 

My current vision is to have a side business selling my own illustrations and designs (low expectations- just a creative outlet!) while working for a supportive company in a healthy environment either in graphic design or UI.",youseamstressed,2,1.0,7,1706648657,2024-01-30 21:04:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aezb8s/35f_looking_to_shift_my_career_into_graphic/,1,2024

1aez4f8,Any advice in which direction I could potential go..,"I would like to get some career advice from all of you.

I (F33) am currently working as a paralegal, been doing this for almost 5 years now. I moved to Canada from Europe and this was the first job I landed in with having no legal experience in my own country at all. I used to work on the accounting department before or did just all-round administrative office work. 

I love my job mainly because I have great bosses but this is not what I would like to do for the rest of my life. I currently make around the 85k a year which I am happy with and hope to stay in that range.

I love working with excel and creating overviews of data etc. So I was thinking Data Analyst, but I am afraid I am too late to the game with the whole AI coming up.

1aeyyss,Am I being taken advantage of at my job and in my job description and duties?,"I am a school district employee who happens to be in a pretty unique position… to say the least. I technically work for 2 Departments. The Technology Department and the Department of the school district’s Events Center whose name will be kept a secret for my sake. 

My legal job title is Audio/Visual Technician. The job’s Qualifications, Experience, Responsibilities, doesn’t ~really~ align with what I actually do. 

So since my school district also happens to own an Events Center, I and along with another coworker, work as the Event Center’s A/V Technicians. I am pretty much the “Lead” Tech since my coworker just started working here since July 2023 and I’ve been at this job since December 2021. We operate just like any other Events Center, Sports Stadium or Concert Venue, having hosted and worked many Conferences with pretty well-known/famous people. We host Basketball and Volleyball playoff games yearly, and we have hosted big-name artists whose fame at the time was not near as big as it was now. 

All that being said, I act as the Liaison between the Events Center and the Technology Department. At our Events Center, I work with Daktronics Equipment regularly - we actually just got a new Jumbotron last year. I maintain and operate our new Digital Signage system that advertises Upcoming Events, Sponsors, messages, etc. I am also in charge of our Road Sign Marquee outside. That being said, I often work in Photoshop. I also am the house Audio Engineer - which is what my background is from. Live Mixing is done in my job quite a lot especially with the sports games and Graduation ceremonies that we host every year. Mind you, at any other Venue or Center, all of these duties would each be carried out by people specifically working in just that. I’m having to wear multiple hats all the time at the Events Center.

My coworker and I switch between weeks - One of us at the Technology Center for the week. The other will be at the Events Center for the week. We do this since both departments want equal and fair amounts of our time at both departments. Plus, my coworker and I only have 1 Van between us two so work-flow effort would suck since we’d basically have to tag-team all the time if we were to be at the Technology Center together. 

 ANOTHER part of my job is I have completely different responsibilities at my Technology Center when I go work there for the week. We basically just work on Tickets/Service Requests and work on TVs, Projectors, wall plate installations/replacements, Fiber Optic cable, at all of our schools (Elementary, Middle and High), and Administration buildings on our week at the Technology Center. In essence, I have always felt like I am working 2 different jobs at 2 different places for just 1 salary. 

Both departments win in this case since I assume they evenly split paying my salary. Here’s the thing too, I am an hourly employee, making just $26/hour. For all that I do, are they realistically paying me fairly? Should I ask for a title change and job description change in hopes I could make more? I contacted our HR department about 6 months ago around time when it was due that we were all getting a 1% raise (hooray…), and asked if we could discuss my pay based on the market rate. At the time I was making $21.50/hour, I started my job at $20.48/hour.  The very first email they responded to me, was with a surprisingly great message stating that the district’s pay for me in my hourly rate was well-below the market rate. So they adjusted my pay to reflect being AT the market rate to $26/hour, effortlessly… Could I have asked for backpay? Is it maybe too late to ask for backpay? Could I have asked for more? 

In the grand scheme of things, what do you guys think I should do?",_thatunodude_,1,1.0,2,1706647800,2024-01-30 20:50:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aeyyss/am_i_being_taken_advantage_of_at_my_job_and_in_my/,1,2024

1aewywq,Should I stay in Germany or go back to the Philippines?,"Hi! I’m 27 years old female. I live in Germany for a year now under a volunteer visa. My contract will end in December 2024. Now, I’m in dilemma if I should stay here or should I just go back to the Philippines ? 

Background about me, I’m a virtual accountant in my home country. I earned a decent amount of income way back home but I’m feeling so empty and longing for something more. I honestly don’t like accounting that is why I decided to pursue something different in Germany.

Fast forward to 2022, I found a program called au pair. A cultural exchange program in EU. Since, I desperately want to change my life and experience something different, I took this program and found a host family in Germany. I left my accounting job but now I am not earning enough here. I only received allowance of 280€ a month. After a year as an au pair, I’m doing a volunteer service in the kindergarten earning only 400€ a month. This is fine with me. Since this is my way to learn more about the language and its culture. But the problem is that, my contract as a volunteer will end in December 2024 and I have to think of other options to stay longer here in Germany. I want to stay longer here. 

I’m thinking of applying for university or ausbildung that is completely not related to my previous degree in accounting. Since I want to change my career totally. 

But I’m getting tired now. I don’t even know if I’ll be able to find my way here. I don’t know what I want to do with my life to be honest. I just went here to pursue on something I don’t know. The only thing I know is that I don’t like to work in accounting anymore. But I’m turning 28 this year and I feel like I have not accomplished anything yet. I don’t know if I should continue pursuing a life here in Germany or should I just go back to my home.",Significant-Cut7268,1,0.5,1,1706642919,2024-01-30 19:28:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aewywq/should_i_stay_in_germany_or_go_back_to_the/,1,2024
1aeww2o,Musician - Marketing pipeline?,"Hi everyone,  
Thank you in advance for reading this post, let me give you a little information about myself first.  
I am a 25-year-old woman, currently working as a catering assistant. I chose this as a way to make ends meet while I figured out my path. I graduated from college with a BA in Popular Music, and I consider myself a singer/songwriter - this is something I love more than anything. However, unfortunately for me, that tends to not be a great money-maker.  
To tackle this, I have been trying to carve a new path that keeps me somewhat in the music industry, researching different areas that I am interested in that still allow me to nurture that creative side of my brain. I feel a little lost with this, unsure of the best way to tackle it.  
One of my biggest goals in life is to travel. I have yet to move abroad and I am itching to do so. I also enjoy and value education. In that sense, I would like to return to university and earn a Master's degree, it would also be an excuse to move abroad for a year or so and have a purpose in doing so. However, the fields taking my interest right now are all within the 'marketing' bracket (PR, A&R etc). I have been advised that a master's degree will not be of much use to me in this field, but I'm not sure if that is entirely true for me. Sure, I know that I could push myself to get out there and get working, and maybe that is the best option, but as someone who needs structure and has no prior marketing experience, I can't help but think furthering my education would be beneficial. Maybe there is another way to get my feet off the ground here, but I simply don't know enough to know what that is.  
I suppose, I am asking for some real, honest advice here. Am I wasting my time looking at pursuing further education in these fields? I graduated from my undergrad with a First Class Honours (Ireland), so would it be worth my time looking into a PHD instead? My biggest fear is that I'll dip my toe into this and realise it simply isn't for me and have wasted tonnes of money, but considering that I am 25 and soon to be 26, I just feel like I need to make a decision and try something. I can't continue to be stuck in my current dead-end job. Free-lance also isn't an option for me, I simply don't think I have the motivation to create my own structure like that - maybe a masters with work experience would be an option here?  
All in all, does anyone have experience in these fields with some knowledge to offer? Or has anyone been on a similar path to me and figured something out that works for them? Any advice or opinions welcome. It's always helpful to hear different perspectives.  
Thank you again if you read this far :)

1aewl3t,Got promoted but am so depressed suddenly,"Hi all I’ve been going through work stress and fear of being laid off for the last 6 months. After a ton of stress and struggling, all the sudden I’m getting promoted and moved to a new team that is perfectly in line with what I want to do.

I was elated at first and so happy—all my fear about being laid off suddenly went away overnight. But a few days after getting the news I feel so incredibly depressed for some reason and TERRIFIED of failing. My friend leads the team and I’m afraid of not doing well enough to make her happy she picked me. I’ve failed under pressure before and now I’m questioning my own competence. I can’t shake the feeling she made a mistake and will “find me out” in time. My confidence and mental health are shredded—maybe it’s just the sustained anxiety for 6 months suddenly coming to the surface? Or maybe it’s that my partner might lose his job and I feel guilty for having this happy news when he’s in pain?

I’m mentally so scattered I’ve been avoiding emails and work, like I’m so depressed I can’t even function normally and I don’t know why it’s affecting me so much now? 

I have until Thursday to fix my mindset and get my confidence back and I don’t know how.

1aew926,Should I apply for internal position?,"I work for a smallish company. We have several branches and I know everyone at the branch I work at. I have been with the company for almost 2 years and I think I’ve done a great job and have received some praise but have yet to be offered a raise or promotion. A job got listed at my branch which would be above my current position. It pays a decent amount more. 

I’ve never been through this process before and I’m not sure how to go about it. Our HR sent out a link to the posting and how to apply. I also talk to our manager regularly and considered texting them first to ask their thoughts on if I should. 

To be clear on the situation: my current manager would still be my manager in this job, this new role would be at the same branch I’m currently at.

1aew3ny,"Ruined my credit, will this effect my Investment Banking internship offer?","Throwaway account for obvious reasons, but here is the situation. over the past 6 months I have ruined my credit score through various different nefarious activities. I am roughly $4,500 in Credit Card debt which represents a 90% usage. I have never missed a single payment and always have paid at least the minimum. I start my IB internship in June, which is 4 months from now and I assume they will do a background check and see my credit. My score was once 750, and now it is more like 600. I have Budgeted and came to the conclusion that at the very least 75% of my debt will be paid off by my start date. How will my credit score be effected by then, will the background check reveal my poor credit? How will they react to seeing this. Beyond this,  I have learned the technical questions inside and out and I know that I would make a fantastic banker, I am a finance nut and know I will do fantastic in the internship come the start date.

1aew0qs,Is it worth while to change careers at this point?,I graduated with a bachelor’s in mechanical engineering back in 2020. I was able to line up a couple of internships while I was in school. By the time I was in my senior year I realized that I do not like working as a mechanical engineer. I decided to just go with it since I was already fishies with school and one of my internships offered me a full time position after graduation. I realized very quickly that I am not as passionate about working in the field as I was about studying the theoretical material in school. My other passions have always been business and tech. I have been thinking about going back to school and ether getting an MBA or a MCS in order to shift my career. One of the biggest struggles for me to make this decision is that I would potentially graduate with a masters degree in ether field and would have to take a pay cut when changing careers. I am 4 years into my mechanical engineering career. I have managed to get a pay increase every year averaging 8%/year. By the time I graduate from a masters program my salary as a mechanical engineer (now project manager) would probably be significantly higher than what I can expect at an entry lever role. Is it too late for me to change careers now? Does it make more sense to just stick to what I’m doing and try to find the silver lining in the great pay?,GalacticGuru19,1,1.0,1,1706640661,2024-01-30 18:51:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aew0qs/is_it_worth_while_to_change_careers_at_this_point/,1,2024

Looking for a little advice here. I have a meeting coming up with my boss about my career goals tomorrow. But I have no idea how to answer that. Obviously to keep making money, and eventually get promoted? The thing is, the company I work for (a credit union) is very supportive when it comes to advancing in your career. At least I think it is. Honestly it seems a little too good to be true. I haven't even started my position yet, only training and shadowing. Is it realistic for them to be encouraging me to shadow/ cross train in other departments at this point? Right now I'm going to be a teller, but eventually I would like to be able to work remotely. I guess I just want to know if anyone has any thoughts or advice on this situation.

1aev8lp,Should I tell my boss that it was my colleagues who complained about him and not me,"Hi everyone,

so, tomorrow is my year in review and I find myself in somwhat of a predicament because of something that happened recently.

I work lab job in a medium sized company (a few thousand employees). The small team I'm in is devided between two locations with 3 of us working at one and the other 3 at the other location. My boss is working at the other location but his boss works at mine. My boss is fairly new to the job (he's been working in the company for about 6 months) and my two colleagues really dislike him. I don't care that much, but I don't think he's as bad as they think.

Last week my two colleagues and me had a meeting with our bosses boss. And of course my two colleagues complained a lot about our boss. And they also said some pretty unfair stuff about him. At least in my view. We were barely our of the door when our bosses boss (who has kind of a temper) called him to talk about this. I am a firm believer that if you have a problem with someone you should try to talk to them first before talking to the higher ups. So I wasn't okay with how the meeting went and I told my colleagues as much. They obviously think that what they did was totally okay.

Fast forward to today. Today was the first time we met our boss since he had the call with his boss. And usually he's super upbeat and positive. But today he seemed super grumpy and in a really bad mood.

So with my year in review coming up tomorrow I'm thinking about telling my boss that it was my colleagues who complained about him. On one hand, I think it could benefit me to let my boss know that he has an ally in me. On the other hand I don't really like ratting out my colleagues and I think it could go quite bad for me if they find out.

How would you handle this situation?

For reference, I don't planning on staying with the company forever. I'm still fairly young and I started working there only a few years ago. Still I don't want to fuck things up with my boss but I also don't want to ruin the work atmosphere and my standing with my colleagues.",curious-goldfish48,1,0.6700000166893005,10,1706638820,2024-01-30 18:20:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aev8lp/should_i_tell_my_boss_that_it_was_my_colleagues/,1,2024

1aeue02,Should I say something?,"Over the past few weeks I have been dealing with a work situation, and I need someone to tell me whether my feelings are valid (and if I should say something), or if I should brush it off and move on. Looking for total honesty here as I could be over reacting.

For background, about two weeks ago my company had layoffs. Thankfully, I was not affected but the person I directly report to for brand #2 was. I now report to the director of brand #2 vs the supervisor. As a result, I was told that my responsibilities would temporarily be taken off the brand #1 that I work on, to make up for the work I would need to cover on the brand #2 where my supervisor was laid off. This was fine, and I told them I am open and willing to picking up her responsibilities now that I would have less focus on brand #1.  

This week brand #1 was having a meeting with client that would require travel. I wasn’t directly told that I wouldn’t be travelling, but it was implied given the circumstances and I was fine with that. A part of me wishes they would have told me directly, but I let it go. However, the day our broader team was scheduled to travel I heard in passing on a meeting that my new boss on brand #2 would be going to said meeting. They also never told me this, and that would just leave me “in office” and there was never any conversation had about what type of coverage would be needed, etc. It also seems a little odd as this person is not a part of brand #1 and hasn’t done any work with those clients. I felt like they should have discussed this with me merely just to let me know I would be alone, as she is my boss. I also question why she would she travel when she has no connection to this brand but I wouldn’t? This isn’t the first time they haven’t been forward thinking about this type of stuff, and given we have a small team AND someone was just laid off, it feels like poor management style. 

Despite the above, I was able to join this in person meeting virtually. Come to find out during a 2023 recap portion of the call, they let another employee who is the equivalent position as me also working on brand #1 present the projects that I lead and executed over the year. Again, I felt blindsided. Despite not being in person and shifting my priorities to brand #2 I would have loved the opportunity to present these to the group. I was never even asked; and although I have a lot on my plate putting together the slides and such would have been a minor ask. Even a heads up would have gone a long way. Am I wrong for feeling this way, or is this just the way it goes?

I feel this comes down to poor management style, and again I don’t know if I’m overreacting. There’s been other minor incidents that lead up to these but the above are the ones that feel the most unprofessional. I am trying to find the balance between feeling resentful, but I also feel like I should stand up for myself?",Humble-Software8093,2,1.0,2,1706636767,2024-01-30 17:46:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aeue02/should_i_say_something/,1,2024
1aeu1lc,Going on a PIP tomorrow. Will be terminated after. Resign or get fired?,"I was warned by my boss last week that my performance rating has been flagged as unsatisfactory and I will be put on a PIP tomorrow. Candidly, he told me that I will almost certainly be fired at the end of it.

He has hinted multiple times that I should resign in order to keep a termination off of my record. I've done lots of research on this, much of it from this sub, and I have some questions.

I live in MO, and according to state labor law, a former employer can disclose reason for leaving among other things to any prospective employer. So, if I get fired, they can tell potential new jobs about it and hamstring me.

I also have 3 weeks of PTO accrued, but can find nothing in company policy or MO law that states they would need to pay it out to me.

I also have been unable to locate my employment contract. I don't even know if I signed/ have one.

If the aforementioned points were not true, I would say it is 100% better to just get fired. However, it looks like the only ""benefits"" to that are that I'll get paid during my PIP and may be eligible for UEI. However, I work for a massive corporation and suspect they would contest it.

So, what should I do? I don't want me getting fired to screw me out of future jobs, but I also don't want to forfeit a month of pay.",oneilmatt,597,0.9200000166893005,1129,1706635915,2024-01-30 17:31:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aeu1lc/going_on_a_pip_tomorrow_will_be_terminated_after/,1,2024

1aes8qt,How soon is too soon to ask about benefits details for a job?,"I have a couple of interviews coming up, and these first interviews will be meetings with a recruiter of the company. The jobs I am applying for will be more of a lateral move in my career where Im looking for just similar pay in a different role/industry. So higher pay isnt really a priority.

What I am most concerned with right now is benefits & work life balance, and it is a huge determining factor. Right now I have really good benefits that basically fully cover the cost of some specific health issues in my family, costs that could be a financial burden if benefits weren't that good. And I have really good work-life balance; I only go into the office 1 or 2 times a week and our paternity leave is really good (expecting to have another kid in future).

My question is, how soon do you guys think I can ask about details of benefits/work-life? Since it is such a huge part of my decision, I wouldnt want to get through interview rounds just at the end to find out that the benefits are not great or that details of paternity leave option are a lot worse. I feel like it would be a waste of their time and mine because it would definitely make me not take the job.

1aerxvf,Looking for a career change,"Hi, I currently work for my state natural resources agency doing exciting and interesting conservation projects. Think: big land acquisition projects. I’m working for the state bc I am pursuing the public service loan forgiveness program on my debt from law school. I’ve been working for the state for 6 years so I have 4 years left and my loans will be forgiven.  I passed the bar and am licensed but I’ve never had a client. 

I’ll be 40 in a few years and really want to spend my 40s making money. We have two little kids, a small home, total household income is about 100$k annually. Which is good money, but we work a lot and still just sorta get by. 

I’m trying to lay the groundwork to leave state service after my loans are forgiven. But I’m not sure what to do next. The obvious move would be to join a law firm, but I’m not sure I want to go that traditional route. 

State service is great but the earning potential just isn’t there. If I stay with the state and keep at if for a few more decades I might get up to $100k annually. Again, nothing to sneeze at but not huge. Benefits and retirement are very nice. 

Should I make a linked in profile and see if I can get head hunted? Is that how that works? Also thinking about possible career options at: universities, lobbying firms, environmental consulting.

I feel dumb asking this but how do I become a more teachable person? I feel like I have tried to listen and ask questions but I guess whatever I am doing to try and work on this isn’t helping.

1aeq6nl,Take the promotion when you're ready,"I've learned a very valuable lesson over my professional life that I think is worth sharing. You, above all others, should recognize when you're ready for a promotion (or not).

In my previous role my manager stated that I would be promoted in 7 months (I was given a specific time) assuming I was able to take over a few duties successfully on my own after the last person was let go. Each month I would give my progress and ask for feedback during my one-on-one meetings with my manager and was given praise every time. 2 months prior to the date I was told I had met all the requirements and should see a promotion soon. I stayed patient for another 3 months when I asked about the promotion and was told that ""Yes you had met all the requirements but the timing isn't great, you **might** be eligible this time next year"" and mentioned that I should try and master a few different ""Key areas"" prior to that promotion. Keep in mind I had already taken over the duties required and had trained myself to be performing at the next level.

Shortly after I left that company and now work at the level of the promotion I was promised and couldn't be happier. Promises and promotions are a two-way street. While you need to make sure that you hold your end of the bargain by meeting those requirements, the employer should also reward you for a duties you take over and proficiencies that you now possess. If you truly feel that you're performing at the next level and your employer isn't seeing it, chances are that there is another employer that will see it.

The only person truly looking after you in the professional world is you. Good luck out there.",Siidewinder,3,1.0,5,1706626351,2024-01-30 14:52:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aeq6nl/take_the_promotion_when_youre_ready/,1,2024

I graduated from undergraduation back in 2018 but since then I haven't had a decent job till date. I've mostly been living with my parents and have had to work for meager wages in different roles.

I started out as a fresher in Digital Marketing back in 2019, worked at it for about 6 months and then moved ahead to Bangalore for another low paying job in 2020. But due to COVID i had to come back to Chandigarh. Then i didn't have much to do for the longest time, although i joined this fellowship program that also had a PG certificate attached to it in rural enterprise management and social entrepreneurship based out of Ladakh. During my time there i also interned at the Himalayan Film House where I worked with an internationally acclaimed environmental filmmaker on a documentary project. 

While i was involved there i made a connection at a startup incubation center at IIT Mandi in Himachal. I worked there for about 18 months but the place, the people, and some kind of frustration got to me.
I quit last year and started my own creative agency where i provide digital marketing and content creation services. 

Now I'm working with one or two odd business, helping them with their content on social media feeds and conducting photo and video shoots with them.

But off lately I've been losing all assurance in my choices. I set out on my own venture to be able to become a filmmaker but I think I should reconsider my decision and just find a job that I can find stability in.

This surely feel like a big failure for me but seems like it's more important to earn a living than chase a dream.

1aemevh,Should I apply to a company that's not in good terms with my current one?,"I've been in my current job for more than a year.
For some context, it's space industry and I'm an engineer in a startup. In Europe, space is a small circle so most people know each other, especially in startups.
 
I'd like to think that I've been doing a good job so far, but for the past few months I've been very unhappy. First, I'm underpaid. When they hired me they promised a fast increase in income if I delivered. One year later, they decide not to give anyone raises. I talked to my boss and expressed my disappointment since they're not keeping their promise. I'm also not happy with the management because even though we're a small startup that can't afford to give anyone any raise, they hired a guy whose only job is to be a boss, and they pay him 3x my salary. Lots of employees are unhappy and looking at other options. I'd also say that it's not the most ideal position I'd like to work in. In the beginning it was good but now the exiting projects are over and I'm not doing anything I like to do.

So I've been casually applying to other jobs and they've been negative so far. Few weeks ago I've seen a job opening by a company whose founders have beef with my current company's. They're not direct competitors but I guess they were almost going to be, but then the other company took a different direction. Yet they hate each other. 

The position itself is much more exciting. The location is better too, it's in a beautiful city with a lot more opportunities. I don't know how much they pay but I'm sure I can increase my salary at least 20-30% by jumping ship. I'm only concerned because I don't trust them enough (no particular reason I just don't) to not tell my current boss that I applied to them. This would make things more difficult for me as a foreigner holding onto a work visa in Europe and can't afford being jobless. Well good thing is there's a 3 month notice period and it's very hard to fire someone.

It's also not allowed to work for a company that can be deemed as a competitor per my contract, but they'll have to pay me 6 months of pay upfront and I can go look for a different job if that happens.

I guess I'm overthinking about this but I'm a bit lost and bummed out due to being rejected a couple of times in a row.

1aemb0x,Last chance to make something of myself?,"Hi folks,

Bit of background

28m in UK, have a bachelors in music (first class) with a particular focus on a very relevant technology and how that could be used to structure business models within the music industry - this tech is now being used in tech companies, along with artificial intelligence. I've worked different jobs before and after graduation: operations focused role, sales roles, business development, market research, however disliked all of them. Currently work in an account manager role earning £35k and absolutely hate it. I find the work menial and not intellectually stimulating, to the point that I get so frustrated with myself that I'm sitting in an office doing this job (understand this may be ADHD, however I haven't been diagnosed). I'm often thinking the grass is greener and yearn for stability, both financially and general career path, in something that interests me. My current UK city is where I came for uni, and I recently broke up with my girlfriend before Christmas, so don't feel like there's anything keeping me here. I'm quite lonely if I'm honest. Have 16k in a LISA and have 4k in general savings.

Moving forward

I applied to a graduate program for a large management consulting firm who work in the aforementioned technology sphere and got the job. It doesn't start until summer 2024 and it's in a different city to where I am now. I'll be taking a paycut to around 34k euros, however I've seen through evidence that promotion is yearly and so is increase in salary - I also know a senior consultant there who confirms this. When I think of the years working after graduation, I've had no idea what to do, however, I've always wanted to be in some sort of consulting in something I enjoy, and I often dream of being able to rectify business challenges through the use of tech, and become an absolute expert in a particular field, solving problems for different businesses, in different sectors. This is something that I haven't found in the jobs I've held or industries I've already dabbled in and I know that working in various different industries, which this company does, would cure my thirst for knowledge and the world around me. 

Apprehension

I'm really reluctant to take this job (even though I know I'll regret it if I don't) due to having to start at entry level, in a city where the cost of living in so high, and where I don't know anyone. I know it may sound like I'm having a third life crisis but I feel so inferior that I'm this age and don't have a girlfriend, am renting on my own now, and will be renting alone in this new city, without being able to save. I've never had an issue with finding girlfriends or one night stands, however now that I'm older, I want that stability and for ME to feel like I'm worthy of handling a family etc etc. I feel embarrassed telling people what I do because I loathe the industry, what I do on a daily basis, and just know it's not me, as if I'm not where I want to be and I know it deep down. I just don't know how to get to a place where I live a normal life. I feel like maybe putting in two/three years of graft to this new job would have me on a brilliant path, both for myself and for future prospects. 

Thoughts

I have been thinking of leaving my current job and going travelling for a while on my own - this is something I didn't do whilst growing up and although the thought of 'finding myself' isn't something I think will definitely happen, I know I need time on my own to think and to plan my next steps - I'm actually miserable and dread getting up everyday for work. Maybe part of this is because I haven't had time to regather after the relationship ended - I started a new job and moved into a new flat to get out of our flat together. 

I know it's quite an extensive overview of where I'm at but I honestly need some advice about what to do here. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Cheers

It feels crazy, since I worked for so long to get the type of job title I have, but now I just want something with better pay and healthier hours.  Is it crazy to call myself a “marketing director” instead of the Chief Marketing Officer. Just an “editor” instead of an “editor-in-chief..””

1aej4n6,"Made redundant, lost and a bit confused where to go next...","Hey all, I thought I'd reach out because honestly I am at a loss. And forgive me if this isn't the right place to dump all of this - I rarely interact even on my main account.  


Firstly a bit of background. I am a single 36 year old Australian male, who graduated university (sociology with honors), who has been working in Learning and Development  as a lead and as a Business Operations Manager for the last ten years or so. I've moved up in the industry from being a clerk through to operations management, I tend to stay at jobs for a long time by today's standards (five years average) with only one or two exceptions where the employer was not the right fit.   


As of tomorrow I will no longer have a job due to company restructuring, and I do not have one lined up. I will receive a redundancy package, but it isn't much. Enough to cover my expenses for a couple of months, but it certainly isn't enough to invest. Thankfully I own my own home outright, so I am not paying rent.     


So how does this fit into career advice? Well I am so tired and burned out from the Human Resources industry, and Learning and Development in particular. I have no motivation to work in that space any more, and I feel like I want to do something more physical or creative with my time up to and including re-training as a mature age apprentice. I am physically fit, but I feel like employers won't be interested in my application for these types of roles due to my age. I don't really know what I want out of my career anymore, and the idea of applying for dozens of jobs at this point to only end up back in HR in some form or another is borderline depressing.   


I guess what I am asking for is some kind of outside perspective, or reassurance that changing my career (even drastically) at this stage of my life isn't the failure I kind of perceive it to be, or some idea of what or how to implement these general ideas on where I want to go with things.   


Thanks.

1aeikoe,Moving On from Reddit: My Journey to Skool,"Hello fellow Redditors,  
After much thought and contemplation, I've decided to share some news with this community: I am moving away from Reddit and transitioning to a platform called Skool. This decision wasn't easy, but it's a step I feel is necessary for my personal and professional growth.  
Firstly, I want to express my gratitude to the Reddit community. Over the years, I've learned so much, laughed, and connected with many incredible people here. The diverse opinions, deep discussions, and even the memes have been a significant part of my daily life.  
However, I've recently felt the need for a change. My interests and goals are evolving, and I believe [Skool](https://www.skool.com/games?ref=56d8fc4eb3bf417fb17294585bf14424) aligns more closely with this new direction. [Skool](https://www.skool.com/games?ref=56d8fc4eb3bf417fb17294585bf14424) offers a focused environment that seems better suited for the type of engagement and learning I'm looking for right now.  
It's not about Reddit lacking anything; it's about me finding a platform that resonates more with my current phase of life. On [Skool](https://www.skool.com/games?ref=56d8fc4eb3bf417fb17294585bf14424), I'm excited about the opportunity to engage in more structured and in-depth discussions and to connect with a community that shares my specific interests and professional aspirations.

1aeiaxs,Career change advice - Fintech,"Hi everyone,

Seeking advice on a career path. I'm a 28F currently working as a sales manager for a small student accommodation/property company in Sydney (less than 30 staff). I've got 4 years in the industry.

I just got a job offer for an account manager role in a fintech startup (1500 staff global, US-based), WFH. The base salary is 100k (10k more than my current job, but with a slightly lower bonus (10% versus 16%)

My concern is, the fintech role is a senior associate position, whereas my current job involves more team management responsibilities. Reasons I want to leave my current role: not very exciting culture, no perks, lack of good leadership, no WFH…

Wondering if the career path in fintech/account management is worth the trade-off in title and seniority. Any insights from those experienced in fintech/account manager roles? And for anyone who has successfully transitioned into a new career, what are the things you would take into consideration when accepting a new job? 

Thanks a lot. ",crankybeets,1,1.0,1,1706597648,2024-01-30 06:54:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1aeiaxs/career_change_advice_fintech/,1,2024
1aehjy0,Have you ever quit a great job you hate to do something to you love?,"I (24M) am a business analyst, work in tech, and want to become a data engineer. I’ve been at my current company for ~3 years and make ~$75k.
Work life balance has waned as hours have crept to be upwards of 9-12 hours/day, including some weekends and holidays. It’s clear there won’t be opportunities to advance where I’m at today.

I’m thinking about quitting later this year to:
1. Take a less lucrative job in an a role and industry I love (~$20/hr)
2. Continue learning and building portfolio of projects and return to data/tech in ~1 year or less

My thoughts are: if I’m pretty miserable in my current office job, am no longer able to learn or do the things Im most interested in, and have been roadblocked to advancing, why not take the leap? Financially, my partner makes enough to cover all our base expenses and I’ll still be working, just making less for a time. Our lifestyle won’t meaningfully change, but we won’t be able to save as much. Im young and have no kids yet, so a risk like this feels more palatable.

Have you ever considered doing something like this? Did you do it? How’d it pan out?

1aehabf,"Got a job offer and waiting on another, should I accept and continue interviewing with the other?","Houston, TX

After 8 months of job searching since graduating in May, I received an offer from a one of the bigger health institutions for Business Ops this morning. They want an answer by this Wednesday and will not give me an extension. Job is 50k a year and is currently 15min from my current home. Apparently friend works in the team I am interviewing to work with says health benefits are great and 2 remote days/month with a lax 8-5 schedule. (Come in 8-9am leave 4-5pm) 
Projected to start Feb 12th

I’m also in the process of waiting for a second round interview with one of the top energy companies in the city (I have a friend referral who’s updated me that the hiring manager/her supervisor liked my first interview and plans to schedule a panel interview with me) I have no direct experience in this field but my transferable skills have made me a strong candidate apparently. (Two openings and so far for second round, it’s me and another person who also graduated in May but has no work experience but I do) Salary is 65-75k with bonuses and is 15 minutes from my mom’s house. 10 days in office, 10 days wfm per month. 

Essentially, I plan to accept the Healthcare role since the deadline to accept is Jan 31st, but on the chance that the energy company offers me a the position before feb 12th, I would have the decision to either stay with the original health care role or quit that role before I even started to work for the energy company

I have had really bad luck picking jobs most of my career and just picked the best offer that came my way on the rare chance that one did. I am not happy with my current work environment 5 months in and I am already planning on jumping due to environment/culture fit. 

I understand the basics of what most of the applications can do and how they are run already, but we can't touch them due to red tape and regulations setup by the government. I can only run scripts, I can't alter them or make them better in anyway. I feel really restricted here and anxious that I am not learning anything anymore besides for those first few months.

I’m a new hire and I don’t think I’m a good fit for the role. Problem is, I’m sure a lot of strings were pulled behind the scenes to make my hiring happen so it’s going to come across like a slap in the face. I don’t want to leave the team high and dry so I wanted to give my team notice that I’d be leaving in 3 months. Is there any way that I can ask the company to allow me to stay for 3-4 months to build up a savings or is there no chance of that happening?

It’s a critical position, like a high potential type of position that most would dream of. The other issue is I’m basically holding the seat, which means they can’t put other very qualified candidates in there.

(My plan is) I wrote my boss a letter basically saying I’d like to resign at the end of April and will continue to bust my tail until then, but I wasn’t sure if that’d feel like a slap in the face for them. I wanted to show that I was incredibly grateful but wasn’t sure that’d be enough.

Now some details on the person who handled this contract before me. They have 30 years of experience in the industry, and he goes well & beyond our typical scope of work for this client. Think of someone who is trained in working on Hondas & Toyotas, now being expected to work on airplanes. He has spent the last 15 years with this client, building relationships & fixing just about anything they ask for. 

I’m always up for a challenge & get excited to learn something new, but my hesitation with this decision is that this client is now accustomed to this guy & his capabilities & now if I can’t do most of the things the ask of me strictly because I am not nearly as experienced as the previous guy and haven’t been able to learn everything yet, what happens if they get annoyed and end up dropping my company as their service provider? Does that somehow fall on me?

I have a meeting scheduled to allow me to express my concerns with the person who made this decision & I’m looking for some guidance on how to handle this correctly. I don’t want to make it seem like I’m not willing to put in extra work, or rise to a challenge. I feel like I have some legitimate concerns.

1aeeflf,Aerospace Student: Archaeology Dreams,"I'll keep it brief. I'm a student at a good university studying aerospace engineering, this was my plan since I first found out about the discipline because, at the time, I found it pretty cool - at least cooler than everything else that paid so generously.

Really, though, I was obsessed with all things to do with the deep past - obsessed with the neolithic revolution, with different material cultures, with population genetics, with linguistics. Sadly, that discipline, I thought, didn't pay well enough considering my primary goal was and is to retire my parents. I also thought the fascination would blow over like it did previously for space and gaming. The thing is, though, it just didn't.

I'm 22 now and I'm as obsessed as I am as I ever was. I sink way too much of my time into the discipline to the point it is affecting my studies. It's something I could see myself committing the rest of my life to with a smile on my face.

Somehow, it is only now that I thought of somehow merging these two interest, if possible.

1aecfqn,Should I Master in Math or Atmospheric Science?,"Should I master in Mathematics or Atmospheric Sciene? I'm a Physics graduate who's deciding between these two Master's programs, and I don't know which one to chose from. Both have their pros and cons to me. I'll lay them out, and you guys can give your opinion:

Pros for Atmos Sci
*Opens doors to various science-related fields for me(Environmental, NASA, agriculture, airlines)

* Incorporates math, as well as physics and chemistry (I learn more about other subjects)

* Job market is pretty chill. I won't have as much competition as engineering, computer science, medicine

* They'll ALWAYS need atmospheric scientists & meteorologist, so never out of a job (unemployment is really low, I hear)


Cons for Atmos Sci

* I've lost interest in it. I've had it ever since I was young, but not anymore

* I'm actually AVERSE to learning anything about meteorology. I think I only liked it for the aesthetic & the way the clouds look. I take photos, but that's it. (i.e. my parents bought me a weather book when I was young, and I never read it)

* Outside of science-related matters, there's no other utility. You don't need to look at the forecast to work in finance, medicine, etc

* I. HATE. LABS. Like, REALLY. No matter what science I learned, I never liked labs. 

*I also don't care for research, tbh.

* I hate outdoor labs too.


Pros Math

* You could apply it to ANY field (science, health, finance, engineering, even art)
* I like working out math problems, even when I was young.
*NO LABS 

*Job market is good
* Not sure about employment rate though

Cons Math

* Too broad
*I like science enough to where I would probably have a job in it (which is why I'm still considering Atmos Sci). But unfortunately, I hear math master's often work in finance or something unrelated to it.
*When it gets to higer level math (where you start seeing new greek letters like epsilon, psi, lowercase delta), IDK what's going on, tbh
*Piggy backing off of the last thing, unless math is applied to a real-world scenario, idk what's going on. That's where math got difficult to learn for me. It was like learning a language that you never saw anyone speak or hear.

I absolutely, positively dread the office environment. I have pushed myself for so long to stay in it for the money, or the ""prestige"", or whatever. I am not so sure about my motivation anymore. 
Anyhow, I think I will not be able to cope longer with this. How has left an office environment, in which job did you initially start, what did you switch to and how do you feel today?

1aebvku,Is it legal to fake offer letter for a raise?,"I’m very curious if there is any legality to faking a offer letter from another company in order to increase my salary at a company I am happy at. 

I am 23, in construction as a pm / Estimator.  I make 60k but after row years of working there I really enjoy the work but the pay is not great, and form what I’ve seen at other from the company, they are not really willing to give raises above the standard 3-5 %. 

I am very happy at the job but really need to be making more. Other company’s would pay about $70-75k but I don’t want to go through the interview process especially since the company’s I would eventually go to we do business with. 

I was wondering if I should / can fabricate an offer from a fake or further away company to match what I would ideally make. I’d assume getting an offer in hand is the only way to get the money I’d like. I really don’t wanna leave but we work for money so I can cut myself short for a job I like this early on.

1aeb5ro,I get to choose my title and want opinions,"I am in an interesting situation where my new position in the company I work for can be chosen. I work at a start up and pretty much have had my hands in every pie here for the last three years. My current role is “Category Manager” but I wanted to move towards product development and found this new position to be a stepping stone.  I applied for a new role “Packaging Design & Development Manager” my VP said I will also be sourcing and helping out with product development and said I could also be called “Packaging & Sourcing Manager”. 

Which one would be better on a resume and would allow me more growth in the product development profession? I would love to be a product manager or director of product one day. I know the title with development in it is probably the way to go but since I have a choice, I wanted some opinions. 

I may also get to come up with my own title as well. Any other ideas?

1aeaxwa,"Talk me out of emailing this hiring manager, please.","I applied today. You can see in my posting history that I've been wavering between applying for an internship or an entry level role. I decided to bet on myself and go for the entry level role!  


So tell me why I've already got an email drafted to the manager of the team to ask if I can be considered for the intern role if I don't qualify for the entry level?!? This is a weak move, right? I'd be undermining myself, right? And making a terrible impression?   


I should not send this email. I should stick to my original decision, because:  


* The only qualification I'm missing is knowledge based, easily gained. Not a skill that would take weeks/months/years.
* I meet literally every other requirement and a good amount of the ""preferred skills.""
* I could *maybe* afford to live on the intern salary, but...not really. Even the entry level salary is going to put me on the beans/rice/ramen diet.
* If the entry level role doesn't pan out, I have prospects elsewhere. I very very badly want to work with this organization because it would be a dream come true (very unique, well-respected, small place), but I do not need to put all my eggs in this basket.
* The intern role's deadline is in two days. I cannot be asking last minute questions; surely that looks sloppy. 

But also...

* Both positions are going to be *really* competitive. 
* I applied in the fall for a different entry level role that I was overqualified for and didn't even get an interview.
* Both would require a temporary relocation, which I probably can't do next year, but can definitely can do this year. It feels like my last chance.

1aeahqs,life update: I just dropped out of college and moved to sf. give me advice,"I just landed in sf 2 days ago  
Some rando convinced me to take a break to go all in on my ideas at this school he cooked up in sf @ buildspace  
I'm going full-time on building StudentCo, a holding company focused on education  
In this post, I'll run through: My 2023 + why I dropped out + 2024 goals  
2023 has been interesting  
Jan: Broke my ankle in the 1st week, was in crutches for 3 months. I needed something to do.  
I came across acquire.com and fell in love instantly.  
Feb: I started building my personal brand in public from 0  
Soon my favorite part of the day was going on acquire  
May - July: Lived in Hawaii for the summer working at a biotech startup.  
All I did was look at businesses and be in nature (swam with turtles and saw lava IRL)  
I truly fell in love with what I was doing.  
June: Acquired Sourcely for $4k and grew it to $150k+ valuation in 5 months.  
Sep - Dec: Launched/ acquired: Yomu, Student AI tools, Pocket Fund  
Got a VC internship in sf with a 2.4 GPA.  
living in sf changed a lot. I met interesting people and gained some much needed perspective.  
Fun fact: I went bald 3 times  
**Reflection**  
Been an amazing, but difficult year.  
A lot of work, made sacrifices in life, dealt with difficult conversations and pressure like nothing I’ve experienced before.  
A lot of things have changed, especially my mindset, view of the world, and quite simply what I thought I could do  
Honestly, I’m barely getting started

&#x200B;

Why I dropped out? 

&#x200B;

I dropped out of college to buy and sell online business.   
The goal is to build a personal brand in the space while building a holding company in public along the way.   
If my goal is to create a billion $ worth of value over the next 10-20 years. (Shoot for the moon and end up amongst the stars kinda vibe?)  
PE just simply has the most potential for scalable wealth creation at the pace, and returns I would like to be at, from what I’ve seen.   
The more uncommon a market is, the more opportunity there usually is in it.   
The VC backed startup route is brutal and just doesn’t make much sense anymore unless you really trust your investors and their intentions.   
Being a founder/ CEO yourself there’s only so much you can do- it’s not scalable to 10s of companies and you’re limited by your time.   
It’s important to separate yourself from the business and become an owner, not an operator.   
I would like to approach things from the mindset of an owner from the start.   
Also failure is inevitable. This path seems to be the most kind to failure in the beginning especially as I start with low stakes.   
Earlier the barriers to entry to this PE game were crazy high.   
Thanks to sites likes acquire, flippa, microns the process of buying and selling a business is getting much easier   
And most importantly democratised.   
You can now buy/ sell a business for <$10,000 without requiring any help.   
Tbh they had me at ‘buy a business’, the rest of this may just be me justifying my decisions.   
So if I know exactly what I want to do and I know college can teach me none of this. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  
2024 goals  
Turn $100k into $1 million through acquisitions  
Travel 3 months of the year, maybe do Asia solo?  
Life is about experiences.  
Genuinely help as many people as I can.  
I’m pretty happy if I can be a genuine value add to everyone that I interact with.

1aea7o8,Should I apologize to my manager?,"Hi all,

So I made a small mistake ($0.01 mistake, literally) that my supervisor discussed with me, but before discussing it with me he discussed it with HIS manager. I see this manager maybe once a week very briefly, for 15 seconds at most usually. 

Anyway I want to know if I should send an apology email to him too. The mistake was small, not something I’ve come across before, and I only started working here full-time about 2 months ago, I feel that’s why only my manager spoke to me. Had this been a repeated mistake, I think the manager would’ve spoken to me.

You know I have had many different types of jobs in different fields warehouse personnel dishwasher dishwasher capsule filling machine machinist. This was my last job, most of them I entered as an entry level staff. But I am tired of drifting aimlessly. In all the jobs I have had, as soon as I arrived I tried to learn as much as I could by implementing and tidying up my workplace as well as reading on my own how to improve my performance with videos and materials on the internet. Thanks to this, I was generally taken into consideration, supported and given opportunities by my superiors. The issue is that I feel no interest in anything particular no career or talent that makes me want to study it, I feel like a robot a mercenary with no interest until he jumps head first into a field and has to learn or go under and get fired.

1ae9ab5,5 month job search,"Hi! I am coming up on 5 months actively seeking a full-time position either on-site, hybrid-remote or remote. I graduated last May of 2023 with a Bachelors in Science of Business Administration Marketing. I’ve since completed a Google Analytics course and Fundamentals of ECommerce and Digital Marketing as well as updated my resume/ LinkedIn Profile. When I say I’ve definitely applied to 1,000+ jobs I’m not joking. I’ve had lots of interviews where I get to the 3/4 interview and they go with someone else. Often times getting emails saying they had too many candidates with potential, but went with someone else they felt fit better. 

Is this normal? What was your job search process like out of college? Any tips?

**My background:**  
International Student (European) | Bachelor of Arts (non STEM Major) | 3.6 GPA | White | CISgender Male | No connection in the industry | Top 1% Public University (non Ivy League).  
**Previous Experiences:**  
\-Summer intern ad a small VC (When I say small I mean SMALL not BoUtiQue)  
\-Convinced a friend how created a small portal online (virtual reality) to let me write that I worked there as a marketing intern, no this was not a VC backed startup that raised millions in fact it never raised anything at all it was just him running it from his dorm and it had absolutely no customers or investors, more of a side project, I don’t even think the site is still up as of now.  
**In the 3.5 months of job applications and interview I:**  
\-Tried every Ai tool Under the Sun (Will list pro and cons of the major ones to keep it short but feel free to ask my opinions on any other tool in the comments).  
\-Got 3 different certifications to increment my chances of getting hired.-Paid to have my resume edited and proofread as well as my cover letter.  
\-Paid multiple people to apply for me.  
\-Applied to 900+ Jobs | 10 Applications Daily | USA Only.  
Job Selection was limited to jobs that do hire international students, I applied to absolutely anything that would fit a business undergrad, as well as internships.  
**NO NETWORK NO NETWORKING ON REACH OUT OF ANY KIND ON ANY PLATFORM.**  
**Why I had the cards stacked against me:**  
12% of international students are able to stay in the US after graduation the vast majority of international students are in STEM(50.4%), me being in Business which makes up for 16.2% of those 12%, meant that only a 1.94% of international students with my degree are able to remain and work in the USA. This percentage amounts only to the number of people that due to my visa are able to make it through to finally join the USA job market, which is a whole other beast in itself.  
(THIS IS NOT TO BRAG, although I am proud of myself for landing this job I shared this info in the hope to give those who read this post a bit of perspective, if an idiot like me with a shit GPA and with little to no odds to work in the us at ALL managed to land a FAANG job you can easily find a job for yourself)  
I divided the whole process in tranches of 2 weeks each where I would add something or fix something to see If it would increase my odds off getting an interview.  
**Tools utilized:**  
\-***Notion***(free version, utilized the template “Job Applications” to track the application process(the template is free as well).  
\-***Calendar*** to structure a schedule that would allow me to keep up with the quantity of applications.  
**Format*****:*** Google “Harvard Resume Template”  


**LETS START:**  
**1st TRANCHE Week 1-2 | START.**  
**STRATEGY**:Same Resume-Cover letter, created a template for the cover letter that I would fill in, paid an expert to optimize the template as well as proofread my resume template.  
**RESULT:** 140 Applications = 84 Rejected 56 No Answer  


**2nd TRANCHE Week 3-4 | INTRODUCTION TO AI - 1st Interview - Getting Extra Certifications.**  
\-Started to take a look at forums and reddit asked opinions, implemented AI.  
\-Obtained free certifications for the following: SQL, Excel, Google Analytics. (All of these took few ours to obtain and were all free, there’s an abundance of sites that do offer certifications online)  
**STRATEGY:**Tried different AI Resume Scanners(also paid for the premium service when a free trial was not available), scanned each resume and then tailored it better on ChatGPT, this one took A LOT of time, it took me 10x longer to do one application.  
Here is how I divided the tools based on the applications to test them:  
40% Teal.  
40% Kickresume.  
20% Various others that I still wanted to test regardless.  
**RESULT: 140 Applications = 97 Rejected 42 No Answer •1st Interview•**  
Out of all the AI platforms I tried there are the main two, Teal and Kickresume, later one you will see how I ditched both.  
The issue with every single AI platform for jobs is they do give you a score and what to fix but ultimately you will have to do the fixing yourself, there is no automation is just a Scan that does claim to pass ATS scans, I don’t know how true is that(Could be), ultimately they offer some slight improvement (through ChatGPT) but no real “tailoring” per se, and “Templates” which you can easily find on Canva for free, on top of that when I was researching the tools I figured out most of the companies out there do make fake posts on reddit in order to gain traction, in some cases I was not really able to find a legit post and review that didn’t seem shady.  
Regardless I still tailored each application to get at least a 90% score on the scan.  
**Personal Reflection:** I have the impression that tailoring each resume based on the score of any platform might undermine the outcome, there the need of the possibility to keep the same format in the scoring as well as the re writing to be more impactful in the application process.  


**3rd TRANCHE Weeks 5-6 | PAID SOMEONE TO APPLY FOR ME**  
As I was busy with school and had to optimize my time I decided to hire someone to do the work for me to keep the momentum and quantity of application per week, also I had little to no trust in the AI platforms and tools to help me optimize the process.

  
**STRATEGY**:I hired different people across different freelance platforms(Fiverr and Upwork), across different prices, I talked with 20 freelance “professionals”, some of them seemed like bots for some reason, I narrowed down my selection to 4 candidates that seemed promising and matched my requests as well as having a proven track record.  
4 Freelance total applications 140:  
1-Cheap: 35 Applications  
2-Mid: 35 Applications  
3-Mid: 35 Applications  
4-Expensive: 35 Applications  
**RESULT: 140 Applications = 57 Rejected 83 No Answer**  
**Personal Reflection:** The most expensive and less effective, most of the applications were meh some were straight up incorrect and full of grammatical errors, also the vast majority of applications were the exact same, I suspect they use some kind of tool or app that does automate part of the job, I mixed feelings about this because I felt like I missed out on opportunities but with school In the way I would have not been able to apply to as many applications.  
**Pros:**”Time effective”  
**Cons:**lacks quality, cannot track the execution, expensive.  


**4rd TRANCHE Weeks 7-8 | BACK TO THE ORIGINS - Studied the game and paid for lessons.**  
**RESULT: 140 Applications = 98 Rejected 36 No Answer •6 First Interviews•**  
**Personal Reflection:** Went back to the origins to get some control over everything also I had more time, went above and beyond online to find how to perfectly tailor my resume for better outcomes, also paid to get lessons from the person that would proofread my resume at the start to get more insights on how to tailor it better. Structured my day in a different way to I would have resume and cover letter prepared (which is 80-90% to the application process) using the calendar was HUGE in helping me structuring my time more efficiently. This was grueling and non sustainable I do not suggest to to this, but ultimately It was helpful because it led me to my last idea which was the one that made me succeed.  
**5th TRANCHE Weeks 9-14 THE FINAL RECIPE - PAID AN EXPERT TO APPLY FOR ME I CRACKED THE CODE**  
Expectedly got really busy with school again, knowing that I decided to talk with the person who gave me lesson and would proof read my stuff and asked if he would apply for me, and do the whole process for me(applications only no interview). Negotiate ad price and did the deal, it was far from cheap and considerably more expensive than the most expensive “expert” on freelance sites.  
**RESULT:**  
**9-10 140 Applications = 105 Rejected 24 No Answer •11 First Interview•**  
**\*\*11-12 140 Applications = 93 Rejected 39 No Answer •\*\*8 First Interview•**  
**13-14 140 Applications = 82 Rejected 45 No Answer •13 First Interview•**  
**Personal Reflection:** This was the most expensive by a long shot overall, but it came back paying in spades. Also for clarity I negotiated a bulk price for a number of applications amount/week, I had to pay NO percentage of my employment rate.  
**TLTR and CRUDE TIPS:**  
\-tailor each applications to the job.  
\-schedule your applications time to stay on top of it.  
\-all of the ai apps around might help but wont really automate anything or make you save too much time to be worth it.  
\-stay away from freelance that offer to apply for you for cheap.  
\-hire someone knowledgable someone that necessarily doesn't offer the service of applying for you and try to negotiate with them a way to do so, is gonna be worth your money.

**Personal Reflection**: I have the impression that tailoring each resume based on the score of any platform might undermine the outcome, there the need of the possibility to keep the same format in the scoring as well as the re writing to be more impactful in the application process.  
3rd TRANCHE Weeks 5-6 | PAID SOMEONE TO APPLY FOR ME  
As I was busy with school and had to optimize my time I decided to hire someone to do the work for me to keep the momentum and quantity of application per week, also I had little to no trust in the AI platforms and tools to help me optimize the process.  
I hired different people across different freelance platforms(Fiverr and Upwork), across different prices, I talked with 20 freelance “professionals”, some of them seemed like bots for some reason, I narrowed down my selection to 4 candidates that seemed promising and matched my requests as well as having a proven track record.  
4 Freelance total applications 140:  
1-Cheap: 35 Applications  
2-Mid: 35 Applications  
3-Mid: 35 Applications  
4-Expensive: 35 Applications  
**RESULT: 140 Applications = 57 Rejected 83 No Answer**  
Personal Reflection: The most expensive and less effective, most of the applications were meh some were straight up incorrect and full of grammatical errors, also the vast majority of applications were the exact same, I suspect they use some kind of tool or app that does automate part of the job, I mixed feelings about this because I felt like I missed out on opportunities but with school In the way I would have not been able to apply to as many applications.  
**Pros**:”Time effective”  
**Cons**:lacks quality, cannot track the execution, expensive.  
**4rd TRANCHE Weeks 7-8 | BACK TO THE ORIGINS - Studied the game and paid for lessons.**  
\*\***RESULT: 140 Applications = 98 Rejected 36 No Answer •\*\*6 First Interviews•**  
Personal Reflection: Went back to the origins to get some control over everything also I had more time, went above and beyond online to find how to perfectly tailor my resume for better outcomes, also paid to get lessons from the person that would proofread my resume at the start to get more insights on how to tailor it better. Structured my day in a different way to I would have resume and cover letter prepared (which is 80-90% to the application process) using the calendar was HUGE in helping me structuring my time more efficiently. This was grueling and non sustainable I do not suggest to to this, but ultimately It was helpful because it led me to my last idea which was the one that made me succeed.  
**5th TRANCHE Weeks 9-14 THE FINAL RECIPE - PAID AN EXPERT TO APPLY FOR ME I CRACKED THE CODE**  
Expectedly got really busy with school again, knowing that I decided to talk with the person who gave me lesson and would proof read my stuff and asked if he would apply for me, and do the whole process for me(applications only no interview). Negotiate ad price and did the deal, it was far from cheap and considerably more expensive than the most expensive “expert” on freelance sites.  
**RESULT:**  
**9-10 140 Applications = 105 Rejected 24 No Answer •11 First Interview•**  
**\*\*11-12 140 Applications = 93 Rejected 39 No Answer •\*\*8 First Interview•**  
**13-14 140 Applications = 82 Rejected 45 No Answer •13 First Interview**•  
**Personal Reflection:** This was the most expensive by a long shot overall, but it came back paying in spades. Also for clarity I negotiated a bulk price for a number of applications amount/week, I had to pay NO percentage of my employment rate.  
**TLTR and CRUDE TIPS**:  
\-tailor each applications to the job.  
\-schedule your applications time to stay on top of it.  
\-all of the ai apps around might help but wont really automate anything or make you save too much time to be worth it.  
\-stay away from freelance that offer to apply for you for cheap.  
\-hire someone knowledgable someone that necessarily doesn't offer the service of applying for you and try to negotiate with them a way to do so, is gonna be worth your money.",against_all_0dds,1,1.0,0,1706568484,2024-01-29 22:48:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ae8ori/how_i_landed_a_6figure_salary_faang_job_with_the/,1,2024
1ae8hdl,Which would you do?,"I've got a fork in the road going on.

Opportunity 1) Continue into another 6 month nurse travel contract in the Midwest paying $75-80, 36 hours guaranteed, 12 hour shifts with a daily commute of 3 hours. 18 hour days on average, rest, rinse, repeat. Work is brutal, dangerous (prison), and psychologically profoundly harmful. Bonus, I get to sleep at home each night. Travel expenses bring my hourly to an effective $63 W2, I have a billion kids so taxes aren't an issue. I can pick up extra shifts per diem in the area at $50-$65 an hour or overtime at work occasionally for $120 an hour.

Opportunity 2)  Take a staff job in California. Work environment 100000000% better. Mandated patient ratios and I could get back into hospital work. Pay $85-100 with differential per hour. Rent a room and fly back and forth weekly to see family, stack my workdays, etc. Takes it down $16 an hour to $69-84 an hour effective. Same amount of lost hours, but I'm flying instead of driving daily. Less exhaustion. No more crazy 18 hour days, but I don't see my family between stints working (sucks, I have ton of kids, but I get home so late I rarely see them anyway on workdays.) Plus, I'd have more time during regular hours to zoom and talk to them between shifts. I can pick up extra shifts per diem at $115 an hour.

I applied for the CA license so I would have options. I need two more semesters to be a psych NP but can't restart my program until the Fall. Sort of in limbo. I have 5-6 months worth of expenses saved up if something were to happen to my health.

1ae7sct,Should I switch jobs that I started 3 months ago?,"Hi! I started a new job about 3 months ago. While I like this job, my dream job has opened up a spot. The application process for my dream job takes about 9 months long in total since it’s with a Large agency. My big question is, during those 9 months, should I stay at my current job or switch to another position that will put me at a better financial position right now.

There is more guarantee I’ll get my dream job but a solid chance due to my qualifications and connections. My current job pays okay, but it requires a bit of budgeting and potentially side jobs. What do you guys think? Should I switch to a different job and hope in 9 months I get my dream one, or should I stay where I am at for the 9 months and deal with the lower pay. On my application I don’t want it to seem like I shop around for jobs.

1ae7hye,How to move forward after major depression after targeted harassment and reprisals over a decade at JPMC?,"Posting from a throwaway as I don't want to taint my main that is used to contribute to specific subs. 

While I intend to sink this LinkedIn account (point the email somewhere I'll never check) or possibly remove it due to mental health reasons I will link it here for background. 

Here is a link to a post with a more thorough breakdown of high-level events that happened:

[https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7157810856620101632/](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7157810856620101632/)

In short I've had stock options that were vested taken from me. I was openly retaliated against in meetings by management filled with team members after using anonymous HR tools to report things. I had HR threaten action against me and refuse to look into easily accessible evidence of illegal retaliation. That is just the beginning of my experiences working at JPMC in the US twice and in the Philippines over a 10 year span. 

Each time I convinced myself it was isolated behavior. Each time I was promoted and got amazing reviews from management until they were replaced and then the harassment started. 

Nearly half of you statistically use products I created or ran as dev lead on. You ever log into [Chase.com](https://Chase.com)? You have used my work, signed up for a new account recently, good chance you used my work. Every employer or customer I have worked with knows the depth of my skills and the commitment to my team, product, and customers. Especially JPMC. 

I also have had an incredibly abusive childhood in no small part to my neurodivergence. This in turn lends to bouts of major depression. 

Over 2 years later I'm just able to crawl out of my last bout due to mental abuses inflicted on my at JPCM but I look at where I'm at and I don't know where to go forward. 

I wanted to create an app for people like me, think Wikileaks for corporations to allow people to report  general illegal activities of corporations and to help others going threw the same, give a legitimate ability for people to report these abuses and avoid retaliation by using HR tools / the supposed proper channels like I had to go through.

However now my cPTSD is triggered every time I try to develop. I become irrationally angry and upset because now development is intrinsically linked in my mind to my past trauma. None of this is diagnosed as my mother, and sole custodian growing up was a major cause of my PTSD. Think getting in major trouble for telling the phycologist things and getting beat with a wooden paddle board while tripping on acid because the funny strip of paper I found 5 cartoon images on it was dangerous and I need to find and return it and couldn't. 

I've drained my funds being unable to work, I'm imminently fearful that any development role I take will again be abusive. I will be filing for bankruptcy soon so when I get employed again I won't be saddled with debt that will make a job nearly futile. I feel like my earning potential and career has been permanently destroyed. 

I am at a total loss as to where to go from here. I've considered getting my PMP, or some Scrum master certs and redirecting my career that way.

I would just like to know what this group thinks about those who stay at one company vs move around. For context this stems from my experience that I have been at one company for 10.5 years. I have numerous companies reach out to me that are very interested but these are mostly lateral moves. What is made clear to me is that these companies find my loyalty to current employer very appealing. However, I have also been told by those in recruiting and HR when seeing that someone has spent 15-20 years at the same employer it is often seen as a downside because they question that candidate’s willingness to adapt to a new environment. In your experience do you believe that staying at one place can be seen as a negative?",ApprehensivePay1869,3,1.0,2,1706563434,2024-01-29 21:23:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ae6mzr/switching_companies_or_staying_put/,1,2024
1ae6imm,"Dream job, in not-so-dream state. Not so amazing job in dream state. What to do.","Hi everyone. I am 24F and recently graduated with my masters degree in public health (MPH). I graduated last September, had no luck with jobs or interviews until now. I basically went on a rage in early January, applying to jobs that I thought I would never even hear back from. I applied to over 300 jobs, and have been seeing the interview emails come trickling in over the past two weeks or so. I am in the final stages of the interview to offer process working at an Ivy League institution. It is looking like I will be receiving an offer in the next week. Here’s my dilemma. This job is not in an area where I saw myself being at 24. I saw myself moving south near where my friends and family are, near the beach where it is warm and where I can finally relax after spending the last 8 years in academia. I have been religiously applying to jobs in this dream state, and have been hearing crickets. The funding for public health or research jobs in this dream state is terrible. I have a few interviews coming up but the jobs are nowhere near as spectacular as this one with the Ivy League institution.

On one hand, I feel as though I cannot pass up this insane opportunity that will greatly impact my future employment opportunities for the better. Or do I keep waiting around for something to pop up or get an interview with a job in my dream state. I feel so conflicted on what the right choice is and I dont know what to do. I feel pressured to make a decision even though I kind of know what the right one is career-wise.

1ae4xa6,Adapting to corporate work,"I recently (3 months) started a new job working in the corporate world. I work in finance for a fairly large company, it's in person and I feel like I need some advice.

I have not been enjoying this job very much and am wondering if I should stick it out or try to find a new job. I feel like I might not be cut out for corporate work and I just wanna know if any of you have advice on how to work in a corporate environment. Before this I worked as a security guard at a theme park and for the most part enjoyed it more than the corporate job even though it was way more physically demanding and in my opinion more mentally challenging. I'm also much more used to a job where once I am actually able to complete a task from start to finish. In this role, it feels like, no matter how hard I work I will always have just a pile of neverending work ahead of me.

I don't mind the work but I find myself getting incredibly annoyed everytime I have to have a meeting with anyone about anything and anytime I run into a problem I have to fight the urge to just ignore it because I have absolutely no desire to deal with it. I feel completely disconnected from my work and find myself incapable of actually caring about anything I'm doing and every meeting just feels like meaningless business jargon. 

I understand that 3 months at a job is not very long and that is exaclty why im making this post, to see if im just quitting before ive started or if I really am just not cut out for corporate work. If anyone could tell me how to handle the drastic change in work and environment or just want to share any relevant experience I would appreciate it.

Job A is interviewing me tomorrow, Tuesday (Jan 30), while Job B isn’t interviewing me until next Tuesday (Feb 6). I really want Job B; it’s my passion. Job A would definitely pay better but I think the work would be mostly dull and unfulfilling. I would definitely take Job A if Job B didn’t want me though. 


My concern is that Job A is going to extend an offer before I can even interview with Job B. Then I’ll be faced with accepting an offer from A and having to decline the job I really want, or decline Job A and potentially end up with no job at all if Job B doesn’t extend an offer.



The only thing I can think of is to tell Job A that I need some time to consider their offer, but Job B is for the government and we know how slow they are..



Any advice is welcome. 






Additional consideration: I don’t feel like I can take Job A and then leave it two weeks later for Job B because a former boss and mentor of mine put in a good word at Job A, particularly in regards to my job hopping, and that will make her look bad and damage our relationship.",AshTreex3,2,1.0,0,1706559077,2024-01-29 20:11:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ae4vv3/what_if_i_get_an_offer_from_a_job_i_dont_care/,1,2024

A 3rd year cs undergrad in Canada here. For context, I secured an internship offer from a pension fund as a quant, and if may, wish to pursue this path (or similar jobs) as a new grad employment. But since I am currently an international student, I'd need minimum 5-6 years to obtain my citizenship here after my graduation to gain TN visa to work in US. I have 3.9/4.0 gpa. 

My (super) long-term goal is either corporate leadership role in tech, or portfolio manager at US asset management/hedge fund. But since I'm tied up in Canada until 2031, I'm debating if I should pursue T7 US MBA (i.e. Kellogg 1y) in 2031, or just part-time OMSCS at Georgia Tech right after my undergrad.

Will T7 MBA be worth it even 6 years after undergrad?

1ae3d3b,Has anyone successfully transitioned to another job after qualifying in civil engineering?,"

Hi all, first of all I'll just say I think I'm becoming disallusioned with my role as a civil engineer. A year after graduating with first class honours BEng in the UK, I just don't think I'm capable of some of the tasks I'm asked to at work. Additionally, the salary for UK based civil engineers seems so low unless you reach the very top level which I don't think I will.

Just wondering if anybody has felt the same? And if so, has anyone successfully transitioned to another role whether it be in a similar field or somewhere completely new?

Is a civil engineering degree useful and applicable to any other roles that don't exactly fall under civils and would help someone get their foot in the door in another field?

1ae3bho,Need help finding a career path that fits my skills,"  
I am almost 30 and currently are struggling taking college courses again for a degree in cyber security and wonder if I would be better off trying to do something else with myself. Please understand I am not bragging here and it is difficult for me to come up with positive skills that I possess. But seeing as I am at a loss with what to do with my future I am reaching out here in hopes for advice and solutions to my current predicament. I want to have a career doing something I am good at and/or enjoy but it is difficult to get any concrete advice. Any help at all would be appreciated.  
Since a young age I have loved videogames and constantly daydream up settings, worlds, plots and characters with ease. Now that I am older I find myself running multiple online DND and custom tabletop games for most of my free time. I love doing it, but am unsure if there is a career to be made of this skill or if its a dead end. I often make these worlds and settings quickly as well and cover all kinds of genres from Scifi to fantasy, cyberpunk and even custom made a pokemon-esque setting with over 500 catchable creatures...So far this has been where most my free time has gone since I live in a remote location.  
I always enjoyed helping people and the idea of being a protector appealed to me early on. This lead me gain a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and a minor in psychology, but have not had a chance to really use them due to there being a 6 month waiting period for applications to join the police where I am at and I failed the math section on the test...I know basic math but algebra is very rusty for me...It has been no end of frustration for me to be blocked by higher math skills that seem to never be used on the jobs they gate keep for.  
I love being outdoors, hiking and animals all interest me and I loved camping and fishing but doing it alone is rough as it makes me feel lonely. I was a part time night shifts maintenance ranger (cleaned the park) for one of my jobs and it was the best I ever worked at but was a dead end until they didnt need me anymore after 2 years (they found someone younger who would take less pay).  
I traveled alot in and around Asia when I was young due to my fathers work and even spent most my child hood in Hong Kong. I would love to have a job that allows me to travel around there again.  
Aside from my math problems I am relatively healthy, but am not perfect. I spent 3 years trying to get into the Air force but due to rookie recruiters and a bad doctor (He was against the armed service and due to personal bias looked for things in my health to cause problems with me joining)I cant apply for two years due to taking anti-depressants a single time to combat my crippling loneliness at a time of weakness. There is more to this story but this post is going to be long enough as is.  
Thank you for reading this and taking the time to help me. I dont know what to do and if cyber security is really the path for me. I chose it as a way to be able to travel and work while helping protect others...But I am unsure if I have the skills to fit.

1ae302b,How horrible is it to quit a well-paying job to focus on school?,"I'm in a weird limbo and out of ideas of what to do. I (F, very late 20s, Europe) am currently working a quite well-paying job for a bit over 3 years now that I would quit without a second thought (the department/company has many issues) if I were to just look for a new job in a same field. However, I am also in uni for a career change towards tech. No mortgage, no debt, no one relying on me financially. It is a fact that by June/July the latess I will have to quit my job and find an internship because I will not be able to graduate without completing a rather long internship. 

Due to my unique position at the company I currently work at, I know that I will not want to do my internship here for several reasons (I know the teams are very dysfunctional with not-so-great leadership). I would love nothing more than to quit my job within the next two months already to have a bit more time to focus on school and building up my skills for the internships. I am currently working and studying full time so it is near impossible to have time/energy to dedicate any time for additional self-development I feel is quite necessary to improve my chances of getting a good internship. 

Financially I am in a good position and could live off my savings for up to 2 years and it is mostly an issue of personal pride as I don't like the idea of being unemployed by my own choice.

Do you think not having a job at the time of applying for internships will give off red flag vibes to recruiters or are they generally more understanding when it comes to internships?",Short_Bus8309,1,1.0,0,1706554495,2024-01-29 18:54:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ae302b/how_horrible_is_it_to_quit_a_wellpaying_job_to/,1,2024

I’m 31. I spent ages 20 - 27 as a warehouseman and forklift operator. In 2019 I got hit in the head with a box due to negligence and got angry and decided to go back to school with the intention that I was tired of abusing my body for no money. 

Went back to be a vet. Switched to accounting. Graduated in May of 2022. Was able to get my first real accounting job my 2nd to last semester in 2021. 

Worked as a tax intern for a tax season. Hated it. Worked private industry doing sales reconciliations and other account recs and misc tasks as a staff accountant. Loved the team and company but was beyond bored. Currently an auditor for a big 4 firm. The work makes me want to gouge my eyes out. I just took the first section of the CPA exam today out of obligation. I think I failed. Either way I don’t care. 

I don’t expect to love every part of a job, but my main goal in going back to school was to pick a career where I could not hurt my body so much. I got that and it’s awesome, but the actual work is miserable. School was fine, but it gets so muddied in the real world. Seems like the rules are there to work around and not as a pillar. Not that I care, it’s just one observation of what I’ve seen as something I don’t like. We are box checkers by and large. 

So I’ve made the decision to ride this career out until I find what I want to do. I’m not going to up and quit. I get paid decently to work from home, not letting go of that. But in the meantime I have no idea what to do. 

Spare time I like riding my bike, exercise, budgeting, watching building channels, organizing, sports. 

Not into video games. No desire to help people in a clinical setting. No desire to sell beyond myself and my capabilities. 

That’s all I got. Can anyone lend a direction?",TrapHouseinSMemphis,1,1.0,2,1706554333,2024-01-29 18:52:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ae2xqe/been_in_accounting_2_years_now_done_and_so_lost/,1,2024

I have a potential job offer from Company B, which is better pay and a remote job. I have not disclosed my school plans.

Is it worth leaving my current role, to work at a company for several months before leaving for school? Just want to gauge opinions.

1ae2kv2,Negotiating on an internal position title and salary,"Currently a Sr. Manager individual contributor at a publicly traded company where my function supports a BU (think almost like internal marketing consultants). The President of the BU reached out to ask me to apply for a new position opening up those reports directly to her, would build the business innovation pipeline and a manage team of 10 direct reports. She reports to the CEO of the company. 

All this sounds great. From the description, this is firmly a director-level role - the listing goes live and lo and behold, they have it listed as a manager level. Currently, I'm a Sr. Manager, so on paper, this feels like a step down.  I'm interviewing this week, and the HR rep gives me a finite salary # which is only 4% more than what I'm currently making. She makes it sound like salary + title is non-negotiable. Now feeling a bit off about it: a manager role with a team of 10, sitting on the Sr. Leadership and directly reporting to a BU's President?? 

 Do I just take HR at face value or am I safe to assume that it's totally legit for me to bring these things up for negotiation with the President? In my head, I'd say with my performance (3 years with excellent reviews), proven value delivery, and the fact that you're adding on People Management, an ask of a 15-20% pay bump and a title of Sr. Manager/Director at minimum (or a consideration to revisit Director-level in 6 months) is fair. Anyone have a suggestion on the right way to thread this needle?

1ae22ob,"Reddit, I need your wisdom. Confused on my next step in my career.","For context, I am 27 years old (F), I graduated from a pretty well known state school in 2019 got a bachelor's in the worlds stupidest degree, political science. Thankfully I got a full ride so I did not end up with student loans. After graduation, I ended up taking a bit of a break, taught english online and travelled for a few years. Then came home, got married, and my husband and I run a reselling business. 

Well we didn't know what the eff we were doing, bought inventory on credit cards, and racked up debt. We were idiots. We got to around 30k of credit debt and now we are down to 11k. 

My husband doesn't have a college degree. When we started getting serious about paying down debt I started substitute teaching part time to chunk that money at debt. One thing led to another, and I ended up accepting a full time position as an after school program coordinator. It pays me 55k. Which is okay but not what I would like, and every single check goes to debt. 

Our business on average makes around 8k a month. In order to live off our business we would need to be making around 20k a month. We resell liquidation/used clothes on online platforms. 

**However, I am feeling incredibly lost.** I want us to make more money and have a secure future. I feel upset with myself for taking that time off after college and not focusing on a career path. I feel like there is no hope for me to get to 6 figures. I have been exploring different paths I could take. Should I buckle down and try to get our business to that 20k income? Should I go get an MBA? Or should I go down a path of sales, try to make as much money as possible that we can funnel into our business that my husband works on full time? 

I also feel a bit insecure about my job title as a self employed/ after school coordinator person, I am not sure how to grow from here. 

Its just incredible exhausting to not know what to do and to go back and forth with scenarios in my head. I would really appreciate any wisdom from you guys. Thank you for taking the time to read.

1ae222h,What is the most effective way to initiate a legal career in Europe as a foreigner?,"Hey guys!  
  
Long story short, I'm Brazilian and I'm finishing my law degree this year and getting close to officially becoming a lawyer. Soon I'll have to choose which area I'm going to specialize in, and since I've always had an itch to live abroad, I'm strongly considering finding a way to move to Europe in the near future to start a career there.  
  
I know this may not be the best field for someone who wants to live abroad, and it can be pretty challenging to make it happen, but I really like it, and I've always pictured myself working in an  international organization or a law firm, contributing meaningfully either to my personal growth or in helping others. The problem is that I don't have any idea what the first step would be to get there, and that’s my question: What would be the most effective way to move to Europe and establish a career in the legal field?  
  
I feel like I'm at an extremely defining moment in my career/life, and since I've always aspired to big things, I'm a bit apprehensive to plan the next steps and a bit lost, to be honest. That's why I'm asking here; I suppose some of you are in this field and could provide me some perspective.   
  
And just in case it matters, language is not a barrier, I have a good english level and I wouldn't mind postponing things a bit to learn a new language before going if it's necessary. I also thought about US or Australia, but they seem even more challenging places to settle in as a foreigner, anyway, I'm open to advice about these places if you have any!  
  
I would really appreciate any advice you can give me!

1ae1zkn,Complete career change later in career - how???,"Hi internet - reaching out for any insight, guidance or resources. I'm several years into a career path that is mostly accidental (but kept evolving). Long story short, it's a job/industry that I'd like to get away from if possible but the hook is I've developed too much expertise to be able to treat it as throw-away career-debt, or at least without a consideration on how to leverage it into something else. That said, curious if anyone has ever made a career change specifically later in your career, how you did it, and if you were able to stay financially close to where you had been previously. (i.e. complete industry shift/change/role change)

Like everyone else, I'd love to find a job that docks into passions - but in a more realistic way, my goal is to not be miserable in the role I'm in. I love the idea of 'if you don't like something, change it' --- and while it is absolutely that simple, it's also not. I know there's a recipe for how to do it well vs how to do it in a way that crashes and burns.

1ae1vsk,Coworker Bad-mouthing me because I leave early,"I have been with my company for 18 months. During my time here, I have excelled, taken on a lot of new tasks/responsibilities and asked for more work as I am talented with excel and able to work more efficiently.

My previous manager, we’ll call him Jared, stepped down about 3 months into my tenure. There’s been some restructuring since, but, overall, I felt like we still had a great rapport and he was someone I admired for his experience.

Pay increases came through in fall and mine was lackluster. My manager (and her manager) agreed it wasn’t what they had hoped for me and asked if there was anything they could do to help “sweeten the pot”, as it were. After thinking about it, I requested to work 8-4 instead of 8-5, explaining that I often spent the last hour just making sure the day ended without any fires. My manager agreed so, now, I leave at 4:00 and log back in at 4:30 where I monitor my email and start my workout. It’s been life changing. I’m sitting down to eat dinner with my family at 6:00 instead of 7:00. Amazing.

It came to my attention recently that my previous manager, now colleague, has taken issue with this. He has been talking about it after I leave and complained to management. They told him that I had made arrangements with my manager and that should be that. He became upset because 3 years ago he was denied this request.

He has continued to complain internally to my coworkers. I’m upset mostly because it’s not his business. He could also just ask him manager instead of involving me. Additionally, I have made no comment on the consistent tardiness of my other colleagues (him included) of the amount he works remote (4 days compared to everyone else’s 2). I’m not his supervisor, his work had no bearing on mine, so I don’t care what he does or does not do.

Any advice for how to navigate this? Do I confront him? Do I report him? Do I ignore it?",judithpoint,61,0.8399999737739563,38,1706551825,2024-01-29 18:10:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ae1vsk/coworker_badmouthing_me_because_i_leave_early/,1,2024

1ae0zi8,I am considering quitting my job in less than a year because of a terrible manager. Has anyone done this? Did you regret?,"Without giving much away, I work in Digital Marketing and I joined a new company around 6 months ago. Prior to this I have two different work experience one for more than 7 years and another for more than 2 years. 

My current manager is absolutely passive aggressive, hostile, and a bully who has been ready to throw me under the bus at any moment. He joined this company just a few weeks before I did and has been extremely weird in behaviour. 

Many folks in other teams have mentioned this to me as well but they don't get as impacted as I do. People in my team are otherwise really respected by him or he just resorts to bad mouthing them behind their backs as they're seasoned employees of this company. 

TL;DR I have had a fairly good record on career and I'm unsure how badly would it impact my career if I quit a job in less than a year because of my manager.

1ae0m4k,"I need advice. Current sales professional going on year 4. But it’s starting to take a toll on my health, relationship, entrepreneurial endeavors, etc.","Hope to make this as concise as possible. I am a 26M. I started a sales role fresh out of college due to my original post grad plan (degree in media management, minor in entrepreneurship - was going to go into media advertising, but not any more) fizzled out. 

I am currently at a base or commission role in sales, with a base of 40k. I have cleared good money since being here
- $110k before taxes - year 1 
- $190k before taxes - year 2
- $110k before taxes - last year, year 3 

So good money of course, but things are getting rough. The industry I’m in has fluctuated and is heading south slowly. I finished last year at 30% down from the previous year end. Not bad but a big chunk of funds were missing as you can imagine. Hoping for a good start to this year, I am already 85% down from this time last year. 

Now I’m debating if I should keep riding the wave and hoping for better than the year before 2025 or pull the plug now? 

Here’s why:

- I have been looking at other sales jobs, but don’t know if I want to restart that level of uncertainty on pay and book of business. Tech sales would be where I would go first - hopefully work from home nevertheless 

- my business grossed 30k last year outside of my 9-5. I haven’t been able to put time in it because I’m drained when I get home, and honestly just go play video games because I’m so worn out everyday. 

- the will to go workout, read, etc is minimal. So now I have gained 50 lbs since starting here. It’s safe to say I ate well while making this money 

- I thought about cyber security but how can I fathom a starting salary of 60-80k entry level (if this much) + course cost to get certified

- I am very complacent with where I am and I think the reason is “what if things turn around for the better? What if I get that next sale that makes me a lot of money, etc.”

- I think I’m in a depressive state. I vape more than ever. Smoke more weed than ever.  Doomscroll more than ever. Drink alcohol more than ever. Fantasize women more than ever. I don’t want to act out of emotion but is a career change even ideal? 

My questions for responders 

1. What are good entry level careers that serve as a good transition from cold call sales role that I am in now? 
 —— fyi at the time, I am not willing to make my business my only income because I want to keep investing. 
—— I have a financial advisor so I have 60k in funds secured in investments, also with another $10k in emergency funds in case shit hits the fan.  

2. When does it make sense to have a pay cut for a new role? 

3. How do you not freak out about leaving your current role going into something completely new ?

1ae06g5,Is Medical School Worth the Debt?,"I'm not in medicine, but my Son wants to be. He is a rising senior in (Upstate NY) High School and I am scared to death about the amount of debt he will accumulate if he pursues a career in Medicine. We are a middle class family, with two of us working, and by the time he graduates medical school, I expect him to have between $300-$400K worth of debt. 4 or so years of a residency and it accumulates even more, so, in the range of $400K-$500K when he is 29-30 years old.  
He's an introvert, likes tech and could see him a field such as Radiology. I could see him returning to his hometown (upstate NY) to practice. Pay probably isn't as well in Rural America, but the average cost of living is low here.  
My concern is that I want to be sure I'm not leading him in the wrong direction. He is fairly simple and hasn't been exposed to traveling the world, and stays close to home. He's not in the ""in"" crowd, which is mostly the sports kids. He works hard and does well academically, not a big club kid, as he is an introvert and feels he does not fit in with the athletes. He participates in the basic academic clubs - NHS, but that is about it. I would love to see him taking a leadership role, but don't think that will happen.  
As I mentioned, I don't want to lead him in the wrong direction. Is the amount of debt worth it and is it attainable to be able to pay off in a decent amount of time, that he will be able to enjoy life and have a family, or is it too steep and he won't pay it off until he's 50, and if that's the case, maybe he should consider a career in IT or Cybersecurity, where you start out at $125K after 4 years of college with $150K debt?

The complex thing is that I (27F) currently work in accounting and want to honestly find either a coding certification or another type of cert that is inexpensive and can help boost my career and salary. I’m not super concerned with working inside of my current field, I am much more interested in finding a flexible position that pays well and has job security. I do not care what that is whether it’s SalesForce or AWS or becoming a dental hygienist lol I’m just ready to find something but there are SO many options I don’t know where to start.

1ady1rw,"Motivation Lost in training role, how do I reclaim it?","Hi, I'm posting this here as although it relates to tech careers, there is a lack of response in tech-related forums.  
I'm on an apprenticeship in software engineering with a relatively well-known company. It's a degree apprenticeship so I complete modules/exams/assignments online with the Open University. I am in the second year, but I am losing so much motivation to continue. I guess because when I started applying for this apprenticeship, the tech industry was in a good place, it seemed to be thriving. Then all the layoffs and recent economic downturn happened. I'm losing motivation to even do my work on this apprenticeship, and I probably look like a really bad apprentice/employee. (Taking longer to do things, bad communication, etc).

  
I'm aware that this is really negative behaviour, but I'm in this really extreme spiral of depression and apathy. Everywhere I look there's negativity etc, about tech, how it's no longer worth getting into - especially as a junior, being replaced by AI, layoffs, economic downturn etc. I keep thinking that there's no point even doing this apprenticeship, and I should just swap out and find one in a career that's more in demand. I'm not even sure what's in demand currently, maybe careers like plumbing? Electrician? I'm not sure.

  
It's so weird and sad to me because I used to really love tech/software engineering and now I'm seeing it as something that I have to get out off, because a) I'm not good enough yet and b) even when I do become good enough, there will be no jobs.

Should I go into quantity surveying/cost estimate and try and get a certification for that, should I go into planning (I don't really enjoy planning much) or should I go into something else.

1adx4ie,I’m trying to get laid off! Suggestions/advice on how to do the bare minimum while protecting myself enough to be eligible for unemployment?,"Serious post. I know some of you will think it’s crazy, but you can check my post history of how much disdain I have for my job. In short: they downsized my team and I am now going the work of at least 2 people. I got tasks on my plate that were not part of the job description nor are in areas I have direct experience with, so I’m learning everything from scratch with no support. I am the only person handling this area of the biz for an international company of 500+. 

My boss assured me I was not to be responsible for my former colleague’s work (unless the task was simple enough for me to do fast) but has infuriatingly put me on incredibly time consuming projects while chastising me for not doing my “actual” job duties. So now I’m at a point where I’m so anxious that I’m getting chest pains, frequent heart palpitations from high BP, dizzy/panic attacks and suicidal ideation. 

It’s clearly time to go and I’m applying for jobs, but as we all know, the current job market sucks. My ideal situation would be to get on unemployment and take a few months off to get my health back in order. I have personal savings that will last me 6 months, but having unemployment will be enough to pay my mortgage and keep me afloat for longer.

So any tips on how to best protect myself while slacking off enough to get a pink slip? Things I have been or are starting to do:

- telling people who email me directly with questions or ask for things in meetings to fill out tickets in our project management tool. This filters out the people who are asking more to look good to others than actually seeking answers (for instance, the types who ask for intensive analysis by a deadline but then never even open the spreadsheet I send them).
- pushing off requests or connecting people to a third party company we use that’s connected to my type of work. The problem with this is that this agency is reeeeeeeeally slow, so many questions ultimately come back to me, but I’m going to be more hardass and tell people to keep working with them instead of trying to help.
- Boss wants me to set up a bunch of meetings with stakeholders and do some kind of 101 presentation about my job. I keep telling him to let me get on top of my workload (it’s a busy season) so I can be able to focus on this better… but I don’t plan to set anything up. 
- Starting to leave work around the 4-4:30 mark (note, I tend to be one of the first in the office at 8-8:30 so I’m still getting in a full day, but it doesn’t look like it to people who come in after 9a). 
- I’m considering taking more WFH days (in hybrid 3/2). My boss has also criticized me for asking for extra even the he and tons of other people do random WFH days all the time. Not sure if this could could as insubordination though. 

Ideas appreciated! I kindly ask for serious suggestions and no comments about how this would be a mistake to not just line something up and quit - that’s easier said than done. I’m at a point where I fantasize about running into a tree at the bottom of a hill on my commute… that can’t be good.

1advb3q,Advice on museum/archive based careers,"
So I’m in a bit of a rough spot, first I’ll give some context. I’m 22F and I’ve grown up with a strong interest in music which I don’t really feel as passionate about anymore. I now treat it more as a hobby. In college I felt under pressure to choose a uni degree after being rejected from the uni I wanted to go to and chose music composition for film and tv. For the most part I enjoyed it but after a pretty traumatic event followed by a long period of depression I ended up dropping out at the beginning of my third year. I know without context that sounds like a really stupid thing to do, but I’m not going to go into why and how I made that decision otherwise you’ll be here all day.

I’ve spent the last year and a half working in a pub that runs events whilst trying work on myself a little more. It was fun, but not something I see myself doing in the long run. Now I’m going through a few career paths I’m interested in. So far I’ve been looking into stable careers that I can incorporate some of my interests like photography and photo editing, history and research into - so stuff like archivist, digital marketing, museum curator, conservationist etc

I recently went to a Holocaust survivor talk at a place that is kind of like a museum/talk Center and thought about how much I’d like to work in an environment like that. There was one woman doing a talk before the survivor came on, showing all these items like suitcases, children’s toys etc and talking about their stories. I quite like the idea of doing something like that. This place is a few hours from where I live though. 

I love history and would love to do something like museum conservation or curation and talk about artifacts to people, but I’ve read that you need a degree for any kind of conservation and I’m not sure I can get funding due to the uni situation. So my question is if it’s possible to get into a career that is museum or archive based without any kind of degree or masters that I can’t afford. I will be emailing the place I went to to ask about it as well, but I’m just wondering if anyone on here has any advice in the mean time.",AM_Carey,1,1.0,1,1706534909,2024-01-29 13:28:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1advb3q/advice_on_museumarchive_based_careers/,1,2024

 I have 2 casual employee's, one who works around 20 hours and one around 40 hours per week, I work around 50 hours per week, apart from Winter when our work load halves. My employee's have to be casual because if it rains and we can't work, money doesn't come in to pay them.

I probably make on average $80k per year. It's enough to cover my expenses and invest a bit but I'm not really able to save much which is going to make buying a house difficult.

I enjoy working for myself, I have created a good work-life balance, I can listen to podcasts/audiobooks/music throughout the day while working. All in all it's enjoyable, however like I mentioned if it's raining we lose income, winter time we don't get much new work, just our regular customers, but it's a 4 weekly service instead of fortnightly so I kinda just scrape by until Spring hits again. 

We've tried to expand into landscaping a bit to make more money, which I found enjoyable, especially while using a hired excavator, but don't get much work come in for it and only can handle very specific jobs as I'm not qualified in landscaping. 

I did personal training before this business took off, it wasn't what I was hoping, however I did love running kids classes so I've been strongly considering following a P.E teacher route in education. 

 I really want to go study to either upskill and become a qualified landscaper, or go learn more and operate an excavator, or go the teaching route, but finding the time for study will be tricky around work. 

What would you do? I'm 29, wife and 2 kids, sole income earner. 
Work is currently very busy at the moment being summer, do I get my casual workers to try run things while I go upskill? Maybe study 3 days per week and work 2? 
Need to still bring in money while studying.. 
This will still bring in some income but not a lot. 

Also any teacher's out there who can tell me what it's really like working as an educator, or anyone who's studied at a later than normal age like I'm looking to do please let me know what it was like for you.

I had a final interview with a company a little over a week ago. They told me the following Monday (last week) that they have a final interview on Friday that week for another candidate. The recruiter (she works at a third party firm) mentioned to me that their feedback is super positive and she even asked if they had concerns with me, and they said no and just want to interview this guy for due diligence. The hiring manager even had the recruiter share his details so I could reach out to him whenever to ask further questions etc. I was told they would hopefully give me a definite answer today. 

The hiring manager reached out to me today and says that they really like both myself and the other candidate, but they want to conduct one more interview with him as there are two things they are unsure about with him. He said for ‘full transparency’ they’re super sold on me and offered for me to speak with them more if I wanted to , mainly as a result of the delay. He said he hopes to get back to me by the end of this week but would really love if I got to catch up with him this week and meet more people at the company. 

I’m just unsure if this is bullshit or no. I know these excuses are often made when they need to buy time in case their first choice doesn’t work out. It would be cruel tbh bc they have been very positive with their feedback and super encouraging so it would be shocking if the ultimate decision was a rejection. 

The recruiter is going to catch up with the hiring manager this afternoon so will see what they discuss and if she will also be honest with me regarding the process.

1adsovv,What should I choose between career and family dividing in 2 countries?,"Seeking advice related to career between two countries

Hi

I’m having a hard time deciding what to do going forward with my situation. 

About me:

I’m 29f, IT professional with 7 years of work ex. I did my masters in Computer Science from Ireland. Prior to masters, I worked 3 years in india and this is my 4th year working for same company in Ireland. 

I got married in 2021 and moved to UAE (very traditional thing to do for Indians , the girl moves to guy’s place and starts fresh ).  My spouse works and has also been brought up in the same country. We don’t have any citizenship opportunities here. 

On informing that I’m getting married (2021) my manager was very kind to find an assignment in UAE initially for 6 months in order to give me some time for finding a new job in UAE. So I worked for Ireland , but on UAE assignment from UAE. This is called foreign assignment arrangement as per my company and usually a lot of benefits come with this like housing allowances / daily allowance/flights etc, but as this was for my interests , I was completely okay not taking any such allowances. To make it well documented , a small amount is added extra to my current salary in the foreign assignment allowance option for HR purposes. 

Every 3-6 months , this assignment was reviewed and extended in different situations until last - March 2024 . I kept working really hard in sometimes very stressful conditions /extra long hours /weekends/customer escalations  , got recognition from different people and managed to get great performance review from last two years as well. 

I also visit Ireland twice a year, each time for a week. This is to abide by tax laws and the rules that assignment shouldn’t be more than 6 months. To this , he asked to make it 2 weeks going forward for which I have agreed as well. 

Initially my manager told , we can continue to keep the assignment , while you try to find job. I also tried finding options in UAE for role , couldn’t find something as good or nearly good. I work on cloud technology which is still not that prevalent in UAE region compared to Europe. Slowly we understood that finding job is difficult for me in UAE , so my husband also tried to find job in Ireland but he couldn’t yet. He is in marketing and less opportunities there compared to UAE where he is much more settled. My manager now expects that my husband might move, but here my husband is unable to find new job as well. The company is also getting very strict on ethics and compliance , and my manager may not be in the favour of extending this set up more. 

I am also closer to getting PR for Ireland , which my husband and I both think is very helpful for us as we will not have this opportunity ever in the UAE. 

I’m not sure if my assignment will extend after March 2023.
I believe my manager won’t ask me to resign but would ask this to leave my husband behind , and stay alone in Ireland if I need to work towards citizenship. 
Or I quit my job and try to find a job in UAE and let go of the time I worked for Ireland / citizenship. 

I’m very confused as to what I should be doing. I’m sorry for this long post but it just keeps making me sleepless and I’m also tried of just hanging like this. 

Adding to all this, there is also a lot housing crisis in Ireland which makes it very difficult to find temporary accommodation each time.

1adsnsn,Just found out I’m 6 weeks pregnant. Unplanned. How does one decide between a baby or career?,"How did you guys or others you know decide between the two? Been with my bf since last summer. We fell in love when I was trying to remain single. It’s been rocky & we’ve argued majority of the time. I know it mostly has to do with how we both grew up within abusive families, causing us to have abusive romantic relationships. I guess we gave up on love & both became promiscuous, dating around a lot, but chose each other. 

I’m the oldest cousin/sibling & have always kinda been the third parent. Mine were always very controlling & didn’t “let” me leave for college or move out when I wanted to. Always were on/off so I helped raised my brothers lots. Wasn’t till last year I got my own apartment but only for half a year as I had a nervous breakdown & suicide attempt. Think I just finally was able to process all they put me through & couldn’t handle that on top of a new job & living alone for the first time. Though my parents are the reason for my depression, they took me back in & supported me until I moved out again last summer. At the time my bf’s lease was up, I had a 3br 2ba apartment, he had nowhere to go with his several pets & I invited him to move in. We’ve lived together most of our relationship.

I wanted to focus on my career, mental health, hobbies, traveling. Simply being alone & only caring for myself. Wait at least a couple more years before settling down. At the same time, I’m 31 & don’t want to struggle energy wise etc. to keep up with kids. So maybe this is happening for a reason right now? I also have lots of years in prop management & know that I’ll have no prob continuing to move up & working those types of jobs from home even while pregnant & after taking a break for kids if I had to.

My main concern are his pets & how often we argue. Maybe I’m too damaged & immature for a real healthy relationship. Idk how to communicate & lash out a lot. He’s brought up going to therapy together several times which men I know rarely do so that’s a plus? 

He has a cane corso that is too strong for me to walk. He struggles to also & just doesn’t walk him or play with him enough. A chihuahua that is super aggressive with ppl/dogs, is basically potty trained but is just so sassy she purposely goes the bathroom wherever whenever in the apartment. Especially on my clothes & belongings. He also has a couple cats that I have to remind him to change the litter for. 

I try to keep in mind how right before we met he lost his grandma to cancer & had a big accident, broke both legs. Started working again soon after bc he ran out of money so his legs never healed & he’s in lots of pain. Right before all that he had just returned to Cali after living in Kansas alone for a couple years. There he became a fitness model/body builder. It took a lot of self discipline & commitment to change his life, habits, etc. we both grew up chubby & unhealthy. This is something that makes me feel as though he really has just been depressed like me & can change. He was going out every day drinking & stopped for us. I dated an alcoholic before who I helped become sober & it seemed so difficult/life sucking for him. All these life changes, I’d have a hard time keeping up with my pets too.

He’s been super supportive about the baby & has always wanted to be a father. Doesn’t let me drive & even offered to support us, that I don’t have to work while pregnant. He’s got five sisters who are very judgmental & his mother is too (she has 3 different baby daddies so is no one to judge). Never met them but I’m dreading it. During our relationship he developed REM sleeping disorder so I’m constantly anxious & never get a good nights rest as he kicks & punches me all night. Just thinking about all the possible deal breakers. I’m worried that eventually I will resent him more than I already do. That I will also resent the baby & just hate my life. I’ll never be alone again. Have to care for him, the baby, and help with 4 pets? I’ve had one abortion before & worry that if I do that again then struggle to conceive later that I’d regret it big time. Also feeling like I’ll regret never being able to become that successful independent career woman that my mom always wanted to be. Instead she gave that up when she had me, an unexpected pregnancy too. She recently expressed feeling like she wishes she never had us & I don’t want to end up like her. What do I do? :(",moonstone_92,1,0.4000000059604645,17,1706525853,2024-01-29 10:57:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1adsnsn/just_found_out_im_6_weeks_pregnant_unplanned_how/,1,2024
1ads7du,Support Worker — How do I ask for a different client?,"I’ve been a support worker for a while I love my job. I’ve just recently moved to the UK from Canada and started at a new company. I’m used to working extremely fast-paced 8-hour shifts in a care facility which means I was interacting with dozens of people throughout my day, and while it could be overwhelming, it was very rewarding.

I am now an in-home support worker and I deal with one client who is mostly non-verbal but is quite independent otherwise. He does not like to engage with us and he does not like to go out. 

My shifts last for 48-hours (two full days and two sleepovers), which means I get 4 days off. That’s really the only benefit of this situation. I’ve been doing this for two months and I am burnt out. It’s not a difficult job, that’s the problem. I’m doing virtually nothing all day and I have nobody to interact with so I’m either reading, scrolling on my phone, or watching TV. I’m feeling extremely frustrated already and I dread my shifts. I know there are probably many other clients within the company who I would be better suited to. I’m very creative, I love music, I am super sociable, and most of all, I’m new to this country so I would be excited to get out and explore the city with someone who is eager to do things. 

How do I bring it up to my manager that I would like to work with someone else? This is affecting both my mental and physical health (there is black mould in the bathroom and on top of that, he is obsessed with glade plug-ins which triggers my allergy laryngitis. I lose my voice every time I’m there). Any advice would be helpful.

1ads0y1,"Feeling Stuck for 4 Years: Procrastination, ADHD, and Fear Holding Me Back .","Hello everyone,  
  
I'm a 24-year-old male who recently got diagnosed with ADHD, and I've been facing some challenges over the past four years. I'm at a point where I could really use some guidance.  
  
During this time, I've struggled with procrastination, ADHD, analysis paralysis when it comes to choosing a career, and a general sense of fear holding me back. I've moved from job to job, mostly in blue-collar roles, experiencing anxiety in work environments and social situations, coupled with overthinking.  
  
My academic history reflects my struggles, as I was not attentive in school, often lazy, and barely managed to pass secondary school with a trade diploma that seems useless. I attribute this to my ADHD, which made focusing and studying challenging.  
  
Whenever I thought I found a career path, I'd start working towards it, only to lose motivation and begin doubting myself after a few months. This cycle of choosing, doubting, and procrastinating is taking a toll on my mental health, and I fear I might go insane if I continue in these loops.  
  
I've taken various career tests, sought advice from career counselor, and settled on an interest in IT, specifically iOS/Android programming or CyberSecurity. However, I also have a passion for music. I feel great when producing or listening to music, particularly techno, and I've had a childhood interest in DJing and video editing. Yet, I struggle with the idea of pursuing a creative career, thinking it might be impractical due to my limited history with music, lack of formal education in the field, and uncertainties related to my location, especially with the rising tension in the Baltic states.  
  
I'm reaching out for advice because my mind keeps cycling through these doubts, and I'm struggling to make a decision. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I appreciate any guidance or encouragement you can provide.",cntzas,1,1.0,1,1706523263,2024-01-29 10:14:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ads0y1/feeling_stuck_for_4_years_procrastination_adhd/,1,2024

So I've finally decided to resign from my new job, its been 2 months and my probationary period is 3 months.

My contract said 2 days wfh out of 5 but once I started, O had to be trained for 3 weeks then I started training another 2 employees, never got to wfh. The pay is also bad considering the daily commute to work, fuel costs, etc. 

I dont know I have never left a job so soon, is it very rare to leave a job during probation? I have a break planned on for the next 3 months (basically spend time with my parents, healing myself and take care of my mental health). 
I feel guilty, and I will have to let my manager know 1 week prior (notice period is 1 week). How would I face everyone in that 1 week? Would it be awkward?

1adnlau,Please give me some advice?,"I'm going to keep this as short as possible. Would really love to get some opinions.  
Like many people fresh out of college, I didn't have the faintest clue what to do with my life. That was almost 15 years ago, when I took up a digital marketing job in an agency. Went on to do an MBA in marketing few years later. To be frank, I don't think marketing is for me. I find it quite superficial, with a lot of toxicity and cut throat competition. I've always been a shy, introverted person who loves observing and analysing things. In marketing, I'm forced to speak a lot which really drains me.  Presentations still make me super nervous. Wanted to study anthropology or psychology in college, but dropped the idea due to poor job prospects. I now feel stuck in this industry where I've reached a decent level with high pay, but it brings me absolutely no joy because of the poor work life balance, constantly being on the brink of burnout and basically having little passion for what I'm doing. I've had around 6 jobs in the last 12 years and I have hated all of them. No passion for what I'm doing, the toxic colleagues, unsupportive superiors and poor work environment has really taken a toll on my life. Quit my last job few months ago and have been trying to heal myself from burnout ever since. I have also developed pretty bad insomnia in the last couple of years. I generally don't feel very good and my career is eating away into my soul. I want to do something that gives me more time to myself and work life balance, even if it pays less. I was thinking of a career change, maybe get into UX or product design, but I'm not quite sure where to start. I'm burnt out, tired and don't have the motivation to do this anymore. I want to get out of marketing, and agency life. Would be great if someone has been where I'm at right now, I could definitely use some moral support.

It's a gravy easy job with good pay $38 an hour and so easy, pretty much non labor intensive. I may have the opportunity at my current work to move out of the shift work to a millwright apprenticeship. I'm giving it thought because my job right now is easy and laid back but the shifts are kinda hard to deal with at times. The other hand is I can maybe now move into this apprenticeship and go back to school paid training, and go back to the normal working Monday to Friday 8-4 gig, but the catch is it's not gonna be an easy gig. I'll have to learn a lot, go to school, work in extreme hazardous environments, dusty, chemicals, work extremely hard with toxic coworkerw, with lots of heavy labour. I'll also lose on a lot of vacation time and have to work with minimal time off throughout the year compared to what I've been doing. 

I'm 32 and I have injuries as well, low back and shoulder, so I'm trying to factor in if it's worth it to stick to an easier job doing shift work or take a hard job but normal hours. They both have ups and downs. I would get the same wage and progress a bit higher in the fourth coming years. I'm just nervous of the intensity of the labour in the role, my mental my health is suffering from both sides, but the routine definitely intrigues me because nights have become more difficult in the recent years. I'm looking for some honest input, I feel I'm gonna try and do it anyways because at this point I'd like normal working hours but once I make the choice that's it and I'm out of shifts into daytime hours permanently, and a heavy workload.

The issue is I don't know what to next. 

I am currently earning 68k plus bonuses and super p.a. i am just looking at jobs listing with warehousing roles and reception rolls paying 80k.   I don't want to go backwards with wages because  I have a mortgage and bills.

1adhkx7,Career advice post-grad,"I am a senior that goes to school in Arizona that is graduating in May. I did a summer internship with Wells Fargo this past summer and received the return offer for 70k plus 5k bonus in Charlotte, NC. I also am doing an internship right now during the school year at a smaller technology company headquartered in AZ. I am still waiting to hear about an offer from them, but would it be better long term? 

If I move to Charlotte, there is always the opportunity of going to a decent grad school because of UNC Chapel Hill, Duke, etc and having Wells Fargo on my resume. 

However, if the company I am at right now matched WF offer, would it be worth it to stay? I like the people I work with and the tasks I do, but I’m not sure if it would be harder to get a better job in the future compared to WF big name on resume.

I want to stay at a job min. 2+ year to not be a job hopper and build some actual connections, but my savings are 0. The company, job, colleagues are actually very nice but just salary isn’t. 

I noticed financial stress really gets to me and is a somewhat traumatised issue due to financial troubles in my teenage years, so this genuinely is getting to me yet I don’t really want to leave to a better paying job. What should I do?

I can save but my savings dried up cause I flew often for family emergencies or genuine special occasions 2 countries away, friends from there visit me as a vacation destination which drained it too.

I already decided to refuse visitors or at least not hang too much if they come + I won’t fly back unless it directly involves my parents. Yet I still won’t save a decent pace.

On top of that, I have a busted ankle so I can only do desk work.

I have never lasted a full year at a job without taking a mental health leave. However, I’ve only ever worked in customer service. 

I’m on leave right now for my mental health because I was getting so drained from my job - I couldn’t keep up with having to word things perfectly and immediately while solving complex problems. My plan was to work part time in a different field after my leave, and hopefully transition into a full time role in a field that’s not customer service either.

My dad, however, thinks it’s time to go on disability.

I want to give my job two weeks notice before moving onto a part time job so that when I interview, I won’t have to say that I was let go due to my disability. My dad believes I SHOULD let them fire me after my leave so that I have a stronger case for applying for SSDI and SSI benefits should I need them down the road.

What’s your take? Should I give notice to build my career or let them fire me to build my disability case?

I was okay with the decision at first. But after a roundtable session with other hr dir and vps I'm like....I know JUST as much as these folks. I'm building the dept from scratch!  But I've been denied the title that I am already doing not to mention the pay.

I can see the potential to move up and go places in this industry. I like my job and my boss. But...how long am I going to wait?

So now, applying to optometry school, I am continuously getting rejected due to my gpa. I'm starting to think this career may not be for me, even though I have worked in the field for 6 years. I love eyes and it feels like its the only thing I would enjoy doing day in and day out for the rest of my life so I did not even consider other paths. 

Now I find myself in a rut, working at a job I am underpaid and overworked, with no direction. I could do a masters and try applying again next year, but I have no idea what to major in. Ideally it would be something I could make a career with and optometry schools would accept so I can have options, so I was thinking BioTech.

I have been financially stable for the past 4 years and I dont want to give that up and I love the town I live in, but it is extremely expensive and I wont be able to stay without a full time job. 

But also recently, I am seriously doubting my intelligence. Everyone says I am smart, yet I cannot focus for more than 10 minutes at a time, so higher education may be a waste of time for me if I cant even time manage.

1adbs2f,Trauma vs. passion,"Ok this may be a bit of a loaded question: but how do you know if a career path is something you’re actually passionate about or just a trauma response. 

I was neglected and abused as a child. I’m currently in therapy and medicated for it- have been for about 6 years now and really into my healing journey. When I think about what I want to be when I “grow up” it’s always something that involves taking care of other people. Right now I’m in the medical field and love it. I’m going back to school for psychology right now (want to figure out what I actually want to do with my life before I get too deep in it). When I think about my future I could see myself being in social work, helping homeless, doing therapy, working at a psych hospital, anything that helps children and so on. But I also know I am pulled to these because I want to be the help for others that I never got. Will I always have this feeling? Once I’m more healed and learn more about who I am will I find another passion/career path? Choosing what I want to be when I grow up is so hard and I’m so worried about spending money on a degree I’ll never use. 

I also starting to learn to put myself first, so I want to take care of others but I want a career that compensates me for it. And a lot of these jobs don’t. I left ems because of the pay, I simply couldn’t survive off it and nursing pay is not worth it with everything you have to deal with.

1adbpop,I honestly don't know what the fuck to do now.,"17M, finishing school this year and preparing to go to a university.

I used to be a very computer savvy kid when I was young. I used to be obsessed with everything tech related and my dream job always used to be programming.

I learned my first programming language when I was like 8 and started fixing and repairing computers at 10. I started diving deep in programming about two years ago and learned web developement all on my own. I like doing what I do, I love writing applications, coding, implementing stuff and breathing life into ideas through the means of programming, but the current condition of the tech industry has me worried. I don't want to be the guy who blocks adblockers on YouTube, I don't want to be the guy who helps companies like Google and Microsoft track users and sell their data, I don't want to be the guy behind software updates which artificially slow down smartphones for companies to sell more, I want to invent, innovate, help companies bring groundbreaking innovations to the market, not stagnations. 

I honestly don't know what to do now. I **won't** work for a company who feeds from fucking over their customers, but at the other side, I don't want to pour my talent down the drain. Should I attend a faculty on CS or should I do something else, like EE or design?

1adan2e,What would you do if you were me?,"Hello all, I’ve been evaluating my career path recently as I have some new opportunities. Below are all the options that I see:

Corporate FTE
- Stay at current org or lateral move to another
- Stay in same industry 
- Predictable-ish progression and salary
- Top out at Director $250k… Maybe VP after ~20 years at $300k roughly 

Corporate FTE + contracts
- Stay corporate
- Stress about being caught (primary job technically doesn’t allow you to have external contracts on the side)
- Low progression (no desire to keep moving up to maintain workload)
- Lots of money to be made right away $250k today

Corporate FTE + side hustle
- Stay at current org and work on side project until enough salary from side project to replace primary job
- Eventually being own boss and running own company 
- Can potentially still take contracts from original industry while working on side hustle
- Side hustle: service based business. It could reach potentially $600k revenue at 30-40% margins within 2 years. 

Join startup
- Highest upside as business is already in place at $1.5M revenue with 20% margins and can get equity or profit sharing
- Highest risk as new unknown role (COO type) and new industry 
- There’s an existing path to scale the business to $10M in revenue 

Currently, I have the corporate FTE + Contract + slow moving side hustle as my bandwidth is so low, I’m spreading myself very thin.

**Offer 2: EY, Vancouver**  
Role info: Consultant in the Transformation Architecture team (within Business Consulting service line). This team does transformation (broadly some strategy work, operations, implementation and project management type work) for the public sector and government healthcare/insurance related issues (think multi-year transformations to roll out programs for provincial governments). This office has very limited opportunities to work with private clients, except for some possible opportunities in mining. I could possibly change office location later down the road to work on private sector projects but an office transfer will not be immediate (think 1-2 yrs down the road).  
Salaries for both roles are comparable and I am open to either location so these factors aren't influencing my decision. **My priority is to pick the role which will help me gain the work experience/learning to help land the best opportunities (in or outside consulting) 1-3 years out.** The questions I do have are:  
One opportunity is mainly public sector consulting and the other is more specialized as it is specific to payments projects - which role/experience would leave the most doors open in terms of what to pursue afterwards (since I do not yet have a clear target role/path I am focused on pursuing)? Assuming I don’t want to work for the government or for banks - which could position me best for things like future strategy roles at F500s, jobs at tech firms and generally anything else (e,g. product marketing etc.)?  
Will consulting only on public sector projects limit my opportunities/reduce the transferability of my work experience when applying to private sector clients for roles in the future, or is this simply untrue?  
Based on personal experience, are there specific pros or cons that you associate with each company (i.e. does one have a better name than the other; e.g. if EY seems to be better known for consulting while IBM seems to be quite bureaucratic/political etc.)?

25m working as a welder in the Midwest. Have 1 year of work experience and multiple certifications from school and current job. Myself and partner will be moving to Arizona later this year and I have questions regarding what I should do with my future. I was going to college with a major in business management and minor in finance. Completed 3 years and dropped out, went to welding school and got my certifications. My questions are what would my best route be. Try and transfer to an all online school and get a degree hoping for a position with a large company, or try and get into a trade apprenticeship starting at lower wage than current, and get my way into the industrial sector as an iron worker / welder. I know these are quite the opposite routes, but my mind is torn right now on the best outlook for the future.

1ad90bi,Possible jobs for someone's who's dream is to write and make art?,"For context, I'm currently on the premed track.

1ad8v73,Are some people just not cut out to work 9-5?,"i’ve had a 9-5 job since the end of last august. i enjoyed it at first, it was a new environment, new people, id never done it before so my brain and body were not used to the cycle, it was too preoccupied with experiencing all these new things. 

almost 6 months later, i feel as if it’s literally killing me. i’m always so tired and miserable. i come home, maybe play video games or listen to music for a few hours and then go to sleep or doomscroll. it’s been that way for 5 months, and will continue to be this way for at least 4 more years because of a contract. 

i’ve tried to change things. i’ve started working out or reading when i get home, but it hasn’t changed the way i feel. i feel like i’m stuck in an endless cycle that i can’t escape from. i feel so lost, i don’t know what to do. 

i thought it was be easy to just sit in an office all day and type shit on a computer. it’s not physically or mentally difficult, so why is it so hard?

one of my coworkers is the complete opposite of me. he’s motivated, wants to be rich, have tons of cars, live in a big house, etc. he does lots of research in certain fields that he’d like to change to in his free time at work. i’ve tried doing the same, but i just don’t have the energy.

but when i do have the energy, i just stop halfway through and think to myself, “what’s the point of doing all this work and creating all this stress for myself to help create someone else’s dream?” it makes me feel like a cuck. 

i’m starting to think this job, or any job in general, just isn’t fit for me. i think that my brain is just broken and isn’t wired to cope with work.

1ad8fpb,Promotion but I think the company could be failing?,"I am trying to keep anonymous but here is some background on my situation:  
\- I work in graphic design at a company that is owned by a larger holding company. We have five other companies and have VC backing. My company has really underperformed and is being split off from the rest of the holding company, meaning we have to hire a lot of in house resources that used to be shared by others. The same owners will own us, they just aren't keeping us under the umbrella of the others.  
\- Underperforming and missing revenue. We have had nearly 30% customer churn last year, and had about 20% the year before. In my three years here the sales team has changed over twice. We also have had major product outages that have forced us to give back revenue to clients due to breaking our terms of service.  
\- I was brought in to this company from an acquisition. My old boss didn't get along with the president and was let go. She has trashed this president and says they are not very honest. I think there are some sour grapes but I have reservations reporting directly for this person based off feedback I've heard from others who are more neutral, some of them even still work here so they aren't as bitter.  
\- I was offered a position of head of marketing. I used to do some graphic work for our sales team but I need to create strategies, demand gen campaigns, and learn Hubspot, which I've never used. I will not have a direct report so it's on me from concept, planning to execution. I might get an intern but I was told that cannot be guaranteed.  
\- As part of this, I was offered equity in the company. My current boss thinks we are getting sold in the near future because we are performing so badly that the owners just want to get rid of us. I don't know enough about equity to know if I can get a good payout from this or not if we get sold.  
TLDR, I think my company is going under, but I was offered a promotion with equity. I don't know if I am being set up to fail or if I could get a decent payout in a year or two if I really grind it out.",Budget_Concern_2526,1,1.0,1,1706464340,2024-01-28 17:52:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ad8fpb/promotion_but_i_think_the_company_could_be_failing/,1,2024

also if i go to school i can live at my parents for free(super lucky) so my other thought was get an easy degree that doesnt take hours of studying like engineering and do youtube during that time and just hope it is making money at the end so i can move out. and if not well ill get a job in what ever field the degree is in. well still pursuing youtube but i know it can be hard to do youtube with a fulltime job, less time to do so.

1ad5qu1,Work promotion delay,"Hey, 
So i have been working as a nurse in a big hospital for 3 years now and counting. In this hospital when you cross the 2 year mark you get automatically upgraded from resident nurse to registered nurse if ur doing the barr minimum with no probation or holds. I have a perfect PA from my manager and department leaders. I have never been put on probation or even had any ADE or issues.  I am a member of several councils, I do quality audits and basically do a ton of things for free for the sake of experience. I started my masters as well. 
 Everyone who started with me and even some who started later got promoted and I wasn’t. I raised the issue a year earlier to my manager and nursing admin and they cleared me and were even dismayed that I wasn’t promoted and sent emails to HR. I talked to HR on several occasions and emailed them. HR response was ‘ ur cleared and it was a system mistake, but we can’t give you the promotion because your PA “expired?”” Which they did over the phone and not email.
A new PA was done showed that I excel and yet they’re still gaslighting me despite sending reminders. The new excuse is “ we’re upgrading the career ladder and u have to wait”. 
They are hurting my career and cv since it seems like i’m still a junior nurse after 3 years  and they owe me an increase in salary for over a year now. I don’t know how to deal with this anymore any advice ?

1ad3ppw,Dilemma: Stay in a stressful job or follow your passion for fitness?,"Hello everyone, I'm a 22-year-old male living in Northern Lombardy (Italy).  
  
For over two years now, I've been working in the field of IT consulting, involved in website creation, and testing sites and apps for third-party companies. Currently, I have a permanent contract, and initially, I was thrilled to have found a job aligned with my school studies (I didn't attend university).  
  
I used to work 12-14 hours a day to gain experience and make a name for myself in the company, hoping that my efforts would be rewarded. However, all I received were poorly written thank-you emails from my superiors, imaginary pats on the back, and an unsustainable workload, especially when managing multiple diverse projects.  
  
I've always had a strong work ethic, largely influenced by my father. I rarely took vacations, never used sick leave, always prioritized work over everything else, including health.  
  
However, things have changed. I've noticed the company's lack of transparency towards clients and employees, which is not compatible with my work ethics. Throughout my career, I've contemplated resigning several times but tried to tough it out, thinking things would change. However, it's been like a rollercoaster with highs and lows, and I find myself in the same situation.  
  
I used to wake up full of energy, ready to face the workday and give my best. Now, I wake up counting the hours until 6:00 PM to finally disconnect. I look forward to Fridays to savor the weekend and give my brain a break. I feel like I've lost the passion and fire that once drove me to program for 12 hours a day for my high school thesis. In short, I'm completely burned out.  
  
A year ago, I joined a gym, and it completely changed my life. Every time I step in, I feel reborn, free from negative emotions, enjoying the moment. Not to mention, I've completely transformed my physical shape.  
  
In the gym, people ask me for advice, and I happily help everyone with a smile.  
  
Given my current work situation, I'm thinking of making a significant change in my life by diving into the fitness world, not just as an enthusiast but as a professional. I'm close friends with the owners of my gym, and they themselves suggested I take the course to become a personal trainer.  
  
I'm afraid I won't be able to find a secure job after obtaining the certification and completing the necessary courses.  
  
I would love to hear your opinions and advice. Has anyone made a similar choice? Does anyone have experiences in the fitness industry or has completely changed their career? What pros and cons should I consider?

1acy3ht,Corporate Politics - Avoiding a Potential Layoff - Advice,"Kind of a long story but I'll try to break everything down the best I can.  I work as a Sr. Systems Engineer at a Biotech research organization.  A majority of stake in the company is owned by a large private equity firm.  This has resulted in significant turnover not only in senior management but employee's as well even though our profit is up and we are still expanding.  Prior to the holidays management was not being transparent and a new IT partner was brought in.  This raised a ton of red flags.  I voiced my concerns and questions through e-mail and it wasn't until then that management, specifically the CFO stated to me that the future of my position as it stands right now does not look bright.  Our organization is heading in the direction of outsourcing our entire department but isn't completely certain if that decision will work. The timeline is to complete the conversion by May, 2024.  

After finally getting some clarity I started looking for stable work immediately.  I received an offer and accepted it even though it was a large pay cut (110k down to 65k).  My logic was that it is much easier to look for a better role while employed. If I turn down an offer and gamble on another one and it falls through, I could potentially be trying to survive on unemployment/severance for an extended period of time taking into consideration the current tech economic climate. 

 I went through two exit interviews.  The first was with our interim director.  He is now trying to get me to stay and is having a conversation with the CFO on Monday regarding my employment.  I informed him that there is too much uncertainty and I do not want to risk being without a job. My thought process is that in typical corporate fashion they were not transparent due to the fact that they need people to work with the new MSP until they are up and running. Once this is completed, we would be let go.  I had a second exit interview with HR and also voiced all of my concerns regarding what has been transpiring. 

 My strategy is to move on to this new lower paying role and offer to stay at my current company as a contractor or casual/part-time working after hours to make some extra money. This would protect me if they get rid of my entire department. On Monday, I am to receive news from the CFO and director on what they plan to do.  Basically, my director asked me if I would stay if I had assurance that my role was not being eliminated.  I don't have trust or confidence in our new CFO. 

  I've never been in this type of position in my 15-year IT career.  Am I making the right call?  If the CFO says that they will keep me on it contradicts his behavior and initial statement regarding my role.

1acwfm0,Wife is trying break into higher education in NYC but the market is brutal.. need advice,"So my wife (27F) and I (27M) are set to move to NYC in March and she has been applying to jobs but simply cannot get an interview. Little background on her..

Masters in Higher Ed Admin..
Worked 3 years as an academic counselor, 1 year as an admissions counselor, and 2 years (current job) as the assistant director of admissions for the college of nursing at a large university. She's great at public speaking, passionate about recruitment, and working with first gen students. 

I guess I'm just asking what she could be doing differently to get her foot in the door? If it comes down to it she would be willing to pivot out of higher education but she's unsure what she would be qualified to do. She's applied to some administrative/executive assistant jobs but also hasn't heard anything back from those. If there are any NYers in higher education in this sub we would really appreciate any advice.

1acvr67,Leaving my job - couldn’t sleep tonight,"Hey guys, I’m leaving my job as the title said and it’s really hard for me. 

I got an offer from a great company with better benefits and pay, it’s a 25% pay raise and I get more PTO and more. 

The problem is that I really like my current senior manager(the manager of my direct manager). We have a connection beyond work and we’re truly friends. He did everything for me including a pay raise of 33% last year something that isn’t really typical in this company. 

There’s another thing that makes this harder, I’m leaving to work under my previous direct manager that left a year ago. I really don’t know how to tell my current senior manager that I’m leaving. We work hybrid so he comes to the office only on Wednesdays the question is should I tell him on a zoom call on Monday? Or wait to Wednesday to do it face to face.

1acvjhx,Dental Assisting Training,"Okay… SO here’s a little background. I just turned 25 and have been having a career crisis. I figured I’d have a steady career by now. I had been in the process of starting my photography business since 2020 and have still been having to work a full time job to pay bills. It was getting too much for me. Too much stress, the photography was no longer fun for me; my passion was gone. I’ve been looking for a new career I could go far in. I’d like to be able to completely support myself and have a place to live on my own. 

I had been thinking about going to school for dental hygiene because the health care industry had always interested me, the pay is great and the schedule isn’t crazy. I decided to apply for this dental assisting position where they’ll train you. I don’t need any prior schooling. However, after the FaceTime call with the recruiter and then right after a FaceTime call with the doctor I’d be learning from I’m so SCARED. He told me the first three months are going to be super stressful and I need to have a very good memory. I’m doubting my abilities so hard. I feel like I’m super bad at remembering names, but so good at remembering faces. I’m not sure if that matters. It’ll be on the job training and I am a big hands on learner, but I’m nervous I won’t be able to learn at the pace he’s wanting. I feel like this is such a big step and I’d hate myself if I fail. He said 50% of his students fail/drop out, but also said, “a high schooler could learn this stuff”. I’d love to hear from someone in this field of work.

1acvh7z,Got negative performance feedback. Need help addressing communication challenges about new boss for Improved workflow,"I've recently was transferred to a new team at an ad agency where I'm struggling with a lack of proper onboarding and unclear communication from my boss. Despite my efforts to seek guidance and clarity, I often find myself left to my own devices, resulting in missed deadlines and unnecessary stress. My boss, X,  tends to take hours to respond to urgent queries and turns brief meetings into lengthy discussions that don't address my questions adequately. Additionally, there have been technical issues, such as not receiving notifications for comments on projects, further complicating the workflow. I'm eager to succeed in this role but feel unsupported in my efforts. How can I effectively address these challenges with my boss and suggest alternatives to improve communication and workflow?

I've received two separate ""warning"" messages from the higher up, Y, despite not receiving any discussion from X, and plan to meet with her next week to work this out. here's what her messages said. should i be worried? 

first message 

hey there! As we ramp up and get busier on [new brand] I want to make sure you feel empowered to manage and speak up about your job timelines. Our client is very sensitive to us delaying or missing deadlines so we need to make sure we are flagging any potential delivery issues as soon as they come up to IP/AS (for example, three things came back to you at the same time and you weren't expecting that and need to prioritize!). When you are assigned to a job make sure you see the timeline and agree to the time you have for each step. If we agree to the timeline, then we need to adhere to that unless another conversation is had (i.e. the scope has changed, the client delayed feedback, the client had wayyy more feedback than we anticipated). Also, make sure you are factoring in having things reviewed by [your boss] myself, etc (depending on the project) and giving yourself enough time to make changes. I never want last-minute scrambles or late nights/weekends to become the norm.

I know you’re out today, but I wanted to check in. I noticed that it seemed like you were a little distracted on yesterday’s project call and then I saw that some of the copy updates that we discussed weren’t pulled through before today’s internal review – so I just wanted to check to see if anything was going on, how your workload was overall, if there’s anyone on the team it would help to connect with to background more deeply, etc.

I have written a first draft, the introduction is given below and a link to the table of contents thereafter. If you have suggestions for more chapters or suggestions for the contents of the chapters, I am all ears for you. Thanks  
  
  
The world of work  
  
In the tapestry of life, the majority of us will inevitably find ourselves immersed in the world of work. For many, it becomes a dominant force that shapes our existence from the cradle to the grave. It's a curious phenomenon, for work is a multifaceted entity that we can both adore and detest, find riveting or mind-numbingly dull at different stages of our journey. While some individuals perceive it as the very essence and purpose of their existence, others view it as a mere means to earn a livelihood.  
  
Curiously enough, work often becomes a measuring stick of our worth. Our salary, our job title, and the trappings that come with success—a grand house, a sleek car, material possessions, and luxurious vacations—act as outward declarations of our greatness. I am sometimes confronted by my wife, who ponders why society tends to gauge success based on job positions and salaries, rather than focusing on personal happiness, fulfilling relationships, and the sheer joy derived from hobbies or artistic pursuits. The answer to that riddle lies within the grasp of our understanding; material wealth and social standing are tangible and quantifiable, whereas happiness remains an elusive concept, challenging to measure. Merely stating that one's primary goal is to be happy and content, rather than prioritizing a thriving career, fails to resonate with most people, particularly those perched upon the upper echelons of their professional journey.  
  
Geography exerts a fascinating influence on our perspectives towards work. In the United States, the pursuit of a successful career and accumulating vast riches seems to be ingrained in the very fabric of society, though pockets of the country have begun to embrace a more liberal mindset. In second and third-world nations, the sheer necessity to survive propels individuals towards ambitious endeavours; ascending the social ladder to higher-paying jobs becomes an intrinsic motivation for many. Meanwhile, in Western Europe and more progressive enclaves of the affluent world, a growing inclination towards achieving a work-life balance has emerged. People are increasingly drawn to jobs that are intellectually stimulating, meaningful, or aligned with their ethical values, even if it means sacrificing higher salaries or prestigious positions.  
  
Regardless of whether one aspires to climb the corporate ladder, seeks the fulfilment of engaging in captivating and purposeful work, or simply strives to make ends meet, a significant portion of our daily lives is consumed by work. Therefore, it becomes crucial to maximize the benefits derived from this substantial investment of time while minimizing the potential pitfalls.  
  
Whereas talent, dedication and interpersonal skills ultimately shape your progress, it is considerably helpful to have a universal guide, applicable to all individuals, irrespective of their work goals. I hope in this book I can holistically and concisely outline these essentials to make your path at work easier and more fruitful.  
  
Throughout my own life, I have traversed diverse professional landscapes, experiencing various roles within companies such as ICI, Shell, and Honeywell, spanning from office-based positions to the realm of factory operations, from corporate to entrepreneurial jobs. Additionally, in my student days, I had the opportunity to embrace a myriad of jobs, from serving in restaurants and bars to toiling on farms and engaging with customers in the retail sector. Along this journey, I stumbled and made countless mistakes, often wishing for a comprehensive guidebook to illuminate my path. Now, with the chance before me, I hope to write the very book I yearned for—a universal compendium of wisdom that is holistic, concise, and hopefully comprehensible.  
  
Your voyage begins with navigating the uncertainty of the first six months at a new job, a time when one finds oneself under the watchful eye of probation and scrutiny. This period warrants a special mention. From there, I shall give insights on achieving work-life harmony, regardless of an individual's unique work priorities. Subsequently, I will offer practical suggestions on crafting an effective curriculum vitae (CV), securing job interviews, and excelling in them. Lastly, I shall distil the essence of my earlier work, ""Climbing Your Life Tree,"" summarizing the transformative process of becoming happy and successful over time.  
  
The path to work-related fulfilment and prosperity awaits, and this book will serve as an invaluable compass, guiding you towards a future where you can live up to your potential.

Hi, I’m 18F and in my first year in university, I major in english - but of course, as one does, I had an epiphany, which draws me to my current question/dilemma.

What undergraduate degree should I pursue to join the environment and sustainability field. I am not overly interested in math, but I can stomach chemistry, and I quite like biology. I am especially into the political aspects of conservation and sustainability. My ideal career falls within Canada’s Ministry of Natural Resources and  Forestry or something similar. 

I would greatly appreciate some recommendations for well regarded programs in Canada.

Or perhaps some careers within the field that meet my criteria!

1actkwj,"(Houston, TX) Internship has become a hostile environment, but owner is very well connected in local industry. How do I leave?","Sorry for the long read yall. I appreciate anybody that can help me out.

Hello,

I just need some advice. I’m currently in college and will graduate in May. I’ve been at a real estate internship for about 8-9 months Mon-Thurs, and I work retail Fri-Sun. The real estate internship is with a small company of about 10 people. The CEO is an older lady and she’s honestly a very hostile person. I’ve witnessed her fire 6 employees since I’ve been here, and the firings are usually pretty brutal. She gets angry very easily, and she insults her employees behind their back pretty often, including insulting their weight .

Her sister is in charge of accounting, and I’ve been working under her sister primarily and helping other people here and there since I started. Despite them saying it is a “learning environment”, her sister in particular can be quite derogatory when you ask questions about what you should do about this or that.

While I witnessed other people experience the owners wrath over time, I just kept to myself. This thursday I was the direct victim of it, including her indirectly calling me out during a company meeting, then yelling at me directly afterwards. Not only that, but her sister came to my office maybe 20 minutes later and belittled me to the point that I couldn’t get words out anymore and felt genuinely terrible. It went past discipline and became personal. Basically calling me a “know it all”, saying that I don’t listen, I mess everything up, I’m not a good team worker, and saying that I don’t know shit, that I make mistakes and don’t learn from them, etc. I don’t think any of this is true at all. I’ve always tried to use the opportunity to learn, and any mistakes I’ve made I’ve always wrote them down and made sure to never do them again. I have two notebooks full of things I’ve learned, including how to do things their way. 

A lot of the accusations thrown at me just felt incredibly personal. I’ve never been directly attacked or told by them that I was doing anything majorly wrong before, so I’m not sure where all of this came from. I feel like I’ve done some pretty great things to help them out and I’ve always done the best I can. They said a lot more, and there was a lot of cussing involved, but you get the gist.

Regardless, the way they made me feel that day was absolutely terrible. While they basically already threatened to fire me, I do not want to work there anymore. I’ve worked retail for 7 years and had some pretty terrible managers over the past 7 years, but I’ve never had anybody belittle me and shit on my work ethic and intelligence. My work ethic is something that I pride myself on. 

The issue I’m having is that I don’t know how to leave. My boss is incredibly well connected in the local real estate community. She knows billionaires, she’s on the board of a local charity, she knows the mayors, and she’s in the board of the police department. She knows EVERYBODY. I want to quit on the spot, but I’m scared that she would drag my name through the mud. I’m about to graduate, and the last thing I need is trouble finding a job.

How should I handle this? What do I tell the CEO? Do I tell her why Im actually leaving, or should I just say that I want to focus on school? Should I quit now, or should I suffer for 2 weeks in order to try to maintain professionalism and give 2 weeks notice? I genuinely dread returning to the office on Monday, and I can’t imagine how terrible those 2 weeks are going to be if I give 2 weeks notice. I don’t give a shit what they think of me at this point given the way they treated me,  but I’m not sure if I should be professional and give them notice or if I should tell them to eat shit and quit on the spot.

I still have my second job for now, so money isn’t the biggest concern. 

Thank you all for your advice.",necesito_quesadilla,1,1.0,5,1706414114,2024-01-28 03:55:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1actkwj/houston_tx_internship_has_become_a_hostile/,1,2024

1acougz,"Questioning my career and dealing with burnout, advice?","I’m 24M with a degree in construction management nearing the 2 yr mark postgrad as a Assistant Superintendent/Superintendent. [TDLR below]

Post-grad has been very difficult personally and I’m struggling with my career choice and the burnout I’m feeling. I’ll preface by saying, I’m very thankful for all the opportunities, the financial stability, and do not take my privileges for granted. 

I have long loved construction and building. I am a self taught carpenter of over 5 years and have a high aptitude for building and problem solving. I do not doubt my passion for construction. It consumes a lot of my free time in terms of media and personal projects. My work does not instill that same passion, or at least my current company and discipline do not. 

I have worked several disciplines of construction since HS. Industrial rigging, residential, linear (asphalt), and commercial. I am currently an Assistant Superintendent for a small commercial general contractor (Max 40 employees and Max $40M revenue). The company does primarily tenant finish [TF], new construction [NC], and pre-engineered metal buildings. I mostly work on TF and NC. My current company trusts me and is eager to grow me so they have allowed me to oversee projects as Superintendent among the other jobsites that I worked under another superintendent. Trial by fire if you will, they have been great learning situations and I have grown exponentially from them. The work itself and the expectations are not what I struggle with however.

Early into my current job, I realized I did not enjoy this company but also considered the fact this is my first career job out of college and I need to really commit time to the company to see how things develop. It has been nearly 2 years since that point. There have been lots of highs and lows. Very glad I stayed to get the experience and make the mistakes but I don’t truly feel any different about the company itself. One of my biggest concerns is how old school this company operates compared to most modern GCs. They don’t have the structure or resources to develop me efficiently. I don’t want to waste 5-10 years to reach a point that another company could have gotten me to in 2-5 years. Based on my experiences with other companies and my understanding of this company, things are inefficient and outdated. We basically use no software and have a lot of informal communication between subs, project managers, architects, and owners. I see it as a major disadvantage to learn this style of operation if I transition to another company that has heavy software usage and uses a lot of the formal documentation. Don’t get me wrong, they’re great folks and a reputable company. I just don’t see it as a great fit for how I want to develop my own career. To each their own. That’s the company side of my predicament.

As for personally, I have just been struggling mentally with what I want out of my career and daily work. I prefer field work and getting the work done myself but I also enjoy problem solving and collaborative efforts. I just feel very unfulfilled by this work. Being given a set of plans to build that I had no hand in and need to execute to a T. (Side note, our company does very minimal pre-construction and doesn’t involve superintendents in the little pre-con that happens. They also don’t give supers time in between a project ending and another starting). I can preform under stress, I can meet an expectation. I can juggle the responsibilities and expectations, it’s a matter of if I want to. The biggest question I ask myself is do I want to be a GC superintendent. Do I want all those responsibilities at once? I know I can handle the pressure but I know I probably won’t be happy. It’s a dilemma of is commercial superintending the problem or is construction the problem? Would I be happier working in another discipline or in a specific trade rather than overseeing them all? I digress, I am just attempting to give y’all the insight into the conversations I have with myself.

I love residential construction and have loved many of specialty trades I worked in. Many of those jobs were far more enjoyable, partly bc of the coworkers but still. This current job has moments of joy but is not overall joyful. I know work is work and will have plenty of unpleasantness, I just know I can find another company or industry that makes things more manageable. Currently, I feel like I’m on a crash course.

With that said, I am always checking job openings and applying. In the last 2 years I have applied to nearly 20 positions that I would have figured would have potential but  I hear nothing back and never get any feedback even if I do receive word I wasn’t selected. It’s all a bit discouraging and I am trying to keep my head up. I know this is just a season of life that will pass but it gets the best of me at times. I know that was long and I could probably say more but I think I covered the bases enough. I’m thankful to be working, to have a flexible schedule, to be financially stable so overall I know I can sustain this job until I find the next opportunity but just want outside feedback. 

What advice do y’all have? What recommendations? Anecdotes? Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the responses.

TL/DR
I’m 24M with a degree in construction management nearing the 2 yr mark postgrad as a Assistant Superintendent/Superintendent. Questioning if my career or career discipline is the issue. My current company is fine but I have issues with the outdated operation and lack of quality career development. Struggling mentally if I want this current career choice despite being capable of it. Seeking more balance work/life and more fulfillment from my job. I have a passion for construction but feel that there is a better fit somewhere in the industry. I’m thankful for my opportunities and I know it will come to pass but I know feedback will give me perspective.

I am very conflicted because on the one hand I’m able to get experience in the field that I want to have a career in, however I fear that losing a job that provides stable income is something I would come to regret especially since I am currently a senior who will graduate this summer, so the stress of looking for another job to pay off my student loans is getting to me.

1acosnp,Finally Got a New Position but Still Pissed,"I finally got an internal transfer after a business partner told me and my manager “econ1mods1are1cucks has not been doing what we hired him to do.” 

I really wanted to say “I did everything you asked me to, you just don’t have any requests for me because you’re a bumbling idiot that opened an unnecessary position.” But instead I sat there and let my supportive leaders defuse the situation. My leaders even called me up and said they think I’ve done really impressive work and are going to try their best to keep me if I want to stay. 

So I did it. Grinded my cock off for a year, helping my manager’s program, and another team that needed another head. The other team really liked my work, ethics, and communication with partners. None of the partners here would dare raise their voice to me (maybe the team at large, but never singling anyone out that isn’t the lead). 

I’m still pissed at how the position went even though I was assured it was all mismanagement and not any sign of incapability on my part. Do I need to get over it now?

1acjtps,Navigating Career Challenges Post Personal Tragedy and During High-Stress Times,"I’m in a complex situation and could really use some outside perspectives. Here’s a bit about my background: I’ve been with a financial institution for five years, receiving yearly promotions and top performer awards. However, about a year ago, I experienced a tragic personal loss when my infant son passed away. Seven months later, amidst this difficult period, I was promoted to a very demanding role. Around the same time, my wife was going through a high-risk pregnancy, adding to the stress at home.

Despite my efforts to balance these challenges, my performance at work was inevitably impacted. I took a 12-week paternity leave for my newborn, and upon returning, I received a low performer rating in my review. This meeting included HR and was thoroughly documented, highlighting areas where I fell short of expectations. They acknowledged the personal challenges I faced and chose not to place me on a performance improvement plan out of consideration for my situation. My management has expressed willingness to support me in improving and even suggested the possibility of stepping down from my current role if I feel unprepared for it.

I’m torn. Part of me wants to prove I can handle this role, but another part feels overwhelmed by the idea of working in such a high-stress environment, especially with a perceived target on my back.

Here’s where I need your advice:

	1.	How should I navigate this situation at work? Should I try to prove myself in this demanding role or consider stepping back for my well-being?
	2.	If I choose to step back, how do I approach this conversation with my employer to ensure a positive outcome?
	3.	Any tips on managing high-stress jobs while balancing significant personal life challenges?

1acjn2y,Seeking advice for a transition. How to go about it?!,"
Hello! I have a degree in Media and Mass Communication and am currently pursuing a master's in sports management while working in the sports industry. Although I've been freelancing in operations, sometime back I had the opportunity to work at a major sporting event with a reputable organization. However, in the long run, I envision myself in Media operations. I've done a PR internship but lack extensive experience in media.

During the tournament, I shadowed the person managing media and gained valuable insights. I'm considering approaching him for guidance or even asking if he could help me transition into media within the organization. The hesitation comes from the organization being selective in hiring. Should I ask for his support and take the chance, or should I be cautious about potentially jeopardizing my freelance opportunities within the organization by overstepping? 

If I decide to go ahead, how can I convince them to consider me despite being relatively new to the setup?",evilspawnnnn,1,1.0,0,1706385984,2024-01-27 20:06:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1acjn2y/seeking_advice_for_a_transition_how_to_go_about_it/,1,2024
1acjf2i,am i getting fired?,"
I have been with my company for five years, and freelanced for them for two years before that. I’m in a director role that our company definitely only needs one of, there would not be multiple positions for this role. 
My manager asked me to set up some meetings recently. We have shared team calendars, most of my team it just says “busy” when time is blocked off. I don’t know if my manager knows but for some reason she’s the only person where I can see all her meeting info what all her meetings are. 

As I was looking for available times, I saw on her calendar “[my job title] role interview” and also another meeting with a recruiter. I went to the recruiters website and saw a listing for my exact job description and location. My manager is new and extremely toxic, always talking bad about every person on the team above and below her. She cancels our touch bases all the time and has hardly gotten to know me. 

We’ve had a lot of turnover and other team members being blindsided and fired due to the company being acquired in the last year and a lot of changes, budget cuts, etc.

I was praised quite a bit during the acquisition for my work and the new company gave me a very large bonus that not everyone got when we were acquired. 

Am i getting fired? Seems very obvious I am but i’m so confused why. I just had a review, raise and bonus in december. In my review they gave me a few things to work on in terms of being more responsive/quicker over slack/email. I’ve been working hard to improve there.

To make things more confusing, my manager’s boss reached out to me the next day and said she’s noticed how much hard work i’ve put in lately and that i’m so on top of it. 

Do I ask either of them about what I saw or just ride the wave until they find someone to replace me? If I get let go, can I put this job on my resume still? It’s a major part of my career and I don’t have a ton of previous experience outside of this.

1achio5,Co-worker initiated very intense “relational” call,"Hi - I’m going to try to explain this as simply as possible but to give a thorough description. 

My job consists of more or less being a project manager that teams up with different individuals in the company to help them bring their projects to life. 

For one of these projects, I had an instance where I went on PTO and didn’t send something into a vendor before I left, simply due to time crunch and an oversight. It was a thing that was due but not anything that would/did cause problems if it was late being delivered. The vendor followed up when I was on PTO saying they hadn’t received it, I apologized and asked my co worker to send it in. It was a matter of attaching a spreadsheet to an email and hitting send. She declined to do so I hopped on my phone on vacation and sent it. No harm, no foul, problem taken care of. 

She went over my head to my boss to complain. Which is very very common in the culture at my company, unfortunately. I explained to my boss what had happened and again as is the culture, I got a verbal lashing and moved on. 

Something else needed to go out to my colleagues clients. She asked me about sending it out, I said I can do that x way for you later today or tomorrow, or you can do it yourself, it was largely an administrative task as was the previous one. This upset her, she called my boss again, wash rinse repeat. 

This time though, I did call her and say hey, I can take care of that, and next time, please feel free to just call me directly to discuss any concerns, questions, etc you have and I will always be happy to do what I can for you. 

She froze and insisted on a on camera meeting. I said ok, find time on my calendar. 

I felt that I would need to record our conversation and oh buddy am I glad I did. She had a laundry list of complaints, from a position not being backfilled, to decisions being made by my managing directors, to the face that I was working on my couch, to that one time in October I told her I couldn’t talk on the phone bc I had my kids but I would address her issue via chat. When she got to the couch part, I told her I had to stop the conversation bc it was starting to feel personal. This was after 35 minutes of her ranting at me and me feeling like a therapist/emotional support/punching bag. My dog started barking at the end and she said “you’re unprofessional, you’re distracted, something is wrong here.” 

For further context, I am a single working mother of a 6 and a 4 year old. I don’t have a full office set up bc my ex moved out and took all the office stuff and I can’t afford to set up a full office yet, so I often work from my couch or dining room table. When my dog barks when I’m on a call, I always apologize, get her to stop and mute myself as needed. We’re a 100% remote company. Again, this person isn’t my supervisor. 

Those I think are the highlights and weirdest parts of our convo, though there was so so much more. 

The more I think about it, the more well, creeped out I am. It felt verbally abusive, overly personal, and like honestly she could escalate into further harassment. 

If any of the above makes sense, should I go to HR? If so, do I tell them I recorded the convo? What’s my ask of HR? Should I just try talking with my supervisor or here? I don’t want to unnecessarily escalate and the project is wrapping up in a couple weeks so I could just grin and bear it and hope she doesn’t freak out on me again? 

TIA if you made it this far! Wish I could post some screenshots!",ConfidencePractical8,1,1.0,0,1706380432,2024-01-27 18:33:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1achio5/coworker_initiated_very_intense_relational_call/,1,2024
1acha23,Mediocrity is slow death for a professional,"Can sound like a rant but when you are mediocre as a professional, it is a slow killer, at least psychologically. This is especially if your experience is increasing and you are no more a junior.

I mean you kind of get things but not the extremely complicated ones because you are mediocre. You kind of understand things but really do not know how to implement something useful because it requires too many details. The less experienced people who are excellent look at you with questioning eyes like why is this person even here. The management looks at you expecting that you will come up with something brilliant because of your experience but you simply can't. When something breaks you freak out as you do not understand the in and out of the system.

All the of the above because you are a mediocre intellect person.

It is good to be either at the low end or the spectrum or at the highest end but never in the middle. It is like walking in fog constantly doubting yourself.

First internship and I feel like my mental health is going to an all time low.,"I recently graduated from college and started an internship doing data science (DS) and I feel like I'm going to fail. I don't even know why they hired me. I didn't even study DS/CS/STEM. I literally took one ML class that had barely had coding/ modeling, and a couple introductory courses on DA/ DS. What seals the deal is that I was told I was only hired because the applicant pool was so small and the deadline to hire somebody was rapidly approaching. This and me having an excellent retelling of my projects definitely got me the internship...

These past few weeks l've been put on data cleaning duty. I'm taking days to complete these tasks. I'm asking questions, googling, and sometimes even working after hours just so I can get this work done. I'm constantly thinking about work after hours because I hate that I can't get things done faster and the fact that projects may slow down because of me. I feel useless and so behind. I feel like I'm going to mentally explode once I start getting assigned modeling work.

Despite all this though, I really do want a return offer from this company. I do want to continue working in DS. I love the team, office, and the free bananas. I really want to do well.

I do have a marketing degree but am having trouble on where or how should I start taking some online courses to make the switch over. I've spoken to a few business analysts within my LinkedIn network and have gotten great information and now want to take actionable steps in getting those skills. 

I've heard that business analysts need to be proficient and/or intermediate in SQL, Excel, Tableau (potentially). It also might be of benefit for me to get the business analyst certification - the ECBA as well but I don't know if that's 100% necessary.

Doing an MBA is not feasible for me, so it gaining these skills will all be self-taught.

I am in a position where my contract is ending in June 2024. And there is no light that will get extended and my position is moving to India. 

So I am parallel working and applying for the jobs. I know I am in already stressful situation. And top of it my manager is asking me to give daily status? Like how many hours I work? On what I work? And so on. 

Sometimes she wants me to work on weekends as well! But I will nt get paid for the over time. I am concerned if I say No she will hold grudge on me and make my life miserable for next months. Where I have to focus on my job search! Can someone give me suggestions how I can say no to her and have some peace of mind ?

1ace6u5,Client asked me not to report OT,"TL;DR Client manager asked me not to report OT. I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place.

I'm working with one of the larger consulting firms. The client recently requested that I provide some limited support a few weekends every year. They said that I would be able to comp the time so I agreed to it on those conditions. However I did also mention that I would have to report those hours in the timesheets and it would presumably be billable time. As I said that they had a very poor reaction basically saying that my predecessor also from the same consulting company did not do that and that I should have mentioned that from the beginning etc etc. They basically asked me not to report this time.

I don't know if I'm overreacting but I feel like they have put me in a very awkward position here. Yielding to their request doesn't feel ethical as I would be knowingly submitting incorrect information in the timesheets. However if I bring it to my employer I'm worried that it will be brought to the client's attention that I told them this and that I would ultimately be removed from the client project and possibly be out of work.",Emergency-Sweet-1095,11,0.9300000071525574,18,1706371774,2024-01-27 16:09:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ace6u5/client_asked_me_not_to_report_ot/,1,2024
1acdx5z,Post interview thoughts - should I run for the hills?,"

I had a job interview yesterday for a position in a small café. I have vast experience in that line of work, avid home baker/previous relevant experience etc etc. The interview started well but as it went on, I felt like they weren't actually selling the position to me very well. 
The owner of the café alongside a person who specifcally runs the kitchen were the ones interviewing me. They both frequently talked about how ""small"" the kitchen is and how little space there is to work efficiently. Despite this they said they usually have about 5-6 people working in there at one time? I've seen the kitchen, I think you could have a maximum of 3 people in there working comfortably. They also made a comment about how the pay will be minimum wage (which I expected) however the owner then preceded to comment with an eye roll ""even though the minimum wage rate has increased this week"" (the way they said it heavily implied they begrudge having to pay their staff a little extra). The other manager present asked me questions I felt were personal such as am I claiming any government benefits? They couldn't give me an estimate of the hours required, or how many days a week I would be expected to work? They also couldn't confirm for certain what date they plan to reopen for the season or what the menu will be. They are due to open at the end of March this year. 
Overall the impression I got was that they seem to be a bit chaotic and don't really know what they're doing. I was invited to have a trial day in the coming weeks in which they want to prep some dishes/baking etc. 
I'm really unsure about whether to pursue this further, as soon as the interview was over I got bad vibes and didn't feel very positive? I'm trying not to word vomit too much. I found the Other Manager very rude and frosty. The owner didn't seem particularly bothered about whether she wanted to potentially hire me or not.

July 2016-June 2019: customer service assistant, company A (auto industry manufacturer) making 32k

July 2019-December 2020: customer service rep, company A making 38k (during my time there, management told me they wanted to make me a manager someday, but I was more interested in marketing and didn’t want stay in customer service. They seemed offended. When the pandemic came, we began working from home, I went through a mental health crisis and clocked in late a few times, and my boss fired me. But, on my paperwork, it says I was laid off to position elimination.)

February 2021-May 2023: global planning support specialist, company B (agriculture seed company) making 42k (I was originally hired as a sales support specialist, but a month in they said they hired way too many and offered me this job. Market was terrible so I took it. I was not making enough money and struggling so looked for another job.)

May 2023-present: supply chain support rep, company C (chemical manufacturer) making 52k (my current company is severely understaffed and sack happy. Very toxic feeling culture. I’ve seen management cry due to pressure, peers be torn down and reprimanded harshly next to me, four people have been fired in six month, we are running on less than a skeleton crew. The office facility is not taken care of, people complain how cross bathrooms are, they are moving my department right next to one of the worst cities in America for crime. Lots of gossip and meanness.)

I also have a BA in Communications.

I would be making about 20k more if I jumped to that company. I would also have been working with a sibling.

I received a congratulatory email from our executive VP, however not one word from my manager. I did some digging and found out the he was notified seperately of my nomination the same time was. 

I was surprised that he has said nothing. He is never short of praise for the team and is usually quite supportive. I’m a little hurt and I am wondering if I should bring it up in my yearly review, which is coming up, or keep quiet? I don’t expect anything but maybe a “I heard you were nominated for an award.

1acbbu2,Setting up quotas for engineering positions!!,"So im in an engineering discipline that’s not related to sales. We work on wide range of projects, the environment is fast paced but we keep up with work needed and everyone is handling happily. Recently the leadership decided to add a quota to meet a certain amount of completed project per month! Even though most of these projects are long term at least 70% of projects take 3~9 months for completion. Then the manager started doing assessments based on that being a success measure and the whole performance evaluation is now backed by that. On weekly or monthly meetings the manager calls for who completed something and the whole team is being intoxicated by this. We switched from being very communicative and fun, to no one chats at all now. Silence in meetings is a strong sign of toxicity. I also hear about how stressful and annoying this is in back channels and most of the team is annoyed, at least i am. 
I think the manager is setting up the team for failure, with at least myself already looking for other opportunities and signaling availability for interviews for linkedin recruiters. To me this is pushing for sales-type strategy on a salary without incentives. I’ve done sales before, i know this isn’t going to work unless they add incentives. But the real reason it isn’t going to work is that engineers are not salesmen, they mostly hate sales or making cold calls, and the other reason is the timeline strategy and maybe they’re pushing for limits to get the best out by making the team competitive, the reality of engineers is they like stability and it’s in the core of their work. Competition for quotas in sales was a rollercoaster. I really liked this job until this happened a few months ago.

1ac9ln6,Software Engineer looking for a career change,"Hi, 28M, software engineer here earning about £55k (5 years of experience). I can work from home for most of the days of the week. The work is not really stressful and I can say I mostly work 9-5 without having to work extra hours.

However, I started feel a bit indifferent about it and I find it difficult to envision myself as a software engineer for the next 10 years, let alone until retirement. One reason is that I find it so monotonous to sit in an office and having minimal to zero interactions with people. Another big factor here is that I've realised I don't really enjoy programming hence I'm not the best at it.

I was thinking about alternative career paths in parallel with engineering since I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering.
One that got my attention was Sales Engineering.
I know that I'd be expected to understand a lot about the industry I work for and about the product I'd be selling. I think I'd be comfortable for this part since I was always better at theory (learning and understanding how things work) than practice (implementing and designing), hence my career path change..!

Now, comes the sales part which I have 0 experience/qualifications. However, I am eager to learn and take a leap of faith since I am still relatively young, I dont mind have to move to a new location and start with a lower salary and work my way up again. I've searched also for Master's degrees in sales and marketing. Do you guys think I'll be needing one? Most of the entry level sales engineering positions I've seen do not require any sales experience or degrees, however I was wondering whether it would help increase my starting salary. Or if a master's degree is not needed, are there any courses I should look into?

So that's my situation. What you guys think? Any recommendations are appreciated! Thanks in advance!",A_HoonterMustHoont,1,1.0,0,1706357780,2024-01-27 12:16:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ac9ln6/software_engineer_looking_for_a_career_change/,1,2024
1ac957k,Any advice in handling an unsupportive manager?,"I work as one of two hospice admissions intake coordinators.  Our position is WFH.

1ac864o,"How to deal with this weird work dynamics? Tl;dr workmate is probably hinting at me to get out, or save his own skin from being next","(long read warning, sorry need to rant)
I work as fairly senior and well-paid IC (not the top end, 
mind)  and I was referred by an ex-colleague (let's name him A) who's paid more than twice (likely top of pay range, keep this in mind as it's crux of the matter). Both of us are ICs under manager B who's reporting to skip level C. So A, B, C are the main chars with some background:

- A - jaded and aware that he's at the higher end of compensation for the work we do, but refused managerial/leadership work that C offered. Plays along with whatever B says, but tends to doom and gloom alot (I'll explain more in abut).
- B - competent, hardworking and fairhanded with the team. Though not as good as managing as hands-on. We get along well with occasional headbutts, but all team members find B hard to get ahold of and not good at keeping deadlines.
- C - your typical high ranked leadership who cares more about metrics and budgets. Has no idea/uncaring about what B's team (where I and A work) does and is always looking at optimizing wherever possible.

2023 was not a good year for team B. We didn't totally f-up but really under-delivered 2-3 projects and we failed to make ourselves visible/justify to push back on imposed deadlines. I believe it was fair to say that both I and A left the burden to B to manage up and keep us (the team) in sync, instead of being proactive as we should be as seniors folks in escalations/resolutions. C was pissed with the team and made it known in private to some.

After the latest convos with C, both A and B got worried and told me that shit is about to hit the fan, not sure about what and how. B told me that C wasn't happy and is reviewing all projects we do and possibly shuffle people around. That was reasonable, and B also hinted that it's totally fine if people in the team want to start looking for other things to do (in short, prepare for worst case). What A told me was more specific and unnerving - C asked about what happens if this person or that person is gone in order reduce headcounts most effectively, while also emphasizing how expensive senior folks are. What weirded me out was how I kept being mentioned (according to A, but I can't verify that) and asked about, but B our actual manager didn't get quizzed about me. That got me suspicious as heck because if I'm lined up, I'd be mentioned in the convo with my own manager. If anything, more than likely the most expensive person (A) would be next for cost-reduction so the cynical take I got is that it's more of a ruse A is pulling to tell others to leave first before A. Another context is I wasn't the only one A is telling this to. Another junior teammate wasn't happy with the bonus and again, A was doing almost the same speech about firing risks. Once is okay, twice or thrice don't add up. I myself am worried too, but talking to other folks and going to talk to C directly about my own risks and what I could do to improve my prospects along with career growth if possible.

So kind readers, please comment on whether I have the right read on this and what should I bring up in the skip level chat? I don't want to turn this into a mud slinging fight, just want to make sense of this mini drama. I obviously want to save my career too.",adtechdude,1,0.5,0,1706352106,2024-01-27 10:41:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ac864o/how_to_deal_with_this_weird_work_dynamics_tldr/,1,2024

1ac4uk5,How f***ed am I?,"29f writing from my husband's account. Please help.


So I was laid off back in October. Ive been out of work since. I was a software sales representative (basically an account executive without the title). I had SDR's, demoed the product,and met my quotas. Well, as all salespeople know, the market is freaking brutal right now. Seems like people weren't even giving me a chance to showcase my skills. Instant AI generated rejection letters, etc. So I added a few white lies in my resume. I put my last position as ""account executive"" instead of ""software sales representative""... I also put that I am still working there. A few of the dates were off by a couple months. I just tried to make it look better because I was becoming desperate. I mean... going to food banks and selling plasma type of desperate. 

Now I know a few white lies wouldn't normally be of concern, except I was interviewing for a Sales consultant position. There was two positions available; the Sales consultant position and the Senior Sales consultant position. I applied for both just for the hell of it. I had the initial screening interview, it went great. Then I had the interview with the head of sales who would be my direct supervisor, it went great. I did everything throughout the interview I was supposed to do. I came thoroughly prepared, and treated the interview as I would any consultative sales presentation. During the interview he said something that worried me. He said ""we had a girl about 9 months ago that lied on her resume and the background people, so when the background came back and they realized she twisted dates, we didn't hire her. We would've hired her with her real expybut she lied and didn't even put the right things on the background check paper.""... This immediately worried me. 

So I had my fourth and final interview with was a mock sales demonstration. I had to do a consultative approach and show them my skills. I did that, and to be extra, I wrote a cold call script as well and went over it with them. Apparently this impressed them so much, the next day (Jan 26). I got my offer letter. They offered me the SENIOR POSITION! The whole time I thought I was interviewing for the other position but after my mock calls I guess they decided to offer me the SENIOR one. I'm very proud of myself but I am soooo incredibly worried about the background check. Idk what to do. Without the lies, all my experience still greatly qualifies me for the position,but the lying is what I think is gonna fuck me. 


I still haven't accepted the offer because as soon as I do I know they'll be kicking off the background check. Idk what I should do. Should I come clean and beg him to still hiring me??? Should I block my TWN?? Idk.. all Ik is I swear if he hires me he will have the best employee hes ever had because I NEVER WANT TO BE without a job again. It's so hard out here.

1ac2jgc,previously loved the people but hated the job - now i love the job and hate the people,"my previous position i had a fantastic team in my department. we all performed different functions but had such a positive team dynamic. our executive trusted us so no micromanagement, it was a flexible environment, & we all helped each when we could to collectively contribute to a successful environment. the only issue was i actually hated the work i was doing. i found it boring, repetitive, & mundane.

i decided to make a career pivot to find a position more aligned with my personality & goals. i was extremely lucky to find the perfect position for me. it’s a completely different industry, department, scope of work, whole nine yards.

i enjoy the actual work i’m doing. i learn new things, & the workload / challenges are not a downside for me, it’s exactly what i was looking for. now - my problem is a toxic team environment. not everyone on my team is bad, i actually enjoy working half of them. 
but for the most part the entire company culture is an individualistic approach; stealing credit for others work, micromanaging, nitpicking & seeking to “out” members of their own team? i had my work stolen within my first two months & constantly get asked to “fix” others work so they can get the gold trophy. the outcasted members are the highest performers & the “bullies” have the most seniority/connections within the company. 

its extremely discouraging for so many reasons. minus working with a few narcissistic bullies, i actually feel very aligned with the company & the mission/vision. i’m excited about the future of the company & truly believe in the future success & want to be apart of it. but im feeling so drained & shoved out by the narcissists im forced to interact with daily.

1ac02l3,What should I do?,"Ok this is my first post. I've been a long time reader and now I need opinions.

This is a long story so please bare with me... I am from a 3rd world country, I came to Canada 5 years ago, I was a project manager in my country for 4 years. When I came here I applied to hundreds of positions and companies and never got anything remotely related to that. 
I started working on a pharmaceutical company as admin assistant and after 1.5 years I apply internally to an open position for project coordinator and I was rejected, during the feedback they told me that I needed more experience and/or studies. I believe the hiring manager didn't want to give me the chance. 
After that I applied to another one and I was promoted to audit specialist and I've been there for 2.5 years, I took mat leave in between and it's been 8 months since I came back. 
When I left, my manager was promoted and another manager came in, I didn't know her and she just has seen me for these 8 months, we barely talk and it's like I never felt great with her as with my previous manager. So recently she was promoted and her position was open, I was the one with more seniority and I believe with more experience in general. Anyways I didn't get the position, when I asked for feedback she mentioned that mostly cause she hasn't seen much of my work since I came back and that all my biggest achievements were from before I went on maternity leave. 
I was shocked, honestly it's been so hard to be back while your brain is divided in 2, anyways ... I have felt very uneasy in the team now, I loved my job and now I dread it everyday.
I just saw another project management position with the same hiring manager I applied 2.5 years ago. I am very thrilled to apply but I am afraid to be rejected again, I feel like I cannot take it anymore and I don't know how my manager will see me after 2 rejections. I just don't know what to do, what would you all do?

1abzmoc,Used to be electrical apprentice,I used to be a union electrical apprentice. Technically I was on my third year but I realistically only had 1 years worth of hours due to lay offs and slow work. I eventually left while till in my probation period because I started to struggle academically and I was generally unhappy with the career. I did make 23/hr at 21 which seemed nice but I was so depressed because I didn’t like the job it didn’t matter. I wanted to leave before I had to pay back 3 years worth of loans. Now I miss the since of purpose it had and getting paid 23/hr for only a years worth of on the job training was good. With it being union and having 3 years worth of schooling helped but now I would like to know if there’s a chance I could make the kinda of money again without having to go union. The 10 commitment with the 20k loan agreement was the biggest reason I left. I didn’t want to but trapped in a career and owe back thousands.

1abzep4,"Got fired from first job, unsure what to do from here","Earlier today, I was fired/terminated/let go from my first full time job since graduating college. It was over rules regarding leaving the building when I was still on the clock (after my coworkers and I finished all our work, of course) and coming back in to punch out at my regular time. Until my supervisor talked to me, I did not know it was wrong and did not realize I was essentially committing time theft/stealing hours. I now know it’s wrong and I won’t be doing it again at any job.

After being fired, I spent the day talking to HR, filling out an appeal form, and faxing it which took longer than expected, so that essentially took the whole day.

I don’t know what to do from here on out. I have six more months of rent to pay for and have to repay for a relocation package my job gave me. On top of that I have to keep up with my student loans and other bills. After the six months, I can move back in with my parents, I really think they would not mind, but I don’t really want to do that, nor do I even really want to tell them I was fired.

Should i file for unemployment? I’ve seen a lot of “what should I do after being fired?” Reddit posts recommend that. Should I look for a job to hold these six months over or look for a job in my field that I could perform but would have to commute for? I currently don’t have a car and, after being fired, don’t think I can afford one at all. However, I live in a part of PA that has public transportation, although it’s rather limited. On my Resume and LinkedIn should I even mention I had this job or pretend like it never existed? What should I do if in an interview they ask what I had been doing in the 6 months since I graduated?

1abyvzc,"Go for the ambitious role, or apply to the more sure bet? (Same org)","The same organization is hiring for an intern role and an ever-so-slightly-above entry-level role. I’m a career-switcher and would love this opportunity. 

Other than not having a degree in this field, I have the demonstrable qualifications for both roles. But, most other applicants will almost certainly have that degree and more specific experience than me. Mine is broadly applied.

The higher role’s description does state it’s ideal for those who have competed the internship. It also asks for a working knowledge of something I only have a passing knowledge of, but could easily deepen proficiently by reading a couple of books, as I have the right background knowledge and some spare time during this job search. And it is knowledge they want, not a practiced skill. 

The intern role is targeted towards college students, which I am nearly a decade past being. But I know I’d ace the interview if I got one. I meet every single requirement. 

My fear is that if I apply for the higher role and they don’t think I’m qualified, they won’t consider me for the internship. But if I apply to the internship and it turns out I could have qualified just fine for the higher role, I’ll be setting myself back by a fair margin (in time spent and in lost pay; difference is $6 an hour).

I’ve applied for a remote position at a startup headquartered in the US, which employs a global workforce without a physical office presence. I’m based in Germany.

As I’m nearing the offer stage, I’m uncertain about salary expectations. I’ve noticed that the salaries for US-based employees are significantly higher than typical German salaries for similar roles. This disparity has left me questioning how to approach salary negotiations.

I’m looking for insights on:

	1.	What salary should I expect? Should it align with US standards given the company’s base, or should I anticipate a figure closer to the German market?
	2.	Negotiation Strategy: In the negotiation, should I mention German salary standards, refer to the higher US figures I’ve found online, or use a different approach?
	3.	Experiences and Advice: Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it, and what was the outcome?

1abwvdw,I didnt expected what my new contract is unsure if I still should sign it,"My contract isn't what I expected do I sign it?

I applied for a job recently  before the interview I made it clear I can only work evenings and I made sure I asked if that's something they need and how many hours I'm looking for ( the job ad stated some hours I wanted) then said they're fine with that. At the interview we over my availability and desired hours plus any pre booked holiday they noted it all down I got the job. This week was training week throughout training it was brought up again not just me but others and their availability and it was again noted down and they were happy with it. Their website and ad said  guaranteed working hours from start. I didn't realise until post accepting the job they were a new business still building up a client base. 

Today I received my contract I quickly read it and the contract states "" zero hours- business needs"" I mentioned that I don't want to sign a contract if that's the hours that I'd also need cover (mornings and afternoons) because that isn't something I can commit to I was told that's fine were going to do our best to accommodate everyone but for now our client base isn't big so it's what you're given but will take your availability into consideration. I mentioned if they want my pre booked holiday dates too they said no nit needed yet they got the rough idea and I given them the months I'm away in.

I took the contract home to properly read it and they ideally want it  back Monday 

My concerns are ;

What if im scheduled a shift I can't work , what if the hours I requested aren't available. I was told first few weeks I'd be shadowing but again the current clients are morning only which I can't do

My understanding is my pre booked holiday would be honored as they given me the job and that was asked in the interview but worried they might not stick to that.

The probation is 3 months I don't know if I should give it a go and hope it works out as they originally agreed and sign the contract

I'm worried if I sign they will have that power over me to take what am given and if I don't I could potentially lose the job

I had to pay for my DBS check and wouldn't get that back until past probation abd I'm starting to worry I made a wrong decision accepting the job

I expected my guaranteed expected hours and working hours to be stated instead of business needs/zero hours. I currently have a job which they knew I wasn't leaving that this job would be around that and they were happy with that. Now I'm past training I feel like I'm too deep. The job itself is great and pay is really good there isn't a current guarantee they will be able to build up their client base fast but they're hoping to

It just feels like they weren't honest on their side from the start it just isn't what I expected. And I'm not sure what to do

Any advice appreciated. Thank you

Still, the job setting is a huge difference. The percentages aren't really paying as much as the maintenance job did.

Talked to psychologist, and a few colleagues, who all agreed I was being bullied. Nothing was done. I had to resign after I thought I found a decent new job. 
Then this new job didn’t work out. It was a new role. They got rid of me after some time sensitive projects were done. I felt like it was just supposed to be a contract role but they chose not to advertise like that. The role was there no more. Instead of making it a redundancy, it was made to look like a performance issue. No reasons were provided at first as they refused to do so. Later, somehow managed to get responses via gov agency, but it’s all lies.

1abvg9q,Is 27 quite late to be thinking about changing careers?,"
I’m a 27 year old CFD (computational fluid dynamics) engineer and recently I’ve realised it isn’t engineering that interests me. It’s create cool things out of programming and maths. Which has led me to think that I’d much rather be a software engineer. 

Except my background is mech eng. I have the maths skills. A little bit of programming. But I’m not a software engineer. So im about to embark on a shit tonne of learning. 

Except every time I start, I immediately start doubting myself. I start wondering if im too old to be doing this. If I should’ve done this easier and it’s too late. If it’s possible to actually get a job this way. Things like that. 

Are these thoughts right?",Reasonable_Roof_8629,1,0.6700000166893005,17,1706309546,2024-01-26 22:52:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1abvg9q/is_27_quite_late_to_be_thinking_about_changing/,1,2024
1abu2d2,Am I stupid for considering a bachelor's that I'll probably not use — 22YO and feel like I need to challenge myself more,"22M, finished junior college education and have been working as a full time graphic designer at this a tech consultancy for about a year now with pretty good pay. I’ve always thought I was more of creative and only realised I like learning a lot (esp system related subjects: financial markets, business, marketing and psychology), but do this all by myself and like to learn my own way. I’m unsure on the best path forward from here, can definitely see myself start up a business in the future but I'm unsure if I want to bet on this or maybe just go back to school and get my bachelors.

  
I like my current job, I work from home 3 days, and 2 in the office. But I’m uncertain if I’m making a mistake by not challenging myself enough and not at least committing to a bachelors in either finance or marketing. I have a decent understanding of finance and markets/investing since it was/is my hyper fixation for quite some years now, but being forced to study this will probably be harder than by interest/ambition.

  
Had some mild conflicts at work recently (my boss basically asking me to act like an extrovert, and also criticising some of my work but I’m most likely overreacting to the situation). He also wants me to be more assertive in working together and voicing up about my ideas more which has started to make me doubt my skills in this career. They fired my senior and a mid level designer and currently there’s only me and another junior. I’m not sure on how long-term this job will be since maybe I’m not the best fit for them socially and they’ll get rid of me (also feel like an outcast there sometimes).

  
Combined with the fact that I’m just 22 and have quite some time left I’m wondering if maybe it would be smart to just try and get my bachelors, just to fall back on and to sorta proof to myself that I can do more than just be creative, since I don’t really don’t see myself work a full career in finance — might change my mind but idk. Might also help me connect with more people since I meet very few people since I finished school.

  
Negatives are that I can only get a decent amount of subsidies (from Netherlands) in continuing to study if I attend in person, but I want to do it online fully and continue my full-time job. And working full time while also studying is definitely going to be a big challenge/investment too. 

  
**\[TLDR\]**  
Am I stupid for considering to go 20K in debt for a 3/4 year degree that I might not do anything with in the future? And if not a bachelors, how would you guys advice me to grow my skills and set myself up for success in the future?

My ‘official’ manager will be in office but my direct manager is on vacation until Feb 7th.

I am already kind of mentally checked out and am ready to have my one month of paid vacation.

1absr5x,[6 month update] $200k in student debt and lost,"First things first, yes totally different reddit account here. I deleted my old account but had the urge to update on this story shortly thereafter. So here we go.

Long story short, I went to college and hated it, graduated 5 years and $200k later with a Bachelor of Arts in General Studies, went to Chiropractic school for one year immediately prior, and finally dropped out of Chiropractic school after a year and started working for my father as a CAD operator.

After working for my dad's company for a year and some months, I've been able to express to him that I don't want this to be forever. I hate sitting behind a desk all day. I feel like I'm wasting my time. I don't really get to challenge myself on a day to day. He understood where I was coming from and from that point everything changed.

I started coaching baseball again, this time part-time. Absolutely, the best thing I could've done for myself. It's helped financially but also mentally. This little extra helped but it wasn't a massive difference.

For months I searched for new jobs. Random warehouse jobs, sales jobs, construction jobs, literally anything. But then after time went on I realized why look for those jobs when those are nothing at all what I want to do. I wanted to join the military. But in my eyes that's a huge step backwards, especially financially. But one of the main reasons I wanted to join the military was to make an easy transition into a police department. So I sent out applications to every department that I could find that was hiring.

I worked my ass off, ran my ass off, made sure all my interviews went as flawless as possible. 

After months of trying to get this to happen, I was offered a position with a police department that not only will be life changing financially, but life changing for my happiness.

And I'm happy to say that I finally did what I wanted to do with my life, and my parents couldn't be more proud.

Cheers

1abs58m,Stay or go advice?,"Looking for your input here:

I graduated from CC with an associates in cybersecurity 2022. While I was attending I landed an internship at a global cyber company as a technical licensing POC for a specific technology. This was May 2021 my internship was sent to end Aug 2021, but I was crushing it and they wanted to keep me on. They ended up extending me as an intern until I graduate.

While interning I was doing all customer facing work. Running projects by myself with all types of customers, anyone from fortune 100 to mom and pop shops.

Once I graduated the offered me a full time gig as a technical consultant for that technology. I was brought on as a Guinea pig (and told this) to see if I would be able to handle and succeed in the role, if not they would move me internally to something that was a better fit. They offered me 75k and a 5k sign on bonus. This being may 2022.

Well y’all I have been crushing it. I love the technology and we have some bleeding edge stuff and I am pretty damn sharp with it. So much so that I am a point of escalation for derailed projects to get them back on track and take on the difficult high visibility customers. I am on interview panels for new hires, assist with internal and external documentation even work with product to better the platform. I have Sr. Consultants ask me to join their calls and tshoot issues.

My responsibilities keep growing, but my pay is not. 2.5% bump both years with overachieving on my performance evals.

The Sr Engineers I am diagnosing their problems for are in the range of 175-225k I have confirmed this with them. Meanwhile I am still right around 80k, with no promotion in sight.

1abotwr,How to Terminate a 'Career Coach',"Since the 'career coaching' sub is dead, this seems like the best place to post this.

I was gifted 5 sessions with a career coach. We have burned through 3 sessions, but it's clearly a bad fit. I would like to get refunded for the remaining sessions (on principle. I cannot abide wasting the gifter's money)

For context: **I am a mid-career professional with my MBA and work in tech/finance** 

Some details, without going too deep/making this post too long...

* She insisted that she has experience relevant to my industry and where I am, but most of her advice is either bad, or seems targeted to entry-level, simple jobs
* She had me do the Enneagram to 'see which careers fit me' (I kept an open mind, told her the results did not resonate...)
* She insisted that a cutesy Canva template with a headshot was a great idea,
   * She worked as a recruiter for 15 years and thinks this is good advice?
   * dug her heels in when I mentioned that a photo/funky templates cause problems with the ATS, look unprofessional, or even opens potential discrimination issues (I even made a post about this because I thought I was in some alternate reality/Truman show)
* Communication issues / Unresponsive -- sent last-minute emails in the evening, for something I had sent a full week prior,
   * Her last-minute email was asking me to 'clarify' that I wasn't a technical PM, which I clearly told her during the session, and it was clear on my resume. She sat on this for a whole week, until the evening before our next session...
   * but somehow 'didn't see' my email for two whole business days during the week
   * another example that has been driving me nuts...I was asking how to position a role I had on Linkedin, and she said 'I'll send you the video about how to add a role to your linkedin page'-- I was clearly asking about how to present it, and she took that to mean I was so tech-illiterate that I 'didn't know how to update linkedin' ??????????????????
* She has all these lofty 'mission statements' on her website about 'tailoring to clients' needs',
   * but she has asked me ZERO questions about my career experience, has the vaguest idea of what I am looking for, and has given me zero new ideas
* **Our last session was literally spent with me browsing jobs on Google and reading her the description.**  


In a nutshell, she has given me a myriad of questionable advice, at best irrelevant, at worst outright wrong and harmful.  


I don't want to be an a\*hole, but it feels like a waste of time and money.  
I want to make it clear that is a 'HER' issue, and prefer to not blame myself like 'oh it's not the right time for me'...I want to be polite, but also firm and clear that the issue is with HER. (Otherwise she would likely propose that 'we can save the unused sessions for the future' and that is not ideal)

  
Also, I am writing an email to ensure there is a paper trail, particularly if there are any disputes. I just want a refund for the un-used sessions.

1ablyk5,Master's in Law or Literature?,"Hey. This might seem like a very obvious choice, but it's a bit more complicated than that... I have a Law degree. If I take the appropriate steps, I can do whatever I want within Law. I could be a lawyer, a judge, etc. However, in my country having a Master's in Law is really valued - it would make it a lot easier for me to get into good firms and earn more money in the early stages of my career. So why not take that Master's? Long story short, I absolutely hated Law school. I hated the subjects, I hated the unjustified pressure, and many other things. My mental health was affected in a very negative way. When I graduated I said to myself: ""no more Law. I will study something I'm passionate about and work in that field"". I've always loved Literature and I'd absolutely love to take a Master's in Literature. My dream is to become a Professor or academic researcher. If I managed to become a Literature Professor/researcher I'd be super happy. But I know it's hard to get that job - lots of people try to become academics and fail, or spend their entire lives living on very small stipends with zero professional stability. In one hand, I'm thinking: just study Literature, if things work out, great, if they don't, you can be a lawyer. On the other hand I'm thinking, don't be a fool, Literature will lead to nowhere, just do the Master's in Law and hope a good firm will hire you. Doing something I'm passionate about is super important to me, but so is professional stability. What should I do? What Master's programme should I take?

1ablazs,Promotion or relocation,"I may get a role promotion in the next few weeks/days. A colleague tipped me off about this. It may or may not involve a pay rise. I don't really know.

Meanwhile, over the last few months, I have been thinking about asking for a transfer to another city, as my company has more than one location. I haven't discussed it with anyone yet.  
The reason I want to move is mainly due to the high cost of living in my current location, and the relocation allowance I will receive if I move.

Whatever decision I make, I am afraid of disappointing either myself or those who have decided to trust me. I could consider accepting the promotion now and asking to be transferred next year.

I have been working in customer-facing support role for the past 4 years. My current company is not super technical and I am basically just troubleshooting their SaaS product.

Any advice for me with someone with a tech support background?  
My confusion is, that I am not sure what to focus my time on to get myself to the next level. Do I get cloud certifications and learn cloud? Do I focus more on learning to code (ex. Front end)? I know I need to get more technical - I just don’t know WHAT to spend time on and will complement my current experience.

1abkgy4,I miss my old job but I don't want to disappoint my aunt,"Hi everyone 

Now, here is the thing, I am currently a university student studying CS as my major and, I currently work at my aunt's business during the school semester and work at a supermarket during vacation period. However, last Xmas, I worked at my supermarket job during my exam period and it was great- best few weeks EVER! But now that vacation is over, I am back at my aunt's business but I do not feel as happy as I felt went I first worked there and at my supermarket job.

Now, you may be wondering how I got into my aunt's business well...basically my mum and I got into a really heated argument in Sept, last year, which led her sayings some of the most extreme stuff EVER and of course, I cried because I took everything to heart especially when such words were spoke by my mum. She basically said that I should keep my supermarket job because basically ""she cannot support me anymore"" but in a vague way. But- like I said earlier, I am majoring in CS and, working and doing CS is not really ideal since I am struggling to pass my courses as it is. So, my aunt decided to take me in to her business since it was relatively new small business and it would it was low impact job. Low impact meaning I would able to study during working hours [[since clients only comes if they book a time slot to come]] while at work since a supermarket job would be high impact since clients are constantly coming in and out and, because I would not be able to study as much and the shifts would impact my sleep schedule, etc. Besides, she was her only employee so to have me would put some pressure off her since she also has a full time job. I agreed and that how I became her employee.

I have finished my supermarket job for a week now, but I lowkey still want to work there. I told my friends my dilemma and they said that I should do what makes me happy but I didn't have the courage to tell my aunt that I want to contiune working at the supermarket and not with her.

What should I do? Should I be selfish and do what I like or disappoint my aunt by quitting?

In February 2023 I received a $1 raise bringing me to $16 an hour. 

April 2023 I accepted a full time position making $40,000 a year. I stayed in my current position but also started working part time in our payment operations department. The responsibilities include making payments on behalf of our clients either online or by phone calls, initiating refunds if needed, and answering help desk tickets through Zendesk.

I know from word of mouth someone accepted a position in customer support, which answers help desk to tickets all day for $55,000. She has been with the company about a year less than I have.

During the hiring process, I noticed that this architect, like many interviewers, viewed my LinkedIn profile. When I checked his profile, I discovered our shared work history and mutual connections from Company ""X.""

1abhn36,Quitting an internship first week in?,"Hey everyone. So basically, I recently started a very well paid Finance Internship at a Fortune 500 company. I was initially very excited for the role and even turned down three other offers because I was told I would we working with other teams in multidisciplinary projects and would have a strategic view of all the different teams, the finance within them and mentorship throughout. However, 1 week into the Onboarding with the previous intern and reality hit me. In my role I will be working with only two very busy people (My boss and another guy who is pretty much another boss) and my entire role consists of doing and being  in charge of six VERY complex financial reports, of which 2 of them not even my bosses know how to do, as the interns do them. (And these are reports that go out to the entire region and if I mess up I'm in big trouble). I not only HATE the technicality of these reports, but I also  won't have ANY contact with other teams projects as my main responsibilities are these six reports. My bosses rarely come into the office and take some time to respond, and if i'm honest, i am GROSSLY underprepared. I am getting 2 hours of onboarding per report from the previous intern, despite these reports being VERY complex. Additionally, they require advanced excel, PowerBI and other software, and I am a beginner, AT BEST. (They never made this a requirement when I Interviewed)

Taking this into account, and the fact that this internship position has never been filled into full time, as the past 4 interns all leave after 6 months (Because they either mess up OR they did amazing but don't get hired), I am SERIOUSLY considering quitting 1 week in, as I am painfully aware of how alone I am (Previous intern leaves in 2 days and only he knows how to do most of the 6 reports) and I am left alone to deal with reports i DO NOT have the profficiency to do, and have no proper mentorship.

I NEED to make this decision soon though, as I don't want to further inconvenience anyone with my decision. Additionally, If i make this decision quickly I may be able to graduate in April. However, if in a couple of months I get fired or realize how grossly underprepared I am and quit, my new graduation date would be October, and I would have nothing to do until then. I have prior startup experience so I'm pretty sure I could get an internship or full time role there, but still, the decision is hard, as I know the Job Market is not very good atm.

1abgbsn,Changing a career to HR,"Hi!  
I'm 32 years old and I'm feeling some burnout in my current role of a UI/UX Team Leader & Manager.  
I' d like to do something impactful in my career and help people and companies grown and develop. That's why I felt that HR might be a good direction for me, especially with my interest in business, psychology and natural communication skills.  
Now, I wanted to ask you about your opinion if my transferable skills and a great desire to learn are enough to find an entry-level job in HR. I'm mostly focused on recruitment or learning & development.  
So, some of the transferable skills and advantages that I was able to identify are:  
Experience in:  
\- Leadership, people and work management.  
\- Recruitment: actively searching for and identifying candidates, conducting interviews, negotiating, making an offer etc.  
\- Handling simple administrative tasks, documentation, point of contact for employees in different matters, workload planning,  
\- Responsible and proactive in educating, developing and aiding employees by conducting workshops, presentations, sharing knowledge, evaluation meetings, feedback sessions, retrospectives.  
\- Identifying, creating new ones and improving existing processes in the team/company. From simple and unified file organization, to working on the project lifecycle processes and sales.  
\- Experience in research, analyzing data and applying the learnings into actionable steps.  
\- Strong emotional and communication skills: being a point of contact on a daily basis, collaborating and managing communications with different departments and even companies and clients. Truly and naturally caring for employee satisfaction, effectivness and creating a positive place for work. Also organizing extra activities and events like hackathons or just some after-work drinks.  
\- Attention to detail, organized work, working in a fast-paced environment etc. etc.  
\- A Bachelor's degree (in Graphic Design so completely irrelevant apart from the fact of having a degree)  
Of course, I'm also educating myself online (generally about what HR is about, but also learning techniques and recruitment basics), but I'm not sure if that matters to the potential recruiter?

  
I definitely how a lack of knowledge about local employment law, more advanced and complex administrative work and techniques, any HR-related software. I also have no formal education in business, administration or HR.  
There is more of course, but I just wanted to give you a glimpse of the experience and direction of my resume that I'm heading to. I would kindly ask for any opinions or tips if there is any chance of landing a job in HR with no prior experience in this field?  
Thanks!",ostrowele,1,1.0,1,1706268906,2024-01-26 11:35:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1abgbsn/changing_a_career_to_hr/,1,2024
1abg1uw,"Pride cost me the nine most productive work years of my life -- New graduates, don't imitate my mistake.","  
Here's a note I wish I could've written to myself nine years ago, when I graduated college. I hope it provides a refreshing and chastening perspective, not to dissuade or claim to know better, but to allow you to calibrate. I hate posts that talk from the perspective of ""Hey, I had a problem but now it's all better, follow my soon-to-be monetized newsletter."" Let me just give you the shit, and you pick out any kernels that resonate with you.    
You feel good about your habits and work ethic. Check. You have proven able to push yourself aggressively to get top results. Check. You ask more and learn more than the average of those around you in class. Check. You feel ready to take on the world, driven by an as-yet indistinct but general conceit that by ""going your own way"" in the world you will create beautiful things. You graduate from college. Congratulations, here we go!   
Nine years later, you have never worked anything more than a dead-end, under-paid job. Your idealism has metastasized into a survival crouch, where simply finding a near-minimum wage job with  benefits -- a raft to save you from the risk of insolvency -- is the only thing a rational person can think of. That world you felt you could give unique things to has never given you the time of day, never let you in, never even accepted to play remotely close to your rules. 

And yet, you think, persist. Persist! You take refuge in not giving up, you happily absorb it into your identity and so it becomes You, too. After all, what is the one thing we all learn? To not give up. To do otherwise, is to abandon your ""inner self"" and life dreams. Persistence is as celebrated an ethic as anything in today's world. In the US, it is the moral equivalent of apple pie. No! You remind yourself again. That dead end is not actually a dead end. It is a dead end for people *who don't believe or work hard enough*. So you trust in yourself, that you are the exception, and in what you've always been told. You think you can break through and things will be okay in the end. But you don't and it isn't.   
While you engage in this nine-year Herculean struggle, most of your peers, whether they were more driven or not, or saw the world full of as much mystery and excitement as you did, are now comfortably ensconced in a bevy of different professions and jobs. Some are quite boring, sure. But many seem pretty solid or genuinely stimulating. Many never tried to grasp at ""exceptional"" but instead opted to show up, day in day out, on the right ground, for nine continuous years. In fact, despite some of their limitations, they are now finding opportunities to contribute to their fields in interesting ways in their own rights. Now, they seem to be able to do this from the comfort of their own homes even -- their entire lifestyle lives and grows from the pleasantries of their kitchen or local coffee shop! Somehow, they've covered more ground working far less hard with less emotional turbulence than you have, working it seems twice as hard with less than half the results. You are on the floor, gasping for oxygen while your legs are kicking out to avoid running out of money. They are comfortably pacing at their own speeds, contentedly or wisely ignorant of all but their largely pleasant forward progress.   
It is here where the world that once shimmered for you with potential and opportunity now becomes a cold and hostile environment, where only the cynic seems to win. You have become shattered of your sense of identity and all and any pretense. Beware though, because this angst and frustration metastasizes to prey on any other weak links in your life. Do you struggle with your family or friends? Or are you married with kids?  This potent cocktail hones in on and preys at your weakest points. It smells out weakness far better than even you or your closest relatives can grasp and discern.   
Beware this situation. It is no fun. It does not make life enjoyable. Don't imitate my example. What example is that? To hold too fast to that type of pride that society still seems to want to sell us. College, as a modern social institution, preys on it. Social media culture elevates it. Beware what is promised, beware what expectations people feed you. Most of all beware yourself and the license your conceit allows you to take -- you only borrow here at the expense of your future ability to pay it or anything else back. 

This is not a warning against ambition or mission, or enjoying life. This is a reminder that there is a deep sub-surface level to these things which we cannot neglect -- but often do. Get off the hedonic treadmill and really make sure you are controlling *for* your pride (even if the thing itself is difficult to control). 

I don't know my next steps (I am open to advice), but I do know one thing: Whatever I do, I will need to take my finger off that Pride button.

1abf58d,What should one consider when deciding what qualifications to develop?,"Hello, I am in the final year of my undergraduate course but have don't have any concrete direction for my career. The freedom I've had living in accomodation this year feels great so my goal has become being able to move out and comfortably support myself as soon as is reasonable.

My course is both Maths and Computer Science. After having done some research and consideration Computer Science seems easier for me to enter, especially if my primary goal is having a higher salary in my first serious job, though my math knowledge will definitely complement my endeavour nicely. My experience in coding is moderate, ive done coursework and some basic projects while learning within a few languages, but nothing I'd consider noteworthy. Similarly, I have worked part time in retail but nothing in Computer Science. Im aware that for many jobs the description and requirements tend to not be necessities but more so a guideline however, there are no doubt options that will generally offer more utility than others when it comes to projects and qualifications. Ofcourse, with that being said, the 'value' of a qualification isnt the only factor I will consider. I plan on researching into what I could and should add to my portfolio then working real hard so that I ideally have enough to offer not too long after I graduate. 

Sorry for rambling a bit, but if any seasoned Computer Science veterans could offer me any advice, considerations or questions I should ask myself while starting given my goal then I will be most grateful!

One more thing, while looking around on the internet I noticed some people mentioning that if pay is one's concern, searching for a STEM job outside the UK is a better choice. I dont have a drivers license but im comfortable travelling and wouldn't mind moving for work, though im not sure if this is realistic for a first job.

1abelif,Should I quit my job with a lie or stay and save money?,"Hello all, I'm an 18M (19 in May), and I've been working at Walmart as a cashier for the past 5 months, which is my first job. I'm making around $1,800 a month, and I generally like my managers and the job most days.  
  
I have no plans to stay here forever, as I want to start community college around September and want to focus on that 110% when the time comes. Yet that's still about 7-8 months from now, and I feel the urge to quit Walmart and dive into hobbies, maybe even work on a couple of side hustles.  
  
I still live with my parents, so all the money I earn from Walmart is 90% profit (accounting for gas and food). Part of me wants to stay put and save, but the other part of me wants to go backpacking in Europe for 3 months or have a road trip across the country. I have close to $14k saved up at the moment.  
  
I've spun a web of lies to my managers, claiming that my car is totaled to avoid having to work the two weeks' notice (it's only been three days since I told them). I regret putting myself in this situation, but now I'm trying to decide whether to commit to the lie and let them know I have no way to work and quitting or show up and say I got a family member to drive me.

1abeccd,How do you deal with a client reducing workload?,"We have worked with this particular client for 3 years now. In the beginning we started doing 8 projects including video content, events and strategy and have directly helped the company grow. Today they've reduced the workload to about 4-5 projects. From what we've seen they have given space to friends, cronies and yesmen with similar businesses that take what we proposed originally (and has proven to work) and rehash it. We kept professional attitude and didn't attack their work when it was insufficient and poor. But this new comers criticize and nitpick *our* every proposition and deliverable but fall silent to their errors and shortcomings after they've been given chance to work. 

Clearly our client still sees value in what we do. But we don't want to find ourselves in a couple of years time with no work from this client with other providers doing what we proposed and created. We covered a lot of ground but gave results. Maybe the success we give our client gave way to envious and greedy competitors who have now taken over work we originally had. What would be the best way to address the situation without sounding too territorial? How do you deal with this *leecher* competitors?

1abc3pg,What is the right title and pay range for my role?,"Hi folks,

I’m trying to determine the proper title for my role. I *think* it’s operations manager but I’d love your input.

Over the past year, I’ve been given the unique opportunity to create my own role within a brand new company. We started as a team of 4 people with myself at one of the most junior roles out in the field working directly with clients. I have a limited background in operations and administration thanks to meaningful mentorship beyond my scope in a lowly admin support job in my teens and early 20’s.

As our company grew, I saw an opportunity to switch from field work to admin when my director’s responsibilities became too great for one person. I started out running payroll, updating client folders, and doing other simple projects. However, the more we grew the more procedures and policies I began to notice needing to be streamlined. 

Now, I do a lot behind the scenes. Other than compliance duties assigned to a part-time HR person, if it’s related to admin or operations I’m basically running it. I’m heading the project for creating a new training program for our field specialists, I’m working with other supervisors and the director to build policies and procedures and to update the handbook, I train field specialists, I process new client folders, manage existing client folders, handle specialist schedules, and assign clients to specialists. And I still do payroll. 

If we still had 4 employees, this would still be a lot of work but it would be manageable. But now, we’re a team of 25 and it’s too much for one person. I’ve been in talks with our director about bringing on and training a new administrative team. I will be leading these folks and helping to grow our administrative/operations department and streamlining our admin/operations processes. 

So, my question is, what is a good title for this position, and what should it pay in California for a first timer in this role within a company that definitely can’t afford pay the mega big bucks? Is this operations manager? This doesn’t exist within our team yet because we were so new and so small when I started. So far we have a clinical director (owner), clinical supervisors, specialists who go out into the field and work with clients, and… me. I’m almost everything that *isn’t* clinical beyond what the director covers. For context, our clinical supervisors are bringing home about $70k/year managing a team of 10 specialists each and overseeing about 80 clients each. I will probably have a team of 5 within the year, plus I support the 20 specialists in a non-clinical capacity and perform administrative and some minor direct-contact duties for ~160 clients. I will technically be overseeing *some* of the processes and procedure that are managed in our HR department but HR and compliance will ultimately be going to someone else to head for the day-to-day. Right now we have a part-time HR person who is very close with our director and she has been extremely helpful, but she will eventualally train a full time HR manager and fade out except as a consultant.

What I really enjoy is business operations- keeping things working, writing and establishing procedures and policies, and supporting our staff. The type of work we do means a lot to me so getting to write the program we are using to train our specialists to do the most for our clients has been a real passion project. I’m also extremely dedicated to having an ethical, supportive work environment so I’ve helped create a good benefits package and pushed for high pay for our specialists. Since I get to choose the management title for my position, I want my title to reflect my competency in that area so in future I have this title and my experience on my resume to support me in similar future roles, should that day ever arrive. I want my pay to reflect thriving instead of surviving. I just don’t want to settle.",Gaiiiiiiiiiiil,1,1.0,0,1706251195,2024-01-26 06:39:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1abc3pg/what_is_the_right_title_and_pay_range_for_my_role/,1,2024

1abb0px,Difficult choice choosing between two dream jobs,"Hello all, I've got a very difficult choice and looking for input as my friends and family are pretty split.

I'm a lawyer, and I first started my career as a law clerk at the court of appeals.  After that I was hired by the prosecutor's office, and after a year I was able to make my way into the appellate division because I loved appeals, and I've been there for several years since.  Appellate law is the only law I want to practice, and there are almost no options out there for what I do.

I should say, I love my job because I learn something new every day, and it's usually very engaging.  I don't particularly like being a prosecutor.  I like to make sure the right result happens, and I often concede issues on appeal to make sure that happens.  We have a lot of control over not only the issues, but also settlement and other areas (we train the other lawyers).

Recently the court of appeals I worked at and practice before opened up a staff attorney position.  I realized the position was opened because of a temporary funding bill which allocated additional funding for collateral attacks, and the court of appeals secured funding in anticipation of those collateral attacks.  I've always wanted to return to the court, and the court has a bunch of perks that don't exist for my current job.  For instance, there's remote work and free parking, which don't exist at my current job.

The obvious big red flag is I don't know if the position is permanent, and the interviewing judges/others acknowledged it may disappear in 2025.  There's no chance of going back to my current job in 20225 if I leave and the new job disappears.  Another concern I have is, although I have a lot of control over any individual case right now and the potential to change the law at the state supreme court, as a staff attorney I'd be limited to recommending resolutions based only on what the partys argue.

I've already interviewed,  I'm a bit drunk right now, but when the court offered me the position tonight they gave me one day to think about it and that's the dilemma I'm in right now.  If anyone has insight I'd love to hear.",FourteenFCali_,1,0.5,1,1706247294,2024-01-26 05:34:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1abb0px/difficult_choice_choosing_between_two_dream_jobs/,1,2024
1ab9nv4,Boss told me he's looking for someone with more skill and overseas for cheaper... in the meantime I should continue working like he didn't just tell me that,"Boss told me he's looking for someone with more skill and overseas for cheaper... in the meantime I should continue working like he didn't just tell me that

So I work for a small family owned company as a software developer but really the job is more so game development. I have a associate degree in web and software development so really I learned all my skills as I went along over the past year and half here. So today my boss is doing end of the year evaluations for everyone and he gets to me and has my co worker in the room with us as he said he works closer with me than my boss does and knows more about what I actually do (which is true). 

Boss says that since we are switching our game development platform from unity to unreal engine 5, they are looking for someone who is more familiar with the platform and can make the whole game from the ground up by 2025. The catch is, he wants people overseas such as like Portugal or somewhere (since you can pay like 1k/month as apposeed to my 4k a month). One of the main things he likes about having me tho is I am in office at least once a week and he says he likes having that face to face interaction, but yet he wants to have someone overseas complete a WHOLE game in less than one year? 

he told me that if he were to find someone overseas he would keep me as the ""on site"" person to work side by side with him I guess? Not really sure how that work honestly. He also said that while he looks for someone I should continue working on what I've been working on and learning unreal. He said that if he can't find someone over seas he would have to resort to finding someone local and at that point I would be let go but his preferred way would be find that overseas person due to how cheap he can pay. 

At that point I asked him if I could do anything else for him if it were to come to that point (he had previously mentioned I rebuild his websites, since that is indeed what my degree is in and it would be a better use of skills). He told me that he would talk with a few people and see if that is possible, but for now I am still employed and that I should keep working while he finds someone else either overseas or local...

He did say he would give me a week of pay after I was let go (if it comes to that/ moreso when) as he ""doesn't want me to be outta a paycheck completely flat out"". 

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this situation? I feel he has me in a chokehold right now where I'm still employed but I have no ides if or when I'll be let go... I also feel like all the work I'll be doing over the next however long will just be for him to kick me to the club as soon as he finds someone else.... any suggestions on what I should do? 

It is also important to note that I did just start college classes this week and he was aware of my schedule when I told him it a few weeks ago and he was all on board for it... so now I am not only stressing about my classes, but also my source of income to pay for college and whatnot.

Also, he wants to switch from unity to unreal for a 2d story telling game despite me telling him that unreal wouldn't be the best choice for that type of game.",ThrowAway222111455,3,0.6700000166893005,10,1706242772,2024-01-26 04:19:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ab9nv4/boss_told_me_hes_looking_for_someone_with_more/,1,2024

1ab9aqz,I (23F) am about to move to a different city with my boyfriend (23M) and I am so scared to give my boss my 2-week notice.,"Some background: I am a college graduate and currently live at home. My boyfriend of 2 years got an amazing job offer in his hometown (2 hours away). I personally hate my hometown. 

We found an awesome apartment and got a lease. It’s our new home! Tuesday, I had two interviews in said city. Now here comes the tricky part. 

I work at a small law firm as a legal assistant, my first job out of college. I make $18/hour for 20 hours a week. My boss has been very toxic to me in the past and made me cry even (asked me if i have a learning disability in a mocking way, told me even a mcdonald’s employee could do my job, that my learning curve is slow, and makes me do shit like change the paper towels in the bathroom which is not in my job description) As of lately though he’s been pretty decently nice. It’s a small firm so everyone gets to know each other pretty well, although I am a private person. 

I need to give my 2-weeks Monday. I want to be fully moved into the apartment before applying to more jobs/getting an offer because the commute is ass. But here’s the CATCH! My boss randomly brings me in his office a few  days ago and tells me although my learning curve was slow he thinks i’m deserving of a 1-2 dollar raise and he wants to move me over from my staffing agencies payroll to theirs. I obviously didn’t want to tell him in that moment about my plans of moving because I hadn’t even had my interviews yet. I was so flustered. He shakes my hand and tells me “welcome aboard”. When I had one foot out the door. 

The next day when I was working at my desk he wrote on a piece of paper and hung it in my face telling me to thank the other attorneys for my raise. Awkward. 

I’m terrified now to tell him i’ll be moving. I think they also expect me to train the next person because they have no idea what goes into my job but I truly need to be moved out of here 2 weeks from Monday. I’m feeling so guilty and stressed out. Any advice about how to proceed would be greatly appreciated. I don’t want them to hate me for this. 

PS- all the jobs i interviewed for are full time with benefits & higher pay",captainbrez,2,0.75,11,1706241630,2024-01-26 04:00:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ab9aqz/i_23f_am_about_to_move_to_a_different_city_with/,1,2024

1ab7dws,Is it insane to leave a good job because of the weather?,"Hi y'all. It's my first time posting here so let me know if I'm doing it wrong, but I really need some advice.

I'm currently trying to decide if I should stay at my current job, or quit and move on down the road. I've been here for a little less than a year, and I was recently promoted to an assistant manager type of role.

Pros about where I'm at: Pay is good, comes with healthcare, and (REALLY nice) housing is provided with all utilities paid by the company. I generally get along pretty well with most of my coworkers, and my managers all seem to like me well enough. The job itself if fun and something I legitimately enjoy doing.

Cons: the weather here is HORRIBLE during our peak season (summer). Due to the nature of my job, I'm outside for 99% of my day, and the days are generally 12-15 hours, 4-6 days a week (which is pretty average for my industry and not part of the point). We're in the deep south, so generally it's around 85-100+ degrees with insane humidity basically every day, and bugs everywhere. Our uniform shirts are short sleeve cotton which sounds nice in theory but in reality I'm really fair skinned and sweat through sunscreen faster than I can put it on, so I'm really getting deep fried out here. I'm also really introverted, and while all my coworkers are super nice, I wouldn't call us friends, and I don't have anyone to hang out with here outside of work. Since I work so much the only real option to go meet people here is at a bar, which really isn't my scene, so I'm honestly getting pretty lonely. I'd get a pet/ESA if I could, but they're not allowed in the employee housing. :(

Other than all the cons, this is honestly the best job I've ever had. I'm just really stuck on what to do because I'm not sure I can handle another summer here but I'm also pretty sure it would be smarter to try to stick it out and save some money while I can.

1ab6srh,I’m thinking about dropping out of college and starting trade school.,"I’ve been in college since 2013 studying civil engineering. The university I started at was known for engineering so their programs were definitely weed out programs. Needless to say, I didn’t make it last my 2nd year before I was academically dismissed. I took a semester off and then started pursuing an associates degree. 

I finished my degree Summer 2019 in general science. The goal at the time was to transfer somewhere but I only had a 2.6 and I was just exhausted with school. I decided I’d just work for a bit until I decided what I wanted to do about continuing my education. I basically just wanted to work. Finishing school was like a moral victory since I never completed my bachelor’s degree. 

COVID happens I leave my job and move home. Become self employed for a bit to make ends meet but then that becomes too time consuming for the rate of which I was making. So I started working at a kitchen in a hospital. 

In 2022 I decided it would be wise to go back to school to get credits you’d take in your 2nd year of an engineering program. I basically have: Physics II, Chemistry II, Duffy Q, Mechanics, fluids and statics left at the community college level before I complete a second associates degree. 

If I pass and graduate with a 3.0 I can receive basically a full ride to transfer and complete my degree in Architectural Engineering. If I stuck to my school plan, I’d be projecting to finish around 2027-2028. My Pell grant is almost maxed out at 600%. I’m already 33k in loan debt personally. My mom has taken on some debt for me as well. Probably around 56k combined. Student loans don’t scare me but I’m starting to weigh the investment upside. 

The transfer option isn’t far fetched, except I’m starting to find difficulty advancing financially, succeeding in the class room consistently, and having the time to study, read, and practice material. I just find it that the time school is requiring is taking a toll of my mental. 

I do like school, but at what point is it going to start to help my financial situation. When will it help my professional situation? 

This semester I’m focusing on doing well in the classes I have and to actually finish applications in the construction industry.

Now, I’m considering just picking up a trade to enter the same industry. Maybe I’m not the engineer I “think” I am or aspire to be and maybe I’m a CAD designer or construction manager working for that same company I’d see myself at but as an engineer. 

In my college days I had some legal run ins, and along with bad decision making it caused my license to get revoked. Most trade or jobs in general require a valid drivers license that I don’t have right now. I’m conflicted. Both pathways have upside and downside, they both still do require time. I’m just struggling to understand if I want that time spent in the classroom or in the field?",SignificanceOptimal,1,1.0,5,1706234225,2024-01-26 01:57:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ab6srh/im_thinking_about_dropping_out_of_college_and/,1,2024

19fnw6q,I think I’m getting fired. What should I do or not do?,"Hi All, 

Let me preface by saying I know what I did was wrong and I’m trying my best to turn this into a learning moment. 

So I am a clinician practicing therapy. Last week, I was notified that one of my cases was being audited by insurance. 

I’m feeling nervous and 100% sure I will be fired for time fraud. My company has been very clear on making sure we are billing for our work accurately and shared that they’ve have to let a few people go for this reason. Since then, I’ve really tried better to be dilligent in my time recording. However, audits go as far back as 7 years so I have no doubt they will find examples of when I billed work and I wasnt exactly working.

To be specific, I am doing the work but billing it at different time. For example we can only bill 2 hours of report writing a day. So when a report takes me 2+ hours to complete I would just bill what was left over on another day. Many of us do it but I know it’s wrong and we should just manage our time better. However, sometimes it’s not possible when you have many reports due at the same time.

Anyways, my question is, when they do call me into this meeting what should I say or do? I’m planning to not comment and just accept the termination. 

“I don’t have much to say but I understand. Thank you.”

19fmw5a,How to handle the situation,"Hi all. 
I (F27) am currently working at a big financial institution within trading. For some background, when I started my position I had no prior qualifications to the job besides working in the company previously. And my previous manager knew about it but still felt like I was a fit for the team because knowledge can be shared. Once I started, there was at least 4 people leaving the team within 4 months and my manager went on paternal leave. With that said, I got almost no training and was put into a situation where I had to teach myself everything. Now I’ve worked here 2 years almost and feel like I’ve developed but is still lacking in some aspects. During this period, the manager that hired me had to step down and another manager was brought in who was supposed to “structure” the team. He has been with us for approximately 8 months now. 

Today I had my yearly review and my (new) manager said that I am below expectations. He experience that I am sometimes doing well and sometimes bad. Like as if it goes in waves. I knew about this because I’ve had the feeling as well about myself. Which mostly has to do with my mental health being good and bad sometimes, usually when it’s bad, that’s when it dips. And I’ve been transparent with him regarding this and always ask for advice on how to handle the situation better. Today, I must say, came as a surprise though because now he wants to involve HR for a meeting. And I don’t know how to handle that. 

I know I am good at my job when my mental health is good. Sometimes I should have probably called in sick rather than still going to work and try my best. But how should I handle the call with HR?

They said if I stay until this undetermined date that I will get a $5k retention bonus, 13 weeks of paid severance for my time at the company, and a lump sum to cover 13 weeks of COBRA.

19fma1j,Is a PIP a death sentence at this company? ADVICE NEEDED,"Started a new role in June, trained all of July. From July to October, I have been working on 3 clients. 2 are mine, 1 is a hybrid between her and me because theyre not into change. Throughout this time, I felt like my boss and I had poor communication (we are just so different). We did these color theory things and I spoke to her about how I am a Blue and need XYZ and she is a red so etc etc. November 7th, I am in the hospital. I speak to her via google meet once I got out of the hospital telling her I was taking short term disability and she told me it was ""not ideal"". I take my leave and come back mid December. Came back and saw this informal evaluation ripping me apart and I was so confused so I spoke to her about it. I told her I didnt understand some of the things on there. I realized we had totally different communication styles so I asked someone for advice, they told me my boss went to HR about and that I need to go to HR and tell them my side. I did, which resulted in my boss YELLING at me. However, I reiterated that I need this clarity going forward and mentioned several things were never communicated to me She was mad we had to have this convo, but it ultimately helped. I since have been doing well (mid dec-now). She gave me a good review last week and said I improved a lot and hit my KPIs. Then today I have a convo with her and HR stating that I can either move teams and take a demotion with a 20k pay cut or do a PIP. She kept saying although im doing the job now well with my current workload, she thinks I wont be able to handle more. Not sure why she thinks that. They gave me 2 options and I chose PIP and she was PISSED like visibly mad and so HR and I spoke after and they said they cant do a lateral move bc there isn't a need for my role on another team, but that they'll make her grade me fairly in the PIP, which I dont believe.

19flvo8,Am I going to get fired or just paranoid?,"Hello, 

Just for some context, I've been working at the same company for nearly 4 years. I've been doing customer service for 2 years now and I'm the only one at the moment handling emails phone calls returns and restocking. We aren't a large company so everything I manage on my own. I haven't been answering the phones as much as I should during the busy season last year during Christmas and new years since I was mostly trying to answer a plethora of emails. Of course, we start getting complaints that I'm not answering phones on our social page. It's now January and I've been trying to answer all incoming calls since we are slower, but today out of nowhere the person who manages our social states we need to remove our customer service phone line or get it answered. I've been doing that for the last week or two.

Now our team has agreed to try and remove the customer service number...I'm afraid they'll let me go afterwards. I'm conflicted because I also got a raise not too long ago and was in a meeting this week about how they could make my job easier for me before this.

19flmb8,should i become a teacher in canada,"currently in a gap year (18M) and trying to figure out what career i want to do, my goal is to enjoy what i do well also being able to work on my business and invest in realstate every year so i can retire early (im aware of property management, and I'm ok with that) and work on my business (what ever i want to do at the time i have some ideas) fulltime. However with this plan i know teachers dont make the most, i am well prepared to live below my means, but even with that I may only be able to save 1 to 2 grand a month which may take a while to accumulate enough properties to replace my income. so my thought is there are better jobs that pay way more like pilot and school is half the time so i can start investing sooner. but i feel like if i do that i would dread to wake up every morning for work. so i feel like im in a dilemma of high paying job thats not to fun or low paying job 4 years of school but hopefully injoy it?

19fkv6b,I can't find a software job and it's been 1 year since I graduated. I am willing to work for free. Any advice or thoughts?,"I graduated with a computer science degree from KSU in December 2022. I did not have an internship while in school but I did Full-Stack Freelance work as well as side projects and I still do today in 2024.  
  
I have a website showcasing all of my projects with in depth descriptions. My projects range from Full Stack Business Apps, to complex AI algorithm projects, to 3D unity games. I've made 8 business apps for small businesses locally and online.  
  
I've sent thousands of applications and have been sending out atleast 10 to 50 a day for the past year or so. I've gotten about 6 interviews where I've been denied due to the company finding someone who is more qualified for the role with more relevant experience.  
  
I had a very long interview process with a DOD company in Alabama where I had 7 different interviews. I got the opportunity through a referral. I had talked to atleast 10 engineers in the company and made it through HR. The interview process went on for about 4-5 months. After the last interview I had with them, I was sure I was going to be hired because they had been telling me all throughout these interviews that I would be a great fit and that I was getting very positive feedback. But after the 7th interview the hiring manager ghosted me. I tried emailing him once a week for about 3 weeks after the last interview but he did not respond. Which suprised me greatly because I thought I had a solid connection with him after emailing him for several months back and forth. I felt super betrayed and just wanted feedback on why I wasn't hired, but I got nothing.  
  
It got me down for a few weeks, but as a follower of God I believe everything happens for a reason, and that God was making my path harder in order to teach me something and level up my character. Perhaps teach me through pain.  
  
I quickly bounced back from a few weeks of immense sadness. And I'm still striving to this day. Constantly improving my resume, doing different projects, learning new skills, sending out 10-50 applications a day.  
  
I've been doing research on the best possible steps to take as a computer science graduate with no actual experience other than freelance a year after graduating, but I am seeing a lot of mixed advice.  
  
I don't code for the money, I don't even care about money at this point. I just want to find a job in my field and be an asset to any software company out there. I will work for free, I will do anything. Is there any companies who hire software engineers to work for free that can provide actual experience on my resume?  
  
I'm not sure if I should ditch looking for jobs and start my own company, get a position unrelated at a software company and work my way up, go back to school and get a master's degree until the job market opens up, or go into something I don't want to work in like tech sales, help desk, IT, etc... and transition into the field from there. Or if I should do the same thing I did last year and continue to improve.  
  
My family views me as a very compentent individual and I feel like this has hindered my reputation amongst friends and family. If you are in the field right now and feel like you have any advice for my situation it would be greatly appreciated. I feel like software is what I'm destined to do and I don't want to give up, but time and time again I get the same result. I am not like the other programmers I graduated with. I had a 3.86 GPA and have been very passionate about this all my life.

I enjoy the variety of work and also learning practical skills, but I feel like I’m wasting my potential.

This has left me at a crossroads. I don’t want to continue a career in construction, but I also have no idea what else I’d do. I’ve considered going to College but I really don’t want to spend another three years locked in - racking up debt and studying something I’m not interested in.

I’m considering just quitting my job, moving back home with the parents and then just completing a range of courses and certificates in different fields until I find something that somewhat interests me and then upskilling that way. Is that a stupid plan?

Do I need to go to college to secure a well paying job? Should I just put life on hold and go “find myself” by travelling? Any advice would appreciated

19fkdzt,"Career Dilemma: Balancing Comfort, Growth, and Family Plans","Yo! I'm currently facing a complex career decision and would appreciate your insights. I've been in my current, laid-back job for three years, earning $64k, but without benefits. . Recently, I've been offered a new gig with a $75k salary, and benefits. However, this role involves sales calls and managing clients independently, aspects that aren't exactly my cup of tea. I am 27 and my wife and I are planning on having kids soon. My wife has excellent health insurance, so that's not a deciding factor. We're also in a low-cost-of-living state.  
  
Both jobs allow remote work but what makes this even trickier is that I'm leaving my current job, which, despite two supervisors I don't particularly like, offers a relaxed environment. They leave me alone, and that's been the chill part of my current role. Plus no sales and the clients I have don't reach out to me directly there is a middleman (i do advertising).  
  
I'm torn between the comfort of familiarity and the financial benefits of the new opportunity, especially with a growing family in mind. Have any of you navigated a similar decision, balancing career growth and the comfort of your current situation, all while preparing for a family?

19fi5c5,first job after college interviews,"Hi. I am a first-gen college graduate and graduated last May from an average university in Texas with a bachelor’s degree in math, minor in Spanish, and certification in data analytics. I graduated with a 4.0 GPA, but had no internships. I worked in fast-food and retail during my years in college and was involved in some community service and volunteering projects.
After graduating, up until now, I have been taking a break due to college burnout and some mild health-related issues that are now under control.
Unfortunately, I don’t know what I want to do as a career. Up until my freshman year of college I wanted to be a ms/hs math teacher but reading about the many negative teaching experiences discouraged me. I decided to pursue a certification in data analytics and although I enjoyed the courses I took, I am not very passionate about coding, my coding skills are weak, and I don’t feel smart enough. My classes were more conceptual (which I loved), and software programs weren’t covered as much. I am beginner in Python and SQL and feel comfortable using Tableau. I am aware that I can self-teach myself these kinds of programs at a deeper level, but meanwhile I just want to get a job ASAP.

For the past few months, I have been applying to entry-level administrative/clerical positions and was not able to land any interviews. However, I received three emails in the past two days from three different companies in DFW offering an interview this upcoming week.

1. The first one is for a Student Financial Services Specialist position at a college. This position requires a bachelor’s degree and I don’t know the pay yet. Regarding this job, I enjoy being in a college/university environment. I once had in mind pursuing a master’s degree in Statistics to teach in community college. I also once had in mind becoming a college academic advisor. * I am very interested in going back for my master’s but need to save up first *
2. The second one is for an Accounts Receivable Generalist position at a law firm. This position did not require a bachelor’s degree and I don’t know the pay yet. Regarding this job, I have no experience in accounting/finance, but wouldn’t mind learning about it and seeing where it takes me. 
3. The third one is for a Clinical Staff Assistant position at a top hospital. This position did not require a bachelor’s degree and offers $18/hr with possible promotion after six months. Regarding this job, I am curious if there’s room for career development. 

As I said before, I have no clear career aspirations at the moment. Although I was always top of my class, I am not confident in myself and I admit that this is mainly what is holding me back. It is affecting me mentally, and so I just want to start working immediately to feel a sense of worth and start earning money and help my parents out. Hopefully during this time I establish a better career goal in mind. I enjoy performing calculations, following procedures, and don’t mind doing repetitive work. I admit I am initially quite shy, but it goes away after familiarizing myself with new situations.

My questions are: Which of these jobs is the best start? What are pros/cons? Do any of these jobs serve as a staring point for better careers? Do you have any career suggestions? Life suggestions?

Thank you in advance!!!",rvjoy_,1,1.0,1,1706212445,2024-01-25 19:54:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19fi5c5/first_job_after_college_interviews/,1,2024

We are starting to make up ground financially. However, I can’t say how close or far we are in that.

19fg1qw,Quitting Internship first week in?,"Hey everyone. So basically, I recently started a Finance Internship at a Fortune 500 company. I was initially very excited for the role and even turned down three other offers because I was told I would we working with other teams in multidisciplinary projects and would have a strategic view of all the different teams, thr finance within them and mentorship throughout. However, 1 week into the Onboarding with the previous intern and reality hit me. In my role I will be working with only two other people (My boss and another guy who is pretty much another boss) and my entire role consists of doing and being  in charge of six VERY complex financial reports, of which 3 of them not even my bosses know how to do, as the interns do them. (And these are reports that go out to the entire region and if I mess up I'm in big trouble). I not only HATE the technicality of these reports, but I also  won't have ANY contact with other teams projects as my main responsibilities are these six reports. My bosses rarely come into the office and take some time to respond, and if i'm honest, i am GROSSLY underprepared. I am getting 2 hours of onboarding per report from the previous intern, despite these reports being VERY complex. Additionally, they require advanced excel, PowerBI and other software, and I am a beginner, AT BEST. (They never made this a requirement when I Interviewed)

Taking this into account, and the fact that this internship position has never been filled into full time, as the past 4 interns all leave after 6 months (Because they either mess up OR they did amazing but don't get hired), I am SERIOUSLY considering quitting 1 week in, as I am painfully aware of how alone I am (Previous intern leaves in 2 days and only he knows how to do 3 of the 6 reports) and I am left alone to deal with reports i DO NOT have the profficiency to do, and have no proper mentorship.

I NEED to make this decision soon though, as I don't want to further inconvenience anyone with my decision. Additionally, If i make this decision quickly I may be able to graduate in April. However, if in a couple of months I get fired or realize how grossly underprepared I am and quit, my new graduation date would be October, and I would have nothing to do until then. I have prior startup experience so I'm pretty sure I could get an internship or full time role there, but still, the decision is hard.

Anyways, any advice would be much appreciated.",madeupaccount22,3,1.0,1,1706207098,2024-01-25 18:24:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19fg1qw/quitting_internship_first_week_in/,1,2024
19fg0qn,Trying to choose between two job offers.,"I'm 22-years-old and barely have any work experience aside from volunteer hours. I've been in college since last August.

This week I went to two interviews and received a job offer at both. The first one is to become a dishwasher at a restaurant while the second one is to become a cashier at a grocery store. I have until Monday to decide which one I would rather do, but I'm having a hard time deciding because of my lack of experience. 

Just for context, I'm a very shy person. It took a tremendous amount of willpower on my part to even *go* to both interviews because I'm a nervous wreck. I'm also terrible at math because I was homeschooled and didn't work hard enough to improve. Because of that, I'm afraid I'll make mistakes if I have to handle transactions at the store.

I'm thinking of going with the dishwasher job because as far as I know, I won't have to interact with people as much. Though I might be wrong. The pay is also three dollars more (I'm in the U.S.) than the cashier job in my area. The difference is that it's full-time while the cashier one is part-time. 

Both jobs have similar benefits. Both are close to home. I'm just having a hard time making up my mind because 1) I'm bad at math and 2) I'm so socially awkward it's painful. 

I'm asking this online because I don't have anyone to discuss this with in real life.

In your opinion, which job am I better off choosing, and why? Has anyone been in a similar situation?",Nitrogen70,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1706207024,2024-01-25 18:23:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19fg0qn/trying_to_choose_between_two_job_offers/,1,2024

19ffuyh,What are some good jobs for people with depression?,"My buddy has had what is called ""treatment resistant"" depression for about 15 years now. Unfortunately it's hard for him to hold a job. At the moment he is working retail but karens are calling and getting him strikes at work for not smiling which is unfortunate. He has no actual complaints from his managers about the job itself, nor has ever been bad to a customer, just that they expect you to ""bring a positive attitude"". So like he doesn't bring a bad attitude but is quite neutral. All of our friends describe him as very kind, nice and loyal if a bit reserved and quiet. He said antidepressants can ""smooth"" out your mood so that you don't get as high happy moods, but you also don't get as low sad moods. Unfortunately in the US it seems to be a job requirement that you constantly smile and act like being at work is the best thing ever in life 😒

He's looked at stuff like mentra.com but it seems that there are not a lot of great matches, or the ones that are there seem competitive. Does anyone know any good fits for that type of disability? 

I think a gas station job might be good because there's less of a tender to pander to the always smiling stuff but it also probably pays less.

Skill wise he doesn't really have anything good on paper and can't afford anything like school. It's all retail or fast food. I think he'd be good at teaching old people how to use technology as he's pretty good at knowing all the niche settings and stuff but that type of job probably would have the same type of positivity requirement.",dc469,2,1.0,1,1706206598,2024-01-25 18:16:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19ffuyh/what_are_some_good_jobs_for_people_with_depression/,1,2024

19fezcd,IB JOBS: Accept Boring Good Pay Offer or Keep Looking?,"Hello,

I’ve been interviewing at places for IB Analyst roles, now have an offer, and need some advice. I am looking to be employed within the next 6 months. Further detail provided below:

I have an offer from a mid-tier (think RBC etc.) bank. The work would not be IB-related but more of a support / data entry function BUT would still come with the title of Investment Banking Analyst. So possibility of lateral exit due to title etc could be possible (but probably no real deal experience to talk about). Would also leave me more time for other professional development on the side I imagine since the work would be less demanding (but… boring). Offer is for 110k base.

I have gotten interviews at top places (think Goldman, etc.) and am in early stages, also interviewing at other similar places. No offer from these places yet, and have received some rejections from such places. However I am being quoted at a salary of 120-140k base. The work at these places would also be more aligned with that I hope to do (as an IB Analyst) and maybe better career trajectory.

I am not sure if I should reject the offer and keep looking because other places are better aligned and higher paying or if I should accept the offer because I have no way of knowing if I will get in anywhere else. Any advice is appreciated.

Basically I was offered a dream job across the country from where I currently live. I’m in a very serious relationship (he’s amazing, his family is amazing- we’ve talked about getting engaged this year) he’s not opposed to moving however with his job he wouldn’t be able to for atleast another 2 years with out taking a MASSIVE demotion. He’s completely supportive of me I want to throw that out now. So the job financially isn’t really any better than my current job, it just is the type of work I want to do (I love my current job we just don’t do this specific type of work although my bosses are really supportive of me trying to win those types of projects it’s just super competitive). So here in lies the problem: do I take the dream job and leave behind the man I love (sure long distance is a thing but ive done that before with a previous partner and I know I dislike it) or do I stay put. Of course it’s not just him, I have AMAZING. Friends here, the weather is so much better where I currently am, my family is closer, cost of living is cheaper. 

On another note, can I ask them if they’d be open to me working remote? I think the answer would be no, just due to the nature of the job but is it worth the ask? And how could I pitch that suggestion to make it appealing for the company?

I manage a great, small team as part of a small/medium sized company. (2.5mil turnover). 

I / we have always been told that bonuses are not something the company can really afford for one bs reason or another. Company is cash rich, no mega debts. Reasons are usually things such as “wages are high” or “loan payments” or “unstable market” or “uncertain times”… 

I’ve pushed for a performance related bonus to be implemented after passing on comments to the md from anon team members such as “i can go nuts or do the bare minimum and get paid the same”. (They don’t, they are hardworking and great guys). Md seems to have taken it on board and wants to talk about something end of financial year. 

The spanner i’ve discovered…. I’ve been crunching hard numbers in our systems and it’s quickly transpiring that my understaffed and clearly under appreciated team are the cash cow in the company. The branch that my MD is based at is currently running at a £66,000 loss. Whereas i (single handedly on the sales front) am running at £222,000 profit from a £888k turn over. 

How do i bring this up professionally without triggering anyone. How do i help my team get their performance related bonus in the same conversation? 

I’m mostly asking as i tend to be confident and hot headed at times. They know im ‘sassy’ but i want to make them smile, raise their brows at my results whilst being professional. They only look at overall numbers whereas i’ve really split things down to see who are the performing individuals. 

Any guidance would be appreciated. I may run this part of the company but i am humble enough to know I’m not perfect too. The main one being that i just want to wag my finger and advise them to shut down or pull their socks up lol.

We're not doing good things here but I do my best to slow the ship down, spend more time growing my teams skills than lining the company wallet, etc. I don't work very hard but have automated enough things that my boss thinks I do. I come in later than most folks and leave before most folks. But I'm the only person with my skill set so I'm pretty safe. I wfh 1-2 days a week unless some task requires my presence. When I wfh I'm productive maybe 1/3 of the time but tend to accomplish 4-5x my normal rate in that time. I work well in uninterrupted quiet and also do better when I can replace lunch with a 20 min nap and a shower. My boss isn't onsite currently (works at another facility mostly) but is moving here to be closer to family soon. Dude is a mega micromanager. I'm passionate about the field I'm in but not my company at all. That said, I make good money and have a lot of freedom (for now). I also don't feel good about the product we put out. There's enough OSHA violations that a well placed tip could close the company doors. I just don't want to be here when it happens because I have bills to pay and the market sucks. 

Potential new job reached out a few weeks ago. I had applied over a year ago before my current gig and they're just now getting around to hiring, but I'm their first choice. Did a few interviews and got the ""hey can you officially apply through our special portal at this link"" message followed up by an interview with a VP. Downsides: it's a significant commute and likely onsite 5 days a week. I'm not passionate about the product but my friends are telling me that could be a welcome change for my mental health: to just be apathetic and let it be a job. It's probably a pay bump but no official offer yet. It's an adjacent market to my current gig and still in my wheelhouse. Plus, I'd be really good at this job and it would be pretty self guided. 

I'm tempted to take it because I need any out from this gig, but I've only been here 13 months and I was at my last job 2.5years. It was good to come here bc I got a nice pay bump, but it has been worse culture wise. Is it worth the risk of losing the time freedom for the potential security? Having time at home to work independently works really well for me and also helps me manage daily life better. It's just easier to do laundry and use folding as a menial task to think about problems than the chore it is on the weekends.

Current gig:
3-4 days onsite only ever onsite 6-7 hours including lunch
30 min commute each way

New potential gig:
Likely 5 days onsite 
Likely rigid hours with scheduled lunch (manufacturing site) so assume 9 hours
45-60 min commute each way depending on traffic

19fb1qp,Fixed time employment in EU,"Hi everyone!  
  
I am 30yM from European country with master degree in mathematics and I work as a programmer in some financial firm. I did 2 Erasmus during my college and I loved them.  
  
So, I was wondering if there are any jobs in EU with fixed employment time (for example a year or even just a few months). I know I will probably have to take a pay-cut, but at this point of my career I think that experiences are worth more. And I don't want to move permanently (i would still like to return to my home country and start a family at the end). 

Is there a portal that would have such search options? Maybe the main question is: Where to start?  
  
I would to work in anything that is at least remotely connected to my education, but I am open also to other areas.

19faja3,career opportunities for a degree in management?,"I was not qualified for retention in Accountancy because I failed to make the cut, and all my scores for the tests were just around 50%.

I don't know what the career opportunities are if I continue with this degree. Do I get a job that's stable and with a somewhat high pay? I plan to work internationally now (the States probably) cause the pay is higher. This would be something I didn't consider at first when I was still in accounting since the goal was to become a CPA.

19f851g,"F25 Late diagnosed ADHDer, study / career guidance NEEDED - please & thank you!","Hi Reddit,  
Like many folks I recently got diagnosed late in life with both ADHD and Autism (however I feel my ADHD is more present and much more challenging in my life), which means I failed a lot of my schooling years and has left me with a lot of anxiety and taken a kick to my self esteem.  
I've hopped in and out of college courses, studying Health & Socialcare. Up till now, in most recent Childcare.  
However, now I'm feeling at a crossroads, and starting to realise I've had a very intense, heavy handed start in life where I've been in survival mode for the good majority of it. Whether taking these paths will actually be good for me in the long run, even if I have the right skill set for these things (so I've been told numerous times.)  
Naturally my family worry about me continuing intense subjects of study / further down the line work, as of right now I'm not fit for this and haven't been for a while.  
As I am very empathic by nature, love helping people, these being probably one of my greatest skills, I've often felt this is my calling.  
In terms of my personality & interests. I'm quite an introverted type, HSP (Highly Sensitive Person), with my complexities such as being Neurodivergent also having a hormonal disorder, I'm starting to realise how important it is to work with these and not against them.  
**Other potential fields of interest (?)** *(in terms of potential future study / employment)*  
I love being out in nature, this is how I really re-charge and feel at peace in my mind. Gardening work I enjoy to do, mostly just as a fun side hobby here and there. Herbalism is a topic I've recently taken a liking too.  
Housekeeper is a line of work I've been thinking about due to the fact I genuinely love to be organised, and clean, re-organise things, make a room beautiful. I have a good eye for putting a room together in general, with furniture, colour palettes, ornaments, the whole shabang.  
Childcare (as I mentioned above), supporting kids with SEN (Special Educational Needs) and being a voice for those who don't have one. This is close to my heart as I definitely would've benefited from this and I know many people who also would've benefited from some extra support. Child development is so important.  
Womens health, as I have PMDD (a hormonal disorder which has a tedency to flare up each month), I want to help other women who face this issue and really get to the root of it but I genuinely have no idea where I'd even begin here.  
If anyone can relate, has any words of wisdom, can throw any thoughts / ideas my way, subjects or career paths which come to mind could suit me from the information I've mentioned here.  
I would greatly appreciate it. Brainstorming ideas can be hard when your emotions are REALLY in it.  
Thanks in advance! :)",Catyaen,1,1.0,0,1706185450,2024-01-25 12:24:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19f851g/f25_late_diagnosed_adhder_study_career_guidance/,1,2024
19f7wbl,Advice for performance evaluation negotiation,"Hi all,  
I work at a tech firm as a project buyer (supply chain management). At my firm we basically define goals every year. End of year, these goals are evaluated and you will receive a monthly bonus based on the points you achieve.  
Next week I have the performance evaluation at work and it seems like my boss is going to significantly reduce my pay based on things I can't really follow. All of the evaluation criteria, especially the ones regarding ""engagement"" and ""being proactive"" are very prone to being twisted in the employers favour, since these are more abstract and not easy to measure.  
  
These points below are what I have experienced so far. I'm just missing the words for how to describe what I'm experiencing and how to go into this meeting. Maybe I will find some help here:  
  
My superior is often not tellin me if something is wrong. It feels like he is doing this on purpose, just so he has the upper hand in negotiation with me when something goes wrong and he can call me out for it afterwards. But maybe I'm going crazy.  
  
I often get into situation where I don't really know what task to complete and in what timeframe and to what extent. Their communication is always very vague and I never receive a clear ""do this, until then"". I often wonder if he is just checking in, or wants me to do something.  
Often, while I'm doing something he will ask for status. I will prepare a onepager to inform him. Then I receive no response. 2 weeks later he tells me he I should've done something else to complete this task. I mean it's always easier to call someone out afterwards, right? And if you want to scold someone, you can always find something.  
  
When going into these types of meetings he always starts with what I did wrong. It sets the baseline for the entire negotiation.

19f5lzq,I accidently made my manager cry,"We were forced to come in during a snow storm. The roads were awful coming and I regretted coming in. It was snowing the whole week, and the higher ups were afraid of us falling behind schedule. Basically turned into, ""be sure to come in early friday so you can get out before the storm."" Turns out the storm started at 5am. Got into work and everyone besides our group was being sent home as the storm was going to continue through out the evening. 

I messaged my manager to ask if we could also head out. I didnt want to be stuck in the storm, didnt know how worse the roads were going to get. 30 min go by and my manager doesnt get back to me. I walk to my managers office to see whats going on as the snow fall isnt waiting for us, only tells me they have to speak with my department manager. Another hour goes by, finally tells me management decided if we want to go, we have to use our pto time. 

Im pretty upset at this point, not that we had to take pto, but that we're just finding out pto could be forced during the worst storm of the year. We didnt have to use pto time for lesser storms, it actually rained so hard earlier this year that they just sent us home before the storm. Things arent adding up to me. 

So, I go to my managers office and ask a series of questions. Why now are we being forced to weigh our own safety vs. Using pto time? Why couldnt we even arrive later in the day? Are these timelines more important than our own safety? This is the first time theyve done this so it was completely unexpected and felt very forced. Earlier that week they let us come in later when the roads cleared up, but today we didnt have that option? 

It sucks trying to express this but, I was only being serious, trying to express the need for better planning and communication in these situations as professional as possible. But, as im asking these questions my manager just looks at me and starts crying. Tells me its not because of me, saying how stressful its been with training and all the things they need to take care. Apparently we're taking a bigger role in our area of work as the higherups are focusing more on client communication and my manager doesnt know if they can handle that. I finally calm my manager down, we start talking about mutual frustrations of the job, under the impression im leaving the office on good terms. 

4pm rolls around, i get a call from our department manager. One of the higherup people I was talking about was in the office next door and heard my manager crying. Department manager put me on a week admin leave with an imvestigation because of it. Basically considering firing me for lack of professionalism. 
 
I have no idea what to do because something so simple turned into me possibly losing my job. I even just started the interview process for my dream job with a different company a week before. If I get fired for this im afraid it will be a misconduct and Ill never be able to get my career going. I wouldnt even be eligible for unemployment because of this.",mushroomhunting026,187,0.8999999761581421,110,1706175310,2024-01-25 09:35:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19f5lzq/i_accidently_made_my_manager_cry/,1,2024
19f5j5k,Reached an aha moment at 25M but don’t know how to get there and how long it will take…?,"Hello, everyone! I'm a 25-year-old guy, and I'd like to share a little bit about myself. Currently, I'm in college working towards completing my bachelor's degree in logistics and supply chain management. I anticipate finishing my degree by the time I turn 26 or maybe even right before I turn 27. Speaking of which, I'll be celebrating my 26th birthday later this year.

I would have finished college earlier if it weren't for factors such as my ADHD, the impact of COVID, as well as family obligations and financial difficulties. However, I've already obtained three associate degrees in 2019-2020, and now I'm determined to finish my bachelor's degree and secure a well-paying job.

Unfortunately, I'm facing challenges finding internships and other opportunities due to my low GPA. Despite these difficulties, I remain enthusiastic because I'm in love with a 20-year-old girl whom I want to marry, love, and cherish. As an American of Pakistani Muslim descent, this is a reflection of our cultural norms. My parents are aware of my desire to marry her, but my father has made it clear that I must first complete my degree and obtain a job.

Additionally, I'm uncertain about when I'll be able to earn enough money to move out of my parents' two-bedroom apartment, which we obtained thanks to my safety deposit when I was 19. I've experienced poverty throughout my life, and I come from a family of four. It's important to me that I establish my own place. I have a strong desire to marry this girl while I'm still in my 20s, around the age of 27, and live with her in my current bedroom, but with a larger bed in my parents' place. After saving some money for two years, my goal is to move out and purchase a small house or condo. Then, I can focus on starting a family and having children, perhaps when I'm between the ages of 31 and 33, while she's between 25 and 28.

However, I'm uncertain about how I'll secure a job after graduating from college. The job market is tough and competitive. I wonder if it's normal for a 25-year-old to be thinking about marriage, kids, and settling down, or if I'm overthinking things. I would appreciate your understanding and support, so please, no negative comments.",ThrowRAafeg3456,1,1.0,0,1706174965,2024-01-25 09:29:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19f5j5k/reached_an_aha_moment_at_25m_but_dont_know_how_to/,1,2024
19f4zkx,I still struggle to contain my frustration when colleagues ask for help about basic stuff.,"Background context: I have two immediate team members (same title) who are older. They are both lovely, super kindly people. I am in a super chill culture with 0 reason to not help people. (No dog eat dog) They don’t have a lot to offer to help me in return, because I like figuring stuff out myself and I learn fast. 

Whenever my colleagues ask for help, it’s almost always basic stuff and it makes me die inside. Basic software things, generally. (“How do I rotate the page in Adobe PDF viewer? How do I freeze panes in Excel? How do I extend my screen like yours?) I generally hide my frustration, explain as patiently as I can, and move on with my day. 

Today I drew a line. I organised access to specialised industry software for all my team (I do that a lot, set up meetings with key people for the team, cc everyone on important things, etc. taking the initiative type stuff). It’s software I am familiar with but haven’t used it in years, so basically starting from scratch, and I was prepared to hit YouTube to prep and refresh. I said this to my colleague. 

Colleague asked me to show him the software just as I was sitting down to do as I said, and I said, “Seriously man, this software has had at least five new versions since I last used it. YouTube is your friend.” He sniffed, “If you’re going to struggle with it, then what chance will I have?” I tried to be encouraging and repeated myself, “YouTube is your friend.” 

Whenever I ask other people in other departments for help, I do them the courtesy of outlining how I have attempted to help myself before I take up their time. Basic courtesy. 

Clearly, I am struggling with setting boundaries on what is and isn’t appropriate when it comes to helping colleagues on the same team. Thoughts?

Since November I have been at home not doing anything but just thinking about my future . I wanna go back to school and get a “real” career or even go to a trade school . The thing is though , I don’t enjoy doing anything . All I know is fast money , I guess that correlates to a lot of math and algebra tho , which I really do enjoy . But I see no future in me getting a business degree or anything like that . Everyone around me is graduating this year and I feel like im left behind . And every time I ask someone for advice they all tell me “maybe you should find yourself and see what u like doing” but the thing is , I DONT LIKE DOING ANYTHING. I’m currently looking for a job in the meantime to keep me occupied but keep in mind I’m only able to use one hand and arm really . At the moment I have about 80K saved up (would of had more but I splurged a lot last year) I’d appreciate y’all giving me any advice , what would you do if you were in my situation?

19ezurw,Feel stuck - would like to hear your perspective.,"I have spent my life doing energy infrastructure construction projects. 

 During college, and early in my career, I worked in the field.   During the time in the field, I grew to respect and admire the people who actually did the work.  Their knowledge of how things worked, and experience was always something I valued. I always wanted to do great work and be respectful to everyone.  There is no situation in which I would treat the CEO any different than the person who takes out the trash.  Universally approach everyone with respect and kindness with a willingness to connect. 

 In almost all of my experience it seems office personnel ignores the feedback from the field and have made themselves completely disconnected from the actual work.  It's not just the fields but even front-line office employees' concerns are dismissed. During college I decided that I wanted to work to bridge that gap and create value for shareholders with those efforts. 

Building relationships on both sides to foster collaboration has always been intentional aspect I worked towards.  I have worked as an analyst/coordinator on billions of dollars in capital projects within various energy producing industries.  Anytime I take feedback from the field to supervisors and managers it seems that it stops there.  No one wants to have the tough conversations about why our projects our overspent and beyond the schedule.  A majority of the time the feedback from the field would have made a difference. It is sickening the amount of money that is wasted because of ego. 

Everywhere seems to be the same though.  There is a book that preaches culture while it's an open secret that it is total bullshit (usually encouraged to do the opposite). Recently, I received anonymous feedback in my yearly review that I 'push back and question too much'.  While it literally says in our culture playbook we should have a questioning attitude? Due to budget constraints, we were told to bid out everything by our director.  Shortly after our manager of projects says we are going to direct award a bid because ""they will be cheaper anyways"" and I should just process the request without pushback.  

One of my coworkers describes it as unicorns and mules. If you are willing to play the game and compromise your ethics, they will treat you like a unicorn.  As an example, a 'unicorn' at our work almost killed someone by not clearing the grounds on an electrical line after an outage.  It faulted immediately and he blamed the contractor even though **it is his job description** to physically check and confirm the grounds where removed.  The unicorn was ""talked to"" and didn't even receive a formal discipline letter and there is no record of the incident in which he is responsible. You can figure out the mule part by yourself. 

Its double speak at every turn! There are silos of information and a good ole boys club.  If you ever question that you are blacklisted.  It's an echo chamber that is dominated by ignorance and ego.  

I am finishing my master's in construction management from Purdue soon.  I don't know what to do.  I don't feel like staying in these situations is healthy for me or my family.  I want to be effective and be somewhere that actually cares about their people and their customers.  Maybe I am too idealistic, or dumb, to make it in the construction industry.  Maybe I should just pursue a career in another space before it's too late.  Maybe I need to change and just shut my mouth and color in the corner. 

I'm trying to stay positive. Often it feels like trying to save a sinking ship bailing water with a solo cup.

My concern is that I'm not specifying a timeframe for the raise after fundraising is complete. I want everything to be laid out so I'm not caught in a situation where the salary raise can be delayed for whatever reason.  
Within what timeframe would you suggest requesting the salary raise to occur? What sounds reasonable to you guys? One month? Two?

I graduated with my undergraduate degree last June, but I haven't made much progress in picking a career choice. For background, I graduated with a degree in Neuroscience (Honours) and a 3.7 GPA. Ideally, I want to be in a position where I can work with people within either the mental health or medical field. Some job positions I have considered thus far include Optometrist, Pharmacist, and Therapist, but I'm not sure if I would be good at these jobs or if I'd enjoy it/ be able to help people. If I'm being honest, I'm pretty burnt out from school, and while I am willing to go back to school for a career I would prefer for it to be short, and something I might be interested in so that I can get through it.

Overall, I want to move on to the next stage of my life, whether that be professional school, a master's, or a job that has upward mobility. Any and all replies are appreciated, thanks for your time and consideration.ly I have held multiple informational interviews to better understand the fields. Moreover, I would like to mention that I would need to go to optometry school in the States (I'm Canadian) as Waterloo isn't an option for me, and I don't know if I could afford it so I would have to take loans.

19exk7x,"California, USA. Will anyone hire me with my varied resume?","Some background, I did my undergrad and graduated with a Sociology degree. During my time in college, I did about 1 year of research. I had the hopes of wanting to go to PA school (changed my mind) and so I became a phlebotomist at a well known hospital for a very brief time. It was a short time because it was a super toxic environment and we were working with covid patients when covid wasn't entirely known. Once I left, I happened to get a preschool teaching position from a mutual friend and did that for about 3 years. While I was teaching, I wanted to get into the tech field and got a UX Design certification and worked at a very small startup for a year. I did everything I needed for my role and being that it was a contract position, my time was up. The UX field is very saturated so applying for jobs was overwhelming and draining. I got married in August and I moved to a different city. Because of the long commute time and wanting a different career path from teaching, I left the preschool position. As of September 2023, I have been unemployed and have been applying for jobs like crazy. Recently I've been applying for research assistant positions because I really enjoyed doing research in college and want to get back into that. However, every role I apply for, I either get a rejection email or get ghosted after first round of interviews.  
I've considered going to grad school but its so expensive and my grades were crap in undergrad (mental health issues and family issues factored into my grades) and I doubt I'd get in with my crappy gpa. As of right now, I'm trying to learn Python or some programming language to have something on my belt when applying for research assistant roles.

I work at a small company in an interesting industry where I have a lot of responsibility for my level. Because of the company’s size, I also have a pretty high-level view of the entire company and work fairly close with the executive leadership, including the CEO.

As far as jobs go, I really like mine and feel that I am learning a ton. At the end of the day, though, it is still a job at someone else’s company. I am a pretty independent person with an entrepreneurial mindset who has attempted to start several ventures of my own. I think about wanting to eventually start my own company everyday.

I don’t plan on leaving my job anytime soon and don’t necessarily feel that now is the right time for me to start something, but how should I proactively go about equipping myself with the skills to succeed when that time does come?

Should I try to take on more projects and responsibilities at work? Start something on the side? Take classes outside of work? Seek mentorship? I really don’t know.

My intent is always to respond within three days unless something is truly urgent, as many of his questions involve checking my calendar and cross checking with other pending gigs. Almost without fail he'll text me within 24 hours of his email with something like: ""Wondering if you saw my email and lmk?""

It feels like the ""boy who cried wolf"", where everything is urgent therefore nothing is urgent. I also find it a bit rude that he would expect such quick answers to nearly every question.

I’ve been taking secondary education in management and project planning currently so if I stay I have a slight chance of eventually leading projects. But I have no interest really in construction industry. The industry is really stable and I do have job security. But I’m not passionate about the work.

Given my current supervisors will likely not give me a neutral reference for my next job and I will not even be guaranteed unemployment should I get terminated (long story), I'm strongly contemplating my options on what to do for the next few weeks. My fundamental question is if I truly need a reference from these people in order to get a comparable job in the future, which at this rate is very unlikely. I also want to know, as a contingency measure, if I could someone spin this career disaster successfully in a future interview with another employer, like, for instance, mentioning discriminatory policies or something of that orientation (which is true).

19eu2jn,Does attending or not attending social events affect your career?,"I'm an early careerist, and I'm at a very socially active company. My boss loves doing happy hours, holiday celebrations for like every holiday, and team lunches. 

I used to love that about this job! I would go to all of them. However, I'm the youngest on the team by a decade and I slowly learned that I have very different values and a different personality than most of my coworkers. 

I stopped attending all social events the last ~6 months. There were a few instances that made me feel very unwelcome or like I could be myself.. judged I guess? Thankfully the last 3 or 4 social events I had good reason/excuse not to go. I haven't missed it, in fact my work life balance and mental health has improved since I've distanced myself from my coworkers and kept it strictly professional. 

However... my boss has been dropping not so subtle hints that she knows I'm avoiding, and seems hurt as to why. I'd tell her the reasons but I don't want to create conflict in the office, and I also don't know what the solution would be to make me feel more welcome. 

My question is, will this hurt my career? I definitely feel a lot more distant to my coworkers, but I believe I'm still doing good work and I'm still very friendly, approachable, and kind to anyone who talks to me. That's just the thing though... I don't initiate social conversations or really any conversation anymore, unless i need help with something or feedback. I try to maintain upmost professionalism and ensure that I'm not disliked or make my attitude known.

I took the first job I could get in Nov because I needed the money at that point and I was healthy enough to return to work. I wasn't sure about the employer or the position and never updated my LinkedIn. 

My suspicions were correct and this is not an employer I want to stay with. I'm 2 weeks away from unpaid maternity leave and am getting ready to interview for jobs to start in April.

My hope is that I can just say I've been unemployed due to the pregnancy and not bring up my current employer at all. But I'm worried about background checks showing it and then losing an offer because I wasn't honest. At the same time this position doesn't really fit my resume well and would be hard to explain beyond ""I needed the money."" I feel like bringing it up would significantly harm my chances at getting a new job and I don't want to spend a year with this employer. It also just wouldn't look good on my resume in general.

19esogg,"Should I, at 28, go back to college?","First of all, excuse my English, it is not my mother tongue. I’m 28 years old right now and I live in Belgium. I’ve always struggled with the decision what to study or what or who I wanted to be in life. I think at 18, I was to young, to immature to make such a big decision. I was not in a good place mentally, in an abusive relationship with my partner, a bad relationship with my parents,… and so on. 

I come from a financially good household. Studying and good grades where top priority for my parents so I got to choose anything to study and my parents would pay for it, in that way, I’m really privileged. Ofcourse back than, I didn’t realise. I started a lot of different university educations but after 2,5 years max I quitted, “not what I want to do/to be” I told myself and others. It was, for me, really difficult and I compared myself a lot to my sister who, knew exactly what she wanted and succeeded in everything she dreamt of. For my, the opposite, so I started working.

I now work in a private company and for my age with no degree I’m earning good my money (for comparisons, I earn a little more than my sister with her masters degree). I feel my job is stressful but I like the job. It is not my dream job but I’m happy. Yet, with ageing and experience, and getting to know myself better, I still feel like this is not where I’m meant to be. For over a year - 2 years I am quite sure I know what my dream job would be and that is something with nature preservation and ecology. I’m passionate about nature, our planet, fauna and flora, the eco system and in my personal life, I contribute as much as I can. I really think a single person can have a big impact and can make a difference. 

But 1 year ago, I had a household to run for me and my ex boyfriend, bills to pay, “the adult life”.
This relationship ended and I live back home with my parents now so financially I don’t have anything to worry about (again, lucky me). 

My question / fear is; I’m really doubting about this because it is a risk… should I give up stability, a stable job which I like, but not love, with a good income, to pursue what I believe to be my dream job with no guarantee that even with the degree, a vacancy would be open for something I’d love to do? For this I would need to study biologie 3 years with afterwards a 2 year master degree ecology. So 5 years going back to the student life at 28 and re-staring adult life at 33y old if all goes according to plan. I really don’t care if I would earn less money, I want to do this because I feel that in that way, I can do something I really love and I can contribute to a better ecological system and I am able to make a difference, even a very small one. I’ve earned and saved enough money to pay for the education.

Is there someone with a similar experience? I would love to hear some advice!

19eqiob,Engineering Job Opportunity Advice,"Hey Reddit community,  
  
I've got a situation I'd like your input on. I am a Sophomore Electrical Engineering student currently enrolled at UConn. I've recently received an offer for a paid summer Electrical Engineering Internship offer with a company in CT. I'm excited about this internship and am going to accept it.   
However, a couple of days ago, I received an offer from a very small tech startup where I would be designing PCBs for apartment security lock systems. Originally, the position was an unpaid internship but I negotiated it to be an entry-level Electrical Engineering Internship with the opportunity for 0.5% in shares to be awarded after six months of being a part of the company. However, this position is still unpaid and I need to do 5-10 hours of remote work every week during the spring semester and summer for 6 months.   
To accept this position, I have to sign an NDA and Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Agreement that appears to be quite restrictive and has a lengthy 20-year duration, even extending beyond my employment. I was able to negotiate it down to only lasting 2 years after my termination or when I leave the company. I am just worried that it will prevent me from receiving potential work in the future.   
What are your thoughts on this opportunity? Is the Equity Incentive Plan good? Is it worth it just for the experience to put on my resume? Do you think it will be worth it in the long run? Also, once the NDA is terminated, is there any way they can go after me for any reason?   
 I'd love to hear your thoughts and any advice you may have. Thanks in advance!",Ok_Specific_6508,1,1.0,9,1706128454,2024-01-24 20:34:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19eqiob/engineering_job_opportunity_advice/,1,2024

19epubf,Accepting a counter-offer that I am not completely sure if it is real?,"Hi all,  
  
For a long time, I was looking for a job at a better country than I currently am. After many many tries, I somehow got an offer from a company which also includes relocation. When I discussed this with my manager, I told him that I am going to accept this offer because it will mean me and my family moving to a better country and a chance for a better future. We talked a bit about my notice period and his final words were let me think about how we can move forward with the notice period.  
  
A day later, he said that he wanted to talk to me and said, after thinking, he decided that he did not want to lose me and wanted from me to find a solution. After a brief silence, he added that he can also relocate me to another branch of my company if that will make me stay. I said let me think and get back to you.  
  
Now the country my manager is offering relocation is even better than the country I found a position and due to finances, my salary will be significantly higher (than the position I found) as well. So if it is real, I am keen to accept the counter-offer.  
  
However, one thing seriously concerns me: I genuinely don't know if he will keep his word and actually relocate me; he can say after a while that the board did not allow relocation or it is time for savings and no one will be relocated etc. and cancel the relocation. In that case I can't work there anymore and I will lose both my current job and the new job I found.  
  
I am concerned about the legitimacy of this offer because one year ago 5 members of our team left after finding positions at a better country and he never offered relocation to anyone of them. I clearly know that some of my colleagues were openly expecting and preferring a counter offer. To be fair, they were all more experienced (twice as more) and hard-working than me and the offers they found were also much better than mine (if you consider it as a leverage and bargaining point).  
  
I also have a hard time to think my manager learned something after last year because he is stubborn and not that open to feedback (or admitting that he was wrong).

Hello! 

I have been working for a company for 3 years in a manager level role in the marketing and comms department. I have 9 years of professional experience and a bachelor’s degree. I also plan on getting my project management certificate with this position change. 

I am moving into a role that falls somewhere between executive assistant and chief of staff, but closer to chief of staff. The position is being presented to leadership for approval and is mine if approved but salary hasn’t been mentioned yet (is this a red flag?). 

Given that I am moving into a different department and position, is it wrong of me to expect a salary change? When is an appropriate time to bring up salary? In my existing role I make a little under 70k. I would anticipate to make much more in this new role than my existing role. The average salary for my new position and geographic location is just under 90k but i feel like given my experience, qualifications, reputation with the company, and level of responsibility I should be making right around the 100k mark.

 I just don’t know what to focus on to get somewhere in my career. I have been applying to junior/entry level/ associate product management, project management, and business analyst roles. I am a hard worker and am thinking of getting some linkedin learning certifications to make me standout. I had only 1 interview with a rejection and have been applying every single day of between 3-20 apps per day. Please help. 

Should I keep at it the way I am and eventually I will get there? Should I change careers? What can I do to be more competitive? I am unemployed right now and really need money ASAP. What kind of part time job can help with my skills to become a future PM or business analyst?",Shot_Basket_9059,2,1.0,18,1706120695,2024-01-24 18:24:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19ena3q/i_hate_coding_but_have_a_cs_degree_what_kind_of/,1,2024

19en3k9,Should i switch majors?,"I’m currently studying 2 majors: Law (not US so it’s undergrad) combined with a Software Engineering degree. 

I’ll graduate in the end of 2026 or beginning of 2027, at 23 years old. 

I recently changed my field preference and would like to work in product development. 

An advice i was given was to graduate and persue a master in marketing and administration since there are people from all kinds of study fields in this career. 

That being said, the majority i see on Linkedin have an undergrad in either English or other languages, marketing, business, or industrial engineering. All with a master related to management. 

I thought about switching to Industrial Engineering and after pursuing a masters in marketing management, but that means i’d only graduate at 25 and from the masters at 27. 

The reason i’m thinking about the switch is because i think i would have more opportunities and get a job in the field i want easier. 

The problem is: my parents are immigrants, the only reason they are still here is because i’m graduating. They expressed how eager they are to go back to our country as soon as i graduate. I don’t want to keep them here any longer than i have to and i want them to enjoy their life. I know it’s not my “responsibility” but i do feel like as their child i also want what’s best for them. Of course they’d tell me to switch if i really want to but i don’t want to do this do them and keep them unhappy for longer. 

If graduating on the path that i am now and doing a master’s in marketing and management works, then i’d do that.

19eksit,A GM on an island,"I have spent the last 6 years working for a big gas station chain in a high profile area. For a good chunk of this time, I was a shift lead. When a new company came along and bought us out, my manager and assistant manager walked out. It was a rough day but eventually I got asked if I’d interview for the vacant spot. I went in not expecting anything but was offered a spot as a general manager. Only trouble is, I overestimated how much training I’d get (basically none) and underestimated my work load a bit. Now this is my first taste of the corporate world and it tasted just like vinegar. I feel like I’m not apart of my corporate team and now my team at the store is starting to feel distant. I just feel like they’ve put me on an island with no power to change anything. I guess I just feel like a fool, I had a job where the stress level was minimal and now I’ve got a position that never stops, don’t get me wrong, I ain’t exactly complaining but, I need to figure something out. The level of stress cannot be good for me or my family. So my question is, ride it out and gain some valuable, sometimes questionable experience or look for something a little lower stress?

Just for clarification, this new company is much bigger. Before we were owned by a mom and pop. This new company buys probably 11 new stations on a weekly basis and their growth is amazing but also scary. They estimate they want over 250 stores by the end of ‘24 but they have thousands and thousands of employees and one person in charge of HR.

19ekap4,I resigned. Is it normal to feel bad about it?,"*long post ahead*

So I just recently handed my resignation and notice to my leads. I have a job offer for a higher position and my new company offered twice my basic salary. 

Out of respect, I gave them a heads-up and I talked to them about it via call. I don’t wanna ambush them by just submitting my resignation letter via email. During the call, I thanked them for every opportunity they gave me — all of the trainings, recognitions, rewards etc. I also mentioned to them that this decision comes from a place of gratitude and respect. And I really really look up to them because they’re good bosses (in their own way). 

They asked what can make me stay but I firmly declined. Life happens and it’s not always about the money, the prestige of my career etc.  

The job is making me anxious and I already 
have chronic stress. My weekends don’t feel like weekends anymore. I constantly check my emails even after work and the work isn’t fulfilling anymore.

I realized I’m getting older and I have goals in life. My priorities changed drastically as I turned a year older last year and I have so many realizations.

But I didn’t make this decision out of the blue or at a time when my emotions are at their peak. It gradually came to me until one day I woke up and realize that I’m no longer happy. And all those times I pretended to be happy at my job, I’m just in a state of denial that this is no longer working. 

When I mentioned to my bosses that I’m resigning, I can’t help but feel sad. Bittersweet. Maybe it’s because this is my first job and  company and they have trained me to get to where I am right now. I owe them that and will be forever grateful. 

Is this normal? Have you experienced this and if yes, how did you manage it? I feel guilty.

19ejh20,Career transition advice?,"Happy Wednesday, friends!

Let's chat about career choices today. I've talked to a bunch of people lately who are thinking about switching careers. But what if you know you want to switch but aren't sure what to? I meet a lot of folks who aren't happy with their current job and want something new, but the big question is - what exactly?

Here are some simple steps that can help you narrow down your choices:
1. Think about what you're good at and what people say you're good at. Then look for careers where those skills are needed.
2. Picture your ideal life. Can't stand the idea of an office job 5 days a week? Look for careers that fit the lifestyle you want.
3. This one's tricky, but think about how you spend your free time and what you find yourself thinking about a lot. Sometimes, the answer's right there. Just be careful - some hobbies might not be as fun if they turn into your job. So, take time to really think this through.
4. Chat with people in roles you're interested in. It's super easy to connect with others these days, and this can be a great resource.
5. Take some courses in areas you're curious about. Udemy and Coursera have loads of courses, even free ones!
6. Believe in yourself and your ability to change things up. Remember, it's never too late to make a change as long as you're breathing. Your future's in your hands!

19eioob,"I may lose out on an annual raise / bonus because of a promotion, is this normal?","Title pretty much sums it up, I work in SaaS and accepted a promotion to our implementation team in December, I was given an 8% raise and next years bonus will be increased to 12-15% (max of 3.75% quarterly) which I’ll be eligible for in q3 instead of the current 5% paid at the end of the year which I thought was fair for the added responsibility. 


The issue is, after accepting i found out that it will be a slow transition, no worries, my bonuses/increases start mid February and I start full time in march so it didn’t bother me too much. What does bother me is that our standard 4-7% annual increase and bonuses are given out in April and despite being the top performer for the 2nd year straight im probably not getting this years annual bonus because I’ll have officially switched to a new department with a different bonus structure and I won’t be gettin another raise as I just started on that team. 

Im not sure why but this just seems a bit weird to me and it makes my “huge promotion” with new responsibilities feel like it came with a 1-3% bump instead of 8 and because of the loss of a bonus this year and the first 2 quarters of 2024 means my “max bonus” averaged over 2023/2024 is now 3.25%.

19egjds,Want to quit my job for the sake of my sanity but don't have another one lined up,"This is going to be a long one, but I'll try and make it brief - I appreciate anyone that reads this. 

TLDR: I want to leave my job to free up more time to work towards the career I want to do, but right now I don't have another job lined up and I'm losing my sanity continuing my current job.

I'm 22 yrs old working as an architectural assistant in central London. Ive been at this job for just over a year now however the past five months or so I've been looking to pivot to a more CGI/3d based role - something that is more aligned my interests and career goals.

 A few reasons for wanting to leave:
1. I live in Cambridgshire by my self at my parents home (my parents are retired abroad). My commute is an 1hr40 door to door - I spend £50 a day for travel costs, £800 a month. I wake up at 6:00am, leave at 7:30, get the train for 8 and get into the office at 9:20. I finish at 6pm, get the 6:15 train and get home at 8pm. Three hours spare to workout and work on the career I want before I have to go to bed again and repeat. It's becoming unbearable do this commute, I have barely any time to work on the things I want to do and just feel like I'm living to work. I have considered relocating, but I don't see the point in relocating closer to a job I don't enjoy potentially locking my self into rental contract for a few months for no reason. 

2. The job its self I have lost complete interest for. I still like architecture, but the role it's self is not teaching me anything new anymore. I'm doing the same tasks, have an intolerable boss, and there is a culture of piss poor management. I genuinely sit at my desk contemplating what I'm doing with my life still being here. The people are great, but I just have absolutely no interest in anything to do with the role and the company anymore. 

So, since experiencing this feeling over the past four-five months Ive been applying to a lot of jobs related and semi related to the field I want to pursue. However, I havent had much success. I have probably sent out around 60-80 applications - from this I have had two interviews, three immediate rejections and have heard nothing back from the rest. Because of the little success, I've been thinking about Plan B. Plan A was to smoothly transition into another job more closely related to my career but that unfortunately that hasn't happened due to my lack of skills required for these roles. The rough idea of plan B is to quit my current job and look for any temporary part time local job closer to home (by any I mean literally anything just to have an income - warehouse, customer service etc..). By doing this I feel like I'll have more time to work towards the career I want to do and develop the necessary skills for it. 

**the CGI/3D related roles I want to do require more software skills and a good portfolio. However, to work towards these I need more time in my life to develop these skills properly and be able to show that I'm proficient. I already work on this at the weekends but because I have such little time throughout the week it's just feels like my rate of learning is so slow. Hence why I feel the need to quit, get a part time local job and use my free time to work on the necessary skills/requirements/portfolio - sort of like two steps forward one step back kind of thing**

My problem now is that I'm worried about the uncertainty of just quitting and not having anything lined up afterwards. I really do want to remove my self from this job and just be able to reset, get time back in my life and pivot towards the next chapter properly. I don't feel like I can do this efficiently continuing my job right now. But, I also feel like I'm doing a disservice to my parents and my self by not having another job lined up. My parents repeatedly tell me that I need to have another job lined up before I quit this one, but you can imagine after almost 80 applications and genuinely believing you're doing the most that you can it gets tiresome to hear that. My brother says the same thing. My close colleagues also say the same thing. My closest friend however says the opposite. He says just do Plan B, and even if you don't have another job lined up immediately it's not the end of the world, it's better to take action into the uncertainty and face your problem head on than stay stagnant and worry. 

For more context just to give a better idea, I definitely feel like I'm losing my sanity continuing this job. I'm losing grip of the things that I enjoy to, like gym and working on my goals. I'm feeling a lot more stressed, I've broken down to my self numerous times at that fact I don't feel like I'm progressing in life like how I should be. Overall, my mental state is taking a hit, I don't feel like the person I was once before and everything just feels very stagnant and pointless.

So, this is my current situation. I think I've explained most things. To anyone that does read this, thank you. I'm open to any forms of advice, criticism and/or harsh truths. I'm not really looking for the ""you're only 22 you should be travelling and living life"" type of advice. I have goals, I have plans, I want to work towards my passion and purpose but I feel like none of those things are happening right now. 

Thank you.",Plane_Assignment5878,3,1.0,3,1706101212,2024-01-24 13:00:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19egjds/want_to_quit_my_job_for_the_sake_of_my_sanity_but/,1,2024
19egerh,Struggling,"I am having a really rough stretch at work right now. Until this point, I’ve gotten really positive reviews and I generally think I’m a capable in my work. I won an employee award for leading a series of projects last year. Last week I did something that I wasn’t aware I did wrong, there was an unrelated issue associated with the project and the CEO blamed my actions for the entire problem (it was a tech issue that had nothing to do with me). This week, I did make a mistake and it’s causing issues. I’ve not done this type of work at this agency, so i lack specific experience here, but hind site being 20/20, my mistakes are glaringly obvious and I didn’t put the actions in place for proper quality assurance. I don’t believe, if i were to do this again, i would make the same mistakes. The problem is, my confidence is shot. I have been scrolling for new jobs as an escape and every time I see one I like, my mind immediately goes to “it’s not like I could do that anyway”. 

I have always struggled with imposter syndrome and moving on from mistakes (i tend to catastrophize things and lose a bit of perspective about the relative size of my mistakes). 

I’ve been in my current position for about 2 and a half years (I’m the first in my position for the agency) and it was a change in both industry and a specialization and I’ve definitely had a learning curve. Usually I can just put my head down and push through, but I am having a big issue being able to see my way out of this. I cry very easily and I’ve cried at work a lot recently. I’m 42 years old and have tried to control it and haven’t found a way that works.  It’s not a good look and it makes it really hard to discuss plans for moving forward with the project with my boss. 

Any one have any tips on moving on from mistakes, especially when you’re still in the midst of the fall out? I have my annual performance review this week, and id like to be able to articulate that I know I messed up and have noted where I should have done things differently, but I feel like the second I open my mouth, tears will come.",Ornery-Kick-4702,1,1.0,3,1706100796,2024-01-24 12:53:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19egerh/struggling/,1,2024

What’s tough is that other than my manager having HR power over me, our job duties are fairly the same, but I never want to misspeak on behalf of the department. He has the vision and I’m still kinda learning the ropes (been in my role for a year).

19efbme,"Boss is making my notice period a misery, is taking the last month off a mistake?","TLDR - I want to go on unpaid sick leave for the last month of my notice. Will this affect how new employers view me or negatively impact my chances of getting a new job? 

Hi, been on here before about this issue but unfortunately it’s still not resolved.

I’m in England, UK if that helps. 

My boss has been a challenge since I stayed one year ago. She’s undermined me, moved goalposts constantly, only ever criticised my work. I brought this up to her twice throughout last year. 

Then she humiliated me by criticising my work quite dramatically in front of our small staff team (4 of us). 

After that I quit and I had 3 months notice, I’m currently almost at the end of month 2. In December she started pulling me up about things I’d not done from over 6 months ago, and it felt like she was trying to catch me out or set up like she was going to blame things on me.

So I contacted the chair of the board and explained what had been happening and that I felt like I was being bullied. I didn’t want to formally complain but I wanted to let them know so if I didn’t complete my notice they wouldn’t think I was doing it because I couldn’t be bothered.

The chair was nice and said she’d speak to my boss so that they could work out a way for my notice to go smoothly. 

This happened before new years, since I’ve been back this year she’s been fine in terms or work, but looking at me like she hates me, any non work talk she makes a point to direct it to the other people here.

I’ve been off for a couple of days for my birthday which was yesterday. Standard practice would be a cake, a card, a small present of some sort. But nothing, she just said hi when I came in and that’s the last she’s spoke to me.

I don’t know if I can stick this atmosphere out until the end of February. I have pretty bad anxiety as it is and this is making it so much worse.

I’m looking for advice on if I’m looking for a new job, would this period of sickness go against me, how would employers look at this, I feel like I’m not in a position to explain her actions as that would reflect badly on me.

Really need to take February off to take care of my mental health, but I’m worried that it’ll affect my job search. If anyone has had a similar experience I’d love to hear how it went for you.

Thanks everyone.",KayBeets56,3,0.800000011920929,15,1706097024,2024-01-24 11:50:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19efbme/boss_is_making_my_notice_period_a_misery_is/,1,2024

24F, currently a lab technician (mostly includes data analysis & also troubleshooting GCMS & LCMS instruments, technically and physically) with an unfinished biology degree (1.5 years left)

I love tech and working with computers. especially when it comes to networks and troubleshooting. However I started with web development & after building my first project using HTML and CSS (youtube clone) i realized that it was very lackluster work (imo)

im very investigative and love finding & fixing problems. I also like working alone, and the end goal hopefully would be something that could translate to remote work after some years and with a job that AI can’t replicate. 

I started with A+ core 1 but didn’t take the exam, but becoming a level 3 help desk specialist is interesting to me, but i’ve heard of help desk horror stories. Sysadmin is also intriguing but it seems really cutthroat without a degree? I started to dig around in cybersecurity and started the ISC2 CC cert and thought that blue teaming would be fun but it’s also seems like it’s the same way but with more certs and more networking involved. i even started thinking about jumping on the machine learning train (even though i despise AI) 

I’m just unsure if i should even stick to getting into IT or if i should just finish my bio degree and stay in the lab. I feel that i do have the grit and determination to make anything happen, i just don’t wanna do all of the work just to end up in an uninspiring dead end job like i am now.

19ec97b,Need Advice on Career Path - Growth Analyst,"Hi guys

I got a job at a SaaS company in the Sales department as a Senior Growth Analyst. This is my first gig at a SaaS company.

This role requires me to run GTMs for the company to explore new markets so that we can meet our business goals. I am also required to audit the sales team as well as review all the running GTMs to make a decision to expand in a specific market. Also, I am required to be handy with the CRM as well.

It's less of a quantitative analyst job and more of a qualitative analyst job because I am not actually crunching a lot of data.

Previously, I have experience in multiple fields such as Customer Success and Operations at tech startup companies. My total experience ranges between 4-6 years.

1) I am thinking about planning my next steps and I am wondering what should be my next designation, so that I can have an idea about my potential growth. Asking because I feel that my role is not actually that of typical analyst and thus don't seem to have a career path in sight

2) Also, it would be nice to know about any alternative career paths that might have high earning potential and are interesting (not a monotonous job).

19ebk9q,Stay business or become solutions architect?,"In August 2023, I got fed up with the technical track and applied for some internal positions. I switched to the business as a ""technical liason"". I transform the business desires into workable project requirement and business requests. These requirements are then provided to my former colleagues and I just coordinate the tasks. I'm sometimes still contacted for technical design problems, but I'm just providing high-level patterns rather than building things myself. Overall, the work is dramatically reduced and things are much less stressful. I'm a lot happier.

One of the colleagues I worked with are contemplating retirement. Therefore, there are talks about needing to replace them or divide their roles. I have a decent relationship with all of my former colleagues and I only left because VSP made the workload unbearable. Irrespective, I was asked from my former Sr. Manager if I would be interested in this position and I said 'it depends on compensation and commitments, but I'm love solving problems and business' well. Just a verbal in-person meeting.

I'm conflicted. I think doing the business translations are quite simple. It's not much time commitment and I'm only working 40 hours a week. When I was in engineering, I was doing 70 hours.  I know I wanted to become an architect for at least 5 years. I used to say I'm going to become one to others when I first joined and was naive.

The salary isn't released yet, but I'm likely to go from 120k to 160k. I'll be staying at the same level. However, the work load and responsibilities will increase. My wife is supportive of both and says the decision is one I need to make. We're not interested in having a child, so the time commitment isn't a concern and being an architect would add significant sway to working remotely compared to in-person operations.

Questions: 

1) Should I quit my job to immerse myself into a creative skill fully? E.g. a UI course would be a 3 month full-time commitment. Or should I try to do this part-time which is less risky but I’m afraid I won’t be able to power through.

19eai4g,Should I Stay or Should I Quit?,"I'm 29 (M), currently working as a fullstack web developer for a small IT company. Have been working here for a little over 3 years, fully remote. During this time I have been living in different countries (currently in Asia) and I realized working from an office is something I would never go back to. I love my current situation, with the freedom to work from anywhere, anytime, having very flexible hours, not experiencing much pressure at all, and earning a decent salary. Seems like the dream, right? Well, not quite.  
  
  
  
**Reasons why I am considering to change**  
  
The job is quite dull and altough there are still lots of things I could learn here I feel like I am so disinterested I just won't. So for a while now I have felt stuck in my learning, wouldn't say I am getting rusty but surely not improving... In addition to that, I feel a lot of stress in the sense of guilt because as the job is painfully boring I am doing the bare minimum and I am judging myself for it. Impostor syndrome is creeping in. I would feel happier feeling more productive instead of doing the bare minimum.  
  
Also, by switching I could get a little bit of a higher salary but that is not my primary concern.  
  
  
  
**Leaving is not that straightforward**  
  
It is very complicated to find a job that offers me a contract with such flexibility. Working from anywhere in the world at anytime in the day. My current contract is kind of like in a gray area as a result of the covid situation we had years ago. Remote jobs are almost always restricted to a specific country or a specific region (e.g. Europe, US...). To be honest I could switch jobs while still living in Asia and no one would notice but the timezone difference would be a huge huge problem.  
  
As there is no pressure at work I have lots of time to do some other stuff on the side. Currently learning chinese at university. This is something I would probably have to give up too.  
  
  
  
One potential solution I have had in mind for a while is to go on the entrepreneurship route and try to create my own business with the knowledge I have acquired as a developer on my career. But I have no idea where I would start and success is less than guaranteed.  
  
I am between a rock and a hard place.

19ea5sy,Help me!!,"I have 2 job offers. Technically I have already accepted one and I’m going in tomorrow to accept the other. Kind of a last minute thing. Let me explain, and give you the details of both. 

The one I’m going into accept tomorrow was my top choice when I first interviewed. We’ll call this JOB B. I got along really well with both managers and everything sounded great! I tried following up, but every time I called they were either away or on lunch. I kind of took that as a sign that it wasn’t meant to be. Now Monday, I’m away on a trip and I get a phone call and text from the GM saying they would love to extend the offer to me, and apologizing for the late response time. 


JOB A: i actually got this interview because the owner of where I get massage’s done knows the GM there. They weren’t hiring but asked me to come in. I thought the interview went ok, but it was 3rd on my list of where I want to work. I accepted this one, as I hadn’t heard from the first job. 

Now that I have both job offers, I’m feeling very anxious. I don’t know which I should choose. I don’t want to make the wrong decision. I’m feeling super anxious about making this decision, because I think I just accepted the fact that I was having to work at job A.

Job A: 
- hired me because they got an awesome review about me 
- pay is okay. 100% commission - $1800 per pay then 15% of value made on the car after the 4th car 
- management seem nice 
- they knew I was interviewing at job B and told me to “beware” 
- benefits are ok 
- they know more background on my previous job 
- shifts are 830-6 or 7 in the summer 
- pays are only on the 1st & 15th 
- I think will be more laid back than job B 
- I heard through a friends dad, they were caught rolling back OD 

Job B: 
- base pay plus commission (not sure what the base pay is currently) 
- I had an amazing interview : I left really excited 
- both managers seemed great 
- they don’t know about my previous job history (I was let go for being too nice lol) 
- 2 shifts. Equalling 8 hours daily 
- I’ve heard the owner can be rough 
- family owned. Heard that can have issues 
- was my top choice during interviewing
- benefits are ok 
- has a vehicle I would 100% be interested in purchasing 
- more well known in the area 
- I read one bad employee review online. Subjective though

19e9ekr,Should I accept a low paying job offer?,"Hi everyone,
I recently graduated with a master's degree in Civil Engineering and 've been looking for job opportunities.
Honestly I only applied for a few roles and was hoping to get an offer from the company I was Interning with but unfortunately my interview didn't go well and they refused my application.

Now I got an offer from a state agency but the pay is around $62K annually. I did my bachelor's in my home country and have some years of experience back there as well.

Is $62K okay for entering the job market in the US?",life-warrior,1,1.0,4,1706073185,2024-01-24 05:13:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19e9ekr/should_i_accept_a_low_paying_job_offer/,1,2024
19e98x0,Feeling extremely aimless and defeated in my career - looking for tips to get back on my feet,"I (28F) worked at a big investment bank for 5 years. I didn’t major in Computer Science, but I loved my coding classes and decided I really wanted to pursue software development. During my 5 years at the bank, I had roles in operations, business intelligence, and data before finally moving into a backend software role. Unfortunately, the manager in that role was extremely abusive. He denied all of my requests for relevant projects, had me do personal favors for him like an assistant, mocked me and said I wasn’t a real software developer, and ultimately threw me under the bus to a managing director. He was also very sexist and seemed to have something negative to say about every woman on our team. I documented all of this and presented it to the MD and also the women’s engineering network leads, and while they empathized and condemned his actions they told me that it was on me to find another role in the company (which was in the middle of a hiring freeze). 

Ultimately, I got a client services role at another company and took it as I was desperate to get out of the abusive situation. I’ve been there for a little over 6 months now, and am really hating the work. The clients are very rude, the processes are super inefficient, and I basically feel like a professional punching bag. I’m feeling super depressed as I feel like I took a huge step back in my career growth and now there’s no way out. I’m just feeling really lost as to what I should do, and also still feeling very traumatized over my experience at my old company.

I’m wondering if anyone has any advice as to what I can do to get back on track. I would like to start coding again but I feel like I’ll never be as good as someone with a CS background, and this current role is creating a gap in my resume. How can I get my confidence back and get over this rut? And should I start applying to other jobs even if I’ve only been at my current company for 6 months?",StrangerBright5561,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1706072637,2024-01-24 05:03:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19e98x0/feeling_extremely_aimless_and_defeated_in_my/,1,2024

19e8v6z,Looking to transition from dental hygiene to literally anything else (possibly data analytics),"Hello everyone.  
As the title states, I want to get myself out of being a dental hygienist, or at least getting myself out of working in the clinic.  
A bit of background, I have an associates in Dental Hygiene and a Bachelors in Biological Science. I've been in this career field for 3 years now, but I knew from the beginning that I couldn't do this for the rest of my life.  
I figured, the sooner I do something, the better.  
A patient of mine told me about how she transition from being a pharmacy tech into data analytics, so that's the first thing I'm looking into (I know, everyone is starting to do this now). A remote job is ideal and something I'm wanting to try to get.  
I've tried the Google Data Analytics program, but I really can't teach myself like that. My local university has a 10 week data analytics program that I'm willing to enroll in.  
I guess my question is, is this a decent route to go? If so, I know I need some sort of experience. What non-data jobs can I get that can get my foot in the door?  
What other job opportunities can I try with the degrees I have?  
I'm open to any and all advice at this point. I'm just not really sure where to start.",Angelic_Arch,2,1.0,0,1706071385,2024-01-24 04:43:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19e8v6z/looking_to_transition_from_dental_hygiene_to/,1,2024
19e8mpa,Advice needed: I think I’m being sexually harassed at work and don’t know what to do,"For a little background, I work in a front facing position where I deal mostly with external community members and stakeholders of my workplace. Most of these people are older men in their 70s and 80s. As a 27 year old woman just starting my career, I’ve gotten quite close with a lot of these people, most of whom treat me like a granddaughter. Some flirt harmlessly (like saying I’ll be their next wife or calling me their girlfriend). For the most part, it’s all innocent and I’m happy to play along and laugh it off.

There’s one, though, who has started making me uncomfortable. He’s gotten much more handsy with me than I’m comfortable with. It started with small touches which didn’t bother me much - I’m used to the people i work with hugging me or touching innocently. But it’s been steadily escalating to hands on my waist or back rubs. Last week during a normal conversation, he put his hand on the back of my neck and was rubbing it and stroking my hair. Today, he pressed his head into my neck and hair to whisper in my ear with his hand on my waist. It seems like it’s getting bolder every time I see him.

I’m struggling because I like this man. I don’t want to cause any problems or drive him away from this community but I don’t know how to put an end to this. I can’t get out of being around him frequently but I don’t feel comfortable telling him to stop, especially since it could harm my workplace financially if he left the community.

I guess I’m looking for advice of how others would handle this situation. I don’t know if it could be considered workplace harassment since he’s not a coworker. I had a previous issue a few months ago of another community member being inappropriate with me in which I was able to remove myself from the situation but this one doesn’t come with the possibility of removing myself.",septemberlyy,3,0.7200000286102295,9,1706070615,2024-01-24 04:30:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19e8mpa/advice_needed_i_think_im_being_sexually_harassed/,1,2024
19e8fj4,"New job sucks, team is nonexistent, boss ghosts me. What's my next move?","Hi! I'm a 28M, software engineer of 10 yrs. Desperately looking for some help as I can't think through my current work situation very clearly. I'll try to succinctly layout the facts.

**Team**  
I'm very isolated in a new job of \~8 months, manager has ignored me at least three times when I ask for help/resources, the only regular meeting I have is a biweekly checkup where my teammates and I basically account for our existence in the company. Team is very distributed and social interaction is very minimal (I talk more with people who I don't actively collaborate with than the 1-2 people who work on the same product). I'm a racial/ethnic minority in my team as well, so there are communication barriers. It seems like this is a great company since many people have uprooted themselves globally to work here (we are a very large company, more than 10k worldwide).

**Compensation & Benefits**  
Not a whole lot to complain about here. I feel they are par for the course, although I probably should be earning more for my experience (I made the same base salary at my old employer). I quit that job for extended travel, then joined this company to start building income again. The company has got me with loyalty incentives trying to earn bonuses and stock. The bonus is prorated but the stock is not.

**Work**  
While the organization itself is complex and full of knowledge silos and many irrelevant training/e-mails, my work is very complex and full of reverse engineering. For perspective, I'm one of a few devs working on a 500kloc codebase, perhaps over 20 years old. Basically, before disciplined software engineering principles were a thing, this has not helped my morale either. I usually explain my job to others as searching for a single strand of hay in a needle stack, every day. It's legacy spaghetti code, no tests, using outdated toolchains, and we depend on executables with source code that we don't own. An absolute mess and hardly anyone to talk with about it to make it better.

**Where I'm at**  
As it stands, I feel very defeated. I don't want to work for a company where I have very little human interaction with teammates, a boss that doesn't put the effort to reply to his new hires and get them acclimated (namely myself, but I suspect others too), and I don't want to wade through a horrific codebase where I can't be productive. But I'm torn because I have to serve 9 more months to earn the first payout of stock (nearly $10k) and I already put in a lot of time. The prorated bonus I'm less concerned about since the next job may offer this. More than that, I'm worried about the impact this has on my career and resume. What are the accomplishments I'll have to show for my time at this company? Will I be seen as a job hopper? Unless I dress up my resume alot, about all I can say is that I gained some industry experience, and I gained professional experience working with an old programming language/toolchain. 

My goal is not to be a stable salaryman and retire at 60 off of a 401(k), but I do like this as a back-up plan. I'm a very driven person and have dabbled in business and hope to do it again (I'm looking to FIRE young), but working here makes me feel enslaved and unable to do things. I can afford some risks right now, but it's not like I have the social leverage of doing whatever I want because I still have bills to pay too.

If you've read this far, thank you, I really appreciate it. My past few months have been pretty hard and this is my first time trying to write about it. I've been pretty anxious about my job because my performance feels lackluster, and I can't understand my boss (I admit, I spend more time than I should trying to analyze his behavior towards me, and others and it just causes my anxiety to spiral out of control). I've thought a lot about just quiet-quitting seeing as my boss doesn't manage me, then maybe doing gig-work on the side. It sounds nice in concept, but I know this still is going to kill my morale and leave me pretty useless in the evenings. Heck, I've even considered looking into stress leave on STD.

**What do you think? Do I stay for the loyal benefits? Do I quiet-quit? Do I try to make the company better by appropriately addressing this problem? Or do I just leave and let them be because the problem is too big for me to change.**",Essentially_Alone,1,0.33000001311302185,4,1706069964,2024-01-24 04:19:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19e8fj4/new_job_sucks_team_is_nonexistent_boss_ghosts_me/,1,2024
19e84s9,Negotiating Hours for an Offer on a Second Full Time (Night Shift) Position,"Hi everyone.

  
I am currently a full time Software Engineer working for company A and have received an offer as a full time night shift Software Engineer from company B with the intent to work both positions. My shift at company A ends at 4pm but the night shift for company B begins at 4pm and the hours for company A are non-negotiable. The commuting time from company A to company B is about 40 minutes so there is no way to make it on time for the night shift. However, company B is a hybrid role and is remote 2.5 days a week.  
I am trying to negotiate with company B to set my hours back to start at 5pm but I need some advice. I have drafted a response that at a high level thanks the hiring manager, expresses interest in the position, and requests the schedule change. Should I give a reason why I am asking for a different schedule and if so should I be transparent that I intend to maintain my current job? I have considered giving a vague reason like personal development goals or professional commitments or omitting the reason entirely. I understand that if I give an unclear reason that I might get pressed on it. How would I prepare a response in that case?

19e6qfx,Completely Lost,"Im 25M and graduated mid 2020 with a bachelors degree in psychology. I unfortunately didn’t make plans to go to grad school. Since then I’ve worked in inpatient psychiatric care units as a technician, which I enjoyed but the pay and lack of pay increases wasn’t enough for a job that required a bachelors (~$30,000/year). 

Through working there, I accrued hours toward a “Qualified Mental Health Professional” certification which (I thought) opened me up to higher paying jobs. After several months of bouncing around between a few companies due to them not giving me enough (or any) cases/clients to work with, I learned most of these companies are extremely fraudulent (employees claiming they’re working with clients on documents when they’re not, I was told to do this directly by a supervisor).

Beginning of 2023, I had to get a second job working the front desk at a gym to help pay the bills. This eventually became my only job when I gave up on the QMHP field after being ghosted by the fourth company that hired me (those were also all contract positions which I’m sure protects them legally). I switched to working in pest control beginning of that summer for a little more pay but was laid off in the fall when work dried up.

As the title suggests, I find myself in a bit of a situation. I completed my first semester of sophomore year at NYU Stern with a GPA of 2.93. I'm majoring in Finance on a full scholarship and am a first-generation college student, just for added context. Long story short, I faced challenges in my freshman year as I initially wanted to study anthropology, but my parents insisted on finance. However, that's all in the past, and my main concern now is making a career in finance.  
I've come to the realization that I not only want but need an internship and eventually a job in finance and financial services. While my goal is to work in high finance, I'm aware that many IB opportunities for the Class of 2026 are already being filled. I'm uncertain about pursuing Investment Banking, wondering if it's even a viable option at this point.  I am considering giving my all this semester in terms of commitment, networking, grinding, and studying. However, I'm hesitant about IB, PE due to the notorious work-life balance. On the other hand, I believe roles in real estate or equity research could offer substantial compensation.  
I'm at a crossroads and unsure where to focus or what career path to pursue. I am determined to improve this semester and aim for a 4.0 GPA, but my career direction remains uncertain. I’d love advice from anyone willing to share their insights. Ideally, I'm looking for an opportunity that provides great compensation, work-life balance, and growth opportunities. However, coming from Stern, it just feels like if you’re not doing something flashy like PE or IB you’re a failure. I know I shouldn’t be comparing my journey to someone else, but I can’t help it.  
I've also been contemplating an MBA as a last resort. For now, I would appreciate any advice to make the most of what I have. I want genuine advice, and don’t mind if it’s harsh, so please don’t be afraid to give me your two cents.

19e5349,Estée Lauder Presidential Program Internship,"I just had my second interview for the EL presidential summer internship and am scared that I did just fine.

19e51gs,Quitting job while on a planned vacation to pursue my dreams?,"First time poster in this thread. Here we go.

I am a professional performer. Actor, musician, entertainer, all of the above. However, things slowed down for me last year and I needed something to make ends meet. I took a sales job and I told my employers I was planning on sticking around and not pursuing acting/long-term music contracts. I had one contract I had already lined up before starting this job in November, and they very graciously said I could take the three weeks to go on contract in February. This will basically be an unpaid vacation. This is my first ever ""full time/9-5"" job.

I've been reached out to by several theatres in the past few weeks asking about my availability, one with a director who I have worked with many times and he is basically taking a show he directs a lot on tour around the country at several different theatres, using the same cast and I would be included in this. The job would basically start as soon as I'd get back from my unpaid vacation. In addition, a few other theatres and performing related jobs have reached out to me about my availability. Some of them pay well, some not as well. Some are guaranteed, some are still up in the air. That's showbiz baby.

I don't love the sales job I'm currently in. I don't hate it, but I think I'd be a lot happier if I went back to working full time in the arts. I already know that it's an inconsistent field - I've done it for years. But honestly, the sales job only pays $35K a year (plus commission) and a lot of it involves schmoozing and spending the money I'd make on commission anyway. 

So what should I do? Stay in the job I just started or quit while I'm on an unpaid vacation when/if I hear about these professional artistic offers? Or stay in the job because I just started and tell my colleagues in the arts that I can't do it? Any advice is appreciated. FWIW, I did not sign any type of contract with this sales job. It is basically a handshake agreement, which my employer values very strongly.

19e4tt5,Any insight on these 2 job offers?,"I have 2 job offers, one as a department supervisor and the other in an outpatient clinic. Both are great offers IMO, but neither are perfect. I'm looking for insight on both of these positions based on how they look on paper, not how I feel about them if that makes sense.

  
Outpatient center:

* 0.8 benefit eligible position (can have more flexibility for time off, but would need to supplement with a per diem position to make 40 hours. I'm single and can't afford to not work full time in this economy).
* $40/hr
* M-F days, no holidays, weekends, or call
* 3 weeks PTO (does not increase until you hit year 5 with the company)
* Just ""ok"" health benefits
* Would be able to live near family but located in a HCOL area
* More of a ""dead end"" job, no upward mobility (but honestly there's not a lot of advancement opportunities in my field)

Supervisor:

* $42/hr salaried position overseeing 25 staff
* M-F days, no holidays, weekends, or call
* Able to work from home if not feeling up to going into the office
* Able to flex hours if I want to get off early/take off one day (Director does not micromanage the hours the supervisor works as long as 40 hours are worked)
* Director disclosed that the biggest issue in the department currently is back biting and that they have been without a supervisor for 15 months
* Mostly admin work with working in department 1-2 days every 2 weeks
* Covers 3 facilities (hospital and 2 outpatient centers)
* 3.5 weeks PTO my first year (increases every year)
* Great health benefits
* Would need to live 1 hour away from family but in a LCOL area compared to the above job
* Advances my career and skill set",bluecatlady,1,1.0,0,1706059237,2024-01-24 01:20:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19e4tt5/any_insight_on_these_2_job_offers/,1,2024
19e4bjw,Received a PIP what’s next?,"I am 28M  working remotely as software engineer for a small company that uses their own technology.

I’ve been in this company for over a year now. Couple days ago my boss asked to have a quick call to evaluate the work I done for the new project i was assigned.  I was a bit so specious about call because just a week he decided with his co-owner to add me to this new project to monitor my progress. This project was a mess because it was a system that I maybe worked once the first month I joined the company and it was built using our newest version of framework (we have two version), and I worked most of the time using the oldest version.

Anyway during the call they expressed their concern that sometime I am super exceptional and I don’t need any help and I do everything on time but sometime I have some down and I don’t progress at all. For example the system I am working, they just asked me to implement something without allowing me to access the front end and replicate and understand the issue, they did give some details in the request but it wasn’t unclear, so they started accusing me that I don’t understand the problem in the first place. 

Anyway at the end of the call they decided to give me one month to improve and if that doesn’t go well they have to take a harsh decision and probably fire me. They asked me what they need to support me, I actually told them 3 times even during the appraisal that only I need was a support of a senior since I am a Junior and I never had it since the beginning and training for the newest version of the framework and provide some documentations/notes since we don’t have any, but co-owner actually told me that doesn’t matter now, you been with us for one year and in the past no one needed any training and emphasises that  it take 1-2 weeks to be confident developing. and by the time I spent in the company I should be a pro, even though I never used the newest version before.

Anyway, the call ended giving me this alert that a decision would be made on my performance in a month. Interestingly, no specific goals or metrics were set for me to achieve, and this lack of clarity is not surprising since I had requested them in the second month of joining the company, following the first appraisal.

I don’t really know what to do, unfortunately in the past one year working for this company my only mistake was not to spend outside work to coding or built my own projects portofolio but I mostly focused on my mental health and getting better,  so for me finding a new job especially a remote one seems very challenging.

I heard that PIP is just a formal way to say we gonna fire you and there is not point to even put the effort.  Should I go back and relearn my tech stack and build project and practice for the interview? Or put the effort for this pip and hope for the best? My boss literally told me they want me to stay in the company and they want to find my confidence. But I don’t buy his words. Should I stay in the company or let them fire me ?",Ok-Anything-8346,3,0.6399999856948853,19,1706057787,2024-01-24 00:56:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19e4bjw/received_a_pip_whats_next/,1,2024
19e4a3v,Anyone know how to cope with office politics? I'm being monitored by coworkers.,"I need to get this off my chest because I've now started questioning the ""normalcy"" of my work ethic in this new job of 6 months. I've been called to my boss' office for ultimately 3 things today. The first one, I'm not proud of. The 2nd and 3rd feels like people around me have become too critical of what I do. This is my first job in America so I'm completely unaware of corporate politics here. 

Issue #1: I got a written report for clocking in without being physically present at the office (I work at a marketing desk job). Apparently, Ms. Payroll was taking notes that I haven't been physically by my desk yet my timecard shows I've clocked in 3-7 minutes before arriving at my desk. I've reasoned, I clock in at the parking lot because once I enter the office, I'd forget to clock in with all the distractions; and this was advice from my coworkers too.

Issue #2: Today, Ms. Payroll escalates to my superiors that I took a coffee break but didn't clock out during those 10 minutes. I eventually realized while walking back to my desk that I forgot to clock out; so once I arrived back to my chair, I inputted my 10 minutes and continued working maintaining the integrity that I'll just offset this 10-minute break and go back to work. Apparently, this was unacceptable and I should've informed my supervisor that I forgot to properly time my 10 minutes.

Issue #3: Being new to corporate America, I candidly asked my coworker last week ""being very fresh to the US"" how I'd like to ask for some clarity on how an hourly employee works. If I'm essentially done with my work at let's say 4:15pm cause I'm already waiting on email replies and starting a new task would be too short of a timespan, is it okay to leave the office already? Her reply was that I can always ask for an administrative task from her while waiting out 5pm. I have no complaints on that. Anyway, this was apparently brought up to my supervisor that I've been complacent at work, unproductive and have not been stimulated with work. 

These are only 3 issues brought up to me this month. The past months, I've brushed off but I just want to know if these are actually serious ""infractions"" or are these coworkers pushing me to be fired from this job? Honestly, I don't even know the right emotion to feel cause I'm so confused at how critical everyone here is!",rockstarmadness,3,1.0,9,1706057671,2024-01-24 00:54:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19e4a3v/anyone_know_how_to_cope_with_office_politics_im/,1,2024

Honestly, I am starting to feel burnt out in this field, and I have no interest in moving toward Data Science or Data Engineering. I feel like I need to change my field somehow, otherwise I will start to feel miserable as time goes on. Personally I would love to move to HR somehow, perhaps in an HR technology role?  
**Anyway, the problem is that I feel like in order to get out of BI, I would have to take a significant pay cut.** I have progressed enough in my career where I have gotten promoted or gotten raises, and now I feel like I have to stay on the path, or start in a different field with lower pay (I have a family, mortgage, health costs that I don't think I could support with a significant pay cut)

Overall, I am wondering what moves any of you ex-BI people have made where you were able to make a similar amount of money, or even a small pay cut to pursue a career that was more fulfilling to you?  
What careers out there were you able to move to that valued your BI experience?

I left the company last year in September, and during my exit interview the HR manager asked if there was anything she could help me with.. like landing a job, and I told her that I'll be taking an exam for a certification and expressed interest in possible future opportunities at the company. She said that there are no openings at the time, but people do return to the company and to send her my updated resume. 

Fast forward to this week: I got an email from her with my W-2. She said I'll probably receive a copy in the the mail, but she wanted to be sure I got it.

I thought it was very kind of her to take the time to email me a copy of my W-2, so I will respond and thank her. 

Is it nornal for the HR manger to send former employees their W-2 form in an email, or am I special lol? 

Also, should I take this opportunity to let her know that I am still interested in future opportunities/positions at the company(I do NOT want my old position back, but I would still like to work for the company)?

I have career question because I am tired and don't know what to do. I have secured a job with a long term contract 2 years ago and I am pretty good at it. But everyone keep telling me that I am overqualified for this job, that I could be doing so much and that staying where I am will only hurt my career. The pay for this job is okay but it varies so much from one months to the other . I'd like to go for a career change but given the state of the job market and the fact I'm not sure how the skills of this  job will translate into another field (customer relationship) I am afraid I will get the same pay elsewhere or maybe 100 $ more.

I have 3 options so far. Studying to pass a professionnal exam that will guarantee me a better pay and a steady career progression in another field. But I am tired of studying. I've already studied so much for my degrees and I feel like studying more will cost more effort that it will bring results. Although the results can be guaranted if I manage to pass the exam.  Quit now for another job but I might end up being paid the same. Or wait a little more, current job might be looking for another manager that might be an interesting experience on my curriculum soon and that would be more interesting to negotiate a better pay at another job later.

I’m almost 2 years into my first advertising job (Junior Art Director) and I absolutely hate it. The company itself is pretty bad (I’m paid barely above minimum wage for 10+ hour days), my boss is not a nice person - however, I still believe I also just do not relate to the industry as a whole.   
I feel under constant pressure to prove myself as I watch people younger than me make huge strides, posting on LinkedIn, and while I’ve had some successes I just constantly feel under pressure to do better.  
But, for what? I have zero interest in advertising. I feel like laughing and saying “this does not fucking matter” every time I’m given a task at work (but I’m a damn hard worker and pretend it means the world to me).  
I chose the masters/career at the peak of covid in panic mode. I thought it would help me become confident, this high-stress job, I’d be that cool sexy hard working business woman, and eventually make some decent enough-ish money. I think I rushed into things.  
In my heart, I’ve always been introverted, I don’t capture rooms as I walk in, I can’t shout.

On the other hand, Kirkland does not, leaving me in a tough spot and having to apply to any other legal internship my junior summer or switching back to consulting to get a full time job after my junior summer internship. I am leaning towards asking to push back the Kirkland internship to next summer, but then I will lose the chance of getting a full time offer.

19dzajf,Honestly feel stuck,"Recently I've realized that the source of my recent waves of depression is from my job. My crrent job is not my desired passion, but the career I really want to go into is being hit with massive layoffs and threat of ai generative technology so I'm fucked even if I decide to make the career jump. Changing jobs within the same industry will not solve anything, the source of the discontent is not the specific workplace or people there, but the existential dread of having to survive until the weekend to actually get the opportunity to enjoy the work I really want.  
But everywhere I look it's unhelpful advice of ""you should be glad that you have a boring easy office accountant job that pays good while so many are unemployed in this economy"" or ""work is work just keep your job and try to spend the 2-3 free hours after work desperately chasing what you really want in a hobby and lying to yourself that you're satisfied with that little segment of time"" or ""stfu you entitled millenial I'm miserable in my job so you should suck it up too"" like thanks very helpful that makes the intrusive thoughts of existing being not worth the effort instantly disappear. Years ago I would've thought ""why would anyone want to unalive themselves when there is so much to live for?"" Now I just get why they wouldn't want to work in a job for 50 years to earn money for the ceos until they are at death's door and also you can barely afford to live and you're too tired to do anything after work and also you will never be able to afford a house or retirement.",Dependent_Manner3111,1,0.5,10,1706044697,2024-01-23 21:18:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19dzajf/honestly_feel_stuck/,1,2024
19dz8r5,Stay in grad school vs potential job,"Important context: 2022 grad in Canada here. Worked in sales for a year and a half (all outbound cold calling role), performance was up and down (never top performer). I got sick of cold calling and working for bad tech companies (almost all had huge layoffs, weak products, and one was even delisted). Feeling stuck I applied to a Masters in Management (International Business) program at a top Canadian business school hoping to break into consulting. However, 3 weeks in I got a call from a senior exec at a major cyber security company I coffee chatted in early 2023. He asked about my interest in a sales role on his team.   
I'm not sure if I should stay in school and take on debt just to work an entry level consulting job or if I should try sales again and potentially earn a good chunk of change. My parents suggested working and getting an MBA in a few years but if the sales gig goes sideways I'll be in a tough spot.   
Here is the financial overview of the situation:   
Masters program: $60k cost all in (will need to take out a $30k- $40k student loan

She said she completely understood and will try and push the hiring managers for a decision.

If I get an offer from company B, how should I let company A know? I have received no offer in writing from company A, just a verbal offer so I’m not far along in the onboarding process at all.

19dv640,"Current intern, how do I ask my employer if they will be offering me a full time job?","

Hey! I’ve currently been interning at a financial firm (hedge fund) since May (I’m a student so it’s been part time for me). I was informed that they wanna create a pipeline to eventually offering me a job but I’m growing skeptical if they are going to follow through with that.

There’s another intern in the team who’s already set to join full time in June and his name and contact are already in the team list. He was supposed to intern for our last semester too but I don’t know why, he didn’t end up coming when I joined back today. 

Now, since they didn’t mention anything to me about a full time role, I’m just wondering if they’re planning on not offering me one since the other guy is already in the team now. It would be helpful for me to know if they are going to offer me a full time position. They asked me in December when I was leaving for a month about if I have other offers or if I’m interviewing at other places and that’s about it.

Can someone please guide me as to what to do in this situation? Should I go to HR and inform them that I am expecting an offer in the next couple of days (lie) so as to get a sense of whether they want me to return or not? Because they’ll probably give me an offer now if they want me to join full time then. 

Please let me know what you’d suggest doing in this situation. I just joined back today and was feeling anxious about not having a job lined up for after graduation.

I have worked for a large (100k+ employees) company since May of last year as an intern, and want to continue when I graduate. The pipeline from intern to full-time hire is usually pretty seamless, but because of some poor communication and bad timing I have yet to receive an offer for when I graduate. I found a potential position outside of the normal pipeline, and because of this I don't know what to expect from the hiring process. The hiring manager reached out to me about a month ago for an informal interview, and we had a good conversation in which he expressed interest in having me on the team. He didn't explicitly say I had the job, but it was somewhat implied. Since then, our communication has been limited but I've gone through the normal application process and was just scheduled for a formal interview by a corporate recruiter. I want some clarity from the hiring manager about if this is just a formality and I can count on this job, or if I'm being considered the same as every other candidate that applied (in which case I would temper my expectations of getting an offer). I don't know how to ask these things without coming across as insecure or having some sense of entitlement to the job, and generally I'm concerned with maintaining a good impression with a potential employer.

19dux9c,Completely lost all motivation for my corporate job,"I need help, any advice would be appreciated. In the past few months, the company I've been loyal to for 3 years has made some weird decisions that don't sit well with me. Nothing illegal or awful, just decisions that in my opinion were solely for profit and really put under the bus employees and customers. 

In addition, while trying to advocate for my customers while also trying to make the company money, I have been getting chewed out. Customers really do not hold back telling you everything you're doing wrong and how much your company sucks, threatening to take away business, even when you drive hours to go solve their problems, or are staying sometimes past 10 pm working to get it all done. 

Pizza parties and the occasional company Tshir are nice but not enough to offset the stress and discouragement I'm feeling. 

This is becoming a problem because I find it extremely hard to get motivated at work. I find myself scrolling endlessly on social media during work hours, avoiding tasks, and not trying as hard as I used to. I hate going to work in the morning because I'm just anticipating all the issues and complaints. I know my company provides a great service but the complaints never stop. 

I've always been praised for my work ethic and it's hurting me deeply to be losing it. I simply cannot make myself do the simple things. Answering emails will unleash panick attacks, responses from other departments are extremely unhelpful and I have been feeling alone and empty.

I cannot quit as I don't have any other source of income, but I'm completely paralyzed when I get to work. It's hard to describe but I physically cannot get myself to do anything. I feel physical pain and anguish trying to get through the work day. I have been drinking a lot to offset this feeling. I don't like myself at all. 

My position is well respected and well paid, I have been looking for other jobs but nothing has come up yet, at least not at the salary level I have now.

19duooq,Are high-performers more at risk of redundancy in the long run?,"The title will sound weird or illogical, but in the 11 years I've been working in a corporate environment (meaning large international companies) I've rarely seen people be terminated for mediocre or barely adequate performance. These people tend to stagnate in a junior role but are rarely fired provided they can do the bare minimum and don't make life actively worse for their bosses. 

What I've observed instead is a cycle where high performers get promoted, often several times, and after a few years are made redundant when the firm goes through a cost-reduction plan because they are more expensive and make obvious targets. The role is then back filled with someone more junior who is promoted and the cycle starts again.

Does that sound familiar to anyone? I've never been made redundant myself but it feels like I'm playing a game I'm bound to lose one day or the other.

I get tried great at my work place but do find myself doing long hours. When i’m not on a project I do 8:30 - 6pm and when i’m on a project, baring in mind this can include a multiple hour commute each day 8:30 - 6:30. Sometimes if the project is too far we have to stay in hotels and are away from home Mon-Fri for multiple weeks. I also work 4 hours on a Sunday too.

We do an ACA qualification while on the job which is really tough and it takes 3 years to complete. My issue is I feel like i’ll have no career and pay progression for 3 years and I feel like my current pay isn’t the best, we get £26,000. End of year one we get a £1,000 increase and year 2 week get a £2,000 increase.

19dufgy,Is my agency planning layoffs?,"Throwaway account lol! So I’m based in the UK and I’ve been at my advertising agency for just over a year. It’s been going relatively well with no concerns over performance etc. 

As of recent, one of the agencies in our office (very well known) we work alongside recently lost an account and there’s been talk of potential lay offs. They consolidated their 2 floors into one and mandated a 3 day return to office. Well last week they laid off quite a few people in the one department and apparently set to do more.

Whilst there hasn’t been talk about it within my own agency as we work alongside multiple, I’ve noticed some changes. 
- mandated 3 day return to office
- another sister agency moved into our department 
- got rid of the free weekly drinks
- been notified about that we’ll need bookings to know when we have downtime
- work has been a little bit slow
- higher ups seem to be more visible in the office than usual 
- management who used to go home early are staying in the office a lot longer

I graduated back in 2016 with an Ops Management degree. Decided not to pursue a career in it, but stay working graveyard at a growing coffee chain. Worked my way up, and over 2 years landed a job at headquarters in the social media department. Stayed there for 3 years, and landed a spot as a digital marketing specialist that would oversee the entire southern region of the company. Pretty cool actually.  
Got let go in 2021 right after I came back from my honeymoon. Hit the ground running in applying to anything and everything I could think and see. I started trying to freelance my social media and videography skills. I applied to thousands of jobs, but never landed anything.  
I'd spend weeks doing 50 or so a day. Then take a break, then do it again for weeks. Not just in the social media/digital marketing space, either. In sales, IT, operations, anything I feel that I could do. I would tweak my resume, fix my LinkedIn, connect with recruiters, etc.  
Changed my resume countless times, sent it to ""professionals"" to tweak it or coach me on it. Studied interview skills, etc, etc. I did everything that everyone suggests.  
I did some odd jobs as side work, and focused on pouring into my business. Worked for a local social media marketing agency and managed 7-10 clients for about 2 years. They got slow recently, so they took those accounts back.  
Mid 2023 I decided to say ""forget social media"" let me dive all in on videography since I'm good at it. I got busy fast, and had a busy summer. Then it slowed down in the fall, and I haven't had any projects for 2 months now. BUT that showed me that I CAN do it, which felt SO damn good inside.  
I'm working at a higher end steakhouse as a server now, and still doing what I can to build my videography business, but I just struggle mentally at times and feel defeated.  
We've got a little one on the way, and I just want to be able to provide and give my family everything I can.  
I'm torn between staying committed to videography, or finding a career that can help me provide the life I want for my family. What that is, though, I don't know. Recently I've been looking into cybersecurity, but not for any specific reason.

2nd job offer is for a territory sales representative for TruGreen, $40k base + commission. 30 min commute and door to door(lots of walking).

19dso2r,Is 6 months at an entry level position enough time to start looking for a new job elsewhere?,"Long story short as possible:

I took a job right out of college away from home where the pay range was great but not significant enough for the area. 

I miss home and my significant other. I go home every weekend because I don’t want anyone coming down to see me because I want to get away from here. The area isn’t bad, I just miss home so much and have no connections down here to hangout or be with - it’s just boring and I’m getting depressed.

I’ve put 20k miles on my car since the beginning of September going back and forth every weekend because it’s so lonely down here. I also don’t have an official place to live so I’m in a hotel and cannot commit to finding a year long lease because I do not feel comfortable signing one because I want to find a new job elsewhere. (I love the job though which is the conflicting part!)

I’m not sure I can find a job that pays this back home, especially for an entry level position like I have. 

The average salary in Laurel Maryland is 61k and used that in my negotiation to get more money from offered, 57k. ($27 an hour to $30.)

The average salary in Pittsburgh is 60k so I feel I could talk my way up to $30 and hour in Pittsburgh now that I have 6 months of experience and can mention the average take home pay in Pittsburgh.

———

If you were in a position like this, what would you do if your career choice was limited due to less firms in the area back in Pittsburgh compared to Washington Baltimore area but not sure how much your pay would be.

I saw some positions starting at ~$23 when I’m at $30. I could never drop that much off my current pay to move back home. That is a ridiculous decrease in pay. 

Do you think it’s possible to talk myself up to get $30 an hour in Pittsburgh at the right firm? 

Theres no openings for entry level positions currently. But with some experience it would prevent a firm from starting a “brand new employee” because yes I’d still need training but not nearly as much as I did 6 months ago.

I am so conflicted! 😭

19dosyu,Restructure is prolonging my promotion,"I joined my company which is a government owned entity around 15 months ago. When I joined, there was a strong pipeline of work and I was brought in to run an upcoming project which was expected to commence within the first 9-12 months and I agreed to work under a lower title on another project until the one I was meant to run commenced. 

Long story short, the company got restructured about 6 months into my job and because it’s a govt owned entity, everything is moving so damn slow. I am now 15 months in and the restructure finally looks like it will be done next month. However, I can’t see my promotion coming anytime soon. I’ve been raising my concerns with my boss since August ‘23 and he can’t give me much of an answer because he has no control over what’s going on. I spoke to him this week and he says that it will definitely come “this year.”.. super broad time frame. 

So since I’ve been working there, I’ve been doing lower level tasks than my previous jobs and a lot less responsibilities. It was only just bearable and now I have to spend 70% of my time working under someone who I frankly think is not competent and toxic (office police). I feel like this is the final straw for me. He treats me like his personal assistant when we have the same amount of experience and likely paid similar. I’ve been professional about it but im not sure how much longer I can fake being nice. The other 30% of my time I work with good people. 

Here’s the thing, because I was meant to run my own project, I was hired at very high rate for what I’m doing. If I job hopped I’d probably get around 5% - 10% more but will be way busier however better for the career and development.

So here I am, feeling that I am underqualified for any jobs in ""my field"", and overqualified for other types of jobs. And I do not know what to do at this point. I am currently living with my parents, since I have no incame... shameful, I know. 

Honestly, I feel that this whole IT career was a huge mistake and I do not have much hope of getting a job, so I am even considering a 360 career change but not sure what could I even do, to guarantee me a job without spending way too much time for it. I've been thinking to learn to become a nurse (even though I am pretty sure I won't like it at all, cause it is not really for me), as probably there is always a need for that... but not sure.

With 2 university degrees, I wouldn't want to work for minimum wage either, like in a shop or as a cleaner, which might be the only place that MIGHT employ me. What would be the best choice right now.  Also, last disclaimer, my relationship with my parents is super toxic, literally every day at home is painful and stressful, so I really wanna get away from here ASAP.... I don't know, it feels hopeless.  
I have interests in coding, writing, creative stuff, cooking, photography. ",SadArmadillo6604,2,1.0,4,1706015451,2024-01-23 13:10:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19do35b/contemplating_career_change_what_would_be_a_good/,1,2024

I hate it, the work is so repetitive and boring. The people are nice but overtime especially recently I’ve kind of realised how my manager is nagging me more than before. 

The only thing tying me to the job is the financial security and also the worry of how long it might take for me to get another job. I don’t know if I can do this job until the end of the year. I always get this feeling that I might get fired because I feel like I’m never doing anything right.

So i decided to take 1 year for self learning and investing in stock market where i failed. As for my backup plan was to enrol myself into a Open mba program I did enrolled last year in July and to pursue for cfa side by side but due to some financial constraints I was not able to pursue for cfa. So i started preparing for govt.exams.

 Currently, I am started preparing for cat 2024 with my govt.exams preparation.As i came from a lower middle class family i cannot afford a regular MBA. I checked it myself that it's tough for me to get a scholarship other than IIM and AAA colleges where collateral and co borrwers are not required. To improve my profile I am even looking to apply for CFA Scholarship.I am a average student and i m a little confused that even after I get into LOWER IIM will i be able to make a career in finance with a loan of 20-30 lakhs on my head or i should just leave everything and prepare for CA inter.

19dmb1n,Should I leave a job after 6 months?,"How should I approach this?

I am a recent graduate in the UK having got a degree in software engineering. I recently joined a job that offered a graduate programme in software in an international company.

This company is set up in the way that the code was historically developed in the American offices. This has caused issues in the past where they had to fly out to fix issues in the UK. I was told when I was hired that I would be working closely with them to fix issues and code new things. 

The company has recently started a graduate scheme to hire new software engineers and bring them along and develop their skills. There were several new hires in the UK but the majority were hired in America.

My issue is that I have been there for 6/7 months now and have not actually written any code over even come close to coding. The majority of my work revolves around building electrical things and solving electrical problems like wiring issues. The Americans on the other hand are getting coding projects to gently work them up to joining the software teams. The senior developers in the American offices give an impression that they are not keen on the UK people getting access to software or actually coding and it feels like I was hired just to let them know if there is a software issue and not electrical and testing their software works in my location rather than actually coding. 

I have spoken to my manager about this and clearly show I am getting frustrated by the lack of learning. My main issue is that I am early on in my career and this job is very long hours and so I struggle to have time to even develop outside of work and so I feel my skills are stagnating. I wish to be a good programmer and I do not feel I will develop at this company due to the American mentors not actually caring about us.

 I have been looking at other jobs but am hesitant to pull the trigger on them in case it starts to pick up in work as I really enjoy working with everyone in the office and my manager is very nice. I also have a 4 week business trip coming up to go over to America and “learn” how to test the trucks well but the last time we went we spent a month just waiting around learning nothing about coding.

19di3w7,Advice on how to convert upper level restaurant management into something remote?,"Hello all.... 

I am in a specific situation where the conditions of my life require I move cross-country, to a rural area. I am 44, currently a GM with the same company for the past 6 years and have worked in restaurants since I was 14 with some exceptions sprinkled throughout. To add a few specifics, I have almost completed my AA in Communications, have a lot of experience with HR related tasks, payroll, data entry, design, marketing, and several other skills that would translate to something online. All of this is mentioned on my resume in some capacity or another. So... given the above limitations and qualifications, I have only been able to come to the conclusion that something remote is the best solution. The alternative would require a minimum of 4+ hours per day in the car, roundtrip to be near jobs that would fit the criteria my financial situation also would require (a minimum annual salary no less than $60k). I am open to working multiple jobs to hit that number. I am currently looking at coding certifications that could open more doors, but beyond that I'm at a loss. Looking for anyone who has managed this transition or one like it and whether it was pure luck or not. Looking for work online today is like when you could use craigslist for useful things (like finding real jobs, apartments, etc), and how now it's nothing but scammers and data collecting bots... now it's the whole internet that's like that ...except reddit of course.

19dh5gl,I fucked up my first interview and feel so stupid… how do I get out of this space?,"A little bit of background about me. I’m 18, I have a GED, and I’m currently self-teaching computer science on my gap year. I actually dropped out of school in 2023 because the traditional school system didn’t fit my learning style, and I really enjoyed taking charge of my learning. I am in the middle of taking CS50x, and so far I have learned about the basics of programming such as loops, conditionals, functions, data types, algorithms, data structures, and a little bit of web development. I know that I still have so much to learn before I can land an entry-level tech role though.   
My sister’s former boss (who is now a Chief Growth Officer at a language learning platform) reached out to her offering a temporary admin job specializing on customer support under her, but my sister couldn’t take it as she has a full-time job. My sister asked me if I wanted to take it, and given how pressured I am to start working, I said yes. So she suggested to her boss that I take it. Her boss said that she would have to interview me though to check if I was the right fit, since it was more of a senior role.   
I know it’s a really big opportunity cause it would be a way for me to build connections in the industry and get some work experience. I had 2 days to prepare myself, and on those days I was having really bad panic attacks. I had to rush through everything: create a resumé from scratch and prepare for the actual interview. I was starting to feel scared because I realized I don’t fit the qualifications for the job, and I didn’t really want her boss to think I was stupid or incompetent. She’s someone I really respect and value, and it would kill me to embarrass myself to her. I would say that was my greatest fear coming into this interview.  
My sister had a talk with me as she was helping out with my resumé. She told me that I could just skip the interview if it was too much pressure on me.  
For my last day of preparation, I was already thinking about foregoing the interview just to save my ass. I was having so many doubts about myself, I was starting to think I was too inexperienced for the role. I even drafted an email to tell her that I wanted to skip the interview because I felt I lacked the skills and experience to fulfill the role, and I didn’t want to compromise with the standards set by her team. But then I started to think it was unprofessional for me to do that, deciding that I wasn’t fit for the role and not even giving her a chance to interview me. I felt like that would give off a bad impression, since she even followed-up twice and said she wanted to see if I was fit for the role by getting to know me better. It would make it seem like I didn’t even give it a try. Instead, I decided she should be the one to decide whether to proceed with the interview.   
Here’s the portion of the email:   
——   
Hi \[Employer’s Name\],  
\[Introduction\]  
I understand that the temporary role you mentioned requires a bit of experience, so I want to be transparent about what I can offer by attaching my resume below.   
Kindly let me know if you would still like to proceed with the interview. If so, please let me know about your availability.  
——  
And she responded with:  
——  
Hi \[Applicant’s Name\],  
It’s a pleasure to meet you! I appreciate you mentioning your experience level, but I’m happy to see if this is a good fit. Would you have time for a call tomorrow? I can be flexible anytime tomorrow between 8 AM and 12 PM GMT+3.  
——  
So I had to continue my preparation for the interview. My sister reassured me and said that the purpose of this interview is for me not to get the job, but to experience how a real-world interview works. If I don’t get the job, I could then ask her for internship opportunities. She could refer me to her friends and that would be a great stepping stone for me in the tech industry. I would have made a great connection in the field by going through this interview. I guess there are more pros than there are cons to this interview.  
The day of the interview came. We talked for a few minutes, introduced myself. I felt that the way I presented myself was a bit flat, and I feel like she saw me as incompetent. She then threw me a question I wasn’t really expecting. “If you were on a dessert island and you can bring 1 survival item, but it can’t be bigger than a laptop, what would it be?”   
then “If you could bring 4 more items, what would they be?” I also felt like I performed poorly on those questions.   
While we were talking, she had to stop for a moment to take a call, and she asked me to write a response to a customer request. I believe she had to take 3 more calls while we were on the meeting room. I felt it was really difficult for me to write a response and structure my thoughts. Even with all the time that I had to compose a message as she was taking those calls, I felt like I couldn’t really compose a good enough response. My internet connection went down while she was on a call and I was gone for 10 minutes. I used this time to continue working on the response. I then went back to the meeting room only to find that she left. I had to email her that I was already in the call and asked if she would be able to rejoin. I left the meeting again because I knew that my response to the customer request was still lacking, and continued working on it. I didn’t realize how long I was taking and she ended up rejoining the call and waiting for 15+ minutes. I rejoined the call but she was already gone. I felt so shitty and so unprofessional for having her wait.   
She ended up sending me this email:  
——  
Hi \[Applicant’s Name\],  
Thanks so much for taking the time to talk to me in what must have been the world's most chaotic interview. I think you're very bright and will do really well. Right now, I have a lot of things going on, and this role was initially created with someone who has about 3-5 years experience.   
I want you to succeed, and I don't think this role at this time would set you up for that. But if you're interested in other roles, I'd be delighted to recommend you to  some friends. Would you be interested in that?  
——  
She messaged my sister as well, the message went on like this:  
——  
Hi \[Sister’s Name\],   
Your sister is great!. When I stood her up for a client crisis though, I realized that I don’t really have the time right now to train her. I have to admit that I need someone with more experience for the role.   
——   
   
I guess I’m feeling really sad because I feel that the interview reflected poorly on my competency. I think I made myself sound stupid in the interview. I felt I was processing things too slowly, like shit I can’t even write a proper email response. I’m having so many doubts about myself and feeling like I can’t survive in the workplace. I have so much respect for the CGO after hearing about her from my sister, and I hate that I fell short of her expectations. She said nothing but positive about me, but somehow I don’t believe her. Is it impostor syndrome?  
Everyone was reassuring me and telling me that I did really well for my first interview, and that I shouldn’t be too hard on myself because I did my best given the circumstances. My sister told me that perhaps I’m not ready for a job yet, and that I should really be enjoying my youth right now. She’s telling me that I’m not incompetent or stupid, that this role just required more knowledge and experience. It’s literally an admin role under a C-Level Executive. And that it’s probably a job mismatch. My mom was like, “Honey, why did you think you could sustain a customer service role? You hate responding to queries. You heavily procrastinated on them when you were managing your sister’s clothing store.” and my sister being like “You’re meant for something bigger than an admin assistant. This role really doesn’t align with your skills, and you know that you really lean towards computer science.”   
I cried the entire day yesterday. I’m still processing what happened, but I have started to feel better about it. Could you guys give me an outside perspective on what happened?

Over the past few months I have been sending out my resume to hundreds of entry-level jobs related to my degrees but I have had zero luck and responses are quite rare. I am looking for advice to boost up my resume as much as I can to land a job related to my degrees.

I know SQL and SAS statistical programming and I consider myself a quick learner. I also made the deans list multiple semesters during my time in college. I think the main thing holding me back is my lack of work experience, extracurriculars and my age. Any advice as to how to sell myself in the best way to potential employers?

I’ve dabbled with the idea of doing a summer d2d sales job where I can work 4 months out of the year and make between 30-70k as a rookie (a family friend does it and makes well over 100k so don’t say it’s a scam, it’s HARD work though in the heat knocking on doors all day).

Do I get a corporate job although I’m truly unsure what my dream job is and follow along the traditional path 


I’m worried if I pursue the D2D job my friends will give me that “is she really doing that post grad” look - in a way embarrassed to tell them. As well as fear of starting my corporate career late and being “behind others”

I've worked for small, medium, and large companies. I would say I have a slight preference for large ompanies.

19dddq5,Worried that if I leave the company its going to really screw over the owner,"My first time posting so I apologize for the formatting or if it breaks any rules.

I work for a very small IT company. Its the owner, myself, and one other very new, very green employee. I've been here for a little over 4 years and handle about 90%+ of the tickets that come through on my own. We've been through about 6 new hires since I've started mostly due to the fact that we're incredibly busy and there's not a lot of time for full hands on training. We have an extensive documentation platform that we manage and try to keep updated and new hires are expected to work through issues using this before asking for help but its been tough finding people who have enough attention to detail to not miss steps and make mistakes. Because of all this I've been relied on *heavily* to take care of most of the day to day stuff on my own, when we implement something new I'm expected to brush up on it on my own and I've also been working from open to close and being on the phones pretty much alone while also trying to train the new guy. A bit hectic all the time but I genuinely enjoy the work.

Saying all that over the years I've become as close to friends as you can between an owner and employee. He's a super nice guy and extremely hard working but we are just swamped right now and it feels like we'll never get out from under it. He works well into the wee hours of the morning almost everyday and barely has enough time to see his family. Also he makes it a point that I keep a healthy work-life balance, doesn't call me on my days off about work and if I need to go grab my kids from school or have an appointment or something else he has no issue with it and always makes it work. However if I try to take off even a few days around the holidays he acts like the business is going to burn down. All I hear is how difficult the time was and he (jokingly) swears he'll never approve another day off. Great boss overall.

Now for my issue. My wife has recently tried to look for a different job because she hates where she is at but hasn't had much luck. She has been at her company a lot longer than I have and has more flexibility so she has adjusted her schedule to be able to see the kids to school and pick them up after school. If she gets a new job that flexibility is at the very least going to lessen and I will need to pick up some of the slack. She mentioned that maybe I should for a higher paying job and one with benefits instead and she can work part time or not at all to be able to handle things at home. We don't really have any family that doesn't work that could help out regularly. I don't even know if my skill set would even allow for me to get a higher paying job and I feel I get paid fairly and I get yearly raises. I know that if my boss could afford to pay me more he would. 

My concern is that if I leave I'm going to be leaving my boss completely distraught, jeopardize the company as a whole, or even his home life if he's putting in even more hours. The logical part of me knows I'm putting that on myself and its not my responsibility but I still would feel awful if things fell apart.

Does anyone have experience in a similar situation? Also if I do leave do I give him a heads up that I'm looking or is that asking for trouble? I would feel bad only giving 2 weeks notice but wouldn't want to jeopardize a potentially great job either. I thought I could wait to see if I can even get interviews lined up to give him a little more time at least to find a replacement. Ultimately I'm doing it for my family and that's more important but the easier I can potentially let him down the better.

Sorry this was a lot longer than I realized. Thanks in advance for any advice.

TL;DR - Want to look for a higher paying job to support family better but I don't want to screw over my current employer in the process if possible.",SkepticalBurrit0,1,0.5,4,1705975999,2024-01-23 02:13:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19dddq5/worried_that_if_i_leave_the_company_its_going_to/,1,2024
19dd713,Leaving a job off of a gut feeling + bad experiences within the role?,"Hey guys, so a little bit of background, I’m 21 living in Australia working in IT, started off at an electrical shop for 15 months during / after school, took a Helpdesk Trainee role in Local Government for 18 months, then moved to L1 Helpdesk for 9 months and have just recently taken an L2 Helpdesk role which I’ve been in here for just coming up on 2 months (all different employers).

Long story short there’s things that I’ve noticed in this role that don’t sit right with me, such as….

- a boss that doesn’t really care much for myself personally or professionally, says he wants me to learn and grow in this role however I’ve just been thrown into the deep end with no guidance or assistance.

- workmates who don’t care about helping out with tickets, it seems like 80-85% of Helpdesk tickets are just going through to myself because I try to delegate to others and they just say no and that I can do it, even if I know I can’t resolve I tell them that but I’m still getting handed them.

- no one filling in for my role whilst absent, was recently in a car crash 3 weeks ago and had to spend 2 days in hospital awaiting scans on my body and brain, I’m healthy and fine however during my absence no one triaged any new tickets that came in during that time and I had to play catch up triaging 2 day old tickets and got asked why there’s so many tickets in triage and that I need to prioritise triaging tickets within 30 minutes of them coming into us.

Overall it’s a mix of gut feelings + some crappy things within the role that are making me think I should try and jump overboard and get into a new role ASAP, am I wrong in feeling this way? Would I be making a bad decision in doing so? What would you guys do in my situation?

19dd1lf,Am I screwed?,"(Ontario, Canada for reference) When I was in highschool, I was very childish and decided to take college level courses in my last two years because I thought it would be easy to make a lot of money in any field, specifically Accounting with a 3 year college degree. I've grown a lot since then, and am deciding to pick my life back up after doing nothing for 4 years and trying to think of a life long career because a job doesn't cut it long term. I just turned 22 and I need to get my life in order for a potential future family. My ultimate dream is to make six figures within 15 years of experience in a field, and with a small college accounting degree, I just feel like that isn't possible. I can't go to University because of my courses, I would never be able to become a CPA. I know there is a way, of course. But there's a lot more to it, than my younger self thought. All for something I don't even necessarily wanna do anymore. I like the idea of a desk job, but after learning about things through research and asking questions to people in the field, I don't wanna climb some corporate ladder or have to meet the specific demands of some Big 4 company, or do inauthentic meetings and interviews to impress and one up people. Like I said, a desk job sounds nice, but in terms of what I wanna do for my life, I don't think it's that sort of desk job. I learn things quickly and really dive into things when I start to learn. I love mastering things. As in, perfecting my craft, seeing where I messed up and I love learning how to correct or fix it. I don't think that that skill is as valuable to that field as I thought it was. I like working with my hands now too, maybe it's just come with growing up a little bit, but my favourite part of my current job is when I get to do work on or fix something. Something I can look back on, and be proud of my work. So I've thought about trades, and it doesn't sound like a bad idea, but I just worry that the pay won't be what I expect. I know it's maybe a little childish but growing up, I never really had a lot. Food and water were never an issue. Always clothes on my back, and shoes on my feet. But I watched my parents struggle. They never went to College, I watched my dad work 90+ hours a week picking up a second job to make sure my brother and I were living comfortably. I don't want my future children to see me struggle, barely see me at all and be too tired to spend time with them when I'm not working. Maybe it's just the economy of Canada right now, or maybe I'm just being pessimistic, but I feel like there is little hope of providing for my family the way I dream of unless I figure something out and figure it out quickly.

19dbssx,"I think I've decided that I like the corporate/office lifestyle, but will it be hard changing to a company that provides products/services I'm interested or knowledgeable in?","Hey all, 24M here, living in Australia in a major city,  
  
For the past 6 years since I graduated HS, I've been in the construction industry, working in the office. I never really studied anything at Uni or TAFE pertaining to this work, so all of my duties have been pretty much just things that any Doris could pick up with some training. I.e., general admin, accounts, data entry, managing fleet vehicles, helping organise things for site staff, weekly/monthly payroll, office managing, answering calls, customer service, safety paperwork (I am formally qualified in safety with a Cert 4 in WHS), and probably other bits and pieces.  
  
Whilst the work is obviously quite tedious at times most of the time, I think it's time for me to admit that it's the type of work/environment that suits me very well. I like working on computers, I like stable work hours, I like having weekends free always, I like office culture in general, and I like knowing each day before I turn up to work what I'll most likely be doing that day.  
  
I've tried to pursue other things I'm interested in, but once those things become ""work"", I simply lose interest. Work is for working to me, not for enjoyment. However, I think if I transferred this type of work to an industry that I was interested in, I could surely sweeten it a bit? Construction of any kind is really just not interesting to me.  
  
So, the bottom line: How hard would it be to take this style of work to another company? Lets say for example; I'm really into shoes and clothing, would I be hard pressed to find a job doing this type of thing at Nike, Adidas, New Balance, etc? Would knowledge or interest in a companies products/services serve me at all?

So as the title suggests I'm really torn up with having so many decisions/choices that I don't wanna end up doing something I regret.

For background I did my BA Hons in economics, and while graduating I saw all my friends get jobs that I seemed to think were really cool. A friend she got into data analytics (we had nothing of that sort in our curriculum) etc .

Now the thing I need help is in whether I should do my masters from Ireland or do my mba from my home country because currently I'm working in a b2c sales job and to be very honest with you the initial starting months up around December was fun. It didn't feel like a job ,just going through the motions ,closing big sales tickets and chilling all day doing nothing. This life feels very monotonous ,robotic and a year has gone by and I can't believe it. almost on autopilot.

If I go to Ireland I'll get a chance to exchange cultures meet new people and even probably stay with my cousin brother who's working there now. But in reality I just want a job where I can travel, really wanna go to Japan or even Thailand some out the box place and live life but it almost seems like I'm at crossroads where I should pick the boring safe thing and give back money to my family.

19db1m1,UK based. Want to start fresh (don't know how to),"Hi all,. 

I am currently a Warehouse Supervisor,  but I want out. 
I believe I have more to give career wise and want more for myself, I never started in this industry I had a admin job but moved to the warehouse to pick up more money and worked my way up. 
My workplace offered me a 4.5k apprentiship to help me get my NVQ LV3 in supervising but then said I have to stay on for another 2 years after I pass or I have to pay back the full amount (even if they dismiss me)

I feel like I'm DONE in this industry, warehouse work isn't really for me tbh. I want more but I've been here a good 8 years now and I'm so out the loop I don't know where to start. Don't have great grades from school and I have bills to pay which makes things abit difficult to just go back to college. I am willing to Retrain and do nightcourses ect but I have no idea where to start.

Is there people that can help you? I remember there used to be a careers advice called connections back in the day but.. right now it just feels like ""f u find ur own way kid""

Any help appreciated!",oogieboogie321,1,1.0,0,1705969311,2024-01-23 00:21:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19db1m1/uk_based_want_to_start_fresh_dont_know_how_to/,1,2024
19datkc,"As a senior that will be graduating this semester, is there any reason for me to do another internship over a full-time job?","I’m a senior in college studying Packaging. I’ll be walking this semester but technically have one more class in the summer. This Wednesday my college is having their semiannual career fair where companies come in and offer internships or full-time opportunities to students. 

Last year I went to this fair and did maybe eight interviews. I ended up getting an internship from that fair for the summer through fall semester which I really enjoyed.

Now as a senior I’m seeking a full-time opportunity at this career fair. Only issue is I feel very unprepared and maybe five companies of the twelve that are offering full-time opportunities actually interest me. Is there any reason for me to potentially accept another internship over a full-time job offer if I prefer this company instead as I technically would be graduating this semester/summer?

19d9xdx,"Switch or not switch jobs while pregnant? offer already on the table, new employer is aware.","I am still trying to decide whether I should switch jobs or not. I don't know what pregnancy is like, I don't know what my future issues will be but so far here are the variables:

**Considering two job offers:**

* **Position:**
   * Current company: Consulting job
   * New company: in-house
* **Parental Leave:**
   * Both companies offer full parental leave. In Scandinavia, maternity leave is one year with full paid salary (partly from government, partly from the firm).
* **Workload:**
   * Current company: Slow pace tasks with the client, work from home flexibility, low-mid stress on the tasks, complex project, cold colleagues, lack of diversity, different language.
   * New company: In-house position, possibly high workload, company prefers presence in the office but there is a potential for a hybrid setup, possibly enjoyable tasks (at least I am interested),  subject matter is simple, seemingly kind colleagues, different language but english language is a possibility.
   * New company is aware of the pregnancy, current company is not yet informed (too early in pregnancy to really tell them).
* **Financial Security Concerns:**
   * Current company went through a bankruptcy and got acquired by a new firm. During the financial turmoil, they failed to pay parts of my salary along with my holiday pay (equivalent to 35% of my yearly salary). 65% is automatically covered by government, the remaining 35% is retrievable if I stay in the current company until July (this is a bonus/ privilege due to acquisition).
   * New company assures no issue with salary and with pregnancy, they are accommodating. Seems financially stable, they are owned by a larger firm. The company itself still has a startup atmosphere but is already established or starting to be well known and used.
* **Salary:**
   * Current job is offering 5% more on yearly salary.
   * Current job will award my remaining missing salary not covered by the government (10% of yearly) in July.
   * New job does not have sign-on bonuses, offered if starting earlier (not an option).- New job's in-house nature makes the offer impressive despite the 5% difference.
* **Worries:**
   * Joining the new company will cost about 10% of my yearly income, at least on the first year.
   * New company: Concerns about performing well while pregnant, uncertainty about workload, potential happiness vs. struggle.
   * Current company: Staying at the current job feels like a continuous waste of time, dislike for colleagues, uncertainty about wanting them around in the next stages of life. But I can see them to be tolerable.
   * Current company: What if they don't pay my maternity leave? I lost a lot of trust in the firm and the management after losing my holiday pay last year.

19d9av4,Is it easier to go from sales to consulting or consulting to sales?,"This is presuming they have the appropriate degrees and education for their field. 

TLDR: Is it possible to be in sales for a few years (working way up ladder to account executive, sales leader, etc.) then switch to consulting in a different industry, or vice versa? Would you need to start at the bottom of the totem pole switching from sales to consulting, and vice versa? I know sales is a low barrier to entry. Or would it be extremely difficult to start in sales, then try to find a consulting role after several years? 

My predicament:

-Bachelors in poli sci
-Masters in international relations
-Been working as a consultant for two years post grad at a very small boutique firm
-have had trouble getting into bigger firms/job market for junior consultants right now is rough.
-am interested in sales career primarily because of the earning trajectory
-am considering looking for a sales job in tech
-if I go into sales, can I always come back to consulting, or is this a bad career move?

Like would it be harder to work as a BDR, then account executive in tech for a few years, then decide I want to come back to consulting, and get a consultant role at a firm like Deloitte?

19d901h,Should I go back to school?,"I’m currently 19 years old and I’m in my final year studying aircraft mechanics, but i’ve been considering going back to school for almost a year now.

My interest lies in paramedics. I’ve always had a pretty deep interest in studying health science, and I really want to help people. although, I’m very aware of the fact that paramedic work is extremely taxing and demanding on one’s mental health. I’m someone who gets tired of difficult people pretty quickly (been working customer service gigs since I was 15 and ready to quit lol), but I think the amount of money I’d be making could cancel out that resentment. 

My main concern is money. Working in my country (Canada, Ontario) as both an aircraft mechanic, and a paramedic usually come with a pretty decent salary, however, I am also aware that aviation is a pretty volatile industry, and that I’d be making a lot more as a paramedic. licensed Mechanics who land themselves in a good company make around (80-100k a year), whereas paramedics in my area easily clear (100k a year, and usually make up to the 120s as I’ve heard). I’m honestly interested in both fields of work, which is what tears me between the two. 

My reasons for wanting to go back to school (another 3yrs) : the chemicals and safety hazards of working on planes is pretty severe, I’d make way more money in medicine, job stability as a medic, mechanics is very strenuous on the body, get to help more people

My reasons for not wanting to go back to school: I could make the same money if I got a side hustle, flight benefits, start making money immediately, interest in the trades, not a customer-facing job. 

I’m running out of time as I’m graduating in June, and Pre-Health programs start in sept.

19d7yxk,Need advice on getting a full-time job after being laid off and running my agency,"I'm a marketer with 5 years of experience. My expertise is mostly content marketing and SEO for startups. In my previous role, I've worked for several years and led content/seo for a startup from scratch but have been laid off. This has been very devastating for me and I couldn't really recover from that for over a year. I applied to a couple of jobs with no much luck, and couldn't really apply to jobs. The reason is that the past experience and layoff were so traumatic for me, each time I would sit to adjust my CV, had to remember my achivements, i just couldn't finish it. I don't know if PTSD from layoff is a thing, but it felt like that and only recently I started to recover from it and let that situation go.  


Since being laid off, I mostly took some freelance gigs here and there. I've also started my own content marketing & SEO agency. It's going okay and was providing me with some normal income to live. But if honest, running an agency is not fully my thing. And honestly, not having full confidence in the next month's paycheck is overwhelming me. Also, I feel like I still have a lot to learn and grow in somewhat ""corporate"" world.   


So I'm contemplating getting a full-time job and running the agency on the side. I've always been managing few things at the same time, so in terms of managing both jobs I'll do fine as both will be remote. Also, I have a good co-founder at the agency, who can run the majority of operations, while I'll focus on more strategic parts, so I think we'll balance the things.   


Now coming to the jobs,   
The first is Social Media Manager at an early stage fintech company (seed). I'm overqualified for this job as I have much more experience than needed and in the recent past hold more senior positions. But I have experience with running social media and can easily do this job. What interests me the most in this position and why I consider applying is the fintech field and the potential to grow with the company, be there from the start, have more significant contribution. I also assume, I'll hold the Social Media position for sometime and then could grow to hold even higher role, maybe managing the marketing altogether. Also as a comparison, the Fintech company's Seed round is almost the half of what No-code company raised in their Series A.  
The second is Head of Content/SEO at a more established no-code company (Series A). I'm well-suited for this job, probably like 80-90% qualified with some room for growth. This position well aligns with my recent roles and skills. The field of no-code is also quite interesting. But at the same time, I get a bit frustrated with the role of ""head"" and the added responsibility to be honest. Given my previous experience, I still feel a bit frustrated because I was laid off from the previous position and feel unconfident.   
So I'm thinking about both and not sure if I need to apply to both of them. I think I'll definitely apply for the Head of Content position as it more aligns with my profile. But I'll need to work well on my CV and present my full potential. At the same time, I'm not sure if I should also try applying to the Social Media manager position too, just to be on the safe side. But I don't know how me applying to that role would be perceived by the company. I I'll probably need to downplay myself and my CV.   


And lastly, worst of all is that I'm in somewhat crossroads. I don't really know what I want to do with my career. But I feel like I need a bit more stability in my life and also the feeling of succeeding to be able to think clearly and decide. The layoff really took a toll on me and shaken my confidence.

19d7xda,Asking for a Raise 7 months in...request for advice,"Hi All, 

&#x200B;

I assume that there's a bajillion posts like mine but every situation is unique and if anyone is able to help provide insight I would really aprecaite it.

&#x200B;

I'm coming up on seven months at my first job out of college, which is a mixture of a sales/marketing/product manager position at a startup in Silicon Valley. For the record I'm currently paid $48,750 annually, salaried, with ""unlimited"" PTO, I've opted out of the healthcare plan because kiaser+medical was a better/cheaper choice, AND I'm still waiting for my promised equity in the company because well....startup things. Now that that's out of the way here's the dilemma:  
**I need a raise:** I drive an hour to work each way and probably rack up $70 a week in gas alone. Nearly $49K sounds great at first but it's only so because I still live with my parents and am not paying for several big expenses like insurance(s) and rent (Silicon Valley is insane atm).   
My job position has me managing the sales for several virtual restaurant brands (think ghost kitchens) and my supposed commission for managing those brands to have sales above a certain amount can kick me up to $60K annually. But the restaurant brands are failing and considering that I'm doing all that I can in this weird startup to try to raise the sales numbers and not much is working I feel like anything reference to my performance will only hurt my ability to get a raise instead of helping me. At the moment the brands I manage are below the weekly goals all the time. I do other things for the company, working directly under the COO I help manage the development of our new websites, product launches (coming soon), and other stuff in that genre.   
I don't know what to say other than 'It's been x amount of time' and 'At this wage living in Silicon Valley is unaffordable'. I've been working a part-time job on some weekends for a family friend to save up extra cash too. While I've been applying to other jobs I have nothing lined up, so if I used the ""other job"" leverage it'd be a bluff. Not sure how even to approach asking for a raise but I do need to ask soon as I'd like to move out this year. 

&#x200B;

Not sure where to even start here. Any advice is appreciated. While I've been applying to other jobs I have nothing lined up, so if I used the ""other job"" leverage it'd be a bluff. Thanks, folks!

19d7a6f,Need Advice: How do I tell my boss that I discovered I have been reporting inaccurate social media metrics for over a year? I feel like crap...,"So in August 2022, we upgraded to the enterprise plan of Hootsuite because it made the metrics reporting more streamlined than going to each platform natively for metrics.  
  
When setting up my analytics dashboard, I noticed two metrics that I thought were measuring different things: Post Impressions and Page Impressions (this is specifically for LinkedIn btw).  
  
This entire time my stupid butt thought post impressions were measuring the number of times my posts appeared in someone feed while page impressions were measuring the number of times our company LinkedIn page had been viewed.  
  
It is January 2024, and I just now realized that page impressions measure the number of times your posts appeared in someone's feed FOR A SPECIFIC TIME regardless of the date when that post was made.  
  
To visualize this, let's say I'm pulling data for the month of January. In January, i posted 4 times.  
  
The post impressions for January could be 10,000, the PAGE impressions however could be 12,050. That 2,050 difference also includes any impressions other posts may have received during the month of January regardless if they were posted in December or an earlier month.  
  
But what did I do before this realization? I would add the 10,000 +12,050 and report that my LinkedIn received 22,050 because I would have sworn that the 12,050 was the number of times my LinkedIn page was seen... until today when the lightbulb came on.  
  
I'm such an idiot. that wasn't clear to me a year and a half ago, and I didn't think to look into it.

19d6qs8,Should someone accept a management position before taking maternity leave,"I've been working for this company for a decade, solely working for the same team the whole time. I know everyone on the team really well and we all get along. We are like a family but with a whole lot more of healthy boundaries.

I have never managed people, but it's a career goal of mine to do so.

Recently, a co-worker went on medical leave and privately told me that they may not come back and wanted to know if I'd be interested in taking over their position, which would mean I'd manage half the team. This would be a dream come true. 

But here's the problem...my husband and I want to try to start having a family soon. I feel weird at the idea that I could possibly become a manager and then theoretically leave for my 6+month maternity leave, which would make a lot of people on the team have to make due with a temporary manager again (which they are already going through now for the second time this year). Tensions are high and people have approached me asking if I'd be willing to manage, so this could really happen in the next few months, but nothing is set in stone and no promises have been made.

I hate the idea of putting my team in a less than ideal situation. My team is pretty self sufficient but they want a manager to guide them and help with their career development. I'd like to believe I'd get support and could maybe even get creative with my maternity leave and find a good balance, but this would also be my first baby and I don't know what to expect. 

I'm 30yrs old and I don't want to wait too much longer to try to have a baby. I also have no idea if I'll even be able to have a child. But I also don't want to wait for another opportunity like this to happen, as it takes 8+years for these positions to open as no one really leaves the company. This really would be my dream job and life changing on numerous levels.

19d6d23,Cambio carriera - bancario,"Salve a tutti, sono un ragazzo di 26 anni e vivo a Torino.
Laureato magistrale in Economia con 110L. Durante l’ultimo anno di magistrale, circa 3 anni fa, ho iniziato a lavorare in un grosso istituto bancario come consulente in filiale. Ho velocemente scalato un paio di posizioni, ritrovandomi oggi con una RAL di circa 36k più buoni pasto, assicurazione sanitaria, e welfare di circa 1500 euro annuì. A ciò si aggiungono premi commerciali periodici che possono variare circa fra 2k e i 6k annui netti in base ai risultati. Insomma, a livello contrattuale, specie alla mia età, credo proprio di trovarmi in una condizione favorevole.

Il problema è questo: a livello prettamente lavorativo non mi sento soddisfatto. Attualmente lavoro in una filiale piccola, con colleghi con quasi il doppio dei miei anni, e mi occupo della gestione patrimoniale di un portafoglio clienti (investimenti). 

Lavorativamente sento pochi stimoli, se non quelli economici (però spesso poco trasparenti), sovente nelle mie 8 ore lavorative mi annoio, periodicamente penso di fare un lavoro in cui credo poco, oltretutto con un bel macigno rappresentato dalle pressioni commerciali, molto forti, quotidiane. 
Convivo con la sensazione che alla mia età dovrei focalizzarmi nell’acquisizione di capacità e competenze, mentre ad oggi direi che da almeno 7-8 mesi non ho imparato più nulla di operativo/tecnico. Mi sento in stallo. 

Dopo 3 anni da bancario, tuttavia, fatico a vedere dove potermi ricollocare senza rinunciare a fette troppe grosse di RAL.

Cosa consigliate? Ritenete che la mia condizione contrattuale sia favorevole al punto da dover “reprimere” queste turbe mentali? O invece ritenete che queste sensazioni, a 26 anni, dovrebbero avere molta importanza?

Ringrazio chiunque perderà 5 minuti per leggermi e darmi un parere. Grazie",Wise_Kaleidoscope_36,1,1.0,0,1705957584,2024-01-22 21:06:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19d6d23/cambio_carriera_bancario/,1,2024

19d5njd,Handed a contract exteny unlike what was initially agreed,"Posting on behalf of SO
 -
I have been working a contract of pre-determined duration at an embassy. This contract has had a very clear end date since the very beginning because I am replacing a person on a one-year maternity leave. 
Now the person on maternity leave asked for more time off (which is granted in the European country where this story unfolds) and the embassy has asked me to extend. 

I have done about 11 months of great work, and while not indispensable, I have definitely carried more than my load, taking in varios responsibilities beyond my job description. Now, they have pushed for me to renew for 3 more months past the one-year but I do not want to without a raise. 

The relationship with the boss has gotten more tense over back-and-forth talks about extending my contract. I want to simply finish it as agreed and take my severance package. But as they kept on insisting time and time again, we came to the agreement that I could extend one more month at the same salary since the raise is impossible - and I would really just do it to close on a high note and end in the best light possible.

Today, after all the negotiating, my boss handed me a contract for twice the time agreed, and he just expects me to sign it. I feel like he is totally gaslighting me and so I told him I would take the contract home to think about it. Now I don't know what to do. Had this happened to anyone? How did it turn out? 

TLDR: Today my boss handed me a contract for twice the amount of time that we had agreed upon beforehand and just expects me to sign it.",bad_hombreh,1,1.0,1,1705955864,2024-01-22 20:37:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19d5njd/handed_a_contract_exteny_unlike_what_was/,1,2024

19d46vk,Layoff disclosure?,"So I interviewed with a company (Company A) back in October & made it to the final round before I was informed that I wasn’t chosen for the role. 

A few weeks later I was notified that I was being laid off due to restructuring by my current employer ( Company B), and would remain on their books until 12/31/2023. 

Company A circled back around this week & said that they would love to have me join the team due to “budget expansion”, and sent over an offer letter. I am excited about the role & everything but frankly it still hasn’t sunk in that I was laid off from Company B a few weeks ago. This was my first lay off. 

When chatting about potential start dates with company A, I asked for 2 weeks just to wrap things up in excitement/autopilot of what I normally say when switching jobs ( and now I’m like why did I say that? I haven’t worked in few weeks lol). 

As I move to review and accept the new offer from Company A, do I need to disclose to them that I was laid off from Company B as of 12/31? Should I loop back and inform them or leave it?  Would lack of notification it affect my Background check or cause any issues/ discrepancies? 

This layoff happened after my initial interview with them & I wasn’t asked if there have been any changes, they were just excited to have me on board. I want to maintain the good vibes I have with them so far, so I’m bit lost on what to do, If anything at all. I have the offer in hand already.

19d34k7,How to complete a backlog of tasks when I’m overwhelmed and unmotivated?,"
Context: This job pretty much pulled a bait and switch on me and I’m mostly doing tasks that I did not expect to do (nor have experience in). They downsized my team so I am the only person fielding analytical/data requests for all departments across a 500+ person company. I have no support and am learning things from scratch. 

I just feel paralyzed right now. I have been working pretty much nonstop during office hours for the past few months, often skipping lunch, but my task list keeps growing. Just this morning I had 5 new project requests come in and I’m basically ignoring pings from 2 coworkers. Now everytime I try to focus, I feel like crying and end up browsing my phone or walking away from my desk. 

I typically handle things by doing smaller requests first before taking on larger tasks, but EVERYTHING is so complicated and tedious. I’ve tried automating some reports and creating dashboards but people either ignore them or ask for more. I regularly encounter “too many cooks”, in which multiple managers will pile on work with specific asks and a simple spreadsheet will suddenly become this monstrous beast I have to update daily. 

I’ve brought up concerns about my workload to my supervisor (who is so busy he is barely in his office), but he just gives me useless advice like “prioritize and ask for help” which I’m trying to do already, bro! Then he criticizes me for joining in-office meetings virtually because I’m trying to work on something while listening in. 
 
Yes, I’m looking for new work but we all know how crap the market is at the moment. I also have a few days of PTO coming up but I can already tell it won’t be enough to truly relax. 

I’m sweating at the moment because I have a few deadlines for projects this week but I can’t get my act together to work on them.

19d2xhy,How to tell my boss I want to change locations because of a toxic coworker,"Hello all, as the title says I'm looking to move from my current store and possibly go to our sister store. (I've been here for two years if that matters to the following)

The problem I'm having here is my associate who was recently went on commission last year has been so cut throat about everything since, even on smaller orders (they also got handed 20yrs worth of clients when the older owner left but that's a whole different story). My final straw was last week, I had nothing going on and we had a lead come in. I went to take it and then my associate piped up and said no I'm taking that. I explained how I was super slow and could literally use something to do, but also want to build my numbers. This associate has over $60k in their queue at the moment and literally that morning they were complaining about having too many emails to deal with. So I said well since you're busy I'll take this order because I have nothing going on. They got pouty and said I literally don't have anything to do (yeah I know eye roll). So I called out that they literally just complained about being too busy and how their numbers are at $60k right now and they hit me with the ""No it's not"" (I looked it up and they had $59k and some change in their WIP queue). This is not the first scenario of something like this happening and they have even straight up stolen my clients and hid it until the order was almost completed when I finally saw it.  So they made commission off of my clients...

Ultimately the advice I'm seeking is how to explain this to my owner as the reason that I don't want to be in this hostile environment? I don't want to sound to whiney about the scenario, but I did tell him when he first took over the company that I refuse to be in a competitive commission environment (I would go to care sales if I wanted that) and he assured me that is not a problem in our industry (sign industry). 

With all of this said, both of my associates have been on commission for a while and I haven't been given that opportunity yet despite having the second highest sales numbers with a 79% YTY increase (I have a meeting this week to talk to my owner about this and have a plan on what to ask for in terms of comp/benefits). I also want to approach THIS topic professionally. 

How should I approach this?  
Do you think I should just put my head down and keep to myself?  
Should I just plan to leave? If I don't get the commission I'm asking for then I'm definitely out. 

This is my first office job so I'm very new to all of this. Thanks for any advice you can share. ",jorcaste5,4,0.8399999737739563,3,1705949066,2024-01-22 18:44:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19d2xhy/how_to_tell_my_boss_i_want_to_change_locations/,1,2024

Here's my response so far:  


*Hello!*   
  
*Thank you for reaching out. I am so sorry for my negligence and failing to report this on my application. I assure you that this is not a matter of dishonesty. I have legally resolved all aspects of the charge, including fine payment, 40 hours of community service, and a handwritten apology letter to Walmart for my actions. As a monthly check-in email to my pretrial diversion officer is my only legal obligation to the matter until July 2024, it often slips my mind that the incident even took place. I, with the intention of full transparency, simply had forgotten about the incidence at the time of filling out my application. Since I have almost completely resolved the issue besides a monthly email, I have no reason to hide the matter from anyone that may ask for my history, and I have fully taken accountability and responsibility for my actions. I have accepted and faced the consequences of my poor judgment last year at a time in my life when I had very little support or guidance, and I hugely regret the incidence. I can assure you that this event is not at all an accurate reflection of my character, which all of my references and the people and my life can more than vouch for. Again, dishonesty was not at all my intention, but it was negligent of me to forget to report any type of offense in that way. I hope that this email finds you well, and that whoever it may concern can proceed with grace for this honest mistake.*

 I did attempt on going back while in this hole of debt that I’m in, but because i was 23 at the time and no contact with my mother, i wasn’t eligible for financial aid (went through MANY hoops, didnt work)

I do love computers (fixing them, using them, & so I started looking into tech. I love investigating, problem solving, & delegating and directing. I really enjoy working alone and with a remote future in mind, I started out with learning some A+ but ended up switching to web development but realized it was kind of boring after finishing my first project (youtube clone). 

I’m starting to look at other areas in tech but because of the oversaturation of the field & my background I’m not sure what to go for or If I am even able to self teach myself into a new field & get hired. ANY advice is appreciated. i’m just so lost and feel like giving up. my mental health is still in shreds but i feel like if i can just get this right, ill be able to take the time to heal & work on my mental disorders.

19d15eb,Is my company trying to rip me off or are my calculations way off? Remote Application Engineer US,"TLDR: MSc Engineer highly qualified for a US remote position (+ travel), 100k base, 1.5k/mo for health, 10% annual bonus based on company results (they were bad last year). Low offer?  
  
I (26M), living in the EU, have been offered a (remote) position based in the US by my current employer. I am heavily motivated by the team as I am objectively the best person for the job, and they do show that they want me there ASAP. However, my company is known (even externally) for undercutting anyone.  
  
I have an MSc in Eng, multiple certificates, at least 5 years of experience, and 2 in this company. I've been the designer of a few of our current products and I have an expert level knowledge in all of them. I'm the go-to guy for solving many specific issues. As an example: In one of my latest interviews for a US job in another company, the deal fell through because I was considered overqualified and too senior for a level II position. For my company, the new position would be as a technical expert working with the sales team for the NAFTA market, with expectations for immediate availability to travel around the US for any support. I would be the person with the highest knowledge of the products in that team.  
  
After a good round of interviews, it seems that I even exceeded the expectations of the team and management. I like the responsibilities and have been looking for a position like this. I've been researching and getting recommendations for salary ranges, conditions, and where to live. We've come up with some expectations in the range of 120k base salary and total compensation value in the range of 140k-150k.  
  
The offer:  
\- 100k base salary  
\- 1.5k/mo compensation for medical insurance  
\- 15 days PTO (I currently have 30)  
\- 5 sick days (I currently have unlimited)  
  
\- No commission  
\- No 401k  
\- Relocation (not mentioned but I expect max 5-6k from them)  
  
After my initial feedback of being disappointed, they added:  
\- 10% annual bonus based on company results (last year they had horrible results)  
  
My wife (24) and I are looking to live in Pittsburgh, PA. Between the exchange rate, taxes, costs of living, regular expenses, etc. I actually might have less to support my family than I have now. For a position with significantly higher responsibilities and direct impact on deals in the NAFTA market.

19d0g7t,Qutting ft job (IT) and going back to college (CS)?,"Hi all,

I'm a 22F living in a LCOL city in the south. My backstory:

College history: I attended a community college and graduated with an associates of computer programming in May 2022. I didn't intend to work in IT but I had been working for a grocery store chain as a cashier and applied to an internal job posting and ended up getting a job on the corporate side in desktop support IT work. I make 55,150/year before taxes. After taxes, I bring home around 3500 a month. I have about 1,000 in student loans I'm currently paying back right now.

Current work: Currently, I am very unfulfilled in my job. It pays the bills and I live within my means, but I am unfulfilled. I work from 8-5 Monday thru Friday on-site and take part in an on call rotation. The only thing I really don't like is the job. My boss is great, my coworkers are great for the most part, it's just that the actual job activities aren't fulfilling for me. We ONLY do desktop/hardware support, so it ends up being a lot of the same stuff all the time and I can't really branch out from where I am now. I've been at this job since November 2022. 

Future of college: Since I went to a community college that works with universities around my state, I'm able to input my credits that I earned in college to transfer calculators and currently, I would enter college being 63% of the way through a bachelors of computer science. I love computer science. I love the theory behind it, I love coding, I love the math involved. 

The only reason I don't do both (work ft and school part time) is that I'm already spending around 50 hours a week at work/commuting to work. I know I won't be able to handle CS classes on top of this, and I don't want to be in college for the next 4 years taking classes part time. I'd rather just enroll full time in college and get it over with in 1.5 to 2 years. Plus, being enrolled in a university full time opens a ton of internship opportunities to me. 

I live in a large city however the junior software dev positions are super limited because of the nature of the industry of the city I live in. I've applied to probably 50 junior dev jobs and got nothing. I've updated my resume and have a portfolio of some small projects I did in college, but most of the time jobs are wanting me to have a bachelors in CS or relocate to their city, which I would prefer not to do.

I live with my boyfriend who works full time as a mechanic and averages about 45,000 a year in pay. He's willing to take up a second job but I'd work part time anyways through college to help support us. I'd also have to take out student loans anyways to pay for college so I'd end up taking out enough each semester to cover my half of rent. We pay about 1250 total per month (rent + utilities + renters insurance.) 

I could stay in IT and stay at my job and feel unfulfilled in where I'm at and pay money to get certifications (less than college, but still) that I have to keep renewing or I could go back to college and get a bachelors in something I'm extremely passionate in.

19d07ml,Found Out My Counterpart Is Making Significantly More And Getting A Bonus For A Qualification I Have,"I graduated with my bachelor's in social work in May of 2023. I started working in June of 2023 at the place I interned at for my last year of college. In September of 2023 I officially became a licensed BSW. I started looking around for other jobs as I knew I could be making more money as an official LBSW. I applied to one and ended up getting the job. It is grant-funded program and the grant proposal called for two LBSW's. I was one of them that was hired. Me and the other social worker got hired at the same exact time, and we both have zero history with the company. The other social worker is quite older than me and in turn, has more experience. However, she is not licensed yet. They hired her with the agreement she would get her license in a few months of being hired. 

Last week her and I were talking after one of our group sessions we hold. She ended up telling me her salary and I found out she makes $10,000 more than me. She also shared she was promised a $5000 bonus when she gets licensed. 

I felt a little uneasy about this. I do understand in most workplaces experience often equals more pay. But I don't understand why she is getting a bonus for something that was a requirement of the job and that I already have obtained. Another aspect of this is because she is not licensed right now, any one-on-one sessions has to be run by me, so I am currently taking on her workload until she is licensed. 

I am obviously very new to the workforce. I wasn't sure if I was right to be upset but after speaking with my mom and my fiancé, they believe I should speak with my boss (who I really do like). My mom said to just state that it's come to my attention my counterpart makes a significant amount more and will be awarded for getting a qualification I already have and to then ask why exactly that is the case. Does anybody have any advice on how to go about this?

19czc97,"Can do more at work, but politics are murky. How to let skip manager know without stepping on toes?","I work in a large corporate environment, and not my first. 6 months in, and it's been obvious for a while that, though the brand/title may look good on paper, career-wise it has been a step down from my previous org in terms of opportunity. 

I am the only IC under my manager. Him and my skip manager have been here 10+ years. There are no other FTEs, just contractors, and while neither seem incompetent (far from it), I don't know how much they've been serving themselves this whole time. Seems like FTEs have rotated out. This is a red flag, but given they truly are not incompetent, I can't just assume the worst (corruption, cronyism, etc).

I am very self-sufficient, I dont actually need managing. But of course, my manager holds all the institutional knowledge.  He is very technical at the engineering level, but not a manager. Fair to call him a technical team lead, except of course he actually is my manager, and determines my comp :) All the usual conflicts of interest there. 

He doesnt respond in a timely fashion if at all to institutional knowledge questions. The past 6 months have been muddling through the hard way. He clearly doesn't like to be on the phone with me. I dont think he dislikes me, he's just another impatient engineer. 

That being said, it conveniently holds me back from really accelerating here. And I recognize now that his institutional knowledge aside, in terms of our work I have some strengths directly applicable to our team's big picture strategy. He is super cautious on all my ideas.  He doesn't bring me into any meetings (it's weird my schedule is still VERY open after 6 months) with my skip manager or even diagonal managers, despite the very small group that we are.  I feel left in the dark. I've only had one meeting with my skip manager in 6 months, where I presented and afterwards received positive feedback through my manager.

I can read the situation. I am good enough to do my boss' job, but he's not going anywhere. I should make him look good to move up, right? Right. 

Except he avoids strategy discussion that I can directly contribute to. I'm wondering if there is any way to do my job successfully when he is above me. 

Id like to at least make it known to my skip manager that there is a lot more we could be doing. I have no idea what if anything he has heard about my ideas, which are considerably more aggressive than my manager's.

19cz1ts,Leave good job for better pay?,"Hi all! I’ve recently been offered a new role with better pay but I really enjoy my current job. I can’t decide if it’s worth it to leave for more money.

Context about the jobs:

Both are fully remote. Both in Marketing doing pretty much the same thing. 

Current job:
$70k base salary + additional monthly bonus around $1k. 

I really enjoy my coworkers here. I essentially have no boss, just my manager who I check in with once a month. Pretty flexible workplace in terms of taking PTO / sick days. I’m good at what I do + enjoy my clients. 

Good benefits: Unlimited PTO (which I do use), 401k matching, decent health insurance. 

New job:
$110k base salary. Year end discretionary bonus. 

Smaller team (only about 9 people whereas my current job is 50ish) + obviously no way to know how I’d like working with them. From my interviews they were all really nice but that’s hard to gauge during an interview. 

Benefits are OK: 10 days of PTO per year which are accrued, decent health insurance, 401K matching but only vested after 3 years. 

The new job is tempting since it’s very similar to my current role + the salary is much higher. I don’t want to jump ship only cause of more money when I do enjoy the work/life balance I have. But more money would be very helpful.

Ownership decided they are getting rid of WFH and are asking all employees to transition into hybrid roles where they must come in 3-days a week. Employees have the option to come into the office or take 2-months severance (beginning FEB 2).

I am an employee they want to keep on as a contractor because I have told them I am not willing to come into the office but I'm pretty critical to their operation, especially in Q1 & Q2.

**My initial ask:** 2 months severance + $16,000 per month until the end of 2024

**Their counter:** extend my full-time pay until end of April then transition me to a contract role (for 3 to 6 Months) but only at $12,000 per month. Due to some legalities (NY State) and because of how senior I am at the company, they were not able to provide me a year long contract.

I'm pretty nervous because this company has shown they do not care for their people. ***How do I go about getting reassurance that come at the end of April, I will actually have a contract in place?*** My baseline is to say $16,000 or I would rather leave but I do not want them to just use me until April then cut ties.

19cvpaa,What offer should I choose?,"
I have two offers right now, one at PNC for a product management intern position in Houston(25/hr) and a Risk Management Consultant intern at Crowe in Atlanta(31/hr). I’m more interested in product management, however the most important factor to me is starting salary if I got a full time offer. Crowe has told me that they usually let interns switch fields within the company if they accept full time, and they have a work from anywhere policy which is really enticing to me. The issue is that I’m not interested in Risk and Assurance but I am interested in PM. Can anyone offer me advice?",Top_Working_9736,1,1.0,1,1705930350,2024-01-22 13:32:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19cvpaa/what_offer_should_i_choose/,1,2024
19cvg80,chemical engineer needs advice,"hi everyone, im 24f and i really dont know how to sum it up but here goes nothing:
i live in Turkey, my major was chemical engineering and i graduated from one of a very well known university in Turkey.
life was pretty shaky back then and I really wanted my dad to see I get a job before he leaves us (we lost him 1,5 months ago) and i really didnt have much chance to think between trying to graduate, graduating and then getting a job. i just had a good offer from a cement company and went with it. it was a graduate program involving travels to multiple countries, nice pay etc. 

after traveling countries in europe, we came back to turkey, and figured its a pretty shitty workplace to work in. full of unqualified rude people, a few qualified people trying to survive (often mentioning that we should run away and never come back) and pointing how unhappy they are. factory is known for people quitting all the time. people my age who came with similar programs quit within first 6 months and whenever I talk to them they mention that we should probably do the same for our own good

the problem with this industry is that (at least for Turkey), since it’s a very challenging industry, very few qualified people wants to work in. which makes it more challenging, since now you have to work with these people. although i did not not like the industry at first, my willing to work as a chemical engineer here died rather quickly

now i have 3 questions:
1) im scared that i will have backlash from people around me for quitting, that they will say every workplace is like this and im just being a crybaby. i really dont want to get into detail of stuff thats going on right now, but would you say that every workplace is full of problematic people and there is no chance of being happy with your career?
all people i talked with who had prior experience here disagrees with this btw. they just call here the worst experience

2) if i quit now, since I won’t be completing the graduate program that was supposed to last a year, do you think it’s bad reference? is “i couldnt see myself working in this industry” a valid reason?

3) last but not least: am i too late to envision myself working in tech, become a programmer? i started building a portfolio on github, i have base coding knowledge, small steps but trying to get somewhere with it",jothexp333,2,1.0,0,1705929556,2024-01-22 13:19:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19cvg80/chemical_engineer_needs_advice/,1,2024
19cv4p0,Is marketing over saturated?,"I have a degree in Communications and a work history in customer service and supply chain support.

I have been considering whether to pivot into marketing, HR, or administration, or continue my current path. 

I make 52k as a customer ops coordinator / supply chain support rep.

If I were to pivot, I’d probably be making around $21 per hour (currently at $25). 

If I continue in supply chain, I bet I could land a job at $35 per hour.

I live alone and support myself. More money would be very nice. My past jobs have been alright, but I’m pretty tired of customers, and the repetitive nature of my job and annoying things that pop up time and time again every single day.

My strengths at work have always been that I’m a hard worker, detail oriented, accurate, extremely organized, and a good writer of emails, notes, and SOPs.

My weaknesses are that I’m not super social, I’m quiet, I have the capability to do more and be a leader but don’t put forth the effort I guess.

I wish to be more creative and test my creativity in the workplace, use my empathy and out of the box thinking in marketing. But, I also have some negative feelings towards the field, like that it is manipulative, maybe immoral at times, and can be too salesy for me. I personally love design, aesthetics, I love to decorate, I love to come up with the perfect words to describe something, I love to connect through words, branding is very interesting to me, I love to try and put myself into the shoes of the customer.

I wish to help people and have a respectable career, which I thought HR could be. But also, I feel that HR’s interest is really just only for the company, and not the employee, and they will do anything to save their job and don’t mind yours so much. Its business.

Administration, I feel people don’t respect those folks enough. My goal would be to be an Executive Assistant, but in that job, it would really depend on your exec how good you had it. Many execs could be hard to work for, but also, working with the top minds in a company would be interesting and stimulating I feel. I feel I could serve in this role.

So, I really am not sure whether or not I should stay in my current area of business and put to use all of my current skills in ERP systems, order management, etc., or go for something different. I kind of feel I’m not passionate enough about something else to pivot, and maybe I should just stay in my current line of business for security and stability and finances.

\- GOAL : Want to work in financial sector companies like blackstone, tata financial group and all.   
\- Position I'm looking for : Financial Analyst  
\- Job I want to Avoid : Sales and any front end job ( front end like that requires SOFT skills more than                    HARD skills )  
\- Strength : can learn any thing easily, strong technical background, will do anything to earn 1 lakh   
per month.  
\- Weakness : Soft skills  
I come from a strong government job holders background and I want to pursue my career in the field of finance and analyst (combination of both is my priority). Now moving to the problem or more like confusion I'm facing, I have offer letter from Apeejay School of Management(dwarka, delhi) for PGDM programm(you can look for the collage online). I gave CAT exam without any prep and got 76 percentile and chose this cllg bcz of the following reason:  
\- Low Fees  
\- Good ROI  
\- Companies like Blackstone, Tata Financial group, Deloitte etc comes for recruitment  
\- 40-50 min far from my home   
As per now I gave interview in of the company through my referral and job is most likely in my pocket and I'm having double doubts  whether to go for 2nd attempt in CAT or should I continue with this college, kindly suggest me anything that can help me to clear this double thought I'm having regarding my career.

Plus idk how to even move up the ladder, anytime I talk about moving up I’m told to become a nurse. But even most nurse stay at bedside instead of moving up.

I have no college degree, I started going back to school for psychology but failed out (I had a baby at the beginning of one term and spent most of the 10 weeks at a pediatric hospital and schoolwork was the last thing in ny mind) I’ve applied to go back, but I really don’t know what Job I actually want.- I was doing school through Perdue global but I have to tell them specifically what job I’m going for and I have no clue. I just find the brain and psychology so interesting. And I love helping people. I also love health care but I’m in no way interested in nursing. 

At the end of the day, I just want a job that pays me well. I’d prefer one where I can just do certain tasks then leave. I have ADHD and OCD and thrive off of lists/tasks.

I’m in the US. Was offered 5% “cost of living” increase (though that’s not enough to start off with) - then a promotion when I return from mat leave of another 5% increase to a senior role - which by the way, I’m already doing basically all of those things the role entails. 

Kicker - I’m currently hourly pay because I knew I had overtime and pushed back last year when they wanted me to go salary. This year they’re making me go salary - but this increase we speak of is based off of arbitrary numbers, not what I ACTUALLY made last year.

I now have almost 4 years of experience. I am Cloud/DevOps Engineer mostly worked on AWS. My first job was in Healthtech and it taught me alot I enjoyey my eork alot. But due to certain family reasons I had to move to another country. I left that job immediately without notice and that company didn't gave me my last month's salary.  
I loved that role and I even till date miss that job and my team mates. This was 2.5 years ago.  
Moved to another country joined a Startup, I was the second hire in Tech Team. I along the CTO built very cool tech to support the needs of other teams. There were some conflicts between Business leadership and CTO on how new features should be added. Business leadership never cared about the scalability part. CTO resigned and suddenly I was I was temporarily promoted to look afters things until a new CTO is hired.  
I was very overwhelmed and overworked. I decided to resign because business leadership will give unachievable deadlines for new features and then without testing then will forceful get those features in Production. And then they will complain that Tech team is not capable enough.  
After completing my notice period. I decided to move back to my home country. I joined a remote company as a Senior DevOps Engineer. They are services based company. They haven't not given a project till date now it been morethan 1 month. Sometimes I am oversea some junior team members very basic problems. Sometimes if another resource is on leave I will asked to fill their shoes. I not clear what will be my role in this company.  
Now I have another offer from a well known corporate company same title but it on-site role. Also salary will be little less than what I will be earning currently. But they are very rigid like I told them my current salary and asked them to match it they were like no best we can do is 35% less what you are getting at the moment. I told them then its not possible for me to join. Then after few day they reached out again and said this is last offer 10% less than my current one.  
Should I join this corporate on-site role or stick to the current ome where I am unable to understand what future holds for me?

I'd like to ask my former boss to correct the reference he sent.   
Why you might ask? Because I worked really hard for him and he is pissed that it was me who quit and not him who quit me. When he got my cancelling, he wrote me a whatsapp: ""you dont need to come anymore tomorrow""   


Thats not legal where I live and being so  angry about his reaction, I went to court. Wouldn't do that again, but well at that time I decided to do that.   
Court gave me right, firing me without a significant reason and via whatsapp is not legal.  we decided that he needs to write me a good reference.  
It took him 2 months to write it and unfortunatly I was so afraid to open that letter, that it took me even 3 months to open the letter. That was in december.  
The reference contains mistakes, my name is written wrong and through the back door it's clear that the referencee about me isn't good.   
I want to ask him to correct the referencee, but Im afraid to do so because it took me so long to reply.  
My request would still be legal in Germany but I feel stupid that I procrastinated to request that earlier. I thought „dont wanna bother someone before christmas / before New years eve“  
and here we are....almost in february!

However, say a large company of 100,000 makes $1,000,000 extra randomly. My prediction is that the money will probably be spread evenly through the organization.

19co8xy,Need To Get Out Of Sales,"Hello all, figured I would try and see if anyone might have some insight or have went thru a similar path I am on. I have had sales jobs as long as I can remember, anything from retail to car sales to B2B tech distribution. Mainly ended up in these kinds of jobs out of necessity and the ability to make decent money without having a 4 year degree. I did go to college for an associates degree but did not want to continue with school and there were not any degrees that interested me.  
  
So here I am, about to be 35 and working as a regional pro sales rep for a flooring company. This company has been okay to work for but ultimately I could care less about flooring and it is the epitome of working a job to work a job. Perks are I get to work from home, benefits are solid, and its not like its hard work. I think a lot of what keeps me contently numb with this job is knowing that the remote job glory days are long gone and I wouldn't be able to find another job making $27 an hour fully remote with the type of jobs i'd be able to find/land.  
  
Cons are obvious in sales. Constant pressure and changing of expectations. This company also is not doing well at all and constantly having upper mgmt jumping ship and realigning people. At this point, the idea of getting out of sales and constantly chasing sales goals seems like it'd be a dream. Also, seems like it'd be smart to try and stay ahead of any impending layoffs/bad situations here.  
  
Anyone have any advice on maybe a solid path/field of work to consider coming from mostly sales/customer service type jobs? Should I go back to school and try to find something specialized that I might be into? I know 35 isn't ""old"" but i'd think most 35 year old's don't necessarily feel young and the idea of having to start over with things can always be daunting.

19cnsuk,Layoffs are coming,"My last job, I had for over 7 years. I wanted to grow in my career but there was not advancement in my department so I applied in other area. After applying in every department and having several interviews, I was always told that my work ethic was fantastic and I was very good in my role but I didn't have enough experience to move into the position I was applying for. This always frustrates me to hear as I felt I had built up enough of a reputation to show I have potential to grow into a role and push past expectations. I thought my prior roles in customer service, management, and department head would help show I am able to be utilized in a greater capacity. 

I sadly ended up leaving the company as I realized I would not be able to advance or gain additional experience by staying and have now been with this different company for about a year and a half. They made department changes shortly after I arrived. I was moved into a newly established department and then the person in charge of organizing that transition was fired. The role out was terrible and 5 months later, upper management is still cleaning up her mess.  

I've worked hard and have proven to be a reliable worker and have been thanked by my new manager so many times simply because I am getting done what needs to be done. All this to say, the word has gotten out that whole departments are being let go and are not being shuffled into open positions and several more managers are being let go. My department hasn't been hit yet but the writing is on the wall and I'm looking into other options.  

What can I do to show that I am worth an interview? I have a bachelor's degree , I've gotten a certification, and I'm working on another.

19cnhbk,Quitting my job to go on 5 week backpacking trip,"I (22) graduated college last May and have been working at the same position since graduation.

I have 1 yoe working two different internships and 1 yoe at this current full time role, all within the same field. I am scared to quit my job with nothing lined up to come back to, turnover rates are fast in my field and I do not think I could line something up to start that far out (including a 2 week notice).

19cng2v,Falsified Performance Evaluation,"I filed an internal harassment complaint against my department supervisor after months of trying to work around his behaviour. After that, I started receiving emails from the lead supervisor, alleging falsified poor performance. 

The lead supervisor learns of my performance through my department supervisor, and handles all evaluations. To date, I’ve been more of a high achiever, and am one of the leaders in my department. 

A few days later, I was attacked randomly at work by a regular third party contractor who became unstable, and had to file for medical accommodations. The contractor was found to be in violation of our violence policy, and was never heard from again. 

Despite my injury, I’ve only been late once. My family was incredibly supportive to ensure my performance at work was never affected, and I kept exceeding my quotas.  

A week later, I attended a formal milestone perfomance evaluation, and had to keep redirecting the subject to my performance. The lead supervisor kept changing the subject and it seemed to be on purpose. 

Two weeks after that, I was scheduled for another performance evaluation for the same milestone, except HR was going to attend. Confused, I asked the lead supervisor if this was an error. He stated that it’s his right to assess performance at any time.

I contacted my union, and they intervened - informing me that it was a Duty to Inquiry meeting because of my injury, and was never going to be a performance appraisal. I sent the union the activity log showing the name of the meeting was changed, but never received a response. 

The duty to inquire meeting was invasive, and resulted in no accommodations. In fact, changes were made to my job that were impossible to do with my injury. I received the document for my performance appraisal a few weeks prior, and it vaguely stated a number of poor performance issues with no particulars. I started receiving more frequent emails alleging poor performance until I was eventually placed on a disciplinary suspension for performance issues a few days later.

After grieving the mishandled disciplinary action, my leave was renamed to an administrative suspension, and I still wasn’t permitted to return to work. I started receiving vague emails from HR stating that my inquiries about the confusing process were being seen as a performance issue, and would be investigated upon my return. I also received the results from my harassment complaint, which stated that I was the one in violation. This will also be addressed upon my return. I was made to take a course to learn the effects harassment has on people.

My doctor, furious with the handling of my injury, placed me on medical leave because the situation caused a diagnosis of PTSD. My employer kept me on administrative leave despite my doctor’s recommendation.

I am due to return to work in two weeks, and I’m beside myself. The union says there’s nothing they can do to help unless I am terminated, but this doesn’t seem right. The grievance process for terminated employees is built to fail because the final decision is up to the employer. It cannot go to arbitration. No employee to date has been reinstated. 

What would you do in this situation? Is there anything I can say or do to amend the situation? It’s incredibly difficult to get hired in my field, and being terminated in this field would essentially blacklist me. Getting another position while I still need accommodations would also be very difficult.",Animya8887,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1705898480,2024-01-22 04:41:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19cng2v/falsified_performance_evaluation/,1,2024

Then I continued with a contract with the same company until I turned 18. I did some work for Universal Pictures and took part in an MTV production.

The company then got bought out a year after. It now exists under a big corporation. Around this time I also quit and cancelled my contract to focus on school and university applications.

Once I got into university, I continued to work freelance editing videos, marketing brands, movies, did voiceover work for some fashion luxury brands from 19 years old to now 24.

All in all, I have about 5 years of experience from when I was below 18 under a contract. 

Then I have 5 years of freelance work after I turned 18.

I am in kind of a dilemma right now. I am deeply passionate about personal growth, learning, and health. I have so many interests; it’s crazy. I am constantly overwhelmed and make things much harder than they need to be - overcomplicating. Below is a list of all the things I am interested in:

  
\-Writing a fiction book   
\-Writing a self-help book   
\-Pursuing a degree in psychology  
\-Starting a business of some type  
\-Becoming a nutritionist/dietician  
\-Becoming a life coach  
\-Starting a personal brand, pursuing content creation, launching an online community, starting a podcast, etc.

I am constantly consumed with limiting beliefs, and I don’t believe in my ability to make things happen. I have not had a job in 1 year and four months. I have no income and am currently losing hundreds of dollars a month. I am living off my savings. I don’t even have a car because I sold it. I am living in my parent's house, and they support me emotionally and financially. I feel stuck, and I don’t know what to do. I barely even have friends because I often isolate myself in my room. I am a happy person most of the time, but I just feel trapped. I feel like I am getting closer to figuring things out, but then I change directions for some reason. It’s a never-ending cycle of searching. I have spent months trying to find clarity, but I just can’t figure things out. I feel I am making things much harder than they need to be. As I mentioned earlier, I overcomplicate things a lot. This post is simply a call for help. If anyone can help me with my life, I would be the happiest person in the world.

19chxam,1st job making me question my existence and what work should be.,"
I’ve been working in my first full time position since February so I’m approaching my 1 year relatively shortly but I am not sure that I will make it. I work in a software support role for a small family owned company. I make 46k (less than all of my peers) and feel extremely overwhelmed/over worked in my current position. This job has been a ride since it’s started. I was hired with 2 other people who I got along with very well right off the bat. The first month was ok because I got along so well with my coworkers and the workload was light as I was being trained. Things quickly started to pick up however and I was consistently being thrown into situations I was not prepared for which created an overwhelming sense of anxiety and imposter syndrome because my position essentially required me to advise high level clients and resolve their issues when I was not at all trained on the things I am being asked to advise on. I felt totally uncomfortable for a long time. Although I’ve became much more familiarized with the software and my industry over this past year, I still feel like I am asked to do things above my pay grade and above my experience which puts myself in an uncomfortable situation and is a disservice to the client. One of the people I was hired with left the company about 4/5 months into it because they couldn’t handle it any longer. 

We started under one of the family members who own the company and she is unlike anyone I’ve came in contact with before. She’s rude/condescending to coworkers and clients, no matter how senior they might be which is a major red flag for myself. A few months ago she promoted someone else to be our manager who is someone who has never been in a management position before. He is awesome as a person but the lack of experience in a management position shows a lot of the time. So I’ve had to deal with her less, but she is still technically my boss and someone I have grown to seriously not enjoy working with. 

This is my first full time job and it took me FOREVER to land this after countless applications and interviews at other companies which is why I initially ignored the red flags that I noticed early on. I get along well with my coworkers also which has kept me there but I’m honestly just dealing with a dilemma.

Most days I dread the thought of what is going to happen next or contemplate faking sick and calling out. We are desperate for more help but our CEO told us that there are no plans to hire anyone new in the near future. I am drowning in work and grossly underpaid for what I am asked to do on the day to day. 

A lot of my friends have got their first full time jobs at the same time as me and I feel like I’ve had a totally different experience than most of them for the past year. I am swamped with work that it is extremely common that most day I don’t have time to check my phone for a minute to see if anyone is trying to reach me. There was an occasion earlier this year where there was an accident I was effected by that I didn’t hear about until after work hours where I noticed dozens of missed calls and texts that I didn’t see because I was being drowned in other people’s issues. 

Basically, I don’t know if what I have experienced is normal or not and I don’t know what to do mainly because I am scared about the future. I don’t know if I am being dramatic with the workload (bc others don’t seem to hate the job as I HATE the job) because this is my first full time position and I don’t know if I am going to realize later on that I actually had it pretty good here. I don’t think I’m being over dramatic considering everyone on my team has expressed to our manager that we feel overwhelmed, my coworker had quit a few months back due to my same concerns, and it has reached a point where I resent work everyday.

I am hesitant to quit because of the following reasons:

- I get along great with my coworkers.
- I am in a position for growth.
- It took me forever to land a job, and I don’t want to be left unemployed for the next few months.
- I get to work remotely 2 days a week (basically whenever I want if I have a good excuse)
- The office is a great commute

I want to leave the position:

- Extremely overworked 
- Underpaid (compared to others in my position)
- Cannot tolerate specific manager.
- No time to think about myself during my days. Always worried about other people’s problems and deadlines.
- Feel like I am creating enemies in the industry by failing to fulfill on promises due to the “sabotage” nature of the job which restricts me from reaching my self set goals and essentially doing my job.
- I feel like I am working extremely hard, but still receiving negative results (negative client reviews due to not being able to fulfill promises made because of the overwhelming workload)

Essentially, I am starting to feel like I try really hard to get things done, and then tell my clients I will work on something for them (when I really mean it) but I am physically unable to due to having too many tasks to do and wearing too many hats. I feel like it could eventually hurt my professional reputation. I’m having a hard time deciding if I should tough it out, or take on the risk of finding a new job that might not suit me any better than this one. And that could take months. I am at a loss. Does anyone have any advice off of past experiences of similar situations/feelings towards a job?

19chnpd,Seeking advice for comments about my age.,"Crossposting on various subreddits because I’m looking for next steps from here. I'm seeking guidance regarding a recent performance review. I'm in my early twenties and have been facing challenges at my workplace due to perceptions about my age.

During the review, my boss surprisingly underestimated my years of experience, stating I have five fewer years than I actually do. This contradicts earlier conversations where he compared my career trajectory to someone in their thirties. Despite exceeding expectations and expanding my role significantly, he mentioned that I'm not ready for a specific position title due to my age (which meets my current job description in full), though he believes I'll reach it faster than most.

I enjoy the casual company culture and genuinely love my work and environment. Regarding compensation, I received a raise and negotiated better benefits, which I truly appreciate. However, I was slightly disappointed with the salary increase and had hoped for a bonus, especially considering my significant contribution to the company's growth (+400% as per yearly metrics). My previous issue of being underpaid has been addressed to an extent, but the overall situation leaves me feeling somewhat disheartened. I’m genuinely feeling as though I’ve been somewhat delusional in what I felt was impressive career growth.

I am looking for advice on how to better communicate my experience and ensure that it is appropriately recognized in the future. I'm also curious about strategies to navigate this situation where my age seems to overshadow my professional achievements. Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.

19cglr8,I gotta get paid,"I’ve been working at my company since March 2022. I started out as an entry level project manager at an ad agency in DC with a $50k salary, which is obviously not great. Part of this is my fault because I didn’t negotiate hard enough, but I really wanted the job and figured there was a lot of opportunity for growth. I have really enjoyed my time here and have been thriving.

However I eventually found out that I was being payed significantly less than my peers and counterparts in other departments. I received a promotion to a mid level PM  and an 18% raise in June of 2023, but even with the salary increase I was still being significantly underpaid compared to my coworkers. I had a very transparent convo with the head of my department a few months back and he said that my salary is lower because I had no experience in the industry prior to being hired. He assured me that they were going to do everything they could to promote me again as soon as possible (company went through a round of mass layoffs over the summer so no one got promoted at the Tim) but he didn’t make any guarantees

Don’t get me wrong - i realize an 18% raise is significant and I’m very grateful, but I’ve been taking on the workload of a senior level project manager for over a year now and the only thing I’ve received from the company is verbal acknowledgment. 

We have performance reviews coming up and I’m determined to make a strong case for myself. I’ve gone through the senior project manager job description and can confidently speak to how I’ve been carrying out every single one of those responsibilities on a regular basis. I have saved emails from internal folks and CLIENTS commending my professionalism and organizations skills. At this point if I don’t get AT LEAST a $15k raise soon I am going to have no choice but to leave the company, which I don’t want to do. I love the people I work with, I have a lot of autonomy and the environment is really laid back, especially for an ad agency, but I gotta pay my bills! Based on what I’ve heard other people in mid-senior level positions make, $15k is how much I feel I’m being undervalued. 

That being said, I really think I’m at an advantage here. I’ve heard my department head say how they can’t afford to lose me, but I’m looking for advice on the best way to do go about this. I have no shame about taking advantage of this company since they’ve essentially been taking advantage of me for almost 2 years at this point. I’m wondering if I should start actively applying for other jobs and try to leverage another offer to squeeze as much money out of them as I can?

19cfrlu,My Experience at a Mandatory Team Building Event - Thoughts?,"Hey,

I wanted to give you all an update on my previous post about being forced to attend a meet-up event with the VP of sales. After reading your comments, I realized that sometimes we have to attend these team building events to avoid burning any bridges.

So, before heading to the hotel, I received an email on Friday night stating that the event would be a brainstorming session lasting 5 hours (3pm - 8pm) with no pay or extra leave. Not surprising, right?

I arrived at the venue around 3:30 pm, even though management had messaged us to be there before 3 pm. I knew nobody would reach on time, so I wasn't too worried. The room was of medium size with tables, some toffees (which I enjoyed), and notepads.

Before the ""great"" (sarcasm intended) speech began, we had some snacks and coffee. The VP of sales started by emphasizing that we should see the company as a family and think of ourselves as owners rather than just employees. He encouraged us to interact with other departments, blah blah.

His main point was that when we receive calls from customers seeking support (around 15-20 calls), we should ask some basic questions about their computer's security and try to generate leads for local IT support. For every lead we forward to sales, we would receive a reward of approximately $60. If the customer ends up purchasing the support, we get an additional $96. So, potentially, we could earn an extra $156 for successful conversions.

He also mentioned that each customer ticket costs the company $5 and advised us not to waste time with price-sensitive customers. He used the phrase ""if you throw peanuts, it would attract monkeys"" and suggested that we try to lure them in by emphasizing the importance of data security. Now, even before attending the event, I knew that a salesman's ideas would never benefit an IT person.

The only two things I agreed with the VP on were the importance of continuous learning in the IT field and the need for commitment and capability. Although he mentioned it was for the company's benefit, I believe it's crucial for our own personal development as well.

Honestly, the potential to earn an extra $156 is tempting, but aside from the financial aspect, I don't think it's beneficial for me. Once the company acquires enough local IT clients through these leads, they'll likely forward them to us for support, which means more work for us in the future.

I wanted to hear your thoughts on this. Am I being an idiot for not generating leads, or do you agree with my concerns? Let's discuss!

TL;DR: Attended a mandatory team building event where the VP of sales encouraged us to generate leads for local IT support, promising potential earnings of $156 per successful conversion. However, I'm skeptical about the long-term benefits and would love to hear your opinions.",Bannedazz,1,1.0,2,1705876092,2024-01-21 22:28:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19cfrlu/my_experience_at_a_mandatory_team_building_event/,1,2024

19cek40,29 F in the semiconductor industry looking for advice,"I'm 29 years old with a fairly established career in the semiconductor industry. I've been in the industry for 8 years now and have worked my way up to top process technician in my department. I'm happy with my salary and I'm happy with the work that I do although it can be a little stagnant sometimes. I started working at my first company when I turned 21 and I only had a high school diploma. However, my work ethic really helped me climb up the ladder. I ended up moving away from my family and working at another company a few states away and work my way all the way up to the top tier. I'm happy where I'm at and a lot of the managers at my job are also happy with the work that I put out. So much so, that they push me to join management or engineering. Going down either one of those paths, I would end up being salary and actually taking a pay cut. I'm not really interested in taking a pay cut but part of me wonders if they will kind of force me into one of those roles. Which leads me to my question for advice, I was going to go back to school to get some sort of degree. But I'm completely stuck on what I want to do as far as a degree. If I need to switch companies again I don't want to start the client over since I have no schooling to back me up. I do have my work history, I do have achievements that I can present. But I'm wondering if it makes sense for me to go to school and start fresh - I don't even have an associates degree. Or if there's any sort of certificates I can obtain to keep my resume competitive. If I go to to school and start over, I'm not really sure what my studies should be. Also, I'm based in Northern Virginia so there's ample high paying jobs - just not sure they I qualify for any high salaries outside of my current industry.

19ce0ep,How do I ask for a raise? Do I deserve it?,"So I've been at my current job at a multi-state architectural firm for 2.5 years now and yet to receive any sort of raise or even be considered for a promotion.

The only bonus I receive is the annual Christmas/new year bonus of $1,500 after taxes and benefits. I am also on the lower range of my positions pay scale.

The end of my first year I was put on a 90 day performance improvement plan when I was logging overtime hours for working more than 40hrs a week when the project needed as well as working remote while I was on vacation (due to deadlines). Even though I coordinated and completed my tasks regularly and worked overnight (11.5hr time difference during vacation) I was told my performance was subpar and tasks were not completed on time. So my first year review was 50/50.

2nd year review was positive (exceeds expectations) from my main supervisor and project manager, but had only a decent review (meets expectations) from another project manager, who had an archaic method of management and was not as welcoming of newer methodologies. 

Due to recent downturn in projects in my region, I have been helping out another city studio (same company) who manage projects horribly and provide subpar documents. I have successfully raised their standards and have received positive reviews from their team.

My firm, especially my region, has had significant turnovers (people leaving for better opportunities, layoffs, etc) and along with my first year 90 day ""probation"" has made me hesitant to bring up the topic of a raise or promotion, even though others have received promotions and raises during our last annual reviews.

I do go above and beyond, work during weekends and longer hours, but still don't log overtime to prevent another performance improvement issue. So I am trying to limit my actual work to the scheduled 40hrs only.

I also had some medical issues to contend with in my personal life, for which I tried to have my firm allow me to work fully remote, but was denied due to ""company policy,"" while others have been moving to other towns and cities and being allowed to work fully remote. My supervisor has been understanding, so I end up working longer days to be able to manage the health issues, doctor visits, and almost 1.5hrs of total travel.

With all that is happening, I don't fell like I am being appreciated by my job, but want to continue to learn, improve, and be a team player.

So how do I ask for a raise for being with the firm for 2.5years? Do I deserve it? Or should I look for a new job?",EntropicAnarchy,2,0.6700000166893005,9,1705871739,2024-01-21 21:15:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19ce0ep/how_do_i_ask_for_a_raise_do_i_deserve_it/,1,2024
19cdpmj,Should I tell my boss I'm thinking of leaving?,"I'm in New Zealand, employed full-time, been with the company for a year and a half today, with a requirement to hand in 4 weeks notice if I'm leaving. 

One major mistake I made was telling my boss, whom I genuinely thought I could trust, that I'm having second thoughts about my career and wanting to pursue something else as I don't see myself in my current profession. She was supportive at first, even offered to help me with finding things to develop my skills for the next job, but recently she's been distant and hasn't been handing me any new work (it's actually been a while now that I think about it). I did bring up the new things I want to try or be involved in but haven't seen progress. I see it as she likes control over her work, so she does them herself.  

I'm actively looking for jobs and there's this one job that I want to apply for but it's in the same industry as my current company. There's a high chance they will ask at least one of the managers at my current workplace about me. So I was thinking if it was better to let my boss know before she hears it from someone else? Could also be helpful when I ask for referees, when I get to the reference check stage of my application elsewhere?

19cdcux,Feeling undervalued at work,"Hi everyone, I'm seeking guidance regarding a recent performance review. I'm in my early twenties and have been facing challenges at my workplace due to perceptions about my age.

During the review, my boss surprisingly underestimated my years of experience, stating I have five fewer years than I actually do. This contradicts earlier conversations where he compared my career trajectory to someone in their thirties. Despite exceeding expectations and expanding my role significantly, he mentioned that I'm not ready for a specific position title due to my age (which meets my current job description in full), though he believes I'll reach it faster than most.

I enjoy the casual company culture and genuinely love my work and environment. Regarding compensation, I received a raise and negotiated better benefits, which I truly appreciate. However, I was slightly disappointed with the salary increase and had hoped for a bonus, especially considering my significant contribution to the company's growth (+400% as per yearly metrics). My previous issue of being underpaid has been addressed to an extent, but the overall situation leaves me feeling somewhat disheartened. I’m genuinely feeling as though I’ve been somewhat delusional in what I felt was impressive career growth.

I am looking for advice on how to better communicate my experience and ensure that it is appropriately recognized in the future. I'm also curious about strategies to navigate this situation where my age seems to overshadow my professional achievements. Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.

Due to questionable life choices, I'm getting started a little late in the game for school(24) but I think I've decided on urban planning and I was hoping you all could give me a look into a day in the life of an urban planner. My goal is to finish undergrad and apply for law school, but from what I've seen a lot of the undergrad degrees law school applicants tend to gravitate towards either don't interest me or wont pay enough to support me comfortably.  
  
Then I discovered urban planning, while it's not a traditional pre-law degree from my understanding, I feel like it would offer decent overlap with my interest in law and it still accomplishes my goal of bettering my community. Arguably just as important, it pays nice. It seems like it could also provide a decent foundation for zoning laws, tenant and housing regulations, and possibly even some environmental law.  
  
I have three questions I was hoping some of you could provide your perspective on - what does a day in the life of an urban planner look like, how do you feel about it(Is it fun, fulfilling, does it itch your problem solving spot), and does my assessment of urban planning and its relationship to law seem accurate?

I am a 29 year old male and I have worked at large bank for over 6 years now (probably 4-5 years too long but here we are.) Originally as a business analyst but really doing anything data (MS Access, Excel, SQL) related for the team I supported. Then I moved to another team and became a “Data Analyst”, but it was more or less the same, just using Alteryx for ETL and Domo for dashboarding, but we barely make dashboards. I’ve been remote since COVID and while being remote has great advantages, it gave me even less reasons to feel apart of the team/company. I never really liked the job anyway, whether it was banking and operations or the day to day. Banking is both boring and complex that it took all effort to do the job. This will be my last week there as I’ve been laid off. Part of me is feeling relief, but now I am going to be jobless which is obviously scary as hell. I just moved out of my parents house and moved across the US to a higher cost of living area living alone and while it was always the plan to find a new job after I moved, the timing couldn't have been much worse.  
The job search is a struggle, but I also dont feel any passion or care to really get something that my current skill/background aligns with. I realized that I want to get into marketing, (digital marketing, marketing analytics, marketing operations, etc) but I am wondering how to do that now. What to focus on? How to build experience quickly? I have some time, my severance ends mid March but hoping well beforehand I can jump into something marketing related, preferably a smaller team/company too.

I’ve also came to terms that I’m a career generalist and not specialist and I’m interested in exploring that within the healthcare sector as I build my own business. 

I guess my questions are 1) how can I start this job and be an exemplary employee. Even if I don’t stay within the company, having a letter of recommendation from them will look good to future employers and 2) what are some career options that allow me to explore health & business strategy?",Interesting-Hunt8639,1,0.25,1,1705859333,2024-01-21 17:48:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19c91ic/my_first_big_girl_job_questions_within_questions/,1,2024
19c8j5f,I regret studying and pursuing a career in Law – how do I go about making a career switch?,"For context, I’m European. I didn’t go to undergrad for four years and law school afterwards the way it is done in North America; I went straight into a Bachelor of Laws degree and graduated this summer. My true passion has always been for film and TV, but I didn’t get into any film schools after I graduated high school and essentially compromised by picking a “safe” degree where I knew I would find a job and be good at the work but likely wouldn’t feel fulfilled in my career.

I regretted that choice pretty soon after starting law school but stupidly thought it was too late to turn back and finished the degree. In an attempt to get back on the path of sort of ending up in the industries I actually want to work in, I specialized in entertainment/IP law.

I currently work in the music industry because it’s the only entertainment-related job that was advertised in the country I live in and required a legal background. I don’t see myself staying in my current job long-term because I am not as passionate about music and don’t enjoy the legal work. On top of that, my salary is quite low because to make a decent wage or get a good position as a lawyer/legal professional in Europe, most companies require a Master of Laws degree, which I don’t have.

As a result, I’m not really left with another choice but to either:

(a)	do a Master of Laws degree; or
(b)	start over in another Bachelor program that would suit my interests more; or
(c)	wait for job openings in the film/TV industry that require my legal background.

None of these seem very appealing to me as I would be digging myself even further into a hole with option A, I don’t have the patience or money for option B (I’m 24) and option C seems like I would be kicking the can down the road indefinitely.

Doing a Master degree in something film-related also isn’t a possibility, as European universities pretty much always require a background in the same subject (except private universities, which I can’t afford).

In the end, I really don’t know what to do except to try and network in the local film community more in the hopes of making some useful connections.

What does this sub think? Perhaps there is someone here who was in a similar position? I’d appreciate whatever advice or perspective anyone can offer.",iambecomemarty,2,1.0,0,1705858057,2024-01-21 17:27:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19c8j5f/i_regret_studying_and_pursuing_a_career_in_law/,1,2024
19c8ely,Back to Teaching Band at a Dream Job or Continue Computer Science?,"My entire life I've basically been interested in two things: Music and Tech/Video Games

**Music**

I was deeply involved and in love with the band world for 12 years of my life.  Was mostly focused on jazz and arranging/composing music.  Got my music ed degree, graduated with honors, and did my student internship in one of the best high school programs in my region.  Despite being in student leadership, and first chair in every top band, by the time I was done with college I was sick of marching band and concert band, and only really cared about jazz band.

First job out college was awful.  Extremely micromanaging principal that respected no boundaries, and was known to all the teachers to get his way no matter what.  If it gives you any idea, he non-sexually pinched my butt (I'm a guy), in a funny haha kind of way, at the end of the year band banquet with parents and students present.  I have never once indicated, inside or outside of school, that I was anywhere near friends with this man on this level.

I only taught 2 periods of band, and then forced to teach 4 periods of computer science because there was nobody else to do it.  There was no jazz band, only HS concert band and then MS beginning band.  The kids were nice though, and that was the redeeming quality of this job. 

Not to mention, the weird unspoken social pressure that is put on a small town band director is awful.  Everybody suddenly has an opinion on things that they are in no way qualified to have an opinion on.  It's like I had to a circus dance to appeal to the politics of the job, and my performance wasn't actually judged by the quality of the band. On top of all of this, I had to put in anywhere from 10-20 extra hours a week for marching band, even giving up Saturdays.

My undiagnosed also ADHD came to a head, and I was at the worst mental state I had been in to that date.  Began dissociating, and getting to a point to where I would come home, lay on the couch, and stare at the wall until \~10 when I went to sleep.  Felt like I was watching my life happen while I was trapped inside my head.  I genuinely felt like I was one bad day away from the psych ward.

I went to a psychiatrist, started getting treated for ADHD, and things started to get better mentally.  When I came up from what felt like drowning, I wanted out.

By this point, I came to the conclusion that if I was actually qualified to teach the computer science class I was being forced to teach, I would **1.** Make 2 to 3 times as much as a teacher, and **2.** Be working *significantly* less hours.  So on the very last day of school, when we were let out, I immediately drove to the school board and handed my resignation letter to the superintendent, and blocked all communication from the administration from my school.  I leveraged my teaching skills to get a basic software training and support role making the same as I did before. 

**Computer Science**

Growing up, along side band and music, I pretty much exclusively played video games and toyed around with tech, building my own computer, etc.  I was the defacto IT Helpdesk guy for my friends and family.  It didn't really go beyond that, but it was something that I also genuinely loved.

When I got the new help desk role, I was amazed at how much free time I had, and used it to start seriously teaching myself software development and computer science fundamentals.  I began automating support tasks at my job, and got noticed by the head software architect.  He started letting me fix bugs for our software, and then put me on a project to work on the new company website alongside a new CS grad.  I did 75% of the work, ahead of schedule, better than the CS grad, and was promoted to a junior developer because of it.  I've since done another project independently a full month ahead of schedule, and gotten a 10k raise.  I've now been talking to recruiters quoting me salaries 20-30k higher than my current one.

I also decided to reteach myself all of HS math via free resources in order to begin taking online college courses to finish out a CS degree.  Made a 100% on the math placement and am now currently taking Calc 1 and some intro programming classes.  I genuinely love and enjoy it, and my current plan, if I stick with CS, is to get the degree, and move into embedded software in the government sector, or game engine development so that I can use all of the sick math that I'm learning.

This entire time, I started going to therapy alongside being medicated, and my mental health has gotten so much better.  Immediately after starting ADHD meds, I gained a lot of weight, but have now been able to develop a stronger willpower and executive function.  After that, I've lost 40 pounds, began exercising, and cut out all sugary drinks.

In general, it's not perfect, but I feel better about myself, I feel better about my future, and I feel more fulfilled.  It feels like beforehand, life was a force acting upon me, and I was reacting to it.  Now, it feels like I am a force acting upon my life.

**The Dilemma**

The answer seems so cut and dry, but recently, after doing some contract work for a friend, an assistant band director, to write music for his high school pep band, I've been aggressively offered what seems to be the *dream job,* if I wanted to ever go back into teaching music.  Like, this is the kind of job people get, keep for 30 years, and retire from in the band world.  I would essentially be the director of *only* jazz bands, at one of the most well funded schools in the state, with some of the best high school musicians in the state.  I would have only 3 periods, all teaching jazz, with 4 planning periods to eat lunch, handle organizational duties, etc.  I would get to run the whole program, run a invitational jazz festival, plan community gigs, and even have the funding to write and record albums in house.  Also, no micromanaging from the principal aside from them showing up to the concerts and saying ""That sounds real nice Mr. jockitch42.""

This isn't all talk either, I went to their basketball game after work recently to hear the music I wrote, and the head director confronted me with one of the school board members, having me chat with him, and saying how they were gonna get me on as the jazz director.  They even went so far as to say that they would also have my wife (who is a 3rd grade teacher) a job.

The downside is that I would technically need to be at the marching band practices and games, to supervise, but not be in charge.  This would add that 10-20 hours a week of work in the Fall.  I would get a hefty stipend for it, though.  It's just that in the band world, nobody ever really leaves work at work.  It's like you have to be 100% band 100% of the time, and it makes it hard to do anything else.

All in all, if you count the total pay bump for me *and* my wife, this would amount to about 30-35k more in household income that current.  However, it's very unlikely as a teacher that I would ever see an individual salary of 100k, even at the 30 year mark.  Staying in computer science, it's likely that I could see compensation in the range of 250k for the jobs I'm aiming to get.  Money wise, it feels like the band job would be a short term gain, and staying in CS would end up being a long term win.

By default, I lean towards the computer science route, because I still have the space in my life to write, arrange, and perform music doing CS work.  I don't know how practical the reverse would be, however.  

Sorry for the ginormous post.  Thanks for anybody reading this far.",jockitch42,1,1.0,0,1705857728,2024-01-21 17:22:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19c8ely/back_to_teaching_band_at_a_dream_job_or_continue/,1,2024

19c70uz,Need advice on choosing study pathway,"



Hello everyone, I am really in need of advices from this community so please help me out.
I have few options at the moment that I can go with in order to pursue my career.
Option 1: Do ACCA and once I clear F7,8,9 modules, I'll submit the thesis in order to get the degree from OBU. This way I can get a degree along with a well-renowned certification. But going with this route it will cut me off socially as I won't be having any university life but on ther hand as ACCA provides flexibility, I may be able to do some part time work to get some financial help, although I don't need any but just so that I can earn some extra money. 
Option 2: Do a degree in accounting and finance from UoL from a recognised teaching centre and once I graduate then I can go for ACCA. I may be able to get some exemptions by then it would be really time consuming as first it would take me 3 years to graduate and then it depends on how much time I could clear acca exams but after that again 3 years for practical experience to gain ACCA membership. 
Option 3: Do ACCA along with the university I want to go in, it may save some time but would be really for me to manage and could've a negative impact either on ACCA and my GPA. 
Please lmk which option seems to be the wisest even if not easy. Also, consider the future prospects while giving me an advice.

I knew I wanted to pursue psychology in 10th grade and went for humanities with psychology in 11th and 12th grade. I scored 93% in 12th case board exam. I got into CHRIST university in Bengaluru. I am a kathak dancer and poet. I opted for a triple major course in christ. It was Performing arts, English and Psychology. I scored 7.87 CGPA. The final year posed a question of choosing a masters degree. I knew I wanted to do psychology but in my time at undergrad I realised I don't want to be a traditional fherapist and was very intrigued by Organizational Psychology. My professors also encouraged it. I also achieved the feat of becoming a published author at 20 during this time. So naturally, I wanted to explore outside of India. I tried to convince my parents but failed as they cited financial reasons. By this time, I missed CHRIST admission for their MSc Psychology-HRDM. It's a relatively new course and I hated I wasn't there. Now, I had to pivot and look into other colleges. It striked me that if I want to get into HRM. I can go for a business degree as well. So began my competitive exam journey, I had to face my worst fear and skill. Well, in math I've no skill. I joined TIME coaching near my place and learned that they don't teach you maths basically. During this time my parents enrolled me in my other worst nightmare called AMITY UNIVERSITY for organisational psychology masters degree as a safety net. I went over YouTube videos and such to first build a base in maths. I still haven't gotten far in terms of skills. I couldn't give cat due to a leg injury and was bedridden. I gave nmat and got a score of 198. Colleges like IFCAI, GIBS, etc approached me. My parents who have always seen me shine and outshine said I don't deserve to go to a mid or say tier 2 college. And I should work harder. But by then I had lost all my confidence. I did study and gave xat. I failed again and scored 51 percentile. I haven't told my parents and I feel stupid and dumb. I am not dumb but here I am I guess. I'm at a loss of things to do now. I'm applying for the MAT exam but I've no hope. I will also give CUET for TISS. I need to know if I have any chance whatsoever. I tried really hard to ace math. I need help to understand my options further if there are any and/or things that could help me in math.

19c3xz1,idk what to do with my life (22yo),"I live in Germany and finished college (I do not have A levels I have something close which is called ""Fachhochschulreife""). I had to do one year as a volunteer to get my college certificate. Now idk what to do with my life, my grades were bad and only universities of applied science (I believe it was those) can even take me in because I didn't finish college. I started studying on the university IU first psychology then social work then game design all of those didn't suit what I imagined it to be not to mention just trying to get all that stuff in my head makes me extremely suicidal. I first blamed it on the university but I know myself that I'm the problem. As of right now I try teaching myself through youtube videos and codedex how coding works since I liked it in school already, but my dad is pressuring me to study or find a job/ apprenticeship now, which is understandable but I don't feel I'm doing well enough mentally to work or study, even just writing this right now makes me feel like shit. I feel like a loser not being able to do any of this without feeling suicidal. I already tried committing suicide when I still went to school/college a bunch of times and I can't tell my parents I'm not doing well mentally either since they both don't ""believe"" in mental health, my mom even told me everything would be easier if I would just kill myself. I absolutely hate living but I really wanna try to get to a point where life is fun I just don't know how.
I think working as a coder preferably html, css would be a good start but if I start in an apprenticeship I'm stuck with my parents for 2-3 years longer and I don't wanna stay in touch with them.

19c3gz5,Im 33 and looking to maybe switch my career.,"Seriously considering switching careers. I’m currently working for government in a data analyst role and to be honest I think I need a change. I don’t know if the job is right for me, I feel under qualified and boss doesn’t like me and co workers are not really my kind of people. I was talking to old timers at the job and they pretty much said it’s impossible for them to retire. A lot of them when they actually do retire go work for contractors in their older age and are miserable. I was told pretty much told what to expect is a retirement that pays 30% of your salary. If you work a few extra years you may get a few extra percentage points, but that’s it.  I really want to retire one day and I think I found a career that I can do. I was searching jobs and came across a local county corrections officer job that offers an up to 85% salary for retirement after 30 years or 72.5% after 25 years of service. It takes 6 years to reach top pay, but even at the lowest rank top pay is over 100k and overtime is unlimited. I know corrections will be tough. I use to be in the field when I was fresh out of college, but I think it is a way to actually be able to retire and live a decent life after retirement.

19c1x0g,Unpaid internship which should have been paid - am I being unreasonable?,"I graduated last year in July 2023 and since then I haven’t had a job or any form of experience.

If a mod reads this post please don’t take it down as it is serious.

I applied to a job back in December and the description stated it’s a paid internship.

Upon arriving for the interview, it was very casual but the hiring manager mentioned I have to work unpaid for a month! Because their investor isn’t releasing their money until they launch their campaign.

Essentially yesterday, Saturday, I emailed the manager and explained how I would love to work for them. Considering their financial constraints, I just want one months worth of travel and food expense covered which would be £200-300 for the month.

The hiring manager emailed me back stating everything they wanted done for Monday which is tomorrow at 1:40am on Sunday. 

So I have a whole day to get whatever they want done by today without highlight my offer of travel and food costs.

Essentially, I don’t want to work unpaid 10-6pm. That to for two weeks for them to hire someone else and pay them for the work I should have been paid for.

I can work 2 weeks unpaid, but 4 weeks is a stretch.

The photographers and models are getting paid then I am not sure why I can’t be paid? 

Could someone help me with this? 

I know a lot of you will say I shouldn’t do it, however I would still like to add something professional to my cv.

I believe I have set something that is okay for both parties but she isn’t acknowledging it.

I do also want to add that the hiring manager literally doesn’t need me. The file she emailed me, it’s practically 90% done by her.

I didn’t sign a contract and didn’t confirm that I will work unpaid. Hence, the email.
The hiring manager even said that if I want to paid, she can do it, as she urgently needs someone to fill the role.",QueensGambit90,4,0.8299999833106995,4,1705838359,2024-01-21 11:59:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19c1x0g/unpaid_internship_which_should_have_been_paid_am/,1,2024

My team is made up of 3 people and one of them just left for a month and I will be taking most of his work. We have a massive project that is several months behind the due date that will definitely be delayed for longer. This project is basically being left into my hands to do all of the work on. I did not receive proper training and I am struggling to do basic tasks every day. Simple things like an email that should take 5 minutes takes me 30 minutes to send. I have asked my manager for assistance and he said “it’s gonna be really busy with our other coworker gone so we are not gonna have as much time to meet.” 

Every morning I wake up an hour or two before I need to get up with crippling anxiety. I just sit in bed worrying away. I feel that this job was not an entry level position or they are expecting too much out of me.

19bzqx4,Help Me Make A Choice,"Recently I was offered a job for a management position at retail store. I currently work as a Team Member for a different retail store and I love the position. Essentially I had applied months ago to the management job (before I started at my current job) and finally got a call back and offered the position. They sent me an offer letter and were pretty adamant about me signing it immediately so I did. However, as I have a few weeks left before I’m supposed to start the management position at the new job I’ve really been weighing my options. I LOVE working at my current job and the people I work with, but I don’t see myself being able to really move up much. The pay difference isn’t substantial, but after 6 months and all my training at a the management position I’ll be eligible to be promoted again and at that point the pay would be a significant difference. So I’m wondering, do I take the management position with potential to move up, but risk not enjoying my job or the people, or do I stay somewhere I already really enjoy, and not take the risk? And if the choice is to back out of the management job, how do I go about backing out after taking a drug test and signing the offer letter?",Kindly_Ad_5854,1,1.0,1,1705829514,2024-01-21 09:31:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19bzqx4/help_me_make_a_choice/,1,2024
19bz9ax,Lost out on a promotion. What to do now?,"So. This is going to be a fairly lengthy explanation and I apologize for any “ranty” aspects. I’m just truly feeling lost right now and could use some true advice. 

I’ve been at my current job now as a makeup artist since summer of 2023. It’s a position I’ve honestly always wanted with a company I previously respected. I’ve trained for it, both outside of work recreationally and at past jobs, and felt very confident when starting. About 3 months into the job, my counter manager/ direct supervisor ended up leaving the company. Considering my qualifications, praise from other managers, and work ethic I put myself forward for her position.. and things started to go gradually downhill. 

For further context, I’m in my early 20’s. And for anyone familiar with the cosmetics industry… that isn’t always an advantage, especially when the majority of management is older. I had a meeting with the GM, who said verbatim when I asked about why they had been reluctant to take steps to place me into the role, “your age is a concern.” This obviously got to me though didn’t dissuade me from working my hardest. After this point, I had a myriad of health issues flare up, likely tied to the severe anxiety I was experiencing. I’m a chronically ill person and have been since birth. It did start to affect my attendance to a serious degree, I will admit. Though all of these issues were documented by medical professionals and I communicated to the full extent I could. This would later be thrown in my face, as if the previous statement had never been made. 

I continued to push through several obstacles all while doing the work of 3+ people. I maintained sales goals, built a solid client base, and dealt with all of the Black Friday and Christmas craziness all on my own. My managers strung me along for MONTHS and would never give me a solid answer as to why I wasn’t being promoted. I DID the job with none of the recognition. Again, keep in mind this has been happening since early fall of 2023.

Cut to Friday, when I was informed the manager position had been filled entirely without any communication or notice to me. I can’t really even express in words what getting that news felt like. Call me dramatic if you will, but I was incredibly disparaged at that point and ready to walk out. Being a logical person I obviously didn’t but going forward I don’t know what to do, which is where the actual request for ADVICE comes in to play here… 

Should I stay at this job? Look for another? Do both at the same time? 

I have an opportunity to work for my family business, at a livable wage. It’s not cosmetics related but I would feel comfortable in the role, though the idea of working for my parents isn’t appealing. To sound stereotypical, my childhood was not enjoyable and I’ve gone out of my way to distance myself from them in adulthood. Giving them this kind of control, by working for them, feelings like I’m losing a part of my independence. And pride maybe too. Though returning to a workplace that cast me aside isn’t appealing either. 

I suppose I’m experiencing typical burnout, makes sense since I just turned 25. I had big dreams at one point, life just honestly got kind of sad and I lost faith in them. I’m in a monotonous pattern and feel like any choice I have isn’t a good one… so, I would love an outside opinion.

19bysnc,Need help with a career path,"I have funding of around $8000 for school and ideally looking for something that will take a year to complete. Both are lightly flexible

A brief summary of my life/situation:
I am in my early 30s, unfortunately was born into a dysfunctional home. Dad had mental health/anger issues which made my childhood a bit rough as my parents would constantly fight. I spent my early to late teens addicted to the computer and playing counter-strike, neglected school, and for some reason had the feeling I had time to figure it out but never acted on it - then life swept me away for a ride. I didn’t graduate even though I was well able to if put in the effort but my mom died when I was 19 which led me to jump into various jobs throughout my twenties specifically warehousing and courier work instead of finishing school. I could have made the effort to move up to leadership roles as my employers always had high praise for my work ethic and ability to learn quickly but always felt like it wouldn’t be enough money along with the feeling that I don’t belong there. My 20s is a blur of living paycheque to paycheque, partying on weekends with friends that weren’t the greatest influence, having no direction and then drugs introduced itself to my life in my late 20s. I wasn’t a daily user but would go on binges; tell myself that was the last time then start a self improvement grind but eventually fall back again and go into depression. I struggled with mental health issues until early last year from the drug use. I’ve always been big on self improvement and made plenty attempts in my 20s to do better but failed - I feel like it was a combination of lack of support, trauma, ADHD symptoms, my brain being wired to seek pleasure/escape and that eventually led me to hitting rock bottom when the drugs got mixed in later in life. I decided it’s either change or die and started creating momentum by abstaining from use and adopting positive habits, found myself seeking therapy to get back on my feet early last year and am stoked to say that I’ll be a year clean next month. I got into meditation during my recovery which has helped a lot along with exercising regularly and eating well/taking supplements. My brain is healing gradually and I’m being blessed with more energy everyday which has me ready now to buckle down for a grind towards a more stable future. Also, I got diagnosed with ADHD recently and got prescribed Vyvanse which I plan to use sparingly along the journey.

My thoughts on my personality traits/strengths:
I feel like I have high emotional intelligence because of the struggles endured, have had plenty of phases of change and growth in my life. 
I have good communication skills, am a strong listener and genuinely interested in people.
I would enjoy a job where I can socialize with people because I can be pretty talkative.
I feel like I could excel in sales despite my work background if I got my foot in the door and started growing/learning.
I am also good with computers and am able to spend long hours on a specific task.
My ideal future would be building a business overtime preferably in the online space but first I would need to earn the capital in order to do that. I have a burning desire to make a lot of money in the future because I’ve lived most of my life in financial distress and want to achieve a certain level of freedom. 
I feel like I have an “eye” for things that will work and won’t work.
I have really good observational skills along with the ability to read a room which I feel comes from the anxiety filled childhood I had.
I have a keen interest in the mental and physical health space.

I know my career options are limited due to my poor education but wondering what the best path would be for me when it comes to schooling because depending on the course/program; I would have to meet the pre-requisites which is not a problem as my goal is to be ready for a start date near September. I can also enter as “mature student status” and take a test as the assessment. I can also jump into a sales gig or take a sales course. 
Needless to say, trying to make a decision on the right kind of schooling for me or what direction to go is a bit overwhelming. 

I live in BC, Canada.

19bx7v5,Mechanical Engineer to Software?,"Currently a 4th year ME student and feel like I need a direction. I accepted an offer earlier in the year with a major aerospace company with high pay as a structural designer (CAD) of commercial aircraft. My senior year of college has felt very slow and unexhilierating compared to previous years. Most my classes are electives that do not require much effort leaving me with a lot of time to think.

  
I feel like I made a big decision by accepting my offer and didn't have time to think about other career choices, such as in the software field. I also enjoyed working on the software aspects, such as MATLAB and C++, in my robotics and programming courses. I am interested in possible leaning more into that field and using this position as a stepping stone since I am young.

  
Since in my job I will be doing CAD most of the time, I would like to slowly transition more into software. I have been self-teaching myself a bit on Python and data-science related topics on the side, and took a particular interest in Machine Learning.   
A few questions I have are: do I need to have a master's degree to pursue further education, or can I self-learn? My employer offers 100% funding for graduate education; would they still fund if its not directly correlated to the field I would be working in? Could I move eventually into a more software-focused field internally and branch into it that way?

Some of the reasons why I want to work in software is:

1. I feel it is more beneficial in the long-term
2. I want to diversify my knowledge into other adjacent fields, and continue to learn
3. I like the WFH opportunities",Icy_Ad2884,1,1.0,0,1705819248,2024-01-21 06:40:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19bx7v5/mechanical_engineer_to_software/,1,2024

I am a bit confused about which career paths to pursue. Here are the options I am considering:  
  
Finance: My plan is to start with short-term courses (like NCFM, NISM, Financial modelling), followed by obtaining a CFA. Then, I would choose between pursuing a master's in finance, an MBA in finance, or perhaps both. I could also look at completing both FRM and CFA  
  
Data Science: For this, I plan to learn it on my own through courses, bootcamps, or YouTube. I will learn the programming part of data science online, including Python, SQL, and other relevant languages. As data science at its core is mathematics and statistics, I would be doing a masters in either statistics or economics to get a solid grip of the fundamentals.  
  
MBA: While considering an MBA, my primary goal is to enter fields like Investment Banking, Consulting or Marketing and Sales. However, I believe I should not focus on it as my first option, as I can pursue an MBA after gaining some job experience through one of the other two options.

19buct0,Advice on navigating toxic boss in a new job,"I’m 2 months into a new job, a different role in a brand new industry. I’ve launched my first campaign and it was a super painful journey for a number of reasons:

- super tight timeline; campaign was briefed to me 1.5 month prior to launch, and there was a 2 weeks down time as all agencies were closed for year end
- first campaign of it’s kind, the company has not done something like this before
- agency deliverables kept getting delayed, which led to the campaign almost not going live on time

The worst part has got to be my manager who is probably the most difficult person I have worked for. While he’s great at his job, he’s prone to lash out at the team when he’s in a bad mood. There are a few moments when he’s encouraging, but every other day I get comments like ‘why do you keep screwing up’, ‘i can’t keep cleaning up your mess/mistakes’, ‘I expected more from someone like you but I have to treat you like an intern’.

I reviewed everything that I submitted to the various agencies and team with him, but it became my fault when he didn’t spot the missing items as i got the wrong reference deck from my colleague. Whenever there were gaps from the agencies it became my fault because ‘I should have known’. All these while I get nagged for not being detailed in checking work (but I don’t know what I don’t know?), not getting people to reply me on time, etc. 

Long story short, I’m very demoralised and not looking forward to work. It made me regret leaving my previous job , where i had a super nurturing boss and colleagues who I can call friends. 

I do want to solider on, but I’m in a very bad headspace. Any advice on how to deal with this situation and at least look forward to going to work?",breadandpasta,1,1.0,4,1705809056,2024-01-21 03:50:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19buct0/advice_on_navigating_toxic_boss_in_a_new_job/,1,2024

19btqhi,I'm experiencing imposter syndrome and feel very lost.,"Hi everyone, I'm 23 soon to be 24 and I'm about to graduate with my B.S. in computer engineering. Yes it took me almost six years to get this degree because computer engineering requires a ton of classes, plus I started off at city college so that took some time.  


Anyway, I'm finally almost at the end of my journey, but I'm feeling very lost and unfit, almost like I really don't deserve this degree. I honestly never thought I would do anything involving tech, but I went into it anyway considering my parents strongly suggested I choose something in high demand that will provide a stable career. It was also me trying to prove to myself that I can excel in math and science even though I never enjoyed it throughout my entire academic career. I did it anyway. Now that I'm coming to the closing of my academic career, I'm having some strong imposter system, specifically having to do with my combined skills of computer science and classic engineering (circuit theory, electronics, embedded systems, etc.)  


As a computer engineering major, you are required to basically take the same courses as a C.S. major, along with hardware and electrical engineering courses. I can't say that I've excelled in any of them. I'm like a C average student at best. I started my first coding courses during Covid when colleges went completely remote, and I think that really hindered my experience. During covid I felt so isolated, I didn't have the motivation to actually learn how to code and would hardly ever pay attention during zoom lecture (not that they were helpful anyway). There was no chatGBT at the time so I would heavily rely on Chegg and google to solve my assignments. I payed the price for that as soon as I transferred out of city college to a university and had to take my first data structures and algorithms course. My knowledge of c++ was so broken so I hardly knew what I was doing. I barely passed the class. This would go on for the rest of my courses throughout my final three years at university, barely passing my c.s. and engineering courses.  


Now that it's all coming to an end, I feel as though I didn't get much out of my learning experience as I should have. I can barely make a ""for loop"" or implement a ""tree"" to save my life, let alone know any algorithms at the top of my head. If I apply to software development jobs and get hired, I'm so afraid I'm not gonna know what the hell I'm doing. The courses are over, so there is no retaking them now and I'm about to graduate. I can still utilize resources online to maybe relearn everything, but will that be enough to fill in the gaps of my knowledge? I also started to learn Python through Angela Yu's course which I actually enjoy, so I am trying to fill in the gaps of my coding skills, but I know that's not enough. I was only able to pass classes like data structures & algorithms because I had friends who would help me out, the internet, and quizzes and exams were sometimes online. I could never fully develop a program just based off of what I learned in class and without the help of external resources. For my embedded systems course, my projects were just replicas off of Youtube, I was not able to compose one all on my own. And I have geniuses around me creating robots from scratch. It's so intimidating.  


I want to give this career path a shot considering it took me six years of working my butt off (kinda) to earn this degree. Don't get me wrong I wasn't just plain out copying other people's work, there was a lot of effort on my part, only to earn mediocre grades. How can I redeem myself? Am I capable of pursuing a career in software engineering, or any sort of engineering at this point? Over the summer of 2023, I did an IT internship program that I really liked. They seemed to like me to because they gave me a return offer which I gladly accepted. A fair paying job right out of college I guess. But the issue was that the internship was not software heavy at all, to be honest I really felt so out of my element considering I have an engineering degree. It felt like such a downgrade compared to what other people were doing. It was mostly on network management, cyber security and help desk. Is IT kind of a downgrade for someone with an engineering degree? Also, they are starting me off at 78k/year salary, let me know in the comments if that's good. It seems like actual software engineering jobs pay way more.  


In summary:  
Am I capable enough of still pursuing a degree in software engineering or other engineering roles?  
Do I deserved this degree considering my experience?  
What can I do to redeem myself?

Recently I’ve been focused entry-level PE and FE positions and interviewed with whiting-turner (US Southeast) but no luck (not enough experience).
Should I be applying to positions below these to gain the experience for PE/FE? 
From my understanding anything lower seems to be laborer jobs; should I be applying to labor positions? 
Should I still apply for PE/FE and be patient in hopes a company will take the opportunity on me? 
Can I apply to internships even though I’m a few years out of college?
And are there any resources that will help me gain some more knowledge while applying? Found some helpful resources on yt (Jason Schroeder, kienen Koga, Jesse Lane etc) and books, but I know that’s not hands on knowledge.

19bq2ie,Need advice!,"Hi there! Im new here and need some advice! I am not sure if this subreddit is the right place to post.

I’m 28F and I’ve been working for the same company in Australia for the last 4 years. My workplace doesn’t really have a manager on site but my boss (the owner of the business) frequently visit the busines once a month. Few months ago I was promoted as a team leader to take care the business while the owner is away. I also have a chance to be a practice manager in the future if I want to chase it. My responsibility so far is to make sure the business runs smoothly and to take care of the staff. Little bit about me, I’m the type of a person who easiley feel stress or anxiety whenever someone is not happy around me, and so far I’ve been trying to keep everyone happy at work. I try to listen what my staff wants and try to implement it whenever it possible. My boss said that I did a good job with handling everything.

At my workplace, there are 22 staff but I only have to manage 9 staff, the other staff are managed directly by my boss. In my team, there is this 1 staff (45F, lets call her Jane) who has been there for more than 20 years. Jane is the one who recruited me 4 years ago. And since I’m younger than her with less expereience (and now I’m her leader), she always try to give me hard time! Originally Jane is a good worker but very unorganised. Sometimes, Jane doesn’t follow the roster that I made and would do whatever she likes. She does bad with the stock inventory/ordering. She give customer a discount without consulting the owner of the business, and sometimes take longer to finish the job that is not complex,etc. Recently she came to work on her dayoff, and she got upset when I told her to go home and continue her job when she is back on her normal schedule. Whenever I try to give her advice on how to improve her performance, she wouldn’t listen. 
 
My boss told me that he will back me up whenever something happen between us. I have always reported her to my boss, but so far my boss didn’t do anything (I’m assuming because they are busy expanding the business in other state and it’s not easy to find reliable staff in my town). But I feel like, dealing with Jane is just wasting my time and give me unnecessary stress.

What am I supposed to do with Jane? I have reduced her responsibility at work, with the approval of my boss, but she still doesn’t improve her performance. I do want to get rid of her and replace her with someone else. But I do not have the power to do so at the moment!",Perfect_Donut_307,1,1.0,1,1705795949,2024-01-21 00:12:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19bq2ie/need_advice/,1,2024

19bn95b,Tips on starting in the insurance field with no experience?,"Tips on starting in the insurance field with no experience?

Hi all, I have been applying to different jobs for the past week and this week I applied to Customer Service Representative and Account Associate/Rep positions at State Farm agencies in my city. I am needing some advice on starting the field with no insurance background, tips on being successful in potential interviews, etc. 

Here is some background:

I recently graduated college back in May with a psychology degree and have been working at a social service agency for kids in the foster care system for the past couple months. I have been facing extreme stress/anxiety and burnout due to my job and am wanting a way out. Coworkers are quitting, some of my cases are very difficult, and it’s taking a toll on my physical and mental health. So I have actively been looking for other jobs and want to secure other employment before I quit my current position. I started getting curious about insurance around my junior/senior year but didn’t think much of it because I was focusing on finishing my psych classes and other requirements. I liked the fact it involved helping people, dealing with others, and getting to grow in a passion. One of my close friends from back home works as an Agent Aspirant at his State Farm agency and really likes his work. 

I just want a job where I am able to have a good work life balance and can grow. I don’t mind working under pressure, but it’d be nice to have one where it’s less stress from what I am doing now. I don’t have the time or money to back for grad school in psychology so I’ve just accepted the fact I might have to find a job outside of psych/social services/similar fields. 

So this brings me back to my current question. What is some advice and tips anyone can give me on starting out working in insurance? How could I incorporate my psych degree into insurance work? How can I be successful in an interview and use my degree as a factor in why an agent should hire me? How long does the whole interview/hiring process usually take for these positions? I would be interested in obtaining my life/health and P/C licenses if the positions required it or I have an opportunity down the line, so I am trying to learn a little bit about those.

I’m 30F & I’ve been an Executive Assistant for 8 years. I’m looking for a new role & really don’t want to be an EA again. I’m great at my job but I get bored usually after the first year at a new company. I always worked for small businesses with only 2-6 staff members so there was never enough room for growth. I sat down to create a career strategy and realized I love projects & creating SOP’s to help put systems and processes in place. I narrowed some job titles down to Project Manager, Operations Manager & Scrum Master. Some industries I’m thinking I’ll be interested in are Construction & Tech Start-ups and I want to be at a company that has at least 50+ employees.

I recently took a PM class which just narrowed down the basics of Project Management. I was going to get the CAPM but I’ve heard it’s not worth it & getting the PMP is better.
I see a lot of jobs for project engineers that’ll get me into construction but I can’t afford to do any free internships or low paying positions in construction.

I’ve been applying to jobs for a couple months now, revising my resume for every job I apply too & reaching out to recruiters but no interviews yet.

19blve9,The job I am going for is dream job but it is far from my partner (4h). Kids would be with me,"Hello,

throwaway account. I have some hard time deciding how I should proceed and maybe I could get some advice from you.

Here we go, we lived in country 1 together my husband and kids and now he got a good job in country 2. Country 2 does not have nice parental benefits and is very expensive for kids but he seems to finally be happy in his job and that hasnt happened for 8 years. Me, I finished studying for my degree and I have been looking for both Country 1 and 2 jobs as country 1 is still the one I would prefer we all live in (country 2 has shit salary also compared to country 1 and I would need to pay visa).

Now I got a bunch of promising leads and especially one of them where I would be in country 2 with a rather quite low salary but a really nice job where I can really improve my skills to be more well seen on the job market. The issue is... it is 3.5h of train from his job. I don't want him to quit his job and he is willing to commute like 2 days a week  to the city however I think it is a waste of time and money especially because pay is so low that we can only afford one place as daycare costs 25% of our combined salary, with 25 other % being renting a place. So if you add on top of that the train then that is again 5-10 % gone per month.

Now I really would thrive in the job but it seems infeasible. My partner still want to try but I feel very negative and disappointed too. The company now wants to meet me in person and is ready to pay for the trip too, but I feel I will never be able to take this job in the end as it is too far from my husband.

So my question is :

1) Do I still go for the interview in person? And that to not take it as a signature of a contract but also a training for future jobs.

2) Do I try to make it work or in your opinion this will never work and I should just be unemployed and join him with kids and figure out there what I can find in his city?

19bkgvk,Wait in a big company or settle for a small organization?,"I've been interning for a huge car company, known worldwide for three months. I have another three months to go and I still don't know if I'll be offered a job afterwards, although my teammates say it's likely given that they offered a job to the previous intern. 
I have another fellow intern beside me and honestly they seem more hardworking than I am. I'm also doing my tasks but they seemed to be extremely excited about the job and they almost always do overtime. I'm not a huge fan of competition among team members, I'm a calm type, and I feel that the other intern is closer to get a job offer than I am. 
In the meantime, I got a full-time job offer from a much much smaller organization that pays the same amount that I have as an intern. But it's a permanent position that gives me security especially for my residence permit. 
I'm thinking about talking to my boss about my future in the company soon. Should I mention the other job offer? If he doesn't offer the job just yet, should I still be patient and wait or leave for the permanent position although the pay is the same?
TL,DR: I've been interning in a huge international company for three months, I've three months to go. I don't know if they'll hire me. I got a full-time job offer in another tiny organization.

So about to apply to my school's ChemE program (currently a pre-major) with MSE as my backup. Honestly, the idea of working with bio-materials and being in a lab intrigues me more. I wonder if the job I daydream about aligns more with being a chemist than a chemical engineer. My grades and pre-reqs qualify for both, but if I switch them on my application, am I messing things up? Job security is my top priority, and I want a career that's not solely focused on research and can be hands one. MSE might not be as great as ChemE for this, but is it at least a safe choice?

19bge8z,May I have help figuring out my career please?,"Disclaimer: I have no idea what I want to do with my life anymore. From middle school to now in my early 20s, I was so sure that I wanted to be a meteorologist because I always loved weather. I hardly considered anything else, and everything else I did consider didn't feel right. Fastforward now, I went to the local weather station to shadow them a couple of days. I realised it's not for me (it seemed boring), and I also realised that I only liked weather for the aesthetic/the way the clouds & snow look. Tbh, I was a fool. So, I'll tell a little about myself, and I was wondering if y'all could figure out what career would best suit me.

1. I like to ""get in the zone"" when completing a task. I like doing work where I get easily immersed in it, where I don't have to think or move or do anything else. Examples in my life include drawing/tracing, solving a math problem (but not too complicated, or I stress and out of that zone), knitting, etc. Like an addiction/obsession, but also not



2. I want a healthy amount of interaction for my career, but not customer service oriented or in-your-face 24/7. I'm a straightforward, introverted person, and although I've worked in customer service jobs before, I don't want it as a career. I would rather interact among colleagues, or teach (I've tutored before and enjoyed it).



3. I'm very meticulous with my work and I am very detail-oriented 



4. I don't mind a design career. Only if I'm already given something to design, not if I have to design myself, because I'm not that designer-oriented. I do enjoy tracing though. For example, for my art elective in high school, I was one of the best photo-realistic drawers ever. I could draw anything perfectly that was put in front if me. But I was very bad at drawing concepts or ""creating"" out if thin air. So I doubt engineering.



5. Whether I want to make a big impact on society depends on how much I love my career, and want to spread that love to others. So currently, no. But if I find something I love, then yes.



6. I'm good with numbers and math and physics. However, I like the concrete/practical side of math, not the theoretical side with all the greek alphabet letters. So while I'm really good with lower-level math, I'm not so good with upper level.



7. Last thing. One thing that's ALWAYS been consistent with me ever since I was young. I've always been a maladaptive daydreamer, I think. I would always create alternate scenarios from the shows/animes/cartoons that I would watch. Like fanfiction. I always knew, even when I wanted to be a meteorologist, that deep-down, this would hinder my future. I'm trying not to do it as much and to be more ""present and in the moment"". But even so, I've always had a huge imagination with characters and stories.



8. Music also fuels my imagination #7. So if I'm working, I can't listen to music or I'll start daydreaming.

Anyways, what do y'all think :) ?",101-5,2,1.0,6,1705770402,2024-01-20 17:06:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19bge8z/may_i_have_help_figuring_out_my_career_please/,1,2024
19bg5l8,Unemployed - Should I pursue a Data Science Masters?,"Hey everyone,

I’ll try to keep this short, I’ve been struggling very hard to find a job with a computer science degree and I believe I would like to specialize in a field. I graduated back in May 2023, had a SDE internship the summer up until August 2023, and have been unemployed since then struggling hard to find a job. Truth is I would like to stop wasting time and my end goal was to end up working as a data scientist or data engineer. I planned to go back for my masters while I worked if needed to get into the position, but is it worth it to go with no experience and since I already have a bachelors in cs already. I plan to apply to a much more prestigious school than my original undergrad and would love some advice. 

I’m 22 and currently have no loans from undergrad and live with my parents so no rent. I would have to pull $35k for the program if accepted, but I just don’t know if the prestige, job hunt, long term career path at a better company will be worth the expensive tuition that I’ll need a loan for. Maybe my decision would’ve been made if I had been already working but being unemployed I feel as if I’m out of options and would like to fill my gap with something that might end up putting me in a bigger hole in the long run? Any advice would help!

19bg033,Accepting an engineering role without a true engineering degree. I think I need a sanity check.,"I have accepted an offer as an engineer for power plant with only a energy engineering technology B.S. The job description is pretty wide ranging and encompasses some things that make me nervous. It primarily seems that this ""engineering"" position is more of a analysis/support and project management role rather than what I imagine engineers actually do, which gives me hope.  
  
The interview (which I thought went poorly), didn't encompass any technical questions and only asked me to go through my resume and conflict resolution strategies. Also, the interviewer did not mention several primary duties on the job listing. I asked them about mentorship culture in their plant, and they made it clear that I ""wasn't expected to know everything."" To my surprise, they offered me the job with compensation more than I asked. At this point I am kind of concerned that I misrepresented myself. Perhaps this is just imposter syndrome.  
  
In the past I have worked in two different kinds of plants in an operator/technician role over the course of 8 or so years, including moving into support and supervisory roles. These roles included some fairly stressful management and troubleshooting challenges that I overcame. I am confident I can learn to do anything that is required of me, but I am worried about expectations. How is it that they passed up on true mechanical engineers, for example? I am thinking that they like my soft skills and personality more so than being impressed with my outright technical expertise. I am currently refreshing myself on project management and management of change.  
  
What advice do you have for me to be as successful as possible?

19bc8np,Department is a dead-end and waste of my skills,"I joined a new company (global company with multiple departmants) through a friends recomendation after being burnt out from my previous job.
Althought I knew before joining that this specific departmant isnt really my area of expertise, the company itself is related to my area. (The managers knew this as well)

The hours are ok and it pays really well for an entry-level position.

In this specific department, I have noticed that:
1. My skillset is wasted;
2. I have little to do;
3. Doing side-projects or gaining other skills on the down time is very much frowned uppon;
4. Feedback from other coworkers is that the department is a bit of a dead-end in regards to progression. (The rest of the company doesnt seem to be this way and being a global company was one of the things that attracted me).

Also, I have noticed through the companys internal platform that there are several openings where I would be much more engaged and able to use my skill set.
Although I feel confortable to talk to my direct boss about it, I feel that the departmant manager would not like it if I was already eyeing other positions.

This is not even asking for a promotion but a reassingment of departments.
I have been here for 2 months and have not had 1 performance review meeting and I have an initial contract of 6 months.
When and how would you guys suggest having this talk with my boss?

19bbela,Should I do an internship senior year or take an extra college class?,"Hi. For context, I'm a junior in high school thinking about what direction to take as a senior for next year. I have an opportunity to do a paid internship with my school from 2-5 pm throughout the school year which would give me some experience in the IT field, which I plan to build a career in the future. I know how important it is to get a foot in the industry at a young age and build experience through internships, which is why I heavily considered this.

However, I'm having a dilemma on whether I should take up this internship or focus on taking a general education college class through my community college that would earn me credit for my planned major. My school has an early online college program that would allow me to take a class for 12 weeks at no cost.  I'm considering this a lot because although I can do an internship in college too, I won't get the chance to take free classes like this in the future. I already have 13 credits worth of transferring to college, so adding more would help greatly.

I figure people would ask why I can't do both, but my schedules would conflict if I were to try to juggle both of those on top of my regular high school coursework.

I hate this culture, I have decided to open a separate bank account and never tell them about my salary! Is this a selfish decision? I put my family first for years. They are all in their comfort zones, and no one of them want to change, or at least put the effort to look for a job or learn something. If they do they instantly give up. I am fed up 
I wish If I could move out, as female in this culture moving out on my own is impossible.

I am so tired and stressed, please. Any advice?",sacvv05,509,0.8999999761581421,436,1705754597,2024-01-20 12:43:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19bayn5/my_african_parents_take_50_80_of_my_salary_for/,1,2024
19ba7js,Radical job change,"Hi Redditors,

I've a bachelor in computer engineering and a master in computer science, since three years I'm involved in my first job as software engineer.

I'm almost sure that I have chosen the wrong career path.

This won't be a complaint post, but a request of tips for a radical job change. I'm young so I have the possibility to do it.

I've never enjoyed my job. During studies I loved the mathemical side of engineering, but I started noticing that computer science make me unhappy. For years I try to hide this to myself, because I was in the middle of my study path and I didn't want to throw all away, so I do an effort to finish my bachelor and I started a master because i was empty of ideas.

In last months I've began to think about myself and I noticed that:
- working in office destroy my vitality
- programming and computer in general frustrates me
- Not a day I've been happy about my job

In parallel I've analysed my strenghts:
- I love nature and animals
- I love having a varied life, routine kills me
- I love be social with people

So this is my plan B and I ask you some suggestions about it:
- begin to do volunteering during weekends to understand which activities excites me more, my job interests are:
-- take care of animals (feeding them, keep cages and environments tidy, taking care of them) in a zoo or a park
-- being a park naturalist
- while I explore my interests give anyway a possibility to my current job. I will try to change work place for another company.
- if my volunteer goes well reduce my software engineering job to 50-70% and begin to prepare for new career (stage and study what needed)
- when I'm ready do the switch

What do you think about my plan? Do you have some tips? I need to organize all in good way because I know isn't easy to do a carrer change.",Orochi597,1,1.0,9,1705751851,2024-01-20 11:57:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19ba7js/radical_job_change/,1,2024

19b6lp9,End of Assignment vs Layoff(CA)?,"My role recently ended with my company.  I would describe it as a layoff, due to lack of available work. 

I'm in California.  The HR rep I spoke to said that this wouldn't be categorized as a layoff, since my role hadn't been eliminated or made redundant.  Rather, there's simply not enough work at the company to justify keeping all roles.

The separation notice they asked me to review indicated it was an 'end of assignment'.  The other option was resignation(voluntary) or discharge(implied performance termination).

It's too late now, but should I have pushed back insisted I be classified as a layoff for their records?

19b3vd4,Help me find a pathway,"I have to apply for uni pretty soon and I've done a lot of research on this.

I think I will try to do medicine, but I still need other courses in case I get rejected.

My interests:
- chemistry
- biology
- physics (particle, gravitional, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, electrical)
- calculus
- geography
- linguistics

So naturally I thought a BSc is probably good. But no, it requires a Master or PhD and even then careers don't look very good in terms of employability and pay.

So I also looked at engineering. But I'm not amazing at maths (I can improve though) and really don't like motion physics. I think electrical and biomedical are probably most interesting to me. But I really don't know about this. I took STEM classes with a focus on the E for two years and I did not like them at all. I'm really sloppy with measurements and stuff like that. I didn't like having constraints. Half my projects failed spectacularly. And I would never have enough time.

I just feel it isn't right for me at all.

We also have CS and Data Science. I used to program and it was very bad for me. Not willing to do that again.

Finally, I looked pharmacy and pharmaceutical science. Pharmaceutical science has the same issues as science. But it doesn't need a master's, because it's already 3 years of specialising. 

Pharmacy is convoluted. Most end up as retail pharmacists. Extremely poor pay in the vast majority of circumstances. But some end up in hospitals and those pay relatively well. But extremely competitive and unreliable.

Actually for all these you can work in related economics, sales and law. But if I wanted to go into those areas, I would instead consider doing a commerce or law degree.

Our benefits are atrocious and not even comparable with typical corporate America - no holidays off (yes at corporate), horrible mat/pat leave, no sick days, 2% 401k match, a refusal to take a stance on social issues of any kind so no employee ERGs (even for women or minorities or anything), no money for conferences or travel, we have to pay for our own food at company events, no budget for team training or socializing if any kind, bo bereavement days (a girl working for me had her mom die and this is how I found out), no education reimbursement - the list goes on and on.

19b22o0,Thoughts on applying with a vendor I manage?,"I’m curious about people’s thoughts on this:

I run a $50M line of business that depends on a group of ~25 vendors. The vendors recently went through a competitive bid process to get renewed/hired. 

I had a shitty 2023. Wife had cancer, I had a major surgery that messed me up for 6 months , and business was shit for a lot of reasons. Some of those reasons were decisions made by management, and those same managers are now lining up to kick me in the nuts. I don’t think I’ll get fired - I have a long history of excellent ratings and usually blow out my goals - but wouldn’t be surprised if I got no-bonused or PIP’d, and I’m killing myself with work. So I’m looking.

I’ve been working with one of the vendors on reviving a particular line of business. They’re hiring for it, and the more I think about it the more I realize I’d be perfect for the position and I want to apply. I am certain that I could 10x this line for them in 3 years, which would help my current company too.

Trouble is I manage this vendor day to day, so there’s a conflict of interest that would affect both sides. 

It’s a bit of a dirty industry and this type of movement is not uncommon (one of my directs got poached from this vendor years ago). I am certain I’d be able to move on and work impartially with them if I didn’t get it.

So, what say you? Have a talk or take the Boy Scout route and leave it alone?",6byfour,1,1.0,4,1705720873,2024-01-20 03:21:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19b22o0/thoughts_on_applying_with_a_vendor_i_manage/,1,2024
19b1ogr,"20 years at dealership, possible Tesla opportunity.","May 2024 will be my 20th year anniversary at my local dealership. Started as a lube tech and now I am a team leader in the shop. Basically hit the ceiling, as the shop foreman is pretty young and not going anywhere anytime soon. Currently sitting at approx 100k a year. I may have an opportunity to move onto Tesla as a technician. 

Got into current position in 2020 along with the pay bump. Since then there has been zero pay increase while CA wages and everything else has gone up. Basically all the high end guys didn't get a raise. At the beginning of the new year, there were some changes in the shop and everyone is unhappy. First change of it's kind in decades, basically more work/stress. I've address this issue with management but it appears that they are not going to change back.

Early 2023 is when I started thinking about how everything was, same thing day in day out. Kinda having to baby sit all the guys that I watch over. Then the changes at the new year was what really put me over.

Background on the company. Local, well know big brand, dealership is owner owned. They are greedy, money grabbing owners. During COVID, marking vehicles up to 30k+ and even now still marking up hybrids. Benefits sucks. No 401k match. Starting to think about 401k and benefits more and more as I get older. 

From my understanding, I would start as a level 3, that maxes out ar $40/hr. There are higher levels and I'm sure I can move up. All I heard is nothing but good about the service center. I hear benefits are amazing and they have stock options. Benefits may be a plus because we are expecting as well. 20 years at one place is a long time to just leave, and the unknown is what scares me.",mrjt465,1,1.0,2,1705719664,2024-01-20 03:01:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19b1ogr/20_years_at_dealership_possible_tesla_opportunity/,1,2024

19azfxa,"Got offer, could I have your feedback and help with negotiating and next steps?","Hi everyone - Well I've got some good news, I got the job offer for a role that I really want from HR today. I DIDN'T accept the offer YET and asked to take the weekend to review the details, and I have a follow up call with HR on Monday afternoon.

In short, as happy as I am to get the offer, I'm NOT too happy with the salary. It's not bad and could be worse, but could be way better.

I have a plan and would really appreciate your feedback, advice, and suggestions on next steps to get the salary and start date I want.

tl;dr: role: relationship manager (farmer) role, salary offered: $105k, too low, start date is too early, seeking feedback on what I'm planning for next steps during my Monday follow up call.

The role and offer details

* Role: Relationship manager (farmer)
* Salary: $105k (Range discussed is $95k-$125k)
* Bonus: Up to 10%
* Start date: February 5th

How the call went with HR

* HR was very straight forward and friendly, just presented the offer
* I had a handful of follow up questions that were more general
* I asked for the weekend to review the details
* Follow up call with HR scheduled for Monday at my request
* I purposely did NOT push back in the salary and start date, my plan is to do this on Monday (my gf said she would've pushed back right away, oh well, I chose a different game plan and too late now)

My issues

* Salary is too low, I would settle on $125k, that's my minimum, which is their upper band (The thing is, I really want this job in particular, but I also feel/know I'm being low balled)
* Start date is too early, I'm on vacation and need/want a start date of February 15th

My fear and hesitation

* The thing is, I REALLY want this job in particular, it encompasses certain elements that I want that not available in other roles
* It's in the field is finance, not like it's non-profit, it's a multi billion dollar corp, they're not hurting for money
* I don't want to walk away from this job because of the money, it's just I know I can command more money
* The thing is, I have no experience negotiating salaries, I worked at my last company for many years after undergrad and worked no where else. So now that I'm done with my masters, this is the first time I could be working at another company and really my first time negotiating salary since undergrad. I NEED HELP WITH THIS!

My counter offer plan

* I plan to ask for $145K + signing bonus = 1 month
* I plan to say that this is an offer from another company (this is a gamble because I don't actually have an actual other offer) and ask if this can be matched
* I also want to anchor high to get closer to $125k, my minimum
* Why should I get paid more? I have X years of experience (more than the role requires) in this field, I just got a masters in this specialized field of finance, I also bring specialized knowledge of the field, the product, and existing relationships in the field. These are all things I've discussed in the interviews, so they know this.

I would really appreciate any help, feedback, guidance, and words of encouragement please!

19aysvb,My job is nothing like the job listing I applied for a year ago. How can I talk to my boss about what I feel is a raw deal?,"**TLDR: I took a 20% pay decrease for a job that sounded like it would be a great move for my career, and the whole reason I signed up for the job hasn't materialized. I have a meeting with my boss coming up and I want to emphasize that I feel like my talents are being wasted, and my career and financial future are taking a hit.**

More background:

I'm a coding bootcamp grad with no degree, I worked for an SEO company for year before switching to this job.

Well, 9 months in I talked with my boss about this disappointing situation and he said he understood and would do something about it.

Here we are 3 months later and the only bone they've thrown me is spinning up a WordPress site with no meaningful code-related work on the horizon. Meanwhile I'm getting more unrelated responsibilities and tasks and my physical/mental health is suffering.

Meanwhile 2 of the company's managers with no training in code are struggling to cobble together working supply chain software using chatGPT and no-code products. (We're talking business critical systems here!!!)

Can anyone offer broad advice about how to approach the conversation with my boss? He's a reasonable man and I think he'll be receptive to the right arguments and attitude, but I know I have to appeal to his bottom line if my pleas have any chance of being heard.",TomBakerFTW,1,1.0,3,1705711222,2024-01-20 00:40:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19aysvb/my_job_is_nothing_like_the_job_listing_i_applied/,1,2024
19aymha,Should I Quit My Job After Just 2 Months?,"Hi everyone, I'm currently debating on quitting my job after just a couple of months. The reason being I don't really enjoy any of it. I joined the company as an intern in 2022 and in December of last year I got the opportunity to begin working full time on a new project. Ever since I joined the project I haven't been enjoying work and I don't feel like it's going to get better, I don't like the job or my boss, and the company (which has 1,000+ employees) has changed a lot since I joined and it's been mostly for the worst. 

The reason I'm reluctant to quit is because the project seems to have a lot of potential and the salary is ok along with medical insurance, a good number of vacations days, and several financial aids. Also I'm reluctant because I'm worried I won't be able to find and opportunity as good as this one. I'm 23 and this is my first job since graduating from college, but a lot of my friends are struggling to find decent jobs in the field. And to be fair even if I quit I wouldn't know what to do, I'm not even sure as to what I would like to do for work. 

I currently live with my parents so I don't really have any major expenses and I have a decent amount of money saved up, I'm mostly worried about losing on a good opportunity but as I mentioned I'm currently very unhappy with pretty much everything involving the job. 

What are your suggestions or past experiences? It's also worth noting that my contract expires on Feb 29th, but after that it gets renewed for a year with a higher salary. The reason why the contract I'm on only lasts for three months is because it's supposed to be a trial period. 

I'm very open to answering any questions you my have and please feel free to leave any sort of advice or past experiences. 

English is not my first language so I apologize for any mistakes

19ay6wi,Reneged an offer the same day I accepted,"This past summer, I worked an internship at a tech company. I mostly enjoyed working there and really liked the interim department manager (who was filling in for the actual manager for the summer). When they expressed they'd like me to return the following summer, I told them I want to explore my options before making a decision. I didn't see myself at this company long term but I got good experience with them.   
We kept in contact and I met the actual dept manager, who I thought was OK. I kept insisting that I want time to see what else is out there, to which they did not give me and I understand that as they want to hire asap.   
They eventually gave me a day they needed an answer by.  I asked for more time but they said no because they had interviews scheduled immediately afterwards and at that point I'd be added to the pool of candidates.

The manager was short to my questions, dismissive, and I got an icky feeling after the phone call. All that mixed with my desire to seek new opportunities, I knew I should back out. And so I did.   
I sent an email later that day to the manager and HR explaining that I felt pressured to give an answer too soon in my job search and I do not stand by my decision to return. The manager sent a bit of a nasty email back, explaining how unprofessional it is to say yes then no, and to be mindful of how such actions can affect the company's process, etc. Overall, their response made me feel even more horrible.   
They also mentioned that it is very inconvenient given that they had cancelled interviews they had scheduled with alternative candidates (just in case I said no). Isn't that in itself unprofessional? Would a company actually take the time to schedule interviews, and then back out and cancel last minute once they received my answer? I find that questionable and perhaps they were bluffing.  
I would just like others thoughts on what happened. I know what I did isn't great, but is it really so horrible?

Some jobs near me have been slowly increasing their wage if I see the post stay up for a while. In a year, a simple hotel cleaning job jumped from $15 to $20. 

It feels like I can tell who is in touch with reality when I'm job searching and who isn't just from the wage they offer. 

 $15 an hour just feels outrageous for a minimum wage. Unfortunately, the jobs near me are usually minimum wage jobs unless you can get into construction or something like that.

19awd4b,How to ask if they are planning to fire me?,"First an interlude, please bare with me. I work in sales and have a middle management type of position (the company has a pretty elaborate hierarchy). I have been with the company for almost a decade, working my way up from part time to my current position. A couple of years ago I applied for a promotion, but didn't get it and have not been allowed to apply since.

I am a very hard worker and I am very good at my job (as per my yearly feedback). What I obviously lack is restraint and people skillls - if I have an opinion, it's written all over my face, even though I try my best to ""poker face"". I also have a dark sense of humor and sarcasm doesn't fare well in my store. These are the main reasons that I was not allowed to apply for promotions, as I have been told by my superiors. They always mention how I'm great at my job, how  my communication skills have improved significantly, but that I'm still seen as a negative person etc. Lately I've been talked to about my attitude more frequently and as this topic has been a reoccurring theme, I'm getting the feeling that they want to fire me. The company has done sth similar a couple of times already and I have a feeling that I may be next on the list.

So, how should I go about it? I don't want to seem ""confrontational"", I just want to know where I stand and what my timeframe is. The last two similar situations looked like this; the person came to work and after a couple of hours HR told them, they should go home and never return (they were banned from entering the store). One was even not allowed to personally clear her locker, another girl had to do it.

I've got a job offer for a Logistics Sales Rep position in San Antonio, Texas brand new territory I would be the only and it’s mostly outside sales for an asset based transportation company.  
  
Google maps says it can be from 45 min to 1:30hr commute depending traffic from the north side to the south side each way.  
  
The job requires in-office hours from Tuesday to Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM, with Mondays being remote. Also, every other Saturday is remote from 9 AM to 12 PM at home.  
  
The pay is $60,000/year plus 1% commission on all revenue. The benefits seem great, but it’s been hard getting another job (almost 2-3 months, I am a 24M)  
  
I currently rely on social media income since I upload skits and have a pretty good following. I mostly get income from brand deals but the pay/views varies A LOT, for example in November I got almost $30k from deals but December and January got $400 combined, plus TikTok and Facebook pay also around $500-1000 a month but it mostly all goes to my rent ($1200 which just seems to be going up) and some expenses.  
  
I do not pay my car since it’s all payed for plus gas is also a gift from my parents, which I’m very thankful for.  
  
Considering the commute, income and circumstances should I take this job or wait for something else?  
  
Or should I even just try to sublease my apartment for the reminder of my contract which is 1 more year, move back in with my parents to my hometown, save up and build a career there? (After I am done with my contract that is mostly my plan to move back to my hometown since the industry I am in is very big over there)

19atwqv,Aerospace Engineer - Mid-career Work/Life Crisis,"TLDR; Change careers to find remote work or give up on working remotely and accept impacts to family lifestyle?

I'm an aerospace engineer with around 15 years of experience spanning many of the sub-disciplines in the industry, a BS Mechanical Engineering, and an MBA.  Generally speaking, my prospects for continuing or seeking alternate employment in this industry are solid. I've been with my current employer 12 years and am well-positioned for another promotion in the next 2-3 year timeframe.  I know what I have and am grateful but I'm also not happy.

I am head of household for a family of four.  We depend on my income for everything. Our kids (now 2 and 1 years old) don't get to see family often, don't have friends close in age, the weather is always bad where we live so we are sometimes sheltered indoors for days on end, and we want to be elsewhere. My job demands 100% on-site work hours, and I've been looking for something 100% remote so I can move closer to family in the Northwestern US mountains. It isn't specifically important that it be a remote job, but there is no aerospace in or near the areas we'd like to be living, and other jobs there are on the low paying end of the spectrum.  So far this search has been unsuccessful. 

I'm conflicted with giving up on this idea of moving closer to family where the lifestyle matches our ideals.  We'd have cousins, Aunts, Uncles, Grandparents, good friends with kids around the same ages as ours, beautiful weather at least half the year, all four seasons, smaller neighborhoods and better schools.  But I suspect we could find a nicer place to live while remaining in aerospace, I'd just have to leave my current employer (have tried relocating within already 3 times) and wouldn't have the family proximity.

Or I could try for a career change, pick an industry where 100% remote work is abundant, potentially expect a decreased salary (starting over in experience), and move my family to where we'd like to be.  A real concern with this option is the pay cut we'd be faced with now that housing is so expensive and requires a higher salary to keep up even in the rural areas of the country, so any career change would have to somehow still pay enough.

https://www.ascm.org/technology-certificate-program/  
  
My background:

I have been a PeopleSoft developer for roughly 20 years with a BBA in management info systems and Master of Science in computer info technology. After surviving a couple of reorgs and layoffs, I am now supporting the procurement side in addition to development/tech support. I am also assisting in supporting accounts payable and some travel and expense, AR, Billing, etc. I do not have as much understanding of the functional side like those functional support crew (business analysts) who got laid off. Although I have assisted them over the years. Mainly been a developer. Typically, you need a crew to support PeopleSoft and we are down to 3 including myself plus two admins.  
  
I have never gotten any clear path from my current employer on next steps or how I should prepare. It's just dropped in my lap as they need me, and I figure it out. Should I next go for some business side certification such ASCM (Association for Supply Chain Management) or some other type of procurement learning path certification since I now support procurement? Is there any benefit?   
  
I am struggling to figure out what I should do next. I may eventually move off PeopleSoft onto another ERP system. Plus, I am struggling to find another PeopleSoft position elsewhere. They either lowball me with an offer, or the interviews are a total nightmare.",cousinconley,1,1.0,0,1705692376,2024-01-19 19:26:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19ardal/i_am_an_erp_developer_taking_on_procurement/,1,2024

19aqn3v,"This may be unpopular, but I appreciate HR","I work for myself and pretty much there is NO ONE to say anything to. Bottom line- do your fucking work, if there are any issues, there is really no one to really tell anything to.  Fix this, implement that, no bullshit, if there are problems leave a note in teams.  You have to resolve everything with the person you are working with.

My last company HR used to send emails every day about their open door policy and they are always there to talk about any matter, even if personal. They would also plan small events for employees.  They would send emails about corporate mottos and shit like ""Develop a sense of urgency"" and ""we don't turn off the lights at 5PM.""  I think in the big picture that is a good thing. Keeps you motivated and a solid employee.

Also miss being the office but that is another story.

19aqmyq,Can't seem to get even a screening call as a fresher for entry level Data Analyst positions. What am I doing wrong?,"A little bit about me - I graduated in May 2023 with a BA (Hons) in Economics from one of the best tier 1 colleges in my country. But I am not here to flex- I am here to plead for help cause I've been feeling pretty directionless since the last 6 months when I started on this vague path to pursue Data Analytics.  Stupidly enough I didn't sit for any of my college placements and that decision is haunting me every day to my very core. I have no work experience (nope not even internships) and I come from a non-tech background so that's a double blow to my chances of getting an opportunity to set my foot in the industry. On top of that, it's going to be 1 year since my graduation in a few months, so I guess I can't even call myself a fresher anymore which is another turn-off for potential recruiters. Completed the Google Analytics Professional Certificate (which was a total waste of time), got my hands dirty with projects in Python, SQL and Power BI, even practised insane amounts of SQL interview questions through Leetcode and StrataScratch. But what's the use of all this prep when I can't even get an opportunity to show it? So far I've got one exploratory call from a random analytics consultancy and that too was months ago. Pin-drop silence since then. Applied to hundreds of jobs and even internships - at times even got sent assessment links, did pretty decent at them but still never got a call. Even got aired when asked for referrals on LinkedIn.  What's going wrong? Is it me? Is it the job market? Is it my resume? Should I just give up and pursue something else?

I’m considering a new position at a new facility that is approximately 1.25 hours away. This job would provide better benefits in the form of retirement and pension and a $25,000 per year raise. 

The issue is the commute. My current commute is 25 minutes of mostly in-town driving. The new commute would be mainly interstate (I-82, central WA state). During spring, summer, and fall the drive at face value at least seems manageable. Winter months are entirely different.

I'm in a sales position at an equipment dealership. I have a base salary + a commission structure. I've been here for almost 3 years. The discrepancy in the definition of ""salary"" has come in to play multiple times.  
  
So my salary is unchanged working 40 or more hours per week, but any less and it's changed to an hourly rate. This just started in the last 3-4 pay periods. We're in the slow season right now so <40hrs/week is pretty normal for most of the salesman.  
  
My question here is whether or not it is legal for my employer to change my pay structure like this? There are weeks where I work 50+hrs/week but am not compensated. I am also forced to give up 30min/day for lunch. It essentially seems like my pay structure changes wherever it is most beneficial for the company.

19aiwoo,Remote Job to Non-Remote But More Pay,"Hello,

I greatly enjoy the place I work and I'm well respected from coworkers and management. I make $162k in a high cost of living area and I'm fully remote without any change in sight. Before the pandemic, my office allowed me to work from home three days per week. Recently there was an internal opening which made more money ($13k) and included more responsibilities (e.g., managing people). I applied and ultimately was ranked #3 and therefore wasn't offered the position.  


After that, I looked around and applied to some jobs which are similar. I received an offer and now they want me to start in three weeks. The new job makes $15k more,  isn't supervisory, and has a higher overall salary potential. My current job, historically, increases 3% per year. The new job is the same sector but the group said I would expect around 4.5% per year. With that in mind, I can project out that in 4 years my salary at the new job would be \~$211k. And my current job would be $183k.

I've notified my employer and they are giving me the hard sell especially since the new job isn't remote.

I'm very torn and not sure what to do.

19agk7a,Shall I carry on?,"I'm debating on whether to give up learning as every time I try to better myself with a new job, I get told I either don't have enough experience or I need to learn something else and so it goes on like a circle where I end up in the same place as when I started, wiser but still in the same place. I have a degree in Photography and teaching, I learned 35mm photography everything went digital and no one wanted to employ me unless it was Olan Mills, I couldn't get a teaching job as I didn't have experience,  so now I work in a call centre. I have been here 6 years, I have trained people who are now above me and I get nowhere when I apply to change my role and I am still just an agent. So I thought I would learn Python as a start then C++, and Java and see what's out there, but then when I look for jobs they wanted at least 5 years of experience, I'm 43, 5 years I feel I will be too old. So I wrote some novels, but I couldn't find a publisher so I self-published and local independent bookstores won't sell my book as its self published so I hit a wall there too, I'm really thinking about just giving up,    
Then I see people at work who have less experience, less qualifications taking me over career-wise, I see writers on TV who self published and now have book deals and film deals, I honestly don't see the point of doing anything anymore.   
Can REDDIT advise me, I'm at the end of my rope.

19acrzm,"Theoretically if I were to become a celebrity movie director/artist for mainstream media, would I be able to create nsfw content and say it was made by me?","Basically what the title says. I’m struggling to find an answer on the internet because I guess it can’t pinpoint what exactly I’m asking. But for example I guess let’s just say this:

I became a highly successful movie/artist for content intended for mainstream (not like kids stuff, more like rated R or M (lets just say like attack on titan for a random example^(is attack on titan mainstream?^^(in fact what does mainstream even mean?)))) and I’m very well known in the industries.
If I decided I wanted to try and do nsfw things like comics or graphic novels, would I be able to credit myself as the creator for making those things or would that be like… I dunno… illegal?… against the rules?… idk something like that. Because I would maybe like to make something that would be made by the creator themself officially and be able to possibly Implement into the main storylines(or canon to the universe I would make(if I even end up doing that)).
Because if by some miracle I do end up achieving my dreams (will be a massive challenge) I would like to try different things as well (like video games!(not nsfw ones though)). Would my careers be tainted and unable to continue because I implemented nsfw into it?

*phew* that was a lot to try and put into words…

19ab8l6,"Love my day job, but it doesn’t pay enough. Getting offers for double, but at boring companies. Do I tell my current employer..? Help!!","
Tl;Dr at the bottom 

For context, I’ve been self employed for close to 20 years. During that time though, I’ve paid myself very well and had some freedoms. Ive also worked close to 90-100hrs a week for almost my entire professional life. Never left work at 5, very rarely take either weekend days off. I’ve enjoyed working hard, but the older I get the more I think about my future. 

Within the last 4 or so years, I’ve started to think long term. My industry has some volatility, and I’ve had interest in seeing how my organic, self taught business skills would do for me in the typical corporate world. So for the past 4 years I’ve held full time jobs, while running my own companies. While hard, it’s proven to be something I really enjoy; I essentially get paid to learn things that I can use to scale the revenue and effeciency of my own ventures. But, waking up at 4am and going to sleep at midnight is starting to catch up with me. 

About 2 years ago, I set a goal to get a job within a company I really admired. I found an entry level position, and applied. They mentioned how I was over qualified, and I explained to them my goal to grow into my dream position within their company. They gave me a job. After being in this position for 3 months, I applied for a job at their HQ, and they promoted me to a corporate position. I was ecstatic. I had actually done what I set out to do. The only issue is, the pay is not great. In fact it’s horrible. Even worse, the job is very very hard and detail oriented, with long hours and the ability to manage up to 8-9 projects at once. But I love a challenge so I’ve been giving it 100% for the last 3 months. For context, I had no experience in this role before this, so I feel good that in 3 months I’ve already begun to take control and ownership of certain key parts of this position. Im always the first one in the office, and look for extra areas to add value. I think my coworkers like me, however my boss is a very detail oriented and extremely hard working person. He expects a lot out of me, so only being 3 months in, I sometimes get discouraged.  He’s nice and when we are out of work or doing team bonding stuff, he’s really likeable. But at the office I get the impression he is expecting way way too much of me, and doesn’t take into account the fact that A.) I’ve never done this before B.) Im literally only 3 months In and C.) he is naturally very talented at this job, so he doesn’t see why other people aren’t as good as him. He’s never rude, but on the flip side he’s never giving positive reinforcements or compliments. 

The other day, the landlord for my own company approached me and said it’s time to renew my lease. However they wanted me to resign a 5-7 year lease this time. Would my company stay afloat? I’m 99% sure. Would I be breaking sales records? No. Would I be burning the candle at both ends for the next 7 years? Absolutely. 

So I began doing the numbers, and the fact of the matter is I could not support my lifestyle solely based on the pay at my day job. I had a friend tell me that on paper I would easily be worth $125,000/year which would more than support my lifestyle. I’d have nights and weekends off for the first time in my adult life. So… I started applying. 

Wouldn’t you know it, I start receiving offers in the $125k range. But, I can tell these jobs are not fun. They seem dry and I have no personal interest in the products or services any of them offer. My current day job I love. Great culture, lots of perks, fun people…. But the pay is garbage and the work is currently very hard and strenuous.

In a perfect world, I’d get paid $125k to work my current day job. But I know life isn’t fair. So friends have said “you need to approach your boss and tell them about your situation. They might really like you, and be willing to give you a raise to keep you around.” Personally, I think that’s a bit of a risky think to do. Only 3 months into this new role that I certainly have not mastered yet, and ask for a substantial (20-30%) raise? I know in my business I wouldn’t do it. I might really like the person, but my bottom line is what’s most important; not someone’s lifestyle.

Still though, they say I should explain my situation to my boss and see what they say. 

I’ve considered finding contract work to supplement my pay so I can stay in my “dream job” but it’s surprisingly much harder to find freelance flex hour gigs than a $130k. It’s unfortunate, as just 1-2 flex contract freelance gigs would put me in a position where I could stay in my dream job and wait for an opportunity to get a raise and showcase my business acumen more.

On the other end, I have 1 organization that has offered me a folding a much easier task, for much more money, that wants an answer within 7-10 days. 

I’ve never been in this situation before. I hear people say money isn’t everything, but it is when you are trying to plan for a retirement at a reasonable age, and live in a somewhat expensive city. 

What do I do, and how do I approach it? Im honestly loosing sleep over this, and getting pretty distracted at work. Ideally I just want to stay at this company but unless they give me a drastic increase in pay or I find side work, I just don’t see it happening. Help!! 

Tl;Dr - I own a company, and have a full time day job. Because of this I have enough money to live comfortably. However I’m considering closing my company. My day job income is not enough on its own. So I’ve applied to find my market value and received offers almost double what I make, but at companies I’m not interested in. Do I approach my current job and tell them my situation and hope they give me a raise after only 3 months? Do I just take the higher paying job and suck it up? Is there another option I’m not considering here??

I work for a large investment company for almost 2 years now. The first year here was amazing with a hybrid work schedule and a good work life balance but 6 months ago, they demanded everyone to work in office 5 days a week and for an additional hour of work (with no additional compensation) . 

They recently did a wave of mass lay offs. Unfortunately my team got really small from it. My workload has just been increasing since my first year with no additional compensation.

Prior to these lay offs I’ve been asking for a raise since I hit my year mark. I’ve asked and requested formally with no luck. My managers got raises but I didn’t. My team praises me and always give me good feedback on my work stating I’m irreplaceable but compliments don’t pay bills. Recently I met with the main director and he pretty much told me not to expect a raise anytime soon.

I’ve spoken with people who got fired and they pretty much said they sign a severance with 3 months of pay + they do not disclose that you got fired.

19a9361,"Thinking about leaving my job after 7 months, it is not what I expected at all.","I started a new job in a hospital about 7 months ago after spending the previous 2 years in an occupational health and safety position. I have my B.S. in Public Health and have always wanted to work in a hospital because I love the environment, being somewhere people go to be healed. I took my job knowing that it was to get my foot in the door and told myself that I would do it for a year or 2 and then try to advance within the hospital. After 7 months I can't see myself making it through my first year in this role. My job is to respond to patient complaints, which was interesting at first because I get to hear about all of the inner workings of the hospital and help patients get answers/resolutions sometimes. But the longer I stay here the more I realize that I don't really do anything. It's basically just customer service, which I did for years through college and I don't want to do it anymore. I get yelled at by patients, share their complaints with the proper department and then call the patient back to let them know that their feedback was heard. I'm not in a clinical position so I can't discuss anything clinical with patients, which is really all they want to talk about, so I sound like an idiot on the phone because I don't really get to say anything beyond ""I'm sorry to hear that, I'll make sure I share that with the proper people."" I just have no control over anything and it's driving me crazy. Coming from previous jobs where I was constantly doing audits and was actively involved in decision making, I can't stand not having a say in anything and only acting as the middle-man. Knowing now what the role is really like, I think the hiring process was very misleading too. They made it sound like I would be in a compliance role, making sure the hospital abides by laws and follows regulations, but really the only aspect of that is that I make sure that I document the complaints. I feel like I need to move on but I also feel like 7 months is barely any time and nobody will want to hire me seeing that I just started this job. I've heard from some coworkers that the previous 2 people hired for my role both left in under a year too, so I know that I'm not the first to feel this way about the job. I would love to stay with the hospital and advance but there's not many openings for me to move to without taking a huge pay cut, which I can't afford.

19a8zwd,Business Analyst London -> NYC,"I am currently nurturing a multitude of aspirations and goals, some of which occasionally seem daunting due to their scope and scale. Originating from London, I am a 21-year-old student in the final year of my Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Analytics at the University of Westminster. I am on a promising trajectory to graduate with first-class honors. In my first year, I had the enriching opportunity to participate in the university's Working Cultures Programme, which facilitated a trip to Washington D.C. Alongside a group of fellow students, I was immersed in a week-long cultural exploration, interacting with alumni and various professionals based in the city, gaining invaluable insights from their experiences.

My academic journey further expanded in my second year through an exchange semester at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. There, I not only achieved a 4.0 GPA but also forged lifelong friendships and unforgettable memories. The profound impact of this experience led me to revisit Seton Hall and my peers a few months after completing my exchange program.

As I approach the conclusion of my final semester at Westminster, my ambition is to graduate with first-class honors and subsequently pursue an MBA in Business Analytics. I have applied to continue my studies at Seton Hall University, a decision influenced both by my previous positive experiences there and its advantageous proximity to New York City, where I aspire to establish my career post-graduation. I plan to seek on-campus employment at Seton Hall to assist with tuition expenses and aim to secure a work visa post-MBA, leveraging the STEM designation of my course for up to three years, with the ultimate goal of obtaining a permanent professional role.

Reflecting on my journey thus far, I am keen to hear your thoughts on the feasibility of my aspirations and any advice on strategies to ensure their realization.

For example he randomly just takes down social media content I approve just because he doesn't think it's okay for him which I did not appreciate Also he is always very opinionated if he happens to be in marketing calls with my CEO, he always want to do everything from Event marketing to everything and more like he is giving me orders We are both managers in our department it it seems more like he is my manager which he is not. I am feeling really inadequate and really angry. Recently he reached out to me to mention we haven't posted recently and I was aware about it. I am not sure what is discussion was with the CEO, now he has been told to take social media lead and the excuse was he had a social media marketing background and he needs to relief me if my work load.

19a8kyi,Seeking Career Suggestions,"Hello all! 

I have been working as an accountant for  the past five years, and I don't feel like it's quite the right fit for me. It's close, but I'd like to be in something that more closely aligns with my interests. 

I have five years of accounting experience split between public accounting and non-profit endowment accounting .

I have liked the following from my education and in my work:

* business law (no formal law experience - this is just from classes I took as an undergrad)
* taxes (oddly, I don't do this in my work). 
* teaching
* building financial models
* writing policies and procedures
* automating repetitive tasks (I currently do this with excel and VBA)

I place a high value on flexibility for my work both in terms of location and time of day I work. 

Does anyone know what career I can pursue that would allow me to do all of the above? Is it public accounting and I was just in the wrong side of it (outsourced accounting services)? I am open to going back to school for a graduate program.

19a70jh,"6 figures, work around 12 hours a month.","I took over an individual contributor ""management"" role from someone who retired and was able to automate nearly all of the responsibilities to 12 hours maximum work hours per month. Maybe one or 2 meetings a week, so legitimately open calendar almost all month. This was cool for a month or 2, but I'm going on 6 years and have no prospect of moving up(I do have the ambition to do so).

Besides the constant anxiety of someone realizing I do nothing all the time...I am soooooo bored. I filled my time the first 2 years by helping other areas in my division with projects. Enough times where my effort wasnt rewarded/others being rewarded for my work I stopped that. 

I have 3 side hustles that haven't bared much fruit, my hope was that I would be able to use my open time to grow side businesses, but just couldn't get them rolling. 

Now looking at roles, besides wanting to do something with my time, I just don't see the upside. As of now my take home is 130k + 10k from side stuff. Probably around 40 hours total per month in work effort. 

The roles I am looking at would most likely be at minimum 40 hours per week and would be in the 160-180 range.

19a6ftq,Should I be worried?,"Help! My boss keeps telling me I doubt myself…

I’m a young female professional with over five years experience in my field but over the last 6 months, my older male boss has been sharing his, in my view, unsolicited opinions about my personality in work. 

I know I perform well and I have also been told by peers and other senior management colleagues that I am competent, confident, and stand out as one of the best performers in my team.

However, over the last 6 months, my boss keeps telling me I have a tendency to self-doubt, tells me I “overthink” and I should “stop worrying”. This is new feedback that I have not experienced in my career so far and took me by surprise. 

For example, I recently declined a long-term project which would require me to work outside my usual hours. I was told by my boss I was “doubting my ability” to do the task at hand, that I was “more than capable” of doing it, and my “tendency to self-doubt” was the reason for my decision to decline. I responded to confirm that I was confident in my ability, but I simply didn’t have the availability to work the hours they needed to deliver the project. 

Another example, I was in a meeting where two colleagues were having a confrontational discussion about my work which I felt went too far.  Immediately after the call, my boss called me to discuss outcomes and next steps, during which I raised my concerns about the way the discussion had been handled by the other party. He told me that I was “over worrying” and that I had “done nothing wrong”, despite me not questioning whether I had been at fault during the conversation.

Comments like these now appear in nearly all of my limited interactions with my boss, despite working for them for over two years, often opening with “I know you worry” or “I know you doubt yourself but….” before asking me to do something.

I know I’m good at my job, I’m confident in my abilities, and self-doubt has never really been something I’ve struggled with, so I’m unsure where this perception has come from. He has also never raised concerns specifically about the quality of my work or suggested the traits he has applied to me are impacting my work.

After a chat with a close colleague who used to be managed by them, they’ve also had similar experiences. This has led me to become concerned  these comments may be even be being used in a more coercive way, to try and get me to work later, or to undermine my legitimate concerns about certain toxic situations I’ve witnessed in the workplace. I also sometimes feel these things are being said in a patronising manner because I’m the youngest member of the team. 

What do you think? Should I be concerned about my bosses comments? Or dismiss them? TIA for your advice.",Competitive-Soup9307,1,1.0,0,1705626341,2024-01-19 01:05:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19a6ftq/should_i_be_worried/,1,2024
19a626z,What would you do? Risk / Security,"I'm < 30, & relatively new to my role in a big tech company. I make $110k as a junior, most my colleagues make 150k - 200k & those at the very top 500k. Benefits are mediocre & there is no pension / stock program etc. The work is very fast paced, people drop like flies, people get fired, etc. 100% remote (which I like). Intense environment. No one has lasted at the company longer than 8 years or so. 

I have the option of swapping to a government role  which has near guaranteed job stability. I'd make the same salary starting out, but people cap around 170k. If I work there for 25-30 year I get 70% of my best 5 years as my retirement salary. Job will be less demanding, I'm fearful it may be dull. I have to go into office 1 or 2 times a week. But I won't have to job hop the rest of my life / die of stress and anxiety.

So here is my question, how do you weigh these options? 

Higher potential max salary, high risk of getting fired, high stress, make my own retirement VS lesser max salary, guaranteed job & pension, less stress. 

Feels like the latter is betting against myself, but maybe that's the smart thing to do when I have other goals ? Family / house / etc ?

19a5wjo,The clock has almost run out on my conversion,"My current company has a policy of starting all new employees as contract to hire. With the understanding that conversion is around the one year mark. Company policy is anyone not converted within 18 months is let go, and re-employment is blocked for 6 months. My one year mark came and went, there were discussions around my conversion and a job req was opened for my position. Well, there seems to have been some kind of changes in the upper echelons, hiring freezes, changes in budgets, etc., and things never moved forward. Now, I'm sitting here three weeks away from my 18 month mark and eminent unemployment. 

My manager is trying his hardest to work something out to keep me, and senior leadership keeps making noises about converting me at the last minute. But, I don't really hold out much hope. The newest option that was raised was converting me over to a managed service. This would get rid of the 18 month deadline, but it would pretty much guarantee I would never be able to convert over to a full time employee. There are a lot of benefits I would lose out on, as well as not being able to receive bonuses which make up a good portion of the compensation at my company (around 20%).  Even that option isn't set in stone.

I've told my company I'm going to be taking the next week off to look for other options. Which I think is understandable, and they were fine with it. After all, even my leadership isn't sure how this is going to play out. 

 I have little doubt I'll be able to find a new position, but I'd probably have to take a 10-30% pay cut. So my question for my dear r/careeradvice, should I move on to something more stable with less money, or, given the opportunity, should I stay with my current hot mess? Even with all of this going on, I still like my current company, and I don't like the idea of starting over, but man I don't need this stress.

I have 15 years of experience as a Producer and Editor in the video, television, and commercial space. With time spent working in the top level of the field in Los Angeles and now in Phoenix (admittedly it's not the same type of market as L.A.). 

Even though I've been doing a lot of Creative Direction and Directing over the past 3-4 years, while I was mainly freelancing, I'm now working at an agency where it seems like they want to keep me pigeon holed into a ""production role"" as a editor. The job title is technically Production Manager with some needs for editorial work as needed. I took the opportunity because I thought it would be a good transition into Creative Direction and Director. So I thought. 

It's been hardly a manager role. I've found myself doing more of the editorial work and having to answer to Creative Directors that hardly have the industry experience that I come with, don't really understand the dynamics, can't speak the language with creatives etc. It's like they want a button pushing monkey. I've worked too hard at my craft to be that. 

I suppose I'm feeling stuck. I'm an above average editor and producer, thanks to my time learning from some of the best editors and producers while in L.A. Yet, for whatever reason, I can't seem to break through the barrier. I'm not a jerk to people, I LOVE mentoring future professionals of the industry, I am dedicated to the creative process and the craft. However, I just can't seem to break through. 

Leading teams of creatives is my next phase of my career. I just can't figure out why, with my experience,  that I can't break through. I believe I have a lot to offer, I also believe that I have a high ceiling when it comes to being a Director or Creative Director. 

**How does one shift the perception of how leaders view you in order to break through to that next level? I suppose this could be for any industry. I'm really interested to know how to achieve this. I would love to hear suggestions, personal experiences, advice.**

However, my German is only at a B2 level and there's simply no way I can study an entire degree completely in German. So my options are limited but not 0. I can't go to UK, Netherlands or even the US because I have a weak passport and I come from am immigrant family, so we don't have much money. 

Luckily for me, Technical university Munich offers two bachelor's degrees that are taught in English, aerospace and information engineering (it's essentially computer science with a few business management modules). 

Here's where I can't decide: I love the aerospace field. It's growing, but not exponentially here in Germany. I always dreamt of working with rockets and airplanes. Hell, I even build small RC planes and fly them at the Tempelhof Feld in Summer. However with my passport, working in an aerospace industry will simply only remain a dream for some years. With that, my options will be moving to the automotive industry, which again I still am passionate for, because I also love working with anything related to engines. But the pay here isn't great for mechanical engineers, let alone for aerospace engineers. 

However, for software engineers, the industry usually pays more and are also greatly in demand. Thus, a degree in information engineering would be helpful. I don't hate or love software engineering. I am not necessarily passionate about it either. Despite that, I know it pays good money and I really want to help my parents out as well. 

I want to give them back for providing me the opportunities and sacrificing a lot of me.

19a32xh,Not Sure if I'm in the Right Field?,"i (25f) have been struggling with whether or not i'm in the right field.  
i recently quit my previous research job (verbally abusive boss and co-workers, lack of concern for patient safety, etc.) and moved to a bigger research hospital. i am in my third week of my new job, but am having doubts about the job and the field.  
i studied psychology in college, and dedicated most of my college years to courses and internships that would help prepare me for a phd program and its (very stressful) application process. however, i am worried that it has all been for nothing. the thought of entering a phd program was once exciting, but now feels like a waste of 6-7 years of my ""youth"" / life. i also don't want to put myself through the application process or begin a program (assuming i even get in?) only to confirm that i really don't find psychology exciting anymore.  
i guess i'm wondering how i know if i'm in the right field for myself? is work even supposed to be something that we enjoy day-to-day? if anyone has earned their phd (psychology or otherwise!), it would be great to hear if you feel as though it was worth your investment.

Luckily, I recently got a job. Doing just okay at it for now. I think I could be good at it. But, if I get laid off here, I have no idea where to go next or what to do.

19a2t05,Should I try for a new position after just starting a new position?,"Hey there! So a bit of context: I'm in a big software company and have been in the same team for the last 4 years working as a support with clients. I've recently been promoted to work with escalated cases within the same team. 
A bit over an year ago I tried to move to the engineering/development team, but due to lack of experience I didn't got in. 
This week the director of my office reached out to me and said that they're opening a position on the engineering team for Product Owner, and that he sees a great fit in this position for me. 
So the reason for this post is that I'm unsure if I should apply. In on hand, I'd be moving to the engineering team, I'd be closer to work as a software engineer (which is something that want for in the future), better pay (not that my current salary is bad) and looks better on the curriculum. On the other hand, I literally just got a promotion with a new boss, and wonder that if I don't get the Product Owner position and my current boss hear that I I barely joined his team and already applied to leave it, that it might get weird the relationship with him, or that he thinks that I took my recent promotion for granted or something like that.

19a1rdp,Need some help deciding?,"Hello. 

I just graduated from college with a bs in business focusing on finance. I have no experience. 

I’m currently debating between two jobs and would really like some advice

Option 1: 
Title: financial service rep
Background: it’s a financial company we’re I would get my financial licenses. I’d be taking calls helping clients with their accounts or answering any questions they may have. Its a program open to new grads. 
Pros: the company offers good benefits. 401k matching pto, dental, medical, etc (no sick though). There are opportunities to grow in the company and they tend to promote within if a position opens. Learn knowledge of the industry. Permanent job
Cons: it’s a call center job for a 1.5-2 yrs Mostly building up soft skills. Longer commute by 10 minutes (if there is no traffic). Not sure how the skills would be transferable. Half people seem to stay the full program others tend to leave the company around a year later. 

Option 2:
Title: Staff Accountant 
Background: small family owned company I would be learning how to do accounting duties such as journal entries, reconciliations, ad hoc reports, help prepare financial statements and stuff like that. 
Pros: a lot of more technical work involved and it’s not really customer focused. Good for experience. They also offer medical vision dental and sick leave. I’m not sure they offer 401k also closer commute 
Cons: it’d be a temp to hire position have to work through a staffing agency in the beginning. opportunities for career advancement in the company are kind of limited but they seem to encourage you take learn other areas if you’d like. Also its small it be like 3 other people in the department. 

In terms of compensation they’re very similar. 

Can any provide me any advice on what would be good for setting up the foundation of my career or would be good in the long run?

I am in a very very tough situation and I really
need your guidance. I was a 3rd year student in University of Aberdeen doing bachelors in
business management and information systems. My father lost his job and now I am leaving my degree halfway as I can't afford it and there is no scholarship or financial aid for international students. I am getting an undergraduate diploma of higher education (science) from the university based on my grade record from 1st and 2nd year. The places I might be moving to I know won't
accept a transfer student.

Thinking about starting bachelors all over again gives me intense anxiety. I am 20 years old right now and if I start from 1st year there will be 17 and 18 year old students exactly my younger sister’s age and that just makes me so anxious. I was always ahead of my age when it comes to studies and now I have to start over again. I can’t do this. I am getting an anxiety attack even thinking about it. Is there any other way rather than bachelors. I wanted to be an AI engineer. Are there certifications I can do instead of bachelors. I am going to be working on further building my programming skills. I am an intermediate level Python programmer, I am web developer using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Node.js and Express.js. I know quite a lot about SQL as well as Java. 

I am sorry If this post doesn’t make sense. I won’t be joining any university for about 6 months now as I don’t even know the confirmed place I will be settling in.

19a0j02,Unemployed with some management experience - seeking career advice,"Hello everybody!  
I was recently laid off from my job, and am soul searching for some new career paths. I'd appreciate any help with tips or guidance. A bit about my situation:  
  
I worked as a manager (contractor) for Google Ads for about 4 years, as a trainer, a team lead, and now a service delivery lead. I have experience with people management, and building up new projects from scratch (I helped build a project that then scaled to over 150 people). I've had 2 direct reports, and about 50 people I oversee quality standards and production standards for. The job itself was never technical - I never managed budgets, data analysis, etc. So, mainly I'd say my skills are communicating (I was the person of contact for client communication and training - my managers promoted me because of my excellent people skills), and day to day management.  
  
However, my company was SUPER underdeveloped. We were using Google Docs and sheets for everything, and the way we built up the new project is through no formal ""project management"" methods/documentation (e.g. no charters, issue logs, assumption logs, etc).  
  
I've been applying to project management/general management roles for a while now, but haven't gotten interest from any companies :(   


Do you have any other ideas what my skillset could be applicable for?

19a0fwf,Should I quit even tho I don’t hate my job?,"I work in customer support for a big finance company and I don’t think I hate the job or company itself but I feel horrible.

Let me explain. I’ve been at this role for a year and 3 months, the company is good, my manager is great and the benefits are good (except the pay, I live in a very expensive city in the US).
Every 2 months I become extremely mentally tired and irritable because of my job. I’m just doing what I’m doing now cause I don’t know what I want to do and I just stumbled upon it.
I miss my family incredibly (they live in a foreign country 13 hours away).
I notice how I feel mad most of the time, pick fights with my significant other and am in general mean because of my mood and I hate that about me.

I’m trying so hard to socialize with peers to move to a new position (which is expected in my role) but I can’t really decide where I want to go and to be quite honest all of this socializing is taking a toll on me. I’m aware we can’t get anywhere without knowing people but dear lord. (I make a point to say hi to literally everyone, speak to new people, ask to meet people coffee even people I barely know to learn about them and what they do). 
I’m not awkward or badly spoken, I hold myself well, I’m smart (one psychology bachelors and 2 masters, international business and international economics).

I’m sitting here having lunch thinking should I quit and find something else? Should I  wait maybe till the end of the year and quit to find something else? Should I suck it up the next 2 years so I can get my full 401k ?

I was offered the position of a marketing manager for an industry i have no experience in (industry experience is crucial) for my role and they were looking for someone with 5 years experience. Ive also never worked in B2B, and the environment and team structures are completely different , so while understanding the industry i also dont know how the teams work and how they integrate together. I took this job because it seemed like the better stepping stone between the two job offers i had and while at first i thought im incredibly unqualified for the role, maybe if given adequate training or information i’d be able to succeed on the job.

Turns out i take the job and i realize,
1. Theres nothing documented. There was someone in my role 7 months ago, and theres not a lot of information around processes, reporting, previous documents. 
2. My manager sits in the states while im in the EU. She openly admitted today that she wouldnt be able to train me since she doesnt know the day to day. 
3. There is someone who technically does my job but she also sits in the states and is really busy and said theyl help me get up to speed. The other counterpart of this person, who is a coworker - will explain something occasionally but only if i ask her questions. There is no training or shadowing. 
4. I have access to tools, but everytime i open up the tools i get overwhelmed because i dont know what i should be looking at/what to do with them. These tools are all brand new - they knew i dont have the expertise but i was hired and they dont even have a plan to get me trained up. 
5. I have asked to be included on projects so i can learn while figuring things out on my own but since its a job i dont have any experience in and with no training manual i feel like im filling in the blanks everyday. 

Im only a month in and i dont see this getting any better.

199zvaq,I feel lost on what to do next (quarter life crisis things) and feel like I’m rotting,"Hi, I (24 F), have found myself in a position where I barely have any work to do, and it’s making me anxious. It was great at first because my first job (in marketing) was high stress, low pay, and I had to deal with very toxic co-workers plus tons of microaggressions as one of the few minorities in the company. I fortunately got a new job before the job market went to shit, and I’m now at a consulting company that’s much bigger than my old one. However, I got on a project that barely has work, and most of the time I am twiddling my thumbs and waiting for things to come my way. I am doing dev work now (with dashboards and minimal coding) so it’s a lot less meetings than my first job. However, I’m worried that the project would have another budget cut and then I’ll get put on the bench but with no real impact or work I can show.

I’m not sure what I want to do. I think my old job was too toxic and this new job is too lax and big so I feel like I slipped through the cracks into this position. I make a bit more but I’m still technically entry level. I’m debating applying to grad school (maybe get an MBA) this year. I still qualify for early MBA programs which stress more on undergraduate stats than work experience, so I think I’d have a decent shot. It would help me learn more skills, and I’d hope it give me an idea of what I want to do. My college’s business school is for the last two years of college and that happened over Covid for me so I feel like I barely gained anything out of it. But it is an expensive decision to make.

It looks like it would be my ideal position, not to mention a $60k increase in salary. It would be life changing for our family. I'm 42, we have one child and my husband runs his own business.

I do love my current job but I cannot grow anymore at my current, small organization and am within the top $5k of my pay scale.

I have a vacation (non work related) this spring planned with two friends who I'm close to, but they are also my co-workers. We are planning a 20 day vacation to Europe. We have booked flights (thankfully with the ability to cancel at no charge) but no accommodation yet. If I get and accept the new job, I will likely not be able to take this vacation at all or at least not all of it (perhaps a week could be negotiated, but the job is my priority over the trip).

They have been looking at accomodations and wanting to book. I feel like I want to let them know about this potential opportunity so they book what's best for the 2 of them in case I can't go.

199xsmi,I feel a little stuck. Need help.,"At the moment, I am working a job that pays me well, but in exchange, causes my mental health to suffer a bit. I am in sales for context. I realized that a lot of my passion focuses on the environment and being responsible with my decisions. I love to compost, recycle things at their appropriate places, educate my wife who doesn't know a lot about these initiatives, really care about climate change, and interested in self-sustaining and eco-friendly solutions like solar power. I just want my next career to pay at least 100K. The issue is transitioning to something that requires more education which means I will have to pay money to do that. For example, I looked up an Environmental Engineer which seems to line up with my passion for the environment and air and creating solutions that help maintain it. However, I would probably need a masters at minimum if not another bachelor's degree with a masters to get there. I'd probably need to take some more math and science courses even though I have a BS already. I want to make good money and enjoy my career instead of doing a job just for the money and not enjoying it. I am an expecting father (June 2024) as well adding to the complexity of my situation.

What do you all think? Can I make this happen without going into too much debt?

The job I'm at currently and the new one I'm considering are not common. I like the idea of stability, even at a lower wage. I worry if I take it, I'll be starting over in a few years (at age 48). If I stay put, I worry, I could be restructured into a new role/department in 5 years. I think I'd still have a job at the company, it could just look differently. But, the safety of what I know I have is a lot to give up. Basically, I'm worried about it all!

199wjiq,"[29F] Seeking Career Advice for a Higher-Paying, Fulfilling Career Path","I'm at a crossroads in my career and life, and I'm seeking advice on transitioning to a higher-paying role that aligns with my strengths, interests, and the need to support my family under unique circumstances. I've had a series of changes in personal circumstances (and subsequently financial) over the past few years, including becoming a caregiver to two (relatively young) adult dependents with life-altering chronic disabilities that keep them from working. I'm currently juggling two jobs to make it work (Job 1 Primary - 75K, Job 2 Evening/Weekends - annualized \~25K = 100k pre-tax), which is unsustainable, and I'm aiming to consolidate into a single, more lucrative position that, with some upskilling and leveraging my transferable skills, can realistically pay \~$125k.  
Here's a snapshot of my background, preferences, and constraints:  
**Background:**  
Experience: I've held various administrative roles (front office administrator, office manager, executive assistant, coordinator, etc.) across different sectors: public (not a great fit), start-up (not a good match), and a large publicly held company (best experience so far, love large multi-nationals).  
Strengths: Strategic planning and implementation, board governance, project management, HR work, internal communications, and working with VIP clients and partners are my forte. I am a big-picture person with excellent social skills and a strong track record in performance reviews.  
Challenges: I find work involving finance or marketing less enjoyable.   
**Preferences:**  
Work Environment: I thrive in dynamic settings due to my ADHD and require a mix of meetings, independent tasks, and possibly offsite work and travel. Highly social settings suit me well, but prolonged mundane admin work really hampers my productivity and ability to produce high quality output.  
Company Size: Larger companies with clear promotional paths and opportunities to connect with other younger professionals are my preference. I derive a huge sense of professional satisfaction from working with other folks my age and at my speed.  
Flexibility: My responsibilities as a caregiver, with immediate family abroad, and religious observances not federally recognized as statutory holidays requires a career with some flexibility, ideally hybrid to limit my need for time off.  
**Constraints:**  
Location: I'm in a high-cost city and can't relocate soon. However, future mobility is on the table, so I'm looking for a somewhat location-neutral career with opportunities in most North American economic hubs.  
Financial: Supporting two dependents (not my biological children), I'm juggling two jobs plus pulling from savings regularly– it's not sustainable. Ideally, I need a career where I can earn \~125K, which will allow me to take care of my dependents while also prioritizing some of my own goals such as eventually moving into a larger home, having children etc.  
Education: Returning to school likely isn't realistic due to poor undergrad grades and constraints on time, finances, and admission likelihood. Very open minded to a certificate or self-guided upskilling via YouTube, Coursera etc.  
Some industries I’m interested in are the hospitality industry (hotels, airlines etc.), beauty and wellness, and real estate development (but not as an agent, extremely oversaturated where I'm located). I appreciate that higher-paying roles are more demanding, so I want to ensure I'm doing something I'm either interested in or to some degree predisposed to find some success in. Ideally, I'm looking for roles that generally maintain normal business hours with some flexibility for late evenings and work travel but are generally fixed to typical hours. Additionally, I'm conscious of the evolving job market and want to steer clear of roles likely to be automated away by AI in the near future, as I feel my current work is destined to be.

199ueyj,I need advice on my studies and career,"
For context, i am working in a whale watching company where I mostly do administrative work now but I am also a guide sometimes. Either I will be a guide here or I am gonna change to other company to be one. This is basically a dream job for me.
I took my bachelor degree in nature and heritage and after that I tried my master degrees in conservation biology. I say I tried because I never finished it. I finished all my classes but for 2 times I wasn't able to finish my master's dissertation. 
I know these are all excuses but I hate how biology circles, teachers, researchers, other students treat each other and me of course. I am not a biologist so it's almost like I don't know anything or I'm not worthy. This got me a lot of anxiety about it and since I started I always thought I would not be able to do it. And so I didn't. 
Now, I miss being busy and learning new things but I am afraid of going back into it. 
To do your masters you always have to envolve other people. At least a teacher to mentor you.
I know taking a master's would be a great thing for me but I'm not sure I want to try another time with the same university, same teachers and so on. Specially after already failing 2 times. 
Where I live now there's another university with  the master degree of applied biology. And there's  another one that got my attention too in linguistics ( I used to translate stuff just for fun). 
So I'm thinking should I simply get over it and finish the masters I already started or should I change to another one in biology? Even though, I always think it won't get me anywhere since I'm not a "" real"" biologist.
Or should I risk and go into other one I feel interested in that might even give me another career?
Or even, should I take another bachelor degree? I would like thay but it feels like walking backwards and also it's 3 years. I'm gonna be 29 soon, I kinda feel old to go into another bachelor's degree.
What do you think? Any advice is much appreciated, I feel lost!",kallipso9,1,1.0,0,1705596178,2024-01-18 16:42:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/199ueyj/i_need_advice_on_my_studies_and_career/,1,2024
199tzdi,"[U.S.A. | Citizen ] Machine Learning Masters Dropout (Have CompEng Degree), how can I Jump Start a Career after a Hell of a Year? (Willing to look outside of tech, relocate anywhere if necessary, and have proactively been doing so)","## 🧔🏽‍♂️ Profile

Morning, I hope everyone is well.

### 1️⃣ Who am I as a professional (i.e., engineer, developer, salesperson)?

In brief, I am a former graduate student (U.S. Citizen) at a University of California (T15 university) who had to withdraw from my studies for a _M.S. in Machine Learning & Data Science_ (**Dec 2022**) to oversee the hospice of my uncle, and then take to family matters after close death of my father. It’s been rough, but I will be damned if I am going to mope about and despair.  **Not** looking to vent, b*tch, or beg for sympathy, just seeking any/all tangible advice in moving forward.

Currently, I’m 100% focused on tailoring my résumé to be as exceptional as possible. I graduated in **June 2022** with a _B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering_ major (from the same institution as my graduate work), and I am currently targeting backend/data engineering/full-stack software engineering positions _ideally_ focused with the .NET ecosystem.

However, since my last termination from my contracting role in **May 2023** (8 months currently unemployed), I have been through a ringer with this tech job market. And with current trends for junior level employment (or people starting out in this industry), at least for the foreseeable year, I am planning for alternative careers.  I’m making it to the final rounds, but I’m falling short, compared to other candidates. I’m past the point of saving face with the recent termination of my role and have been aggressively approaching my network, calling local public work agencies, hitting the pavement to be in person at temp worker agencies, and fortunately have been slowly getting referrals. Nonetheless, I am still hitting a wall in my final interviews stages and not able to secure an offer. Or, I secure an offer which is immediately rescinded due to reduced headcount. 🙃

> I am continuing to pursue this tech-oriented career, but if I don’t get any bits by **June 2024**, I have **no hesitation** to **pivot** and find my fortune in opportunities laying elsewhere. Since December 2023, I have been actively planning in doing so. 
> _Just because the tech sector is in a slump does **not** mean I am going to let it dictate the rest of my career or livelihood_

As of now, I have secured a receptionist position at a hotel via a temporary agency alongside working odd construction labor jobs throughout my area to get me out of the house and still have some semblance of income. In the meantime, while I hone my skills for a tech (or tech adjacent) job, I have been exploring opportunities in bluer collar (less high finance or tech) industries to develop _**a**_ **career**, ideally utilizing my electrical and computer experience.

(Refer to 2️⃣ to see further details on roles I am targeting)    

#### **Quick summary of profile:**
    
- Graduated with a _B.S. Electrical & Computer Engineering_ in  **Jun 2022**        
- Took graduate coursework for a _M.S. Machine Learning & Data Science_ up to **Dec 2022**  
- U.S. Natural born Citizen (_no sponsorship, visa, etc. required_), Male, 25 years old
- x1 internships, x1 graduate fellowship/TA, x2 research positions
- Had a contract (_**Business Intelligence Engineer**_) position which terminated
- Currently residing in the SF Bay Area, but open to relocation (at my own expense) _**anywhere**_ throughout the United States of America. 
    - I should note that I am **not** just targeting major cities, but everywhere: rural, urban, etc. Moreover, although I am located in the SF Bay Area, I am focusing primarily on the Midwest (Michigan, Ohio, Idaho, etc.)
- **No** criminal record, or any other marks on my history.
- **No** medical illness, anxiety, issues, depression, etc. (i.e., more than happy to work in front facing roles as needed)
- **No** outstanding credit or college debt (thank you California Community College system)

### 2️⃣ Type of roles I’ve been looking for...

Currently, I am applying to the following roles/position titles. As you can see, I have broadly categorized them into two categories...

| Tech oriented position                        | Not tech oriented position  |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Software Developer (Primarily the .NET Stack) | Signal Technician (Rail)    |
| Backend Developer                             | Service Technician          |
| Data Engineer                                 | Line worker                 |
| Database Administration                       | Utility Operator            |
| Business Intelligence Engineer                | Waste & Sewage Maintenance  |
| Data Analayst                                 | Supply Chain System Analyst |
| System Administration                         | Procurement                 |
| Help Desk                                     | Electrician/Maybe Oilfields

I do _not_ at all care how dirty or rugged the job is, or even where I start (outside or inside), behind a computer or talking to people. My only concern is for their to be major room to grow and advance (i.e., not cap out early).

If anyone has any advice or insight where I can better utilize my skillset or find opportunity, please let me know. Will be responsive as best I can throughout the day.

199tap4,Do you think it's fair to say that working at a job is a bunch of nonsense a lot of the time?,"What I mean is that there's a bunch of stuff at work that doesn't make sense, is unfair, and/or is a bad use of time.

Examples of what I mean:

- an employee is scheduled to work 40 hours per week but they're either given too much or too little work

- people in high level positions don't seem like good leaders sometimes 

- employees are given tasks sometimes that don't seem like a good fit for them 

- there's deadlines for things that are due that are too early for enough work to be done

- employees aren't given good training 

- people can be blamed for things even though it's truly not their fault

199svdg,How can one to make a career shift from manufacturing operations to consulting?,"Hey everyone, so I'm a 28 year old electrical/automation engineer working in an FMCG manufacturing plant, looking to make a career shift into consulting. Why I've chosen consulting specifically is because it would allow me to build on the experience and skills I already have, whereas pivoting into tech (second option, as I've dabbled in programming and web development on and off) might set me back in terms of salary and seniority. The problem is, I haven't the faintest idea of how to get there, and I'm hoping someone here could shed some light on what steps I can take to get there.

To expand a bit on why I want to make this shift, put simply, is I feel that my current role doesn't allow me to fully utilize my capabilities. My current role is technical, with bits of management and planning mixed in, mainly covering four duties (further explained in the next paragraph). However, I've always had an interest for the business side of things, and some of the courses I performed best in back in uni were those that involved business case studies and engineering-backed policy writing. That being said, there's still a lot for me to learn, especially in a real-world scenario, hence why I'd like to break into something else that's more business and strategy focused.

My current job scope includes: 1) Troubleshooting - root cause analysis, immediate and preventive action plan implementation, 2) Planning maintenance tasks, including sourcing of maintenance spares and services when required, 3) Implementing improvement projects for energy/maintenance cost improvement, and 4) Managing my team of technicians, in terms of their daily job tasks and also welfare ie. leaves, claims, grievances. A large part of number 3 involves IR4.0 (digitalization), and I know that's an area a lot of industries are pushing for (and hiring consultants to advise on). My thought process is that there'd definitely be a role in a consulting company for someone with my set of skills.

But yeah, not the faintest idea how I'd actually start the transition, besides updating my resume and applying for vacancies. My main questions are:

1. Are there any communities or resources I could use to prepare myself to work in consulting? I'm not sure if it would be a good idea to read through some case studies, for example. More importantly, a community in which I could find a mentor would be great
2. For those who've gone through a similar transition, what can I do now in my current job to build my portfolio and skillset that would make me a more desirable candidate? Meaning, are there any parts of my job that I could focus on?

Thanks for taking the time to read, looking forward to your responses!",repsillon,1,1.0,0,1705592173,2024-01-18 15:36:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/199svdg/how_can_one_to_make_a_career_shift_from/,1,2024
199sj86,What job would utilize my skills best?,"Do to circumstances and childhood trauma I’ve ended up as a pharmacist for the last 16 years. I hate it. It’s so boring, tedious, repetitive. 

I’d like to explore what other careers or positions I’d be a good fit for or would utilize my various skills best.

Academically I’ve got a BA in Chemistry and a Doctorate of Pharmacy. I worked as en elementary teacher for 2 years during the pandemic and loved it. I also have a certificate of general programming and database management. 

Outside of formal school I have skills developed in 3D printing, electronics (including soldering and microcontroller firmware development). I’m talented at woodworking, precision machine tooling, robotics / animatronics, and basically anything technology related. I enjoy both intellectual and physical complex problem solving / puzzles. Data is my best friend and I can quickly see patterns in data that others cannot. In one of my past positions I noticed an error in productivity reporting that was undercutting dept productivity by 20%.

I’ve taught myself php, MySQL, and XML. I’ve used C++ in school as well as Python which has been further developed outside of school. 

Anything that I a, missing I can easily learn very quickly. Especially talented at being given a goal and due date and getting there on my own. 

So please, what fields, careers, or positions would I find a better fit, even if it would take some work to get there (ie additional projects, courses, etc..)

199rd76,Need Advice on Dealing with Aggressive Team Leader & Probationary Stress in New IT Job,"Hello!  
  
I would appreciate advice for my current situation. I have recently been hired by an IT company in Vietnam and am currently on a probationary period. The terms of my contract state that I must pay $1300 if I am terminated, whether it is by my own decision or by the employer's decision.  
  
My current issue revolves around the aggressive behavior of my team leader. This behavior started in the second week of my employment when she began to insult me. It all began on the day she expressed discomfort in speaking English. She is Vietnamese and, like many Vietnamese people, has a strong accent. Vietnamese pronunciation can be challenging, as they tend to skip over half of each word, making it difficult to understand. After listening to her for just one minute, it becomes challenging to grasp her ideas. Consequently, I often find myself saying, ""I don't understand, please repeat.""  
  
Following this incident, my team leader began insulting me and looking for reasons to discredit my work. I put in a lot of effort and dedicate all 8 hours of my workday to achieving results. However, she ignores my efforts and the results I produce, seemingly unaware of my contributions. This unfriendly environment has caused me significant stress, diverting my attention away from my tasks to focus on protecting myself. She assigns me tasks and then, after some time, decides to do them herself, leading to a waste of my time and a lack of progress on my part.  
  
In response to this situation, I started documenting all of my work on Confluence every day to maintain a record of what I have accomplished. This came in handy when she sent an email to several people, claiming I had spent 14 days on a task with minimal results. I corrected her, referencing my daily work log, which showed that I had only spent 5 days on that task.  
  
It is clear that her behavior is explicit aggression, causing my hands to shake, distracting my attention, and significantly affecting my productivity and concentration. She has also started setting very short deadlines for tasks.  
  
In this hostile work environment, I am concerned about the possibility of being fired and having to pay the $1300 penalty. I don't understand why they hired me only to consider terminating me after just one week. She have been in my interview...  
  
I have attempted to establish a friendly relationship with her by addressing the issue directly, but it is challenging when she continues to behave like an enemy. Can you please advise me on what steps I should take in this situation, especially considering it is only my first month in the company?",No-Act-2364,1,1.0,4,1705588086,2024-01-18 14:28:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/199rd76/need_advice_on_dealing_with_aggressive_team/,1,2024
199r9jc,"Accounting or Web Development, which is a better career that I can perhaps self-study?","I'm 20 with no experience or degree and I want to start a career in either Accounting or Web Dev in the UK.  
  
For Accounting I was thinking of taking an AAT course or ACCA course. For web dev either some sort of boot camp or go the self-study route and follow guides given by others online such as Learn to Code for free by Zero to Mastery (this being just one example as I saw many other resources that can help such as Freecodecamp, The Odin Project and even other suggestions given in other Reddit posts).  
  
I want to aim to get a starting job in one of these careers in 6-12 months if possible. I know it will be very very challenging but I am willing to take the risk as I currently don't have much to lose. Uni degree is still an option but a more difficult one due to my A Level results making it harder to get into a Cs or Accounting degree.  
  
I worked in construction for the past year and will stop working for now and focus on one of these careers full time and hope that I can secure a job in the near future and work my way up over time.  
  
I am willing to try my best in either with the hope that I can be employed one day in either career.

199q5um,[Advice] How to not sound smart and attract attention to get more work,"Hey all,

This is quite unique topic so I dont know if someone has already have been in similar situation.

First I want to set the context so buckle up for lengthy reading.  
I have been working in a company for 2 years with 4 y of total exp. I have quite strict work ethic or more like workaholic behaviour since the first job. Thanks to having strict parents, that I try to go out of my way to work extra hard, extra work hours to get the validation and assurance I didn't get in childhood.

After 1st year in current job, I did get good appreciation and decent hike. Next year I tried harder, good hike and little extra monetary bonus. It was better than everyone, thats what reporting superior said and I also confirmed with other colleagues who said it was certainly higher than anyone they have seen. 

Even though my team had 4-5 members, I was only one trying to work with others to make sure project tasks gets completed on time and also try to be part of every meeting/communication. So I kind of become the SPOC person of the whole project, handling multiple systems with others. Like jack of all trades. Which is good, but it wears your stamina quite quickly because for any problem, they know I can probably identify and solve it, or delegate it/research it and fix it. And also have to attend all the meetings. I know this is my own doing to sound smart in front of everyone. Although its just my behaviour which I cant control. Superior is supportive but I try to work extra hard for my own ambition/ego i guess. No one to compete but myself. 

Now I am working with new people but same reporting superior. My superior knows my skills technical as well as communication and also the length I can go to get things done quickly.

But I have burned out, I dont have anymore stamina, other than sudden spark of excitement which happens like once a week. And have developed multiple health issues(the biggest one migraine due to poor health and overworking myself). I am going to doctor every 2 weeks discovering new diseases I have developed in past few years and now symptoms are being quite severe. Not life threatening but I cant continue to work like before.

The advice I need is, I am working with new people, who dont have any idea about my potential. Due to my past experience in similar project, I become part of new team. But this time I dont want to go all out and burn myself again, I want to just work in background, and only help when needed and complete tasks and go home and rest, take care of my health. Its been only 2 weeks or so, and I can see myself trying to outsmart others because of the knowledge and critical thinking I have to analyze things quickly.

&#x200B;

Advice Question:

So how to become the average employee and dont attract attention to overload oneself to get more tasks or being involved in others tasks, even though you could help them in completing it earlier.  

Any tricks or suggestions are welcomed. If you have any good resource I can read, that is also fine for me. Although I would appreciate if you could give advice personalised for me.

Thank you

Note: I am no more interested in hike or good rating since it doesnt matter for me anymore, mere 5% different in me and average employee isnt huge diff anyway. I am earning well enough for my age. No risk of layoff if luck continues.

I am a mom of 2 and I have the option to start a course to change career, happy to pay and don't mind if it is a year or bit more maybe start working while learning or seeking a good apprenticeship opportunity.
A bit of my situation and possibleties to have a picture. 
I have more than 15 years of customer service experience from being a receptionist to being a contact lens consultant/teacher in the UK.
I am determined to leave this area of work.
I am looking at online studying, learning as I can only do this when kids are in bed, so looking at about 10 hours/week for this.
I went through loads of other similar posts here on Reddit and many suggests using free stuff, free courses, YouTube and so on. 
My goal is to find a good online learning provider and start working on an entry level.
Interestwise I am looking at manual testing, software testing (apologies if it is the same). I started to watch a course on skillshare about this to get a taste but I welcome anyone's experience of this field.
I also found cyber security and interesting thing to do, but again I would need someone's insight as all I got is Facebook and Instagram feeds advertising these courses because I happened to search for it in the past lol.
Because of my customers service experience I was also thinking about HR, which I know is a big area as well and I might be able to ""convert"" to that profession a bit more easily but I read quite a mix of comments from all over the net regarding this. Good choice? Bad choice? If I would choose this I would definitely aim to Learning and developemnt I think.
I did many skill assignments and the 2 big job groups I was narrowed down were IT and Education and Training which doesn't really helps me and even I had a chat with the National carrier service but I am back at square 1.
I got a degree in Teaching in primary school from a different country, done a short massage course even but Covid put to an end to it, and unfortunately not my desire any more. Also done a free Level 2 Business admin through a known college in the town I live.
I asked friends, family former colleagues as they know me from different perspectives what they think, and what they see what might be a considerable route to go down to and now I decided I try this platform because someone might have an idea what I never thought of which might work.
Don't worry I am not asking anyone to tell me what to do, just gathering information and ideas as I want to make a well thought decision.
I am grateful if read my novel 😅 and decided to comment.

I’m currently working in HR and I just finished a 4 years business degree with one year of full time work in the middle of it, I’m 22 years old and still live at home. 

The issue is that I hate my current job and I really don’t enjoy HR or the corporate environment I don’t find it fulfilling but I dont see it as a comfortable way to live my life.

I can get an apprenticeship with a local company who does exactly this. My other issue is that I’m worried this is a dumb idea as I’d be paid apprenticeship wages ($21 au an hour) and would mean buying a house and moving out of home would be delayed and traveling overseas is off the table for some years.

I've communicated plenty with them and offered as much support, as possible, including a concrete plan of what needs to be done. A clear agreement was made. The work isn't even hard - all I require is that someone shows a sense of teamwork and does their fair share of work.

Yet, despite the handful of chances I've given them, they've either dodged my question whenever I asked them if they had their deliverables ready, missed meetings, and/or just hasn't done shit, to be frank.

I don't know what the right choice to make is. Bring this up to my manager, in which 1) the situation will be brought to light and their career is on the line, yet I risk my reputation; or 2) pick up their slack (which goes against my own values). 

With option 2, I have firsthand experience of seeing what happens when a coworker blatantly slacks off, yet no consequences follow. The rest of the team suffers and morale goes down. 

And in option 1, it feels like it could backfire on me.

Unfortunately, a colleague who is supervising some of my projects (this colleague is under my boss), has been putting pressure on me to get things done as quickly as possible. My boss and other colleagues have had issues with this person pressuring others to work without boundaries.

199kk35,What to do?,"Trying to make the most difficult career choice I’ve ever made. I have over 10 years consulting experience in construction. The last time I moved jobs was 7 years ago. I really like my current company but there was an 18 month period where I got fucked around. And so I feel like my progression is behind. 

I have been offered a job at a tech giant on their construction consulting side. I’m not crazy about the work but the benefits packages and comp trumps my current job. It’ll be 215k cash this year vs my current salary of 175k plus 10% bonus. 

My current position has finally come good. I am working with a great client and I can see the progression to the next level which would put me at 230k salary. This would take 1-2 years to achieve. It should take one but recent experience tells me it’ll take 2. It all depends on my ability to grow the account but even if I bring it the target revenue they could tell me to wait. 

I feel like it’s an amazing opportunity to build something and get the reward a bit later. With that said cash in hand now would be so helpful as I am in a HCOL area and my wife is in grad school. 

What would yall do? Take the cash and run or try build something knowing there is a 50/50 chance you could do everything right and they still don’t give you the reward of a second promo in 13 months and 230k salary? 

If everything holds the tech giant still clears the 230+10% bonus in total comp but obviously guaranteed cash is always preferred.

199j9ru,Leaving grad school,"Graduated in 2022 (Canada) and immediately jumped into sales. Almost every company I worked for was a complete disaster and I began to hate cold calling and other forms of cold outreach. I decided to apply to grad school for a masters in management to switch into management consulting. I started my program about 2 weeks ago. The program is alright, it’s at a top Canadian business school but in terms of post grad gigs it’s hit or miss (most realistic outcome would be a Big4 or boutique consulting job). The program is 40k tuition and with additional expenses I’d have to take out a student line of credit of at least 30k. Over the weekend I got a call from a mentor of mine and was told one of his former colleagues was interested in hiring me for a senior inside sales role (no cold outreach). The compensation is very attractive (salary would be 20k more than what I was making pre grad school and the potential total comp would be over 6 figures). I’m not sure what to do. I can always go back to school (MBA in a few years) but I’m scared of going back into sales and failing/passing up on the optionality/exit opportunities in consulting.

Hello all, 

I (24M) have been a software engineer for the past one and half years after my undergraduate. 

In my office I met someone who was preparing for MBA. She got 4GPA, has done great deal of certifications and will probably land in one of the top tier colleges. She intends to go into private equity. 

For the past few months this is creating a FOMO in me and that I will not be as successful as someone who will choose finance over the coding job that I have right now. And I see all these online resources saying that it’s majorly possible to make $1M+/year in finance. 

Is it even possible in tech? 

I don’t have any preference over tech or finance as per say. I don’t particularly enjoy any one more than the other. 

PS I don’t have any qualifications like she has. I don’t have bad grades but not as flashy as hers.",thisistoughtothink,1,0.5,6,1705556151,2024-01-18 05:35:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/199ir1t/tech_or_finance_i_am_torn_between_this_now/,1,2024

199gf5e,Did I pick the wrong career path?,"Heads up -not sure if this is totally in the right thread. 

Basically I finished HS early and tested out with the CHSPE (basically GED) where I didn’t actually finish the math section and never got around to it. So technically a highschool dropout. I stopped hs so I could start working, and immediately got my ca real estate license. I worked as a RE assistant for a year, then moved across the state by myself at 18 where I continued working in the industry as an assistant for another two years. Almost two years ago I moved to Texas with my bf (now fiance) and started working in leasing before I realized I HATED that 9-5 and instead wanted to go for my texas real estate license and try to be an agent. I was always drawn to this career for the potential of a high salary and being my own boss. I’ve been at that for like 7 months now with only one sale from my father in law where my commission was only $2500. I work really hard and know the industry so well, but I’m close to calling it that this isn’t the right job for me. It’s also hard to find motivation since my fiancé makes really really good money and pays all our bills plus funds my life essentially, so it’s not like I have the stress every month to pay rent. Having a standard 9-5 in office sounds not ideal to me but not sure if I should just try a new career path or start a business or something. 

I should add I wish I would be satisfied just being a stay at home wife but I tried that for a few months and it was just not enough for me at all.

199gdiy,I need advice please 🙏,"I am having a difficult time at my job. So I started 3 years ago at a Cable Company. I am more of a network guy or cyber security type of guy. I enjoy my work but when I am at the shop with my co workers it feels toxic to me its very clique-y even though we ride solo when we do our jobs. I hardly ever get a call to see if I need a hand. So that's one thing. 

Recently I applied for an Inventory Control Specialist role. The recruiter said techs get first dibs on any open positions. So I did my interview. There were ME and two other techs. And one CSR (customer service representative). I did the interview and it went really good the manager told me I'd receive an email if I was chosen. Mind you this was days after Thanksgiving. 

So one day working my normal routine. I was working and one of the techs that was involved with the interviews had told me that the other tech got offered the job but that tech wouldn't take a pay cut. Then the one who informed me told me he had now gotten the offer when he found out his pay cut he told them no I am not gonna take the position. Then they skip over me (a tech) and went to the CSR guy he denied due to pay. So now I'm like it's gotta be me right? Nope. They hired someone from the outside. Okay that's number two! 

I now find out they hired this guy and that he was best buddies with a co worker here at the company. I also find out the manager of the inventory control is also good friends with someone in the company as well and this guy lied about me to her so I wouldn't get the position. How do I know? The guy who said the lies told another tech which when that tech found out how upset I was he told me what was going on. Of course a lot of he said she said but is this even legal? Like how would you guys deal with this I was completely snuffed out of the position. I don't understand how I would be able to prove this to anyone as I'm sure if I raised this to HR they wouldn't do anything anyways. Can I get advice on what I should do should I report this to someone high in the company I do not want to work for this company I have had nothing but good numbers such as being top 5 in the entire company so it doesn't make sense how a manager could go off of someone's word. I just don't get it I am depressed and the sad part js this  all took place around the holidays so when jts supposed to be a happy time of year I am just being knocked down after blow after blow.

I have wanted to say this for a couple years now but have never seemed to find the right place..  
I am currently a 23 year old Network Administrator and have 6 years of IT experience in multiple areas.  
Additionally, I have 6 certifications in the IT industry (2 AWS Certs , 1 Azure Cert, and 3 Microsoft Certs)  
I went to a 2 year college for Computer Networking from 2018-2020.During college, honestly I slacked off.. barely paying attention in networking classes etc, so basically my networking skills are bad and im always confus ed on ""deep networking"" talks (which is kind of embarassing with my title). Additionally, about the entire last year of my college studies were done remotely and half-way provided due to the beginning of COVID.  
  
Honestly, I have just never had a direct passion with Networking, I only do it because of how my journey in the IT industry has played out. 
I worked as a helpdesk tech for a bank in highschool (part time after school) and in college when I was home (4 years), graduated in 2020 and begin working as a helpdesk tech for another company for a year, left there and worked for an MSP for a year, and now am working my current job as a ""Network Administrator"" - which is really just a fancy term for what I do.Our senior network admin really does most of the networking - im too nervous to get involved due to my major lack in understanding of networking.  
  
As stated before, I really do not have a direct passion like I have seen other people in networking have for it... honestly.. I find it nerdy. (no disrespect).  

I do enjoy tech and find it interesting, but most people (from my personal experience) that I have worked with in networking are very much so not like me.  

I am a very outgoing and friendly guy and have rarely seen that in my coworkers.  

I feel like speaking to others is a natural God-Given ability of mine and I am not able to use it freely in this current networking world.  

I am currently studying the Network+\_ comptia cert in hopes to learn some networking, but I seriously find it agonizing to study because i do not believe I have any passion for this stuff.  

So, I come to you all today to ask - what would you do if you were in my shoes?  
Or what do you suggest I try doing?

199ep9h,Front-loaded and back-loaded careers,"Since reddit has many posts about how hard it is to find job in tech these days, how overcrowded the field is, how it's all doomed etc I decided to make this post, wanted to put together my thoughts on the front-loaded and back-loaded selection in careers.

So let's start with surgeons. Nobody ever says that becoming a surgeon is a quick way to get rich and everyone should just hop on this train. There are no surgeons who say ""well I have a BS in economics but I liked to cut people as a hobby, so I took some bootcamp on basic anatomy and here we go, I'm working as a surgeon now"".

Once you're a surgeon, you make lots of money and you don't really have super overcrowded competition - because all of that happened way earlier. It happened when people grinded to get into med school getting into colossal debt, then through residency working 70-80 hours per week for shitty pay for years, and many people either didn't even bother to apply or dropped off on the way.

But once you are a surgeon, finding a job paying over 500k a year isn't crazy hard. People who have only BS in biology don't compete for surgeon positions with you. People who attended bootcamp on anatomy don't compete with you.

Medicine has a front-loaded selection, you can't just randomly attempt to break into the field.

Now tech..is different. You can transition to this field from elsewhere, you can (or could, anyway) be self-taught coder, you don't need bar exams, and there are  software engineers making 600k or 900k a year total comp with only a bachelor degree - and sometimes without any degree.

And this creates and promotes this illusion that tech is fairly easy, aka ""just learn to code"".

------

But isn't the truth. The selection is absolutely there, it is just not as front-loaded. Instead people just can't get interview invites, fail interviews, get PIPs, burn-out and self-select out, crumble under pressure or get stuck at certain level or some company. People who try to get into this field _only for money_ without passion and abilities _will_ struggle, especially at the harder job market.



The top of the funnel is very wide - but it's gets more narrow rather quickly. At the top of it, there are layers of people competing for the entry level positions and complaining about how painful leetcode is.

But at the bottom of the funnel there are again people who don't have that much competition. A dude who is distinguished engineer at top tier company doesn't share the struggles of someone with 2YOE who applied to 100 positions and didn't get any reply.",Mediocre-Ebb9862,1,1.0,0,1705543633,2024-01-18 02:07:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/199ep9h/frontloaded_and_backloaded_careers/,1,2024

I like my job, but I don’t love aspects of it - specifically having to work with hospital leadership and physicians. Unfortunately, the highest paying roles in my career field is working in leadership, moving up to a director role, more meetings and of course dealing with more physicians. I’ve been looking to transition to healthcare data or find a clinical data analyst job but I have had no luck. I feel like I’ve hit a plateau with my life and career. A lot of other roles outside of leadership with my degree and certifications also doesn’t pay very well. Right now I can afford to live on my own and enjoy a few nice things. 

I’ve always had an interest in technology, coding, and systems. I’ve been debating for the past year whether or not I should apply to go back college in for software engineering. I had a very good gpa when I graduated from college and I graduated with many awards and honors. My only drawback is A) I owe less than $2000 in student loans currently at 23 which is a blessing. And B) A lot of self doubt about my own abilities, if I’m running out of time, and if this would be worth it. I keep hearing people say that you don’t need a software engineering degree or a computer science degree because you can just take a bootcamp, get a certification, and get hired. I also hear that the field is oversaturated. 

I don’t have anyone I can ask for guidance in this matter because I don’t think anyone truly believes this is something that I could accomplish. Any advice would be helpful! :)",caramel_thighhighs,1,1.0,0,1705542172,2024-01-18 01:42:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/199e6ja/debating_on_going_back_to_college_for_software/,1,2024

I don't have a real education, after having gone to a ruralish church basement school, then failing out of college 3x (20 years ago). Always had service jobs, then worked in a very small mfg company til that ended in a way I could write a hilariously sad dark comedy about, but where I did learn a thing or two from a few of the owners, who used to be execs in a worldwide company. Got hired at bigger mfg company, as a lowest level employee

199cuc8,Advice: Can't fulfill my job duties on time,"Originally posted on r/AmITheAsshole, removed for conflict with a business. 

Germany based, please take this into consideration before replying. On mobile, English isn't my first language, it's late, my eyes are starting to glitch, and I am typing this with my middle finger due to an injury, so please forgive typos. 

Tried to make it as concise as possible. 

Last week (2024/01/08), I got hired as a minimum wage worker in the food industry. My job duties are: 
- cleaning, drying, and putting away dishes, knives, and cooking boards
- cleaning the waste containers
- washing dishcloths and staff aprons
- sweeping and chlorine mopping the floor so it's following hygiene protocol
- closing production and storefront area

My contract only allows 43 hours per month, and I'm scheduled for 3,5 hour shifts on three days a week. The other three days (store is closed on Sundays), a different person with the same contract as me does the job. 

The problem is that due to inexperience, I cannot fulfill the duties on time and usually end up with 30-45 minutes overtime. Because of the legal finesse of my contract, the employer can only pay me 520€ a month with an hourly wage of 12€/hour. For anything beyond that, it's either OT pay or unpaid time off. If I get leave, the other staff will be forced to pick up my ""slack"", if the boss pays me, I'll get taxed on the (very low) income. 

I already got reprimanded for not doing the job properly, which was after my third day. I had a minor mental breakdown in the store and wasn't given instructions on how to properly close the store until my next shift (day four, 024/01/15). I also got injured on the clock on Tuesday (2024/01/16) and can't use my right hand properly. Trying to complete my usual workload would end in severe discomfort and a risk of further damage.

What am I supposed to do in this situation? Should I demand leave or shut up and risk getting my income taxed? Any help is appreciated! 

-----------------

Copy paste of my original post here: 

WIBTA for demanding compensation for overtime?

Obligatory: on mobile, English isn't my first language, **not** US based, TLDR at bottom. 

Last week, I (19nb) started working a 520€/month job at a butchery to earn a little extra money while studying. My scheduled time is 14hrs/week, currently 16-19:30 on my three scheduled days. The other three days, there's a different person doing my job. 

I cannot take on more hours because of legal reasons, so taking on more hours is out of the question. The minimum wage is 12€/hour and the employer pays exactly that. 

Problem: My duties are so complex that I can't do this in my allotted timeframe. I'm responsible for washing, drying, and rearranging dishes, closing down the production and back of store area, and cleaning floors and surfaces in the store to code standards. It's simply not possible for me to do it in 3,5 hours on my own, after closing. 

On my third day working there, I had a breakdown near the end of my shift and got reprimanded for not doing the job properly. I tried making it clear that I'm unable to do it without help, but got brushed off for being a wuss. 

Just yesterday, I got hurt while cleaning knives (on my dominant hand, which is going to make work extra difficult for the next few shifts), and couldn't complete my duties on time. Had to clock out 30 minutes late and was unable to clean the floors in the store. 

I told my roommate about my situation and she told me that the employer has to give me time off for my OT, which I'll probably accumulate before the end of the month, but I'd leave the other cleaner high and dry. 

TL;DR: I can't do my (objectively shitty) work duties in the timeframe I'm given. Bring compensated with unpaid leave would make me TA for the other person I'm sharing duties with because they have to pick up my slack. Boss is too cheap to hire another dishwasher and called me overly sensitive for breaking down on my third day. 

I'm doubting myself for my own behaviour and need an unbiased opinion. So, Reddit, WIBTA if I demanded compensation for my OT?

199cedx,Seeking advice: should I switch jobs?,"

This will be a bit long and I appreciate anyone taking the time to read. Have been a lurker, this is my first post here and just want to provide context. 

I have been at this company since the end of 2019, started in operations. Dec 2021 I switched to staff accountant. I was told by boss/cfo that i was real asset to team, and after my first year in accounting, 2023, they put me at $55K. March 2023 one of the managers left and I was promoted to “team lead”, at $64K in April 2023. The work itself is not too difficult as it is mostly billing but there are some other things I do like recs, entries and also work on one of the footnotes in the FS. I deal a lot with the account reps and customers. Since the manager and 2 interns left, we let go one other staff accountant and we have been outsourcing more to the Philippines, With no concrete/real plans to hire anyone locally (although we got a contractor in the fall, but cfo is basically saying their contract wont be renewed in March). They also let go basically an assistant controller in the fall. So i am basically leading a team of 2 locals, and 3 people in the Philippines. So part of my worry is that I will be eventually outsourced.

I was put on training for a managerial position and got bumped to $70K this year, but have not been promoted yet (basically said theyd like to wait a year for promotion, which is in April). They have always kept to their word and have been helpful and supportive of me, so i dont have reason to believe they wont promote/salary bump again, but who knows? If i do get it i could see it ranging from $75K to low $80’s. 

Work from home 3 days a week 40hrs a week (i put in at most 50 during month/quarter ends but not often), breakfast mondays (ranges from donuts to real breakfast), all the standard benefits and 401K match of a few percent. It can get stressful during work because i deal a lot with clients or sometimes team members aren’t as available so i pick up more workload, but it doesnt affect my life outside of work much.

I am just finishing up my last semester of class to be able to take the CPA, i plan on taking the first one before the end of Q2, my controller and cfo are aware and supportive, and looking to see if HR can help (but i doubt as ive asked before)

My dilemma is, my old manager recently reached out and said her new company is looking to hire and she put in good word for me. I would probably be in the same/similar position as she is now (not manager i dont think). I really enjoyed working with her and she was great, but i feel like i would just be working under her again. I just sent her my resume, and am expecting a call from their Hr soon. Ex-manager gave me basic expectations, $70’s salary range, 2-3 WFH (sounds like 2 lol), commute to office is about 20m vs current 30m. Insurance is a little more and the office isnt as nice. The company is private equity owned so she is a little afraid in a few years they will just sell the company (they have been on an acquisition spree and have like 12 more planned in the near future). The annual revenues are about the same, if not slightly less than my current employer. Potential for growth there and she said the work is less stressful and more accounting oriented that aligns more with my current pursuit of CPA, instead of mainly billing. Dont deal with clients much and just generally more lax.

My main fear is that in a year or 2, and once i have passed the cpa my current employer will just see me more as someone making too much for my role/ unnecessary, and not sure about room for growth, since the last CPA was let go after a year (assistant controller) and only the controller and CFO are CPAs now 

Any thoughts? 

Typing it out made it sound like i should just stay lol, but now i Dont know what to tell my ex manager or just what to think 

Im in the US, east coast, MCOL.

Edit for a little more context: I spend a lot of time answering client emails and rep emails about different billing things",Unclemonty11,1,1.0,0,1705537237,2024-01-18 00:20:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/199cedx/seeking_advice_should_i_switch_jobs/,1,2024
199ca2h,I need a vent and maybe advice (long post),"If this isn't the best sub, pls let me know so I can delete and re-post elsewhere. 

How to tell my manager that their management style is garbage? Long post incoming. Maybe some of you can relate. 

Long story short, I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown due to work. Our team consists of 5 smaller niche teams, all overseen by one manager. Our manager joined our team 2 years ago and most of us have been here years longer than that.

Their management style is that everyone should be cross trained and consistently do the work of the other roles on our team as needed (basically every day). Over cross-training is proven to be bad, and we are experiencing the consequences. Naturally this has progressed into all of us doing tasks that are not in our job descriptions, despite different job titles and pay ranges.  Our overall work area is chaotic in nature, but even more chaotic than it needs to be due to poor management on all levels.

I digress, this chaotic dynamic has turned our high-morale, cohesive and efficient team into quite the opposite. We have massive training gaps that aren't being addressed, we are short staffed, we are constantly being bombarded with reminders of the tasks that are behind, although everything is behind and we don't have time or support because there is 0 organization. We are all burnt out and work keeps piling up. 

The more senior staff on my team (our supervisor and myself included) have told our manager what has worked very well in the past and what we think should be done to fix the mess we are in. They ignore it and come up with some ""out of the box"" bandaid solution every time. There is little consultation with the people that actually do the work. These solutions aggravate our team every time. It's discussed and nothing changes. A few members of our team are close to mental breakdowns, I myself am on the verge of stress leave (my therapist is ready to pull the trigger on this). I'm tired of being undervalued, undermined and slapped in the face all for a peanut salary compared to the work that we do. 

I can't change jobs or be fired right now. I'm close to renewing my mortgage and my mortgage company has explicitly said I need stable employment and any changes anytime soon can fuck me over. 

Maybe I needed a vent, maybe I need a reality check and to be told to suck it up. But I'm at my wits end. I feel irritated and hostile at work, I cry during and after work and it's affecting my home life as well. I can't go higher up, and HR isn't your friend.",13beaks,1,1.0,0,1705536930,2024-01-18 00:15:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/199ca2h/i_need_a_vent_and_maybe_advice_long_post/,1,2024
199bqd3,"career/studies/gap year dilemma, help pretty please","Hello beautiful people! 

I really need advice for what to study/do after my Bc's. I study English language and Special education. I'm a passionate traveller, so I went abroad for 3 semesters and now I'm in my last year. In one of the semesters I studied psychology, then I did an internship where I worked as a special assistant to students with special needs and also tried teaching.

199at9a,"Seeking your perspective! Received 3 job offers - all great, but different! What to choose?","Hey fellas, 

I am seeking a career advice here :) 

I found myself in a position, when after months of job seeking, I’ve been offered 3 (completely different, but great) job opportunities. All seem to have both pros and cons. Hard to decide on one, as all seem great in certain aspects! 

Worth adding at the beginning, I am relatively young (a few years after finishing the uni) and don’t have loans, kids or other kinds of commitments yet that I would need to consider making this choice. My goal is to make some nice money, save up, maybe buy a place in a few years, but satisfaction with the job and career are crucial for me too. I also realize that we spend most of our day at work and am afraid to do a wrong decision here and I would end up hating what I do. 

It’s a tough decision for me and I am counting on your empathy here (please no hate comments!). They say - follow your gut, intuition and stuff, but it doesn’t really lead me anywhere to be honest. If some of you would like to share some personal perspective or even provide an advice on how to look at these, I would be extremely grateful! :)   


**TL;DR: it’s a choice between:**

A: KAM role in a great company where I could further pursue a career related to my language major  
B: a stable global company where I could further develop in the field I have been partially involved with for the past few years (marketing with elements of project management)   
C: start a career in IT with better money than two above + an opportunity to work remotely from basically anywhere in the world, which I would love as well!  
In case you’re interested in more detail, here goes a wordy explanation of each ;) Please note, the consideration points I added are more like thoughts or fears I have about each

  
Option A:

Company: One of the biggest companies of my country (the type of a one considered a pride to have it on your cv). Some people say it’s a great place to work for, some say opposite.

Position: account manager role for clients from the country which language I speak and majored in. 

Salary: 2400 EUR/month + some basic benefits

Location: It’s a hybrid position, but it would most probably require me to live in the city where company is located. The rent would eat up around 40% of the salary. This city is a nice place to live in these days and I also have some friends there, but I am not sure if I would move there right away.  
Worth to mention, I do have a house in my hometown (2 hours away) where I could stay for a year or so and save up the money I would spend for the rent in the city the company has the office, but I can’t imagine travelling to that work location more than once a week. It would be timely and exhausting in a long term to travel from another city. 

What to consider:

1. Does this position give me a chance to be hired somewhere else? Yes, many companies have KAMs in their structure, however I would be a KAM towards a specific B2B market niche. It seems to me, there isn’t another company in my country doing a similar business. I am afraid I could only grow my career inside this specific company and my competencies wouldn’t be as valued outside of it. If I wanted to change the company after a few years, I might need to change the type of role again.

2. Should I keep pursuing things related to my uni major/what I’ve been doing so far or perhaps it’s time to move to other things? For years now, I have been studied the language I mention in the option A. It was my university degree and since the graduation I have been always trying to push my career towards the environment of being involved with that country/culture/language. I have spent a several years living and working in that country too. This does not mean I have mastered the language to a near-native level, so if I took this job it would require a great effort from me + time to get used to using the language in that work scenario (vocab etc.). Knowing myself, I am a bit scared I would feel worse than team members in terms of the language skills, in addition to the usual “new job, new environment” stress, which may affect me mentally.   
So, on one side, I am not sure if I should keep pushing my career towards the environment of using that language. I sometimes wonder - if I gave that up earlier, perhaps I would already be successful in some other field where I am a better fit? (although I am not sure what that could be anyway!)  
On the other side, it’s quite an unique language and a skill to have and I have spent years pursuing that. Is it wise to just give it up?   


Option B:

Company: One of the Fortune 500 global companies. 

Position: specialist in their marketing department (so not a completely entry level, however it’s lower than my recent 2 roles somewhere else, which was also in marketing). Worth to mention, I was offered this role after being interviewed for other position. I didn’t have enough competencies for the role I was interviewing for, however they said they liked me and want to offer me this specialist thing first. They said this role they offer would be a great way for me to start and get to know the company and projects, so after some time I would be ready to be moved to other projects/roles

Salary: 2050EUR gross/month + lots of benefits (such as private healthcare, gym card, learning platform and more smaller benefits along the way)

Location: work from home anywhere within the borders of my country, with 1 day/month visiting their office (one of the big cities in my country) for meetings and catch ups. Worth to mention, I do have a house where I could stay and do the work, at least for the next year or so, so I would save on the rent.  


What to consider:

1. People stay there long term - From what I saw looking at Linkedin profiles of the employees there, many of them work there for years (some even decades!), so it looks like a great environment to work in and people stick to it for a long time. The people I talked with at this company all seem nice, positive and very happy working there. The only exception was my potential line manager, who didn’t talk as much during these calls (not sure why). 

2. The position I was offered doesn’t seem to be particularly interesting in terms of duties, however it was said to me that it can be a starting point for me in their company and after some time I could earn the chance to be moved to different position/project

3. If I would indeed be moved, it may help me to develop further my marketing and project coordination/management skills, which may make me more employable also outside of this company  


Option C:

Company: a global company, not as recognizable as two above, but still good

Role: an entry-level IT role, somehow related to customer service 

Salary: 3000 EUR (please note it’s a B2B contract. The amount I provide here is what remains after counting in all B2B related fees)

Type: remote from anywhere. I would definitely use it to travel, which I love to do.  


What to consider:

1. I am a bit concerned about my competencies here, as I do not have an engineering degree or certs. To make it clear - it’s not a requirement for the job and they offered me it believing I am more than capable to learn all the things related to this position. Plus, they value soft skills and determination more than “being the IT-person”. This will sound stupid... However, I cannot help but wonder whether that wouldn’t be a bit boring to me. I do like to crack problems etc, I am not a tech cripple or anything, but spending all day everyday on numbers, looking for bugs in the code… not sure if I will be able to do it in the long term. Anyone with similar experience here? 

2. Great sector to enter! No need to mention - it’s IT. Already large, but still growing sector of a future. There are opportunities for non-IT degree people (like me) as well, but it’s not that easy to get these for us, so perhaps it’s a great chance to get in?

3. It’s fully remote. I love flexibility and freedom. I could really use this opportunity to travel, which is one of my major hobbies!

4. Unlike the two positions above, this one is a B2B contract which means I would need to be bothered with some of the things related to owning a company. This also means I wouldn’t be paid or anyhow compensated if I want to take annual leave or get sick. These days I am just not getting paid.

5. My friend would be my teammate there. I was actually interviewed through his referral (as that’s the only way they hire tbh). My friend really wanted to help me get a job and once the positions opened in his company, he referred me (the A and B opportunities I mention above weren’t on the picture yet), so I agreed to try and it went fine. Anyway, I really value our friendship and he’s one of the closest people around me. However, I am a bit afraid working together may influence our relation in a negative way. I saw people working with their family members or in other way “shitting where they eat”, and I noticed it often doesn’t end up really well. Even if we never fight and we are both professional, I am scared it will somehow change the dynamic of our friendship.  
So, ok… wow! If you managed to at least skim all the above, then I am really grateful and honestly - kudos for patience ;) I tried to summarize the major points of each option without forgetting anything.

**If you have any advice to give, could give some fresh perspective or shed a light into something I might have missed, I would be very very grateful for your input!**

I recently reached my 1 year anniversary at my first post grad job. I work at a relatively large corporation based in northeast US. It’s been great so far, good benefits and good coworkers. Fully remote too. We have reviews every 6 months/every 2 quarters. My 1 year anniversary happened to fall in the same month that mid year reviews take place (January). So I had my review and I received positive feedback, but when I asked about a raise I was told that they don’t happen during mid year reviews in January, but they happen during performance reviews, which took place 4 months ago in September. And because I hadn’t yet reached 1 year, I wasn’t eligible for a raise. I was a bit confused, since both reviews follow the exact same protocol. I was told by my boss that she is also not the one that decides on raises, so she would ask her boss. her tone did not sound promising. 

I guess I want to know, is this normal? Would you stick it out for 9 more months in hopes of receiving a substantial raise? My boss also mentioned that last years raises were a bit minimal because of budget. I just don’t understand how there isn’t protocol in place for employees in my position, that dont start around September?

1997ihn,"I need a roadmap/guidance, I'm lost.","Hello everyone,  
I've been thinking about constructing this post for a long time. It's all about how my current state is.  
I live in Egypt, and as of writing this, 1 USD = 58.5 EGP in the black market (which is almost used for everything).  
I graduated in Pharmacy in 2020, I have tried tons of jobs:  
1. Working as a community pharmacist: My monthly salary was roughly $110, yep, you read that right, $110 per month for 8 hours a day, 6 days a week.  
2. Tutoring some pharmaceutical courses to Pharmacy students for about $95 per month  
3. Working for the governmental section for $90 per month,9 hours a day, 5 days a week  
4. And the salary goes on roughly the same for almost every single pharmacy-related field/job  
I searched for digital marketing (as a means of getting foreign currency) but I don't believe that's my thing. Also I had some passion about learning web development, but I always find more and more people saying that its market is getting extremely saturated. And I guess as a pharmacist I won't be able to keep up with the job market which contains well-educated computer science graduates.  
I'm unable to manage my financial life anymore, I'm drowned in debt. The funny thing is that I can't even afford paying a career/life coach to guide me. My dreams and goals are fading away, I'm just hopeless.  
I always think that every single field/job has better people than me (at least they learned it in their respective college), why would someone prefer me (out of the field) over them.  
So, what's your advice for this miserable situation? What can I do?

1997efk,Stuck between Civil and Mechanical Engineering,"I am in my final year of high school here in the UK and I am trying to decide what engineering degree is right for me. I am currently stuck between Civil and Mechanical but I can't decide which one I want more.  
 In regards with what I am good at and enjoy in school I would say I like maths especially the Calculus side of things. I also study Physics but I only enjoy the mechanics bit of it and not a big fan of electricity, waves and fields hence I am looking at Mechanical and Civil.   
I am not too certain in what job I want to do in the future so an engineering degree is very attractive as it opens so many doors for me. What I do know is that I want to have a Job that will allow me to travel and/or work from home. What I don't want is a office job that will have me trapped in a cubicle all day. I would also like to use my hands as much as possible and not only a computer. I know that everything I have listed will not be possible but if I could have some of those things it would make my life a lot better. Money isn't the priority for me as I know I will be relatively well with any Engineering degree but what I do want is for opportunities for me to progress and develop in whatever path I choose(maybe a project manager or management later down the line). The main thing however is both travel opportunities and the flexibility to work from home from time to time.  
Lastly, I have always been a fan of large structures like bridges and buildings but also in other infrastructure like dams, roads and airports so that's a part of civil I think I will like but I am worried that I will be quite limited to change a career path down the line in the case I wanted to where as from what I have heard, mechanical engineering graduates have the flexibility to move from very different industries within engineering but also have the possibility to leave engineering in general and go into a whole different career path like finance which is something that seems very attractive for a mechanical engineering degree right now as I am not sure I will want to do engineering forever. Also not to mention that mechanical engineering will likely be a more hands on job which I would like to do.  
 I am sorry for making this quite long but I am hoping that either some students or people that have one of those degrees will be able to help me with some of my questions and advice me what degree might be best for me.

19979hr,"Re-trading: good company, or bad company with more prospects?","Hi everyone,

I’m currently going through a period of change and trying to get into another industry (Arboriculture) as my current job isn’t doing it for me. Over the last few months I’ve been doing “trial periods” with various local firms seeing what they’re all like and I appear to be faced with two distinct options:

Go with a good, small, local company. The work is there and the teamwork/comraderie is amazing. They’re also very well run and all the staff are hard working, helpful, and great team players. That said; as they’re a small company they don’t have the funds to support my progression, and after a certain amount of progression I would need to move company/start my own as there simply isn’t the space in such a small team for “climbing the ladder”.

Or, I could join a larger company’s local team. Here, I have found the staff are lazy, unmotivated, and it seems this particular office is having somewhat of a staffing crisis. There seems to be a lot of “work place drama”, and I’d need to have quite thick skin to put up with my first 6 months there. I feel like it will be difficult not to clash here, as I am naturally hard working and want to get work done to a highest standard. There is also a distinct lack of low-level leadership and the bottom-step staff get away with murder. That said, as they are a large company with offices all over the country, there is plenty of funds and room for progression. The management there have offered to fund and support my training up to consultant level (at which point I’d join a different team altogether) which is rare for someone trying to break into the industry.

Has anyone been in such a position before and able to offer advice? Thanks",TheNextBigCrash,1,1.0,0,1705524417,2024-01-17 20:46:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19979hr/retrading_good_company_or_bad_company_with_more/,1,2024

19957k5,Reference question,"So I’m a recent graduate. My last career experience was interning for a federal agency.

I want to provide some background on my situation. I was recently fired from my position as a branch manager at a credit union. I made the very stupid mistake of processing a transaction for a family member without really thinking about it, and per the rules of the organization I was terminated once it was noticed. I didn't hide the transaction (reversed $10 in fees that were company error) as in the moment I was just processing it like I did for any other member and didn't remember the family policy. I added my notes, etc and it was all public and I didn't think anything of it. Regardless a few months later I was fired and cannot be rehired by them. My director, my chief and my regional all tried to get me approved for a 2nd chance with HR but were denied.

I've been job hunting for the past 2 months and the topic of why I was fired always comes up and at this point I feel that my career in the finance industry is pretty much gone. I don't know if it's that, perhaps my interview skills are bad or at this point I need to do a complete career change. 

I don't have a degree, only highschool GED. I have 2 years of management experience, 4 years total in banking, and 8+ years in customer service.

1993wci,Regret for Leaving Engineering Position at Dream Company,"I (30M) recently left my position at a large aircraft engine manufacturer where I was a mid-level materials engineer hired to work in a specific specialty but was not exactly employed in it. I worked within the department of my engineering specialization but focused on other areas and left because of this. It has since been over a month since I left, and I am a few weeks into my new position and have feelings of regret for leaving such a good company. Reason I left is because I felt like I never would get the opportunity to be the engineer I had envisioned myself there and what the job was described to me at onboarding. I had conversations with my manager about transforming my position for support to my specialization, but nothing matriculated after many months of discussing such. Any advice on if my thoughts about going to manager to ask for job back is worthwhile pursuing or if this is something that seems to be a dead end for me. I really enjoyed the company as a whole and was a dream scenario to work for but once onboarded, I wasn't really focusing on anything involving my background and what I went to school for.  
  
Looking for situation's others were in in this specific circumstance in working for a great company, but position wasn't so much as what was advertised or what you envisioned it to be. My current position seems ok, but I am debating on if I should have just stuck it out at previous company and waited for a potential transition of my job to what I had hoped it to be.  
  
Background info: worked at smaller aerospace organization for 5 years as a manufacturing engineer dealing with a specific manufacturing process and applied for a materials engineer position in the specialty at the company but came out to be support for many specializations and not really anything to do with mine. My manager and our department couldn't accommodate a transition of my position to the specialty because there was no need for it, but overall, the company was great besides the position.",beanman214,2,1.0,2,1705516422,2024-01-17 18:33:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1993wci/regret_for_leaving_engineering_position_at_dream/,1,2024

1993c6b,Should I make the switch again?,"I worked at a company as a marketing executive for 7 years reporting directly to the owner. Over time, he slowly mentally broke down I think a bad combination of personal mental health struggles and business stress. He turned into a very demanding, angry boss who would directly go off and tell off some of our most important clients off but I stayed loyal to him hoping this would pass and get better, unfortunately it only got worse. Over time we lost more than half the clients we had, which put higher and harder expectations on me to try to get more business but it's in a niche market.   


I soon got head hunted to another marketing position and decided to jump ship, when I got there I felt completely lied to about the job, company and the people by the recruiter and when I got there it was really awful and frankly a scary place to work. The owner and his son who I directly reported to were very corrupt, and were being investigated by the police because human remains were found on their property, they had class action law suits against them, multiple sexual harassment claims and acted very inappropriately to me personally while I was there. I called the recruiting company about my experiences to see if they could help me, they offered me a position to work for them instead.  


I felt stuck and like the manager convinced me to take a job, they said it was very lucrative but as new recruiter in a bad labor market with high expectations and quotas it hasn't been fun, my boss and the people are great and they feel safe here but the job itself is a career change for me that I didn't aspire or plan on doing. It's been less than 3 months as a recruiter but everyday I miss being in a marketing position.  


This past week I interviewed for a company as a marketing specialist and company offered me a position for about 5k lower than i'm currently making, they are a global food brand with about 1500 employees, the office space is beautiful, and a shorter commute.   


However I got some bad feelings from the CMO while I was there during the interview, honestly he seemed incredibly full of himself and condescending to the point where I felt that the interview went poorly and that they likely wouldn't hire me. When I told them my wage expectations they seemed disappointed? and like it was far too high for the role, I was sure I wouldn't get the job, but the next day they called and offered me the position.  


I frankly feel torn because on one hand it's in my field and the company itself seems great but I went online and looked at reviews and basically many people say that the CMO is a complete narcissist and needs to get let go and treats staff horribly and because of this there is high turnover. He wouldn't be the person I directly report to but the next level.  


There are hardly any other marketing jobs in this area that are available and pay a decent enough wage for me to be able to pay my bills, and it puts me in a consumer packaged goods market which is experienced I'd personally like to have. I can see how this position would put me back on track to work in marketing and could potentially help me grow more in this field in the long term but I'm struggling because of the 5k less and because of how the CMO acted.  


Should I take the position or stay on as a recruiter and keep looking?",OpenRepair4390,1,1.0,0,1705515094,2024-01-17 18:11:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1993c6b/should_i_make_the_switch_again/,1,2024

1992mki,Nurse trying to get into tech,"Hi Guys!

This post is a long-shot. Wondering if someone can relate and offer advice and insight. 

I’m a nurse in the Bay Area, I’m originally from Chicago. No, I didn’t move her to steal nursing jobs for higher pay, I actually moved here before I even finished nursing school because it’s where my family relocated. I mention this because, original in Chicago I told myself I’ll go back to FNP school, make a better living, etc.

Now being in the Bay, NP doesn’t make sense for me anymore. Not only does the pay not make sense, I don’t think I want that liability. Sure it could potentially open some doors, but I really don’t want to be at the bedside anyways.

I’ve been a Trauma med-surge RN for 1.5 years, and im transitioning into the ER this month. I wanted to get speciality experience just in case I somehow get stuck at the bedside- I at least wanted to be in a department I enjoyed. 

So, as I said, I don’t want to do bedside. I don’t think I have the interest of going back to school and doing NP or CRNA.  Bay Area Nursing kind of has golden hand-cuffs because the pay is what keeps most of us at the bedside. What im really interested in is moving into health technology. For example I’d love to work for 🍎 and work on their 🍎watch, for example. But that’s hard with 0 experience. I once got the opportunity but it was only a 13week contract and the pay was 40% less. I have my Masters in general nursing, I also work per diem in aesthetics doing laser hair removal and injections. (I’m an ambitious mess) 

Have any of you shifted into a more remote or tech role? How, what did you do? Any companies hiring RNs with experience like me?

To keep this short, I (37F) have been working at the same job for the past 3 years. It’s part time and low stress, the people are nice and I have no management breathing down my neck. I work independently and at my own pace. The only downside is there are no benefits and the pay is not enough. 

I started a search for a new job and got an offer relatively quickly. The pay is slightly higher ( about 20K more) but I would be working full time and potentially have a higher stress job and be more accountable to management also less work/life balance. This job includes benefits including a free education. 

After putting my 2 weeks notice in for my current job they offered me the same pay as the new job with benefits. I love my current job as stated only the pay had me considering leaving, but now they’ve increased the pay and I will still work less hours than the new job for the same pay and now benefits added.

I have a degree in electrical engineering and currently work in supply with installations. I'm unsure if supply is the career path I want to pursue in my life, but I know I want to continue with my graduation path. This week, my manager offered me an opportunity to kind of switch departments. I would still be in supply, but all my responsibilities would change, and I would focus more on innovation and market intelligence. Nothing would change on paper, except my duties. I have always been interested in development, something I enjoy doing, such as working with BI and systems. I believe I would excel in this new role and would like to explore a different area. However, I am concerned about my educational background. I graduated in electrical engineering, and I enjoy this field. I think such a change might distance me from my original field and could potentially harm my professional growth. It's a somewhat specific application within the company, a rather internal area, and if things don't work out, how do I present myself? I graduated in electrical engineering and worked with BI but didn't progress in my original field. How do I position myself in the job market afterward?
 On the other hand, my fear is not making a career switch and remaining stagnant.

19900nj,Skip study abroad to further my career?,"Hi there! 19M, currently completing a BA in English Lit and East Asian Studies, in my home city's university. Opted to stay at home for my degree, in order to keep my job at a relatively large regional radio station, as radio/TV broadcast is the industry which I intend to work in.

As you might guess, I have a notable interest in East Asian Culture, and chose this degree with the intention of spending an academic year studying in a university in Korea. I have always been slightly concerned about putting my job on hold for ~9 months, but figured the benefits of study abroad will outweigh this career break.

However, I have recently been offered a significant promotion in my job, with a very generous  pledge to help me develop the skills & experience necessary to move into a much larger role within the next 1-2 years.

My question: is this opportunity at my dream job worth skipping my intended study abroad? I don't believe that studying in Korea would help with career development - considering my lack of spoken Korean skills, and my inability to get a job there due to Visa conditions.

If study abroad is worth the experience - should I instead study in the next country over, with the intention of getting placement at one of our company's other regional stations?

198zy3u,I feel stuck?,"I’m stuck - or at least feel like I am. 

I currently work for a well known large tech company via an acquisition a number of months back. My position and base salary remained the same through the acquisition but I was granted a fair number of RSUs and will be paid out on options from the previous company.  All in all financially it’s been a benefit.

Now, I completely understand that I make good money and I’m aware of the financial struggles the past few years have caused for people - I’m very lucky and I don’t want this post to seem ungrateful for my position. 

Here’s the rub: my current salary is well above the market rate for my role due to the RSUs and stock option payouts factored in. My current job is essentially what I’ve been doing for the past 10+ years - I’m bored and it doesn’t interest me anymore and the likelihood of a more senior role opening with more responsibilities and challenges is slim at this point. Looking at other available roles I’m either not qualified to make the leap to the next level or the compensation is so low for a lateral move I’d have to take a hefty pay decrease to try something new.

The overarching issue is that I’m not convinced I want to even try something new in this field - I’m over it and I’m tired of working so someone else can reap the benefits.

What should I do? Suck it up and be complacent and be a 40-something in a 30-something type role - having my window of opportunity to move up dwindle over time? Take a chance on something new with a pay cut to the detriment of my young family? Go full quarter life crisis and try a business on my own?

They appear to provide great opportunities, but if we take a step towards our skill development, it gets ignored. No one has the willingness to help.

Recently my coworker came in to my office and politely accused me of not including her and taking credit for her work. Instances included a time where I worked on a project and she created a visual with the data that I found, and I didn’t copy her on the email to the client. I asked my boss how to go about delivering it and he said to just copy him on the email so that’s all I did.
 Another instance she specifically mentioned was a time when we were talking about an issue in a meeting and I was the one who brought it up publicly. I didn’t think I was taking her idea because we were both discussing it, and I made a point to say “we” but idk anymore. 
Finally she said that she was left out of emails and communications about a project. The reason she may feel that way is because the others on the project discussed it in person rather than through email, but she doesn’t typically eat lunch or anything with us, which is when those discussions happened. I realize that I could have written her an email about what we discussed but it was pretty inconsequential so I didn’t think it was necessary but I could be wrong.

My strengths are I am a people person and I am good at presentation and public speaking. In my life i attended 2 interviews and I got both jobs that explains my strength. I think I will do great with a MBA. But due to my current family situation, it's a big risk
What should I do now? Should I pause my career do a MBA or should I just go with the flow.

198xoe9,Throwing away my parents finance goals for a childhood dream,"For context, I (23F) left a pretty bad family situation in my hometown about four years ago. I came out to my family as gay and everything came crashing down. I was in college at the time locally and dropped out to move states in fear of my safety.
My parents always wanted me to make “enough” money to sustain myself. My dad was a beat cop and my mom stayed at home to homeschool me so I guess I understand. To the point, I had this childhood (from about 5-15) dream of massage therapy which I kind of tossed to the side. As I got older and developed as a person outside the household, I took an interest into yoga and meditation and all that hippie stuff. Still, I took a job in finance to try and support myself through college for my economics degree. I still haven’t gone back, it’s so hard to support myself out here by myself and finding the time, energy, and honestly the motivation to dive deeper into a career I’m afraid is killing me. There’s a massage school right across from our building I stare at sometimes. 
I feel really lost. I do want to finish a bachelors degree but I just don’t think I can at this time in my life.
Im considering enrolling into a local massage school for their evening program - since I can fit it into my current work schedule. I could keep my current job and work through the program. I feel like such a disappointment if I enroll though.
It’s always so scary to make a change in life.
I wish I could call my family.",Superchl0bot,2,1.0,2,1705501387,2024-01-17 14:23:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198xoe9/throwing_away_my_parents_finance_goals_for_a/,1,2024

I am considering doing a masters however a lot of institutions suggested that I should pursue their online program rather than leaving my job and going for a full time program. 
I am not sure if I will be able to manage my job with an online degree, and I think I lack the motivation to learn these skills on my own. I mean I do want to get into this domain, but sometimes when I get overwhelmed with work it affects my motivation.

198xb8s,I need some serious advice I don't know what to do with my life.,"""Jack of all trades, master of none."" This is something I would call myself. I'm 20 years old, I'm currently in the final semester of my college, my college would end in 4 months, and I don't know what to do next. I'm currently pursuing Economics Honours from Delhi University. I've come from a small town in Rajasthan to Delhi. Initially I wasn't really interested in economics when I joined, it grew onto me. I've always been interested into storytelling, I always wanted to write books and stories. After I came to the college, I joined the college's theatre club and filmmaking club, where I acted also and wrote and directed a play; and wrote and made shorts films. 
Now coming onto what I wanted to do with my life, I've always been confused. When I came to my third year, my 20 years old brain came up with a plan, which is basically a safe way with backups because I don't really come from that good of a financial background. I thought I should do Masters in Economics only, because I've started enjoying studing it, and it'll give me 2 more years in Delhi, which of course has much more opportunities than my hometown. So, I'll work hard to get into best college, either Delhi School of Economics or JNU, and in these 2 years along with studying, I'll make some more films, will try to network and see if I can get some opportunities, maybe go to Mumbai too after graduation if I find opportunities and then maybe get into film line. And if things didn't work out, as I said I don't have a strong financial background, I'll have to eventually earn, so, with the Masters degree from the best institution in India, I can do anything, I can prepare for IES, it has always fasinated me or get a job maybe, I mean, I'll have something and I won't be unemployed. This gives me another advantage, here in Delhi, I met a girl and we fell in love. Being in Delhi for 2 more years will give me a chance to be with my girlfriend as well rather than going back to my hometown. Don't get me wrong here, I've not planned this just because of her, she has of course influenced my decisions a bit but she ain't the only reason. I can't tell this to my parents they won't understand it now, so I'm writing it here. I'm alone in Delhi, I do have a few friends but they are not that close and my girlfriend has been there for me in times of difficulties and have loved me effortlessly, we see a future together and  want to be with each other, of course we both will and are working hard in our separate lives. So, this was my plan.

Now, I'll tell you about my problems. I come from a middle class family, studying in Delhi had been expensive. My father has supported me in my education and I'm forever grateful to him, if it was not for him I wouldn't be anywhere. But he's a bit strict though and he doesn't really communicate well, which leads to us getting into fights, he never told me what he wanted me to do after my degree, so when I told him that I want to pursue Masters (I did not tell him about my filmmaking plan because he clearly hates that), he said a MA from Delhi is pointless, he'd not let me do it, and Delhi is also expensive, he can't affort it anymore, and he'd rather make me do something else from my hometown only, and also he need to spend on my brother too, I tried to explain him and come on to a common ground but he wouldn't listen, and it lead to a fight. After that I tried to change my plans and reconsider, I understand studying in another city is expensive and I didn't want to burden my parents with it. I also realised my dad is not even in favor of masters and I can't be dependent on him, so I thought of college placements. Many students were getting placed and I wasn't even applying because I had a different plan all along. So, I thought of applying whenever a company comes, I applied in 2-3 but didn't get shortlisted for further rounds. So, around December my father and I had a talk and he said I can fill the form for Masters entrance exams, I was busy with my semester exam that time, by the end of december when the forms were open for the entrance (CUET), I double checked with my mum, if my dad is okay with me doing masters, she said okay, I didn't ask him directly because as I said, we often get into fights and I'm afraid of him. So, I filled the form and started preparing; it was my breaks after the exams, so I was at my hometown and my father came to me and out the blue asked me if I'll be still be doing Masters and I said yes, then he said that's bullshit, and I'm gonna destroy my career, masters is pointless and he never said yes for that. It ended up in a fight, I had a talk with mum regarding that later and she always wasn't talking properly either and said my dad is a bit disturbed with his job and everything and managing family finances. See, I have no problem with not doing Masters, I understand it's expensive and difficult for my dad since he's the only earning member of our family, and I'm also okay with working after college, but I need some clarity, since I only have 4 months, I need to know if I have to prepare for masters or get a job and start earning. 
So, I don't know what do I do at this point? Do I prepare for CUET or get a job and in job do i prepare for government job or go with college placements etc, and get a private job, because I've heard it takes 2-3 years minimun to prepare for a government job, I don't think I have that. I don't think I can do anything about filmmaking right now, I can pick that up again after sometimes, because whatever I'll do now I'm not gonna do that for my entire life. I just don't want to go backwards (back to that small town I came from).",ExcitingOpinion8564,3,0.800000011920929,2,1705500366,2024-01-17 14:06:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198xb8s/i_need_some_serious_advice_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,1,2024

198x0gq,Brainstorming career transition ideas for a language-fanatic: need input!,"Hello everyone, I am looking to transition careers.  **TLDR I want a job where I can speak different languages other than English and interact frequently with people from other culture(s).** I'm trying to generate as many potential ideas so I can start working on validating them & not risk leaving any good ideas off the table.  

There are *no stupid ideas*, so **please throw anything ou**t, but it would be particularly helpful if: 

1. you are able to be more *specific* (e.g., not just ""work at a hotel"" but say what at a hotel) 
2. *can offer examples* from your own experience / your acquaintance's experience. 

**Brief background:** 

*  I'm American and based in New York City (but open to remote work & potentially relocating). 
* I have \~10 years of career experience in finance & tech. None of my jobs entailed speaking different languages. 

**Below are optional for you to read** but in case helpful I added **details on my interests & career** so far. 

Thank you so much in advance for any input!!! 

\----------

**My Interests:** 

1. I am **hugely obsessed with languages**. I am **fluent in Korean, English and Japanese, intermediate in French.**  I have ambitions to learn more. Main reason I want to transition careers is **I want a job where knowing / learning multiple languages actually adds value,** because I just love it so much. 
2. Similarly **I LOVE interacting with people from all over the world.** I have a lot of language partners. I love learning about their cultures, and I also **LOVE teaching them** the languages I know. 
3. As an FYI I'm also  **interested in wine/ hospitality**. I'm currently enrolled in the WSET Level 3 class, waitressed in college, just enjoy serving people and giving people a good time. But I'd say my biggest passion is def languages. 

**My Career so far ( finance & tech):**

Here is my career experience  (\~10 years) in order: 

1. **Investment Research (3 yrs):** at a globally renowned investment bank. A lot of financial modeling and writing up reports, talking to clients, dealing with formal situations. 
2. **Finance at a tech company (2 yrs):** in-house at a globally renowned mid-sized tech company doing finance for 2 years. i hated it lol 
3. **lots of things at a Silicon Valley Unicorn (4 yrs):**  I joined when the company had 200 people and left when it was 1400, as an early employee I got to wear a lot of hats. Some highlights include:  
   1. **Heavy analytics** work -> for example, using **advanced SQL** I built our attribution models. I used **excel** to build our payback models that we used to decide how to invest our $'s. I was also on the company's SQL interview panel (I led SQL interviews for analytics roles). I **analyzed experiments**. 
   2. **built & managed a team** \->  I built out our marketing analytics team. Made the interview process, hired 3 people, managed them. 
   3. **Led technical/product SEO**   with 2 engineers and 1 engineering manager.  I wrote the strategy and executed. Drove a lot of measurable growth. 
   4. **Transitioned to Product Manager in charge of New user growth.** For the last 1 year I switched teams and worked in Product Management.  I was in charge of driving new user growth. **A ton of leadership, XFNL & project mgmt work**, esp since it was a sizable team. \~10 engineers, 1 EM, 1 Design, 1 shared DS, 1 shared analytics.  Put together strategy and shipped a whole lotta features. Drove a lot of measurable growth 

**What I liked in my career so far** 

1. working with other people
2. being nerdy/geeking out. Liked SQL a lot
3. liked building an expertise in an area not a lot of people knew (e.g., advanced SQL, SEO) 

**What I disliked**

1. Never got to use different languages. 
2. Finance. lol I just hated it, found it so boring. 
3. Some jobs were too XFNL (and not nerdy enough) that it made me a bit scatterbrained. It was tolerable but not ideal (e.g., PM -- way too many messages and things going on at the same time) 
4. I wasn't hugely passionate about the companies in hindsight that any analytics work felt ""stupid."" like I enjoyed the process but I'd often have moments where I'm thinking gosh what's the point of what i'm doing. 
5. I also hated thinking about strategy ALL the time. Like can we just try some things and execute. Dealt with a lot of analysis paralysis.

198wdq9,Managers being confusing???? Am i going to get fired?,"I (19F) have been working at a retail store since mid 2022. I feel like i understand my work enough to be able to do my job well. The way my job works is that as a casual my shifts double or triple in the second half of the year then lower in the first half.
This month, I took a fortnight off to do some volunteer work at a childrens camp. I worked like normal the day before i left early January.
Throughout the camp, i tried to keep an eye on my shifts despite my shody service. When i got back home i noticed i only had one shift for the rest of the month. I was a little concerned because the way my workplace functions is that you have to work at least one shift a month in order to keep your job. Its a good system for students looking to work in the summer and also for people with a second job. I am neither of these fyi.

My mum urged me to call my manager and let them know I'm available to come in whenever but i remembered last January when they basically told me to cope with it.
I eventually wilted and called my manager and she seemed surprised by what i told her. She then said she would deal with it.
A couple hours later and i get called into work that same day. During my shift, i get asked to work the next day.
This is where im getting worried. During the second shift i was called into, two of my manager came to me and asked if i wanted to work the next day aswell. I said yes immediately and they sorta glanced at each other worried before telling me that i had to keep it a secret. Which was fine because i don't really have a friends at work anyways.
I feel as though one of my managers is fighting tooth and nail to keep me while everyone else would rather see me gone.
Im just so worried, I've never had a bad review as far as I'm aware, If i need help or clarification then i also seek it instead of making a mess. I like to do my work in peace, help customers and not get involved in workplace drama.

Truth be told, I'm not new to having weird shifts, I've had shifts cancelled on me without being told and then when i do notice it, i ask and get told to deal with it. I really need this job as my air conditioning is gone from my car and its summer and Australia at the moment.
But I don't know if i should be mentally checking out of this job and looking for a new one. I'd rather be prepared for the worst even though i like my job.",Lumpy-Hour7438,1,1.0,1,1705497602,2024-01-17 13:20:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198wdq9/managers_being_confusing_am_i_going_to_get_fired/,1,2024

198txuu,Again at CROSSROADS mid-career. Help!,"I was in server tech support for about 13 years. 6 years ago I quit due to family reasons. 

I started freelance writing and then copywriting in early 2020 as I loved writing.

But call it luck or my fate I always encountered cheap clients asking for a day's worth of work for $50 or less. I am not in the US so I am expected to work for cheaper. 

I was writing stories as a kid and even now I make up my own stories for my two kids who love them.

Now I am wondering if I should quit copywriting or content writing career and restart as a children's story writer.

Pros being - 

1. I will hopefully create a business independent of my time.

Cons:

1. I am not sure how the book(s) might be perceived. It might flop altogether.
2. The cost of creating a children's book is high given the need for illustrations.

Also I hate that I am not contributing financially to the family for the past 6 years. But I don't want to keep freelancing given it is no different than a 9-5 with multiple bosses.

Another option is to get a full-time remote job again now for meager pay and write stories on weekends.

198sam1,From UX Designer to Product Manager,"Hello everyone,  
I'm an in-house UX/UI Designer with 3/4 years of experience, and I'm exploring a new professional direction. I've noticed a growing challenge in the UX field in Italy, and I'm considering transitioning towards a more management and strategy-oriented career, rather than staying purely operational.  
Before obtaining my degree in Design, I spent a year as a developer after attending an ITIS informatics program in high school. I've developed a strong interest in Product Management, seeing a unique opportunity to blend my technical skills with those in design.  
Additionally, I also check the possibility of moving abroad as a UX designer. However, I've found it to be quite challenging, with few positions available even in other European countries.

198sajg,Engineering career choice,"Hello everyone, as stated in the title, I would like to have your advices/perspectives on the choice between two job offers.

Take into account that I live in Italy, and here chemical engineers seem to be highly sought after. In the last 45 days, I received many offers from various companies.
Consider that here the annual gross salary is, on average, 25k € for chemical engineers with my experience, which translates roughly in a net monthly salary of 1400€.
The first significant offer is from an American O&G company, which has multiple locations all around the world. A couple days ago, I did the technical interview and it went really well: they complimented me for my interview and offered the best possible position in the contract and the highest paid annual gross salary (32k €). The place where I would work is in Tuscany, where the cost of living is average (considering Italy) and the monthly salary could grant me to live without many problems. Also the welfare of the company is really good. They told me that it could happen to travel around the world with this job.
Everything looks very good about this job offer honestly. At the end of the interview they asked me if I have any question about the job. I always ask the same question: ""can you describe a trajectory of my career inside your company and in 3/6 months to what knowledge I will be exposed to? What will I learn?"" They told me that the career path inside the company is pretty slow and that I will not learn anything significant in the next 3/6 months. This left me a sour taste honestly.
Most importantly, they told me that I have to decide before this Friday at 12:00.

The second significant offer is from a small/medium company (~400 employees) which is about projecting chemical plants, especially sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid and detergents in general. This company is based in Milan, which is the city with the highest cost of living in Italy, and compared to Tuscany is roughly 20% more expensive. I have not received yet an official offer from them, but they wanted to see me in person to discuss the contract. I just arrived in Milan and I will go to talk with them tomorrow (Thursday) morning. I know that they should pay around 33-35k € of gross annual salary (I will update you tomorrow), so a bit more than the other company, but still we have to consider the much higher cost of living in Milan. Speaking with them in the first interview, it turned out that this job is extremely dynamic and you are exposed constantly to new things, thus learning a lot during the span of time that I will be with them. I think that this job would fit me and my characteristics more than the other one. Tomorrow I will update you with more informations.

Thank if you read all of this and decided to give your advice on which company I should sign the contract with.",AndreaMi95,2,1.0,1,1705482100,2024-01-17 09:01:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198sajg/engineering_career_choice/,1,2024
198s8w1,I have no clue what I want to do in life or how to approach finding a favored career.,"I (18M) am about to go off to college and I currently have no clue what I would like to do going forward. I know I am still young and fortunate to have time to brainstorm ideas, but I would be lying if I said I wasn’t worried.

I try to, on a daily basis, pay attention to things that interest me but recently nothing has seemed appealing or if something does seem appealing I shoot the thought down in my head because of money worries or concern of a dying field or questioning if I really would want to pursue this for my whole life. 

I am not normally the cockiest chicken in the coop but I will say I work a lot harder than my peers and have throughout my entire school career, so I believe that I can excel in any career I go into based off my work ethic alone. I just am not sure how to approach finding something that I will make decent money in while also being satisfied with my career path.

But, the company I work for has been losing staff in a way I've never seen before. We've lost more than half my coworkers in the past year and a half.

&#x200B;

We are losing another member of the staff at the end of this week, and a new hire that was supposed to start last Monday ghosted and has since notified that they no longer are interested in following through with taking the job. The fact that my boss wants to discuss my current role in the midst of all this makes me think they want to move me into a new position to fill the voids and balance things out.

&#x200B;

Even assuming this would come with pay/benefit increase my gut says not to take a new role if I have the choice. I've been working hard in the background on getting a college degree and certifications in a completely different field of work. If things stay on track I plan to be job hunting for my career change in March of 2024. I don't think taking a new role for a short burst and immediately leaving would benefit me or the company. If anything I see more ways this ends up creating hell for both of us.

&#x200B;

I know I am probably too sympathetic to the company I work for, but I've seen dozens of people leave this company very poorly and I personally want to do better and make this transition as graceful as it can be when the time comes. I have a good relationship with my boss and part of me is considering being transparent if they offer me a role and letting them know my situation. I have started a whole new service level of the business that no one else has been trained on (and everyone else left lol) so I know my job is secure for the time being. It seems fair to let them know they should be thinking about getting someone trained for what I do in the future.

198q5pz,Work Promotion Help,"Today was ‘comp’ day and in addition to getting a raise, more importantly I found out I was also promoted to ED (executive director) at my company. First of all, I want to preface that I am extremely grateful and thankful that the work I put in was recognized, but when I found out the news today I was not as ecstatic as most would be. I took some time to process and in speaking to my wife about it, I took away that I may have imposter syndrome. Yes I am hard working, don’t spend much time schmoozing, and my Boss is great but somehow I don’t feel like I was ready. I ask myself questions like “ who was I up against, how big was the candidate pool, who from upper management had a say in it.” when at the end of the day truly does any of that matter? I am oneself that takes pride in being technical and knowing as much as possible, but will I ever know everything before feeling ready for promote? Is this what ‘fake it till you make it’ means? I am still processing but can’t help to feel like dam, am I ready for this. It does help that the raise was minimal - not life changing, <$5k, so maybe the pressure shouldn’t really be there bc the pay raise wasn’t significant, but the title holds weight. How do I get rid of this feeling that I’m not ready or there’s a target on my back What am I missing? 

Anyone out there ever feel the same way and can share how did they manage their emotions?

198q484,How to tell parents I want a different career?,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently working as a 20 yr old Millwright apprentice (as recommended strongly by my parents, which my step dad is currently one). When they told me about the job a few years ago, it sounded perfect for what I wanted to do, but now having been in it for a little over a year now, I've realized that the Industrial setting is not for me. I know what I want to pursue next (automotive tech), but I'm worried about what my parents might think of me leaving this career path so soon. It makes above average pay for my experience, but it's so mentally draining that I'm not sure I can last the rest of this apprenticeship without breaking down.

How do I tell them that this new path is something I genuinely want to pursue on my own, even understanding that the pay won't be as good? They've always tried to push me in a direction they see fit, but I really can't see myself ever going down this path again. I just don't want them to be disappointed in me.

198ovi5,"Seeking advice on career transition / Toronto, Canada","Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently 22 years old, and after completing my accounting diploma from a Canadian college, I have accumulated over 3 years of experience in bookkeeping. Now, I am eager to expand my horizons and transition my career towards finance.

I am considering pursuing a BCom with a major in finance as a potential starting point. However, I value the insights of those already working in the field and would appreciate your opinion. Alternatively, if there are certifications equivalent to a degree that could enable me to kickstart my finance career, I am open to exploring those options.

Regarding education, I am contemplating Humber College for my BCom, given my previous experience with them. Additionally, I am interested in studying while continuing my current job. I would like to know if managing both work and studies simultaneously is feasible.

After completing my undergraduate degree, I am curious about the potential roles available and the salary range to expect. Considering the investment of approximately 4 years in education, I wonder about the overall worth of pursuing this path.

Furthermore, I am uncertain about whether additional studies beyond an undergraduate degree are necessary to reach higher levels in the finance field. Alternatively, does career progression largely depend on individual experience?

Your guidance on these matters would be immensely valuable to me. I appreciate your time and insights.",AM749680,1,1.0,0,1705468956,2024-01-17 05:22:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198ovi5/seeking_advice_on_career_transition_toronto_canada/,1,2024
198oocm,Should I finish electrician apprentice program or career pivot ASAP?,"Hey everyone, I'm a 26m 2.5yrs into a 5 year electrical worker apprenticeship. The going rate upon program completion is about $50/hr ~$98k/year. I'm in industrial settings and hooking up motors, pumps, MCC's, and PLC's (all industrial electrical equipment). If I stick it out the next 2.5 years, I'll be licensed as a journeyman electrician and can come back to the field whenever I might need to... as long as I keep up on union dues.

The work is decent. I generally enjoy it enough to not hate life and all, but it can be rough working all day in freezing or 100°+ weather. I'm also a night owl by nature and struggle to sleep enough while waking up at 5am, but that's manageable.

The main thing bothering me is the general attitude in construction of ""we all gotta die of something"" We've had sandblaster guys shooting fine particulate dust plumes in the air for weeks at this job and I bring my own respirator, but a lot of people give me grief about it. Even if they didn't bug me about the mask and safety stuff, a lot of these places have asbestos everywhere and silica dust flying when we drill walls, etc. It just doesn't feel great on my body in general with the work and atmosphere combined.

I've been studying python and data analytics courses at home on Udemy in my off time. I currently have a BA degree in Business Admin emphasized in marketing (I do regret not picking finance)

My goal is to eventually pivot careers back into the office and become a data analyst type. I'd happily go down to $60k if it meant remote work, but that's a want not a need. I've been thinking to pursue an online master's degree in Data Science. I've seen a 10month deal for $10k, but I'm not sure if it'd be better to wait and see if an employer would cover education.


TLDR; 26M with business bachelor's degree. Currently in industrial electrician field. Currently in program for 2.5years with 2.5years left to complete apprenticeship and become licensed. Licensing as an electrician would guarantee being able to return to ~$100k+ benefits and pension is push came to shove.

90% sure I want to pivot into data science and analytics. Question is whether I should wait and finish my apprenticeship or if I should seek the career change ASAP to get ahead of things. Also master's in data science before or after changing career fields? Any advice is appreciated and especially advice regarding the data field and leveraging my business degree/potential future data degree.

198ofhu,"My old company wants me back, but with full interview process","My old company was really good, I had a lot of options, responsibility, and made some really great things come out of this.  
The company was bought, restructured with everything inside it, restricted in spending and options, positions, holidays, freedom.  
The new management wanted to establish full control, so it was a hell to get anything approved both vacations but also business plans, or commitments to direction. 
It became almost impossible to actually do any work, which was frustrating because we just embarked on a journey where a lot of work had to redone in a new better way.  
The lack of movement, plus no appreciation from management to all the work I did, made me move on.  
My former managers started treating me as an outcast, yelling at me for things, or making small comments.  

Now a person from my old team told me they really missed me and wanted me back, and it was a great time in ""the old days"". I agreed that we had a lot of fun and did some great things.  
A few days later a manager reached out to me saying they heard I wanted to get back to them, which they think would be beneficial to the both of us.  
I said I would consider it, but only if some things were different.  
They upfront promised be a raise and some stuff, but I said what I really needed was I needed to be able to work freely, and have possibilities with employees, and getting projects done.  
His reply was avoiding addressing it, and said we would find a way to work together.  

Now he suggested a date we should start, and wants me to do tests, and assignments, and talk with different people, like I was a complete stranger not knowing I can lift the burden at hand, or work with the team.  
Tried saying why he needs this when I already both did the tests before I started working there, plus actually fulfilled the assignments I was given, but he tries saying he needs them to be able to say I want favored the position, and needs to compete with the rest of the candidates for the position.  

Not certain on how I'm supposed to react to this, and would like some input on how you would feel, and respond, because I feel really annoyed, and that the flexibility I'm asking for is missing, and this is already showing me I will walk into the same scenario as before. They need me more than I need them, but it could be fun to do this, if I could get the options I talked about.  

So tell me, how would you feel, and how would you respond to this?",I-Like-To-Wookie,2,1.0,2,1705467512,2024-01-17 04:58:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198ofhu/my_old_company_wants_me_back_but_with_full/,1,2024

I work about 22 hours a week and I get paid min wage for my state, but I need a little more. The remote jobs I've applied to didn't seem to work out well/look sketchy.

198o5qp,I'm good enough for this job?,"I moved from a Spanish speaker country 1year ago. When I arrived to the US I started as many immigrants: working as a dishwasher. I have a college degree as a geophysical engineer and I have a b2/c1 English level. Because of my English I could find some jobs as waiter, but after a while I took the decision to find a job in my career.  I had been doubting of myself because of my English, and to be honest  I wasn't sure if my education was as good as the one that my coworkers  had here in the us.  With all those insecurities I decided to go for it and I started to apply for jobs in my area. I received job offers for all the interviews that I had. I accepted one of the offers and started in this new company a couple month ago. 
I have been learning a lot and doing a lot of new things. In these process I feel that I should have known a lot of things, even when many things were new for me. I'm not sure if I have been doing a good job, but I'm trying my best. Two or three weeks ago I was one of the last ones in the office and my boss came to my office and told me out of nowhere that they valued my education, that nobody have had any complain about me, and if I'm going to start  any immigration process they would try to help me as much as they can. 
At the same time I have made some mistakes. For example, I have made an error putting my hours in the time sheets because I didn't know that certain jobs had to be charged in a different way. I also was using one equipment and it stopped working. I didn't broke it, it was just old. I know it wasn't my fault but I'm just so afraid of messing all up. I can't lose this job. I have no safety net.
How do I know if I'm doing good? What signs should I look for? I'm just being paranoid?
Are Americans the type of person that give feed back? Are they going to tell me if I'm not doing something good? Or they are just going to stay silent until they fired me?

198nxgo,Should I find a less demanding job?,"Background: I work for a big government contracting consulting company with good reputation for 6+yrs now as a consultant. Salary around 120k, fully remote. I'm married with two very young kids. Husband makes around 400k, we have very little debt.

For the past 6yrs I for the most part enjoyed my job, it provides the work life balance and somewhat learning opportunities that I needed. Coworkers are all smart and nice people. 

Three months ago, I was pulled to a high visibility project and direct reports are very demanding, everyone work extra hard and I felt like I'm been pulled into different directions. My direct boss really likes me and want to get me promoted (salary increases 20k), but this will require me to work extra hard (60hr/week) for the next year and half.

So right now, my options are:
1: tell my boss that this project is too much for me, I want the promotion but not to a point that I'm willing to work 60hr/week and sacrifice my family time.
I've never openly admit that sometimes is above my limitations at work, so this might backfire and make me loose this project. 

2. Switch company and hide the fact that I leave because the current project is too demanding. But the risk is new company might have other issues that I don't want to deal with, since my current company is known for have high employees satisfaction.

3. Try harder for my career to don't let the opportunity of getting promoted slip.

Got in a debate with parents, but they (doctors, no IT background) insist that it would make way more sense to get a master's versus getting a few more years of experience under your belt. My thinking is that if I had a few more years of experience (DA relevant), I could expand my portfolio, have a few more skillsets verifiable through work, and have a better upwards trajectory in the DA field.

I was fired from my last position due to taking intermittent FMLA leave for my health condition. They fired me the day after I called out and missed an important meeting, and they claimed it was for ""performance"" though my performance had never been an issue.

  
I had been telling recruiters and hiring managers I was laid off, knowing that almost all companies will respond to a background check with only the dates of employment and job title at time of separation, so they would never find out, but now my attorney has filed a lawsuit against my former company for violating my FMLA and ADA rights. Now, if you were to search my real name, the lawsuit would show up early in the results, since it's public record.

  
How would you recommend that I answer ""Why did you leave your most recent job?"" when that job was the one I was fired for. I feel like most hiring managers would do a quick Google search for someone before offering them a job.

  
""Bonus points"" for recruiters or hiring managers who have either uncovered someone lying about a situation like this, or who have either disqualified or moved someone forward after they were truthful about it regardless.

That bootcamp cert got me my current job as an Application Solutions Engineer (glorified IT with database write access and LIGHT code access) for the last 2.5 years.  
  
  
  
Finding a job where I can get more coding experience has been horrendous. At first I wanted to be strict and get something more back-end (automation, API development, etc.) but even expanding my horizons all the way to QA jobs I don't get ANYTHING (not even an interview). I have a few projects on my github, but being that they are smaller scale personal projects, they haven't seemed to get much attention professionally.  
  
Finally my ask which I am hoping some more advanced CS members can help out with. Would it be worth it to get my masters in Applied Computer Science at a college near me, or would the degree not do much with my lack of professional experience. I have heard mixed things from some developers at my current company who I am friends with, who pretty split on the opinions of ""You don't even need a bachelors degree if you can prove you know what you are doing"" and ""You won't even get an interview these days without something like that""

I made it to where I am doing payroll for a large county government with 1200+ employees with an Associate's degree, but I've recently obtained my BSBA in Accounting and my MBA and I'm trying to figure out what to do now. My current role is very comfortable and I have a lot of flexibility and down time, which doesn't bother me in the slightest. I share the payroll duties with a one-level-higher coworker and she handles the more complicated stuff, so I'm not getting a ton of experience learning the tax returns and whatnot, although I'm very smart and resourceful; I know I could handle more complicated duties. I haven't directly supervised anyone since I was 19 (I'm 41 now), but I know I could do it and I read up on the topic regularly so I can be ready when it's time. My current employer is talking to me about a promotion very soon doing grant administration and reconciliations and whatnot, but I'm just not sure if it's what I want to do. 

I like the idea of staying in the government sector because the benefits and time off are amazing, but I'm not dead set on it. I like accounting and financial functions, but I also like administrative functions and decision-making and I'd like to do more of it. The city where I live is hiring for an Assistant City Manager and it looks appealing, but I wonder if it's too much of a stretch.

198mu1f,"Besides years of experience, what other qualifications would be the most beneficial in boosting my chances of landing a job interview and getting hired?","If I don’t meet the years of experience requirement on job postings, what other qualifications would be most helpful in boosting interview chances?

I currently work in Human Resources for a small manufacturing company and have been doing so for a little over a year. While I don’t have any plans on leaving my job anytime soon, I’m always casually looking at job postings to see what’s out there and have an idea of what other roles I might qualify for. As I’m looking at jobs that interest me, I’m finding that most of them require at least 3 years of HR experience, but most seem to be in the 5-7 year range. I got started in my HR career path later on and took a rather large pay cut to switch to the HR career and while I’m content at my job now, I’m not sure I love the direction that the company is going and I’m unsure if there will be any opportunities for advancement for me in the near future. As it stands right now, I honestly don’t know that I’ll make it there another 4 years. 

My question is: if I don’t quite meet the years of experience requirements on a job posting, what in your opinion would be the next best thing (ie certifications, etc) that would help boost my chances of getting an interview?

My background: My primary role at my current company is in payroll and benefit management for the company which includes multi-state payroll and integration as we are actively acquiring other businesses. I am also heavily involved in employee onboarding, recruiting/hiring, employee relations, etc. I also have 8 years of experience working in healthcare (non-HR role), 4 years of which I worked in a supervisory/management role.",Erbearista03,2,0.7599999904632568,3,1705462446,2024-01-17 03:34:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198mu1f/besides_years_of_experience_what_other/,1,2024

198khlv,Venting - not looking for career advice....,"Looking to vent.  hope that's ok.  here's what riles me up about corporate world.  

I'm a low level manager in the tech industry.  I just had my performance review.  it was bad.  like really bad.  

half my team is offshore outsourced.  half is usa based.  here's what drives me nuts.

I didn't ask to become a manager.  I didn't seek the job out.  i was ""promoted"" into the job, due to designing a few tools that took off like wildfire, and the company needed more people on the project as they wanted to tool to expand.  since I knew them best (as i designed and coded them)... they made me the manager and gave me a team of 20 people.  

Now i will say this - the actual findings of the review... are warranted.  all the stuff i need to improve i agree with.  99% of it is that i'm so busy i don't have time to address some VERY basic common Admin tasks... which are legit necessary.  no arguing that.  i deserved it. (crap like payroll)

here's the sucky part.  my team .... half of them make more than me.  My USA employees ALL make more than me (i'm also USA based).  My outsourced employees make pretty much the same salary as me.  

it's on me as to my shortcomings and i'll improve them.  but half of me wanted to just say ""how about you demote me and pay me what EVERYONE on my team actually makes... and you find yourself a new manager.  after all, we are short staffed, and you keep giving budget for new engineers that make more than me! Fuck it, let me be an engineer again then!""  
(only reason i'm not doing that is i care a LOT about the project and direction and not sure i want to go back down for my career .... another year and it'll be in a place i'm ok to hand it off and i'll move to a new role)",alecubudulecu,2,1.0,5,1705455825,2024-01-17 01:43:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198khlv/venting_not_looking_for_career_advice/,1,2024
198k5cn,"[Seeking Advice] Year Gap, allow me to spin you a yarn.","This ended up being long, but I guess I wanted to say everything I had to say and provide my perspective on how I've gotten to this point. I used to be really ashamed of my relative lack of success in my field of work, but I've obviously had to think on those experiences a lot, and I think that's reflected by what I've said here. TL;DR is at the bottom.

Some quick info about me: Graduated 2019 with degree in Accounting. No CPA. I changed my field of study a couple times and transferred a few times, so at the end of a 7 year undergrad, I wanted to work, not continue testing.

Reason for Acct: I wanted something that I felt was useful, that I trusted I could study (I was discouraged from my original field of study after struggling with health/science courses), and that, I thought, would provide a reasonable pathway to other jobs in the business sector, like marketing or HR.

Wrinkle: I was diagnosed with Bipolar last year. I mention this because I was struggling with it long before a professional put a name on it, and still am. Maybe it'll provide some additional context for better-informed advice.

&#x200B;

Here's my job history:

My first career-level job offer was as a rep for human resources at my alma mater, and I worked there for 2 years. I took that role as opposed to something more accounting-oriented because I wanted to get started working and trying to make some money, and they were willing to hire me before I actually finished my degree. This job had ups and downs. The community generally thought of us as adversaries and so did not like us very much. The people I was serving were often exasperated and unhappy and would project that onto my colleagues and me. My colleagues were difficult to work with sometimes. I wasn't medicated yet, so my moods were still volatile. Eventually I was asked to join the Benefits Administration Team in addition to my existing responsibilities, and when a team member left, I was asked to temporarily take her responsibilities on as well. When I asked for a raise, I was told no. I had a lot of gripes about this role, but I also made good professional relationships and seized a lot of opportunities to grow as a professional. I left this position wanting to not work with people anymore or to operate in a service-oriented role in a business setting.

&#x200B;

At the end of those 2 years, I secured a job offer in another state on a 12 month internship doing grants accounting. I found this job interesting and rewarding for a while. My boss there was one of the best guys I've ever known. He was an expert in the field, a gifted teacher, and a patient, kind person. I mention that to say that working for this guy made some of the more frustrating parts of the job easier to endure. Our team was responsible for doing the final audits on the spending reports of research contracts between our company and other companies. I was excited to be working on interesting projects with highly variable sums of spending authority associated with them, some as low as 10,000, some higher than $1,000,000. I got familiar with interpreting contracts to find whether or not a particular expense could be construed as allowable within the framework of a contract, I communicated with internal partners doing interesting work within our company, as well as external partners in order to validate whether or not certain expenditures were deemed allowable. Basically, I was learning about a whole new field I had never heard about that aligned with my education and allowed me to indirectly work on interesting projects funded by high profile companies, plus I got to move to a new state that I was already interested in moving to. However, one of the problems, for me at least, was that our backlog of projects requiring review to be closed was very large, larger than a team of our size could ever hope to make current. My boss started being pressured by new leadership to provide more specific performance metrics and to do a more effective job closing projects, but nothing was being done to alter the circumstances of our team in a material way so that we could actually achieve that. I have a habit of seeing, from my perspective, inefficiencies in the workplace or misunderstandings from management, and I quickly grow frustrated at them. Additionally, I started feeling stress and anxiety, as the complexity of some of the projects in our backlog made me feel like I wasn't fulfilling my role effectively, and my mentor was becoming less and less available to the team due to demands from upper management. Given that this was a 12-month internship contract where renewal wasn't guaranteed, I opted to look for roles within the company but outside of the sponsored research ecosystem.

&#x200B;

I took a job in general accounting for a role I was told would be primarily related to internal auditing in different areas around the company. My previous role in sponsored research was basically auditing, and I enjoyed that portion, so I was eager for the opportunity. I was told that I would work closely with an intern who would be responsible for answering emails in our shared inbox, which was a function I wasn't interested in filling. I was there for the auditing role. As the first 3 months rolled on, it became apparent that my colleague simply did not have the time to pursue her Master's degree while fulfilling the needs of the role, so I was answering a lot of emails, despite not having answers to most things, pushing a lot of emails around for signatures, and not doing much auditing. I sent an email to our mutual supervisor letting him know what my thoughts were on how the job was going and then spoke with my colleague to let her know I had sent the email. She thanked me for letting her know and for sending the email because she was experiencing a lot of stress for not being able to give her attention to the role due to school, and said she wanted to find a better solution for both of us. Our supervisor got back to me two days later and we had, what I thought was, a very positive conversation dictating our options for moving forward. He was very agreeable towards a lot of the suggestions I made, though he did imply he was going to ""come down"" on my colleague, which was not something I wanted. We finished our conversation and I spoke to my colleague to let her know that a conversation was had, this is what our supervisor said, and here is how I think you should prepare yourself for when he approaches you. I coached her for probably two hours, then she tells me she received the invite for a meeting between herself and our boss. She has the conversation, comes back to me, and then tells me that their conversation went, basically, opposite to what she and I had expected and discussed. She told me that our boss insinuated that I was a huge problem and tried getting her to implicate me as the source of any issues, something which she refused to do. I had already started experiencing a lot of anxiety and stress due to my lack of training and the administrative burden of the role, so when my colleague reported that conversation back to me, as well as some of the details of the conversation, I completely detached from the role. No part of me was interested in continuing in that role knowing my boss was a weirdo who had no issue with making a short-sighted decision to pose two employees against each other. I gave my two week notice and left.

&#x200B;

I took that summer off to do an online web-development course while deciding what my next steps would be. I ran out of extra money, and it kind of seemed like a pipedream anyways, so I acquired a new accounting role as a conventional Staff Accountant in a new company. I was doing things like posting receipts, pursuing AR, doing month closes, advising our branch accountants nationwide of best practices, yadda yadda. When I was interviewing, I specifically asked the guy interviewing me if there was anything wrong with the position, was there anything at the company he doesn't like, what are his biggest gripes in the role, and he said he likes working there a lot and he'd been there for 15 years. I liked the guy and what I was hearing, so when I got the offer, I accepted. I worked closely with the guy who hired me for 3 weeks, got to know my colleagues, found myself enjoying what I was doing. Boss would take me to long lunches and pay on the company card. When we were done with what we had for the day, boss would send me home, whether that was at 2oclock or 5oclock. When we didn't need to be in the office, boss said let's work from home. Well, 3 weeks into my employment, my manager who I liked so much and who had hired me and told me that the gig was sweet, put in his two week notice because he said he didn't really like what the company had become and that too many promises had been made to him that never conveyed. Two weeks later, the CFO, who was my new supervisor, brought in a consultant and added a new team member to fill the hole my previous manager had left. A 1.5-2 months later, I find myself in a familiar position of being filled with stress and anxiety, left to fulfill a role for which I had not been appropriately trained. People were asking me questions I simply did not have answers to. Beyond the administrative issues I was running into, I was fulfilling my other processes the way my old boss had taught me and approved of. Despite that, eventually I was called into a meeting with the consultant and the CFO where they conducted a hitjob on me saying that I wasn't carrying my weight. I opted to defend myself and tell them that I'm already operating at my capacity and doing my best. The CFO tells me ""Well maybe your best isn't good enough for us."" I tell them this wasn't the situation that I had signed up for, and reminded them both that I had already previously expressed that sentiment. The CFO baited me into quitting, but I told myself I would wait for them to fire me if that's what they wanted to do. They put me on a PIP, I finished the day, and went home. The next day, or maybe the day after, I was getting ready for work and filled with anxiety. I was thinking about working from home to relax, but I knew I'd feel anxiety about that as well. With it in mind that I was going to be miserable whether I stayed home or went into work, and with the feeling that after being put on a PIP I would be fired eventually regardless, I reached out to my girlfriend's boss at the restaurant where she had been a server at for the previous year and a half asking if they had anything I could do there. He said yes, and so 30 minutes later I told the HR rep at this company that my employment was over ""effective today."" I later reached out to the guy who vacated my role before I filled it and found out he left after 5 years because "" no matter how much work \[he\] did, it was never enough. They were always on \[his\] case telling \[him\] \[he\] wasn't doing enough, even when \[he\] was putting in >40 hour weeks."" 

&#x200B;

So, a year later, here's where I am. I joined the restaurant's team operating in a role between the front-of-house staff and the back-of-house staff. Essentially I take items from the chefs, group them into appropriate tickets, and either run them to tables or hand them off to servers to be ran. My managers and colleagues are all fond of and openly appreciative of me, often telling me how their jobs are easier when I'm around, and I've received a promotion. I work with people I'm friends with and who I see outside of the workplace. Sure, there are things that bother me, but since I only work there part time and it's just food-service, I'm able to separate from those things and manage my frustrations in ways I never could in my full-time positions. Unfortunately, my income is variable, and lately I'm not getting many shifts. I also don't have access to health insurance, which, because of the Bipolar diagnosis I mentioned above, I need insurance to get things like therapy and ongoing care. My GP said there's nothing else he can do to help me, and I need to start working with a psychiatrist, but I can't afford that. I didn't plan to be at the restaurant for a whole year, but I was burnt out on working in the business-sector, and I was happy to be somewhere where I felt like I fit in and where people appreciated and liked me, and I was making my bills. I need the security and benefits of a better paying job now, but I have had almost no success in securing interviews since taking my job hunt more seriously. I'm worried I've dug myself into too deep a hole. My resume features my part time work, but that means I have a 3 month job, a summer gap, a 3 month job, and a year in a restaurant. What the fuck do I do? I've thought about school, but I really want to move back home, and I have a hard time convincing myself to go back to school when I have financial and medical needs right now. There's a 2-semester certification at the local community college in manufacturing optical technology, basically using precision machining equipment to manufacture precision glass lenses to be utilized in laser technology, but that doesn't start until the fall, so it doesn't solve any of my immediate issues. Do I just keep applying and hope someone is willing to take a look at me despite how my resume smells? I used to have local recruiters up my ass trying to get me to apply for their roles, now they won't even email me back when I apply. Plus, if I go back to accounting, I'm rolling the dice on whether it's something I can even handle anyways, since it's been since 2018-2020 that I actually held down a job for longer than 9 months, not including this restaurant gig. Do I just give up on accounting and try to survive while going back to school? What do?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Accounting degree, jobs sucked, burnt out, worked in a restaurant for a year, ready to work on my career again, how to navigate my stinky resume?

It's been 8 years since (15 total since law school), and I haven't really stopped working, other than the regular 2 week vacation. I don't particularly care for the work, so I didn't rise up in management, or start my own business (maybe that's in the cards).

198k0i7,Should I go to HR about this,"I ( 26 F) just started a new job at a university. The job I am currently at is not that high on the totem pole, and frankly this isn’t what I want to do for the rest of my life. However, this job is preparing me for the job I do want and I am learning a lot and most importantly I am making relationships in this field. 
Here’s my issue, when I first started working here I started working with a person named Kat (23F, fake name). Kat has a huge issue with reading the room and more annoying… trauma dumping. The first few days of knowing her I’ve learned all about her toxic ex boy friends, and that she started smoking at age 12. I want to reiterate that I don’t care that people do these things, but we just started working together and this is a very professional environment. Also not to mention, I don’t know her that well at this point. At the end of the week I politely  brought up that I don’t really care about talking about these things at work. 

Weeks gone by and she would still bring up things like: possibly having an STD, her friends custody battle, her brother’s DUI, her childhood trauma, not using protection, ect. Every time she brings it up I become more and more stern that these are not work conversations and that they make me uncomfortable. It’s gone to the point that she’s either talking to me about it, or she’s sitting in a open area on the phone for all our employees can hear. Needless to say, Kat is not the most self aware person. 

Finally I had enough, I’m tired of being a free therapist. If she wants one we have councilors  at the university we work at, for free mind you. So she has no excuse to use me as a free therapist. Today, we were talking about something  innocent like apartment hunting, but she tuned that conversation into her friend not able to get an apparent because she trashed the last one and how it wasn’t her fault,ect. She went on talking about other in detailed/ personal things. Girl didn’t stop for a breath, but she kept on saying things in between her rant, like “I know you don’t care…” Or “ know you don’t want to hear this but...” Then once she was done I finally said what I was really thinking for a long time. Keep in mind, I used to be a teacher so I can yell at someone in a calm, collective, and articulate way.

 “There’s a difference between just not caring and being forced not to. I gave you my boundaries from the start and you chose to ignore them. I don’t care for you because I no longer that the energy to. You forced that on me. If you cross the boundaries I gave you again, I will call a meeting to HR, because these are conversations for your friends not for people at work.”

She then made all of the excuses in the world saying that she can’t help who she is and that she can’t change. She also tried to get me to feel bad for her because she does not have any friends close to this area.

My reply was, “I am not your friend, and I am not required to be so. You need to please stop treating me like one. Please go see a therapist… I’m glad we have had this adult conversation.” Then I went somewhere else to do my job in peace.",Art_nerd_and_such,17,0.8399999737739563,9,1705454507,2024-01-17 01:21:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198k0i7/should_i_go_to_hr_about_this/,1,2024

I was offered a far better position by a past employer that pays significantly more, is a better company, and I enjoy far more. I have decided I want to take this position and was going to give a one month notice(it starts in 3 months) 

At my current job i have 2 co workers. The parts manager and service manager. The parts manager said he is retiring in 7 months and service manager said he is going to cut his hours back and aim to retire soon as well. He said I have a lot of learning to which I took as a drastic increase in responsibilities and i assume this comes with the proper pay raises and all

198j0p1,Move to greener grass or hold out longer?,"Hey everyone! Just found this page, so I thought I’d post a question. I’m interested in others’ perspectives. For privacy I’ll be a little vague, but hopefully I can give enough detail for comments.

I am a young professional in the legal profession, coming up on my third year. My last job was fine, but I made a move to a different specialty. I make pretty good, perhaps even REALLY good money, but I know I’m not sticking with this job forever. I’m considering a move back to what I previously had, slightly lower pay, but hopefully something that will eventually allow another shift, where I can make what I want and practice what I like.

Right now, I don’t really like the work much, but it’s not so terrible that I need to leave quickly. This has led me to be incredibly picky and hesitant/indecisive about when to leave. On the one hand, I feel like I’m missing out on something I think I would like more, and would be more closely aligned with what I eventually want to do. Of course, there’s no guarantee I hit that ultimate dream job, and I already know I’d need to take at least one step back when it comes to pay. 

On the other hand, I feel like I’m too eager to jump to something else, and should stick it out a little more until I find that really interesting job, all the while reaping the benefits of more money. Of course, it would mean more lame work, and a risk that I’m missing out on more direct experience (not useless experience right now, but less aligned with the ultimate goal). 

Has anybody had similar experiences? Any advice or comments? I can provide more info as needed, in either an edit or dms.

The new job offered me 80K for a lateral move in title, and my old job counter offered with a promotion and 75K salary (10K or so below market rate for the title).  I accepted the new job offer since I wasn't going to take less pay for more responsibility.

About a month into the new place I reached out to my old boss to tell her I wasnt liking the new job and asked if the promotion was still on the table. She said she would ask around and let me know. No salary was discussed at this point. About a week later she said I would be hearing from HR.

When the HR person contacted me, they offered me the same below market offer that I had already rejected a month earlier. I countered with 85K and they said they would have to get back to me. A couple of weeks passed and when I reached out again I was told that my salary expectations could not be met and there was no wiggle room from the 75K at all. At this point, I said I was no longer interested and thanked them for their time.

I texted my old boss a couple days after rejecting the offer to say thanks and sorry that it didn't work out. This has been met with radio silence and now I feel as if I've burned a bridge.

 Did I do something that my old boss could perceive as unprofessional? Negotiating in bad faith or something along those lines? I don't think my expectations were unreasonable and when they weren't met I removed myself from the process.",OnlyEstablishment454,1,0.6700000166893005,7,1705451559,2024-01-17 00:32:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198iwyl/was_i_in_the_wrong/,1,2024

I am at my wits end with retail management. I've worked as a supervisor for 6 years now, at the level of an assistant manager for about 3 years now. I've been dangled the carrot plenty, and just don't know if I want to pursue a career any further with retail. I'm a bit lost on what to look for in terms of jobs. I (and my performance reviews) would say my performance is solid and at the assistant manager level - scheduling, planning, communicating, being the only leader on duty, prioritizing... I am a little nervous on looking for something new since I have been at this job for so long and do not have any much experience elsewhere, I am very adaptable and have gotten moved through out multiple departments that require different things, I got promoted to my current position within a year. I've looked into HR possibly, admin assistant...? Are there any other jobs I might be missing out on that offer decent pay (45k a year or more?) that I can acquire with management experience?

I decided to leave and try out a new job (that didn’t workout), and now I’m at another one. For some reason I just can’t stop thinking about my last job while working these new ones. Even tho towards the end it made me miserable, I will always compare what I used to have to what I have now. I always think about what if I did this better to have stayed and been happier. Or I just miss rhythm I had everyday for 2 years. And for some reason I just can’t stop thinking about it. Even the day I left I drove home crying Bec I knew it was a bad idea. My girlfriend even asks me why I think about this place so much even tho I was miserable. I’ll just have positive thoughts of “what could have been”…What is the best option to deal with this?

198hr80,Resi Sparky Career Switch,"Hello,  
  
I am a 23 (M) qualified residential sparky that is looking for some advice, insights, ideas, etc.  
  
Last year I quit my resi job (75k p.a) as I felt it was affecting my mental health and physical health. I felt stuck in the rat race and that I was never really going to get to my financial goals continuing my current path. (also burnt out doing o/t during my apprenticeship 10-12hr days for 3 years)  
  
Being a resi sparky is terrible for your health. (breathing in cement dust, fiberglass insulation, etc. and body is getting worn from crawling through roofs and up and down ladders all day.)  
  
My mate got me into a Real Estate sales role but I quit after 3 weeks as I felt like a professional pest and hated the culture of people in that industry.  
  
I have now been unemployed for a month or so and am burning through my savings and need to go back to work. (probably will just go back to my old job until I know what to do)  
  
I am not passionate about anything and barely interested in anything too, I like the idea of ecommerce, or sponsored blog posts but so does everyone, its definitely not for the right reasons.  
  
I need to find something else that I can bare for the next 10-30 years and off the tools as I already hate the idea of going back to my job in the interim.

So I am at this point in school now where I have to decide about what Im gonna be doing next. I currently have 2 offers. 1 from PWC for an dual study in audit which pays around 1300 after taxes. I also have another offer from the deutsche Bundesbank which would pay about 1600 after taxes. Im not shoure which I should choose because on the one hand, climbing the career ladder in audit whould be great but on the other hand the bundesbank is far more relaxing and offers more benefits like 1900 in Pension every month just by working there for 5 years. Also after my degree, im gonna get around 2700 after taxes from PWc and 3100 after taxes from the bundesbank.

198fzjb,How to find other employers for a very niche role?,"Hello everyone! I’m in desperate need of advice.

I’m 23 (about to be 24) making 60k/yr in a WFH role as the “Creative Director” in the marketing department of a fitness brand who’s main income is selling muscle-building training programs and nutrition advice.

My role consists of mainly three primary responsibilities: Email Marketing, Funnel Hacking, Graphic Design, and heading our E-Commerce Store.

Within my role, I’m doing all of the copy, graphic design and segmenting/release of each email to our client list. As the brands “funnelhacker” of our company, I’m creating all of our free digital products that bring in people to our email list - I create the product itself, the sales pages to gather the users information, then I execute the entire email sequence afterwards that brings each new lead into our pipeline of product offerings. 

Another big part of my role is creating all of our print on demand & 3PL e-commerce products (either myself or working with manufacturers), implementing and launching all of these products onto our Shopify store, as well as service as customer service and doing the admin work behind that.

Overall, I love my role and I adore my direct supervisor, but our company would technically be classified as a “startup” or “small business”. 

I’m blessed for the opportunity I’ve been given (and worked hard to get) at my age, but I feel like I’ve hit an income ceiling when I know in larger organizations, I’d be making a lot more money for my role. In addition, I’m working as a contractor, so zero insurance and I’m handling my own taxes through my s-corp on paper. I’m getting to the age where I have to start thinking about that as well (American healthcare, fun…)

My company says they want to pay me more so they’ve offered me a 50% share of all e-commerce store profits, but the sites current earnings would only give me a couple $100 extra a month and I have so little bandwidth to grow the brand in comparison to the rest of my responsibilities.

ALL OF THIS BEING SAID - I am in a very niche role and I have no idea how to find this exact role in another similar ecosystem, especially one that’s WFH and gives me as much time freedom as I currently have.

In the event of things somehow going awry one day, I need a backup plan so I don’t go backwards in my career, especially during this recession.

198f4ht,[Need Advice] Forced to Attend Company Event on My Day Off,"Hey everyone,

I'm in a bit of a dilemma here and I could really use some advice. So, my management is insisting that all employees attend an off-site meet-up at a 3-star hotel this Sunday. They claim it's for our benefit and future growth in the company, but here's the catch - it's on my day off! 

I work in the IT support department, so I fail to see how meeting the VP of sales will directly benefit me. On top of that, they expect us to give up our precious day off for this event. I already have plans for that day(excuse), but when I tried to explain this to management, they just brushed it off and told me to reschedule. 

To make matters worse, the venue is a whopping 28 km (17.3 miles) away from my place. It's not exactly convenient, especially considering it's supposed to be my day off.

I'm feeling frustrated and a little disrespected by this situation. Has anyone else experienced something similar? What would you do in my shoes? Should I stand my ground and refuse to attend, or should I try to find a compromise with management?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",Bannedazz,8,0.7900000214576721,26,1705442032,2024-01-16 21:53:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198f4ht/need_advice_forced_to_attend_company_event_on_my/,1,2024
198f1pz,What to do after UberEATS?,"Hello friends,  
  
I am a directionless English grad who has spent the last two years doing gig work, mostly UberEATS. I was at an education company mid-pandemic and was both losing my mind and not enjoying the work, so I left to barely make money doing gig work. I am happier, but poor.

I've had interviews but can't imagine going back to office work. I'm not even sure I'm all that hireable as a gig worker.

198essy,I don’t know what to do with my career,"Idrk where to start with this. So I’m going to just write what I think I guess.

Some background on myself, I’m 24 (25 this year), I have a degree in pharmacology which I graduated when I was 23 with a first/ 1:1. 

Since graduating uni I’ve had just no idea what to do with myself or what direction I can/should go in with work and my career & its gotten to a point where it’s almost debilitating and something I think about all the time. I always figured that once I finished uni I would find a stop gap job while I looked around for a job working within the pharmaceutical field, or something adjacent. Which I did, i found a job in working in facilities, and applied for any/all jobs I could find within my field or scientific field my degree applied too. And it’s safe to say that after a year of constant rejections for positions (always for application with more experience) I’ve firmly given up on that dream. 

Coinciding with the end of 2023, the temporary position I had also ended, leaving me in this limbo of where to go and what to do next, I figured I should stick with what I have experience in (regardless of whether I liked it - which I don’t) and applied for jobs in and around facilities and operations. I’ve since started a new position and honestly I don’t enjoy it, the thought of waking up 10/15/20 years from now and being in this field makes me feel shit. It brings me no fulfilment, sense of achievement or satisfaction. And if I feel like this after working in a position for just a few weeks, I can only envision it getting worse and worse as time goes on.

The problem I have is at this point in time is I don’t know what I want do, where I want to be or how I’m going to find it. I don’t know what I want from a job or a career anymore that’s going give me that sense of satisfaction I’m craving and I have no idea how to go about finding or discovering it. It feels like there’s so many paths that I don’t know what’s going to be right - it’s not exactly like I can try everything and see what sticks.

I’ve spoken to my parents about these thoughts and feeling I’m having toward my career for advice or suggestions, and I always get the same response, “that I’m putting too much pressure on myself”, “that I’m young”, “a job is a job”, “to just get on with it” “and that’s life”. But I also know that they don’t enjoy their jobs and have only ended up doing them because they had children and need to earn to survive. That’s not the position I want to be in for myself, I want something I’m proud of. 

I’ve also spoken to friends who are of similar age and I know that these are thoughts that most, if not all, young people have and that I’m not alone with it. It still doesn’t make that feeling of impending doom and pressure I put on myself to not “feel like a failure” or to find what I enjoy in my career any smaller. 

I really just don’t know what to do with myself, my life, my career. I don’t wanna just wake up one day and realise I’ve worked 60+ years doing something I don’t enjoy, just because it pays the bills. I wish I was one of those people who just “fall” into something they love 

I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or just to rant and get something off my chest, but anything is welcome. Thanks if you read this far 🙂",MrZinkBMX99,1,1.0,9,1705441249,2024-01-16 21:40:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198essy/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_career/,1,2024
198e943,Networking Question and a small story of my life,"Hello, i am a video/film editor and i have edited 4 DIY and 1 Low-budget Feature film and several short films. Been working on reality TV, TV documentaries etc. The latest feature film that i've edited played in the biggest National festival of my country, in the best international competitive category of the festival. My dream is to work as a film editor, but most of the offers i have are from reality TV.  
In the festival this year, in a party of the festival, a friend of mine, met me to an editor from my country that he is working in A class TV series and Films. We talked about 5 minutes where i told him about the latest film that i´ve edited and that i would like to meet him. He told me to send him an email with the movie to watch it and then we could meet up close and talk about it. I would be very happy to meet this guy, ask him questions on how he is working or guidance on how to break into film industry and even work like an assistant for him. I could learn a lot of things in that position.  
Some days later i sent him a polite mail, with a link of the movie, and my desire to meet and speak about editing and the film in general.  
Ofcourse, he never answered back and it seems logical (1 month passed now). I realized afterwards that asking from someone like him with so many responsibilities and not a lot of free time, to sit and watch a whole movie and then drink a coffee with a total stranger is a bit too much. He was polite enough to say, send me the film and we will talk about it, but that's all.  
Now here comes my question. I would really like to meet this guy, or even ask him for a 10 minute insight on how the things are working in his side.What would be a polite follow up mail? How can you Phrase your desire without looking too much of a needy person or pressure him. I am sure i will have other opportunities to meet him and i could let it be but i would like to improve my networking skills anyway cause i found my self lacking them.I've though of sending a second mail asking him for 10 minute telephone call, but i feel a bit weird about it.  
Anyway i imagine that a lot of you guys may had similar situations and i welcome your answers.+ if you know a good way to learn a bit about networking, book or something i would welcome any ideas.

198c3jl,How do I leave sales,"Burntout SDR looking for a career change

Hi everyone,

I’ve been a BDR for two years. I’ve realized that sales is just not something I want to spend the rest of my life doing. I know you can make so much money as you progress up the ladder but I don’t want to spend the rest of my life cold calling, and managing sales with all the volatility. I know I won’t make the same money but I’d rather be happy and be able to sleep at night.

I have a degree in marketing and have thought about project management, marketing, finance, banking. 

I would love to hear about people who have left sales and found careers that they like outside of sales. I ideally want to get into marketing. Has anyone seen or heard success around this? 

I have a lot of responsibility by family and need to make at least a decent living but I need to get out of sales for my own well-being because it’s honestly ruining my life .",RecommendationBig832,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1705434764,2024-01-16 19:52:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198c3jl/how_do_i_leave_sales/,1,2024

I’ve found that people in other lines of work but who have clients in the same industry that my clients are in are great to know: they can refer clients to me.

One guy who owns a professional services business (but in another line of work), but with clients in the same industry as my clients, invited me to be a coach at a 2-day event. I said yes.  Knowing him and meeting prospective clients at the event would be helpful.

I just discovered, though, that the guy invited one of my competitors to sponsor the event.  So I’d be missing two days of work (meaning two days of not servicing my own clients), and another law firm would be getting its name and services in front of everyone, and the prize package from the event would be given by my competitor, who would thus have the strongest shot at getting clients from it!

198b5er,Out of college and lost,"
I really didn’t think it would come to me asking this on Reddit but I’m stumped. 

I’m a recent college graduate with a degree in marketing. I never got an internship, I feel like I didn’t learn anything applicable in college, and the only people I know from school also don’t have jobs. I basically have no experience, no connections, and no fucking idea what I’m doing. 

I’ve tried applying to at least one job a day but this feels hopeless. Every job I apply to 100 other people with more experience do the same. I genuinely don’t even know what to do or where to start. I feel so behind and every time I start applying again I start stressing until I freak myself out. 

I’m currently getting google certifications and my goal is to move onto hub spot or LinkedIn learning after that, but I feel like even that might not be enough. 

Ultimately I’ve stressed myself into a depression and it’s taking everything in me to not give up but I feel lost. 

Are there any steps I could be making in a direction or anything I could be doing in the meantime while I keep applying?",Emotional_Yoghurt_34,1,1.0,0,1705432468,2024-01-16 19:14:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198b5er/out_of_college_and_lost/,1,2024
198b3k1,Took the WRONG job. Looking for advice.,"I have spent the last 10 years at a large company developing my career and moving up the ranks. I have been in sales and global strategy for a majority of my career (not only at my last company but prior). 

A few months ago I left my previous company and got a significant increase in pay as well as an upgrade in title (VP level position). 

To say I am miserable is an understatement. Essentially I was completely lied to in the interview process and the job I have is completely different from what I I interviewed for. The financials of the company are also completely different from what was initially explained to me. To make matters worse, the owner is one of the worst business owners I have ever seen. The company would be profitable but he cannot control his spending which is putting the company in the whole every month. I am the sole provider for my household and the amount of risk associated to being at this company is just massive. Not only that but I physically cannot stand the job. 

My question is this, what the hell do I do?! Honestly I want to get back on the job market ASAP. But I don't even know how to professionally explain why I am looking for a new job. How would that be looked at by recruiters? 

My initial plan was to stay at least a year and then start looking again, but I honestly do not think I can last that long. 

I have a strong background that shows I don't job hop and have been consistently promoted at every single company I have ever been at, but I just feel stuck on how I can market myself and even what to do next.",Jaded-Mushroom,16,0.8799999952316284,22,1705432337,2024-01-16 19:12:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/198b3k1/took_the_wrong_job_looking_for_advice/,1,2024
198aplv,I'm a 20 year old serial job hopper. I need help taking the right steps to landing long term employment. Hopefully?,"I'm 20 years old and have had at least 15 jobs starting from 16 years old ranging from being a party hostess to being a county clerk. My first position(hosting) was doable for me, but was short lived due to my parents complaining about the distance. I feel ever since I couldn't stay stable.

My mother always wanted me to get an office job so I did. I've had about 4-5, and all extremely short lived because sitting in front of a computer screen all day just wasn't for me. I tried making it work repeatedly because it was something she wanted me to do no matter the company. I even glamorized the idea of having my own personally decorated cubicle while being dressed fancy in a corporate environment, but was never happy when I was physically in the position. I've worked as a cleaner and enjoyed it, but left because I was so used to the routine and got bored. That's my issue, leaving due to boredom. I've had a retail job that I loved, but it was temporary so I had to find something else. Other jobs were warehouse positions through staffing agencies but I can't physically do that due to having severe scoliosis.

I will say no matter the occupation employers loved me because I was a hard worker and would go above and beyond(out of needing to feel active). But the praises unfortunately wasn't enough for me to stay.

During my times of unemployment I had other sources of income which was door dashing. Door Dashing can't work anymore because I got in a car accident last month and my car ended up being totaled. I did have a job(retail) I started just a week before the crash, but they let me go because they couldn't accommodate to my injuries.

My resume looks terrible even if I only list two jobs because they're 6 months or less. I've been thinking of lying on it because I understand no one wants to hire anyone with a fickle history, but I know it's risky. I do want to be stable, but I feel like I've ruined my chances with any employer wanting to hire me. I'm feel like nothing is for me, but I know that's not true. Can anyone help me by leading me in the right direction? I live in Texas if that's important.

TLDR; Currently unemployed, losing hope in life and feeling left behind. I'm 20 years old with 15 jobs under my belt. I URGENTLY need guidance and help taking the next steps.

198aj1p,"Any advice for someone pursuing self taught education, living in a van but wanting to settle somewhere warm?","Hi people, I need some life advice. I'm 33. I have a decent amount of savings in my bank. I am currently living in a van, on holiday in Morocco. I usually live in the UK in my van, I was born in the Isle of Man, I have an Irish and a British passport (this means I can stay and work in Europe, Isle of Man or UK as long as I want). I love hot weather, and cheap countries. I don't have a house or any property, but I do rent a workshop/storage unit for £250 a month in the UK. I am slightly disconcerted about continuing to rent this work shop as it's £250 a month and it would be nice to save that, but it's full of my personal possessions and tools that I know i'll need later in life when I move into a house/smallholding. I don't have any investments yet, but I am researching about them. I don't have a job. My profession used to be a sound technician in the events industry, but i began to dislike it. I am financially able to not have to work and continue my current life for a few years.

  
My short term goals are to continue studying Economics, Finance and Computer Science (I do this online using youtube, khan academy etc), read as much as I can, and exist in the warmth for as little money as possible; which I am currently doing on holiday.

  
My medium term goal is get a job (maybe an internship or 2 to start with) that eventually allows me to go fully remote and travel slowly. Maybe software development in the fintech space, or start a business, or do something freelance.

  
My ultimate long term goal is to settle down somewhere warm and safe on a little smallholding, maybe Spain, but I'm not entirely sure yet if Spain is the right option. I like the idea of Spain due to the language, weather, cost of living, relaxed and liberal attitudes and it’s a decent geographical location to travel around from, and the country is beautiful. Also, there is a decent music and food scene there, which is important to me. Right now I can get the perfect property in Spain for around £25,000 to £30,000 plus a £10,000 renovation budget. I have also considered the Caribbean, South East Asia and South America, but I don’t know if I’d legally be able to live long term in any of those regions.

  
Maybe after I have finished my studies I will have to do an internship for a few months somewhere (hopefully warm), and get an entry level position somewhere after, for maybe a year. My heart yearns to buy a smallholding in the south of Spain as soon as possible, renovate it, and live there and continue fitness and studies, then I can move all my stuff out of the storage unit and save the £250 a month. I'm reticent about this however because it'll be unlikely that I'll get an internship or job anywhere near the smallholding, and maybe I'd have to do the internship in a different country. That means renting somewhere near the internship, or staying in the van on a campsite near the internship. It would be unlikely that I could rent out a smallholding; I’m not sure many people would want to look after it, but I may be wrong.

What is your advice?","There are a lot of details that go into this and my decision may have to be completely personal, but maybe people here can provide some advice. 

I’m 24 and I currently work Job A at a large, stable company in City A making $83,000 plus a 10% bonus in March (which I would be forfeiting if I leave now). I will be getting a raise soon which would increase my salary to $85,000 for this year. City A is about an hour drive (more with frequent heavy traffic) from City B, my hometown, which is where I would like to buy a house this year. I generally enjoy this job, but I’m not totally passionate about it. I worked at this company as an intern for 2 years, and have been working full-time for almost a year. I’m also frustrated because this job was advertised as being hybrid but my manager switched it to fully in-person the same week I started full-time. I hate the daily commute and being fully in-person makes it hard to visit friends/family in City B.

I decided I would search for a new job in May this year, but Company B in City B reached out to me in December. They offered me $85k plus a 10% yearly bonus, plus a $3000 signing bonus (replacing my forfeited bonus at Job A). They’re a much smaller company but they seem relatively stable. It’s in a field that I’m much more passionate about. Also, given that it’s a smaller company, I think I could advance my career more easily here. I asked them if I could start in mid-late February so I could inform my team at my current job and wrap up my projects, but they said they are firm on a Feb 1 start date and need verbal acceptance by tomorrow. 

Company B isn’t in a perfect location, but is much better than Company A. It’s on the opposite side of City B than I would like to live, but it’s very doable. 

I’m just not sure what I should consider aside from salary and commute. I’ve never changed jobs like this before and I’m not sure how to decide or inform my manager if I do leave. I don’t want to screw over my teammates and with a February 1 start date, I would be causing some problems on some urgent projects I won’t be able to finish.

I've been working in the disaster restoration and general contracting industry for the last 7 years, started out as a technician and now I'm in a project management role. 

I make around 115-140k including bonuses, which I'm grateful for.  I also have the ability to make my own schedule for the most part. The caveat is that even if I'm not working...I'm working. I cannot escape it whether it's Saturday morning spending time with my wife or Tuesday at 10pm, people are always calling and due to the industry I can't necessarily just turn my phone off. 

Lately I've just been very tired of the greed and general shittiness in the industry and towards the industry. I don't know how much longer I can make it in the industry before I crack. It seems like adjusters aren't having a much better time than me so I don't think I want to go the adjuster route.

So basically I need some advice on which adjacent industry would be better, I'm thinking of getting my Industrial Hygienist license and trying to work for an environmental company but I'm open to any ideas.

I guess I am posting here to see if anyone else has ever faced something similar. No one in my friend circle has so I only got words of encouragement, and little advice that I could apply/use. I appreciate them and what they're trying to do, but I need advice from someone who has been through something like this themselves and can understand. I guess I am just looking for validation, and a ray of hope. This will be a long rant, so I apologize in advance.

I (37M) work at an IT company in a manager level position. I joined them about 2 years ago after a 5-year stint with a different company. I was a star employee at my previous company and always appreciated for my work, was always given good projects, opportunities, my team loved me, all of it. But my previous employer didn't pay very well, and so I decided to switch. 

The IT company I currently work at pays really well, but the work load is double and the culture is very different, it's a fast paced environment compared to last company, more challenging work. The crowd here is also generally head and shoulders above the crowd at my previous employer, in terms of IQ, talent, you name it. Basically new employer only hires from IVY league or from top companies in the industry. I am not from IVY league but had relevant experience for the opening they had. Somehow made it through the interviews, I am sure I wasn't the first choice for the job.

I struggled to adjust initially - had a lot of imposter syndrome and felt like tiny fish in a huge pond. Felt like I was an idiot who just didn't fit. Over time though I started to get a hang of things, and did fairly ok for myself. But work continued to pile up. Initially I was excited by the challenge, and kept taking on more and more work. 

But now I am struggling. Hard. About 1 year into working with the company, major burnout started to settle in. No matter how many hours I worked or how much work I tried to fit into a day, there was always pending stuff, always urgent stuff that needed to be done right then, always another project that was approaching its deadline. I had spoken to my manager about my concerns, and that I needed help which they assured me that I'll get. But my entire team was so overworked that it just couldn't happen. So I kept going. 

I had a major burnout. Like burnout that paralyzes you and doesn't let you move. I tried to keep going, but it got harder with time. Tasks started to fall through the cracks and now I have complaints piling up (from internal teams. I am not in a client-facing environment). I dropped the ball on many projects, not because I didn't want to work, I tried as much as I could, but there's only so much I could do. 

My manager, who I had a cordial relationship with, is now mad at me and is having to justify all of these complaints and sort it out with the complainants (I am working on it with him, but he's leading the conversations). My confidence and self-esteem are the lowest they have ever been, and I feel demotivated and depressed.

It sucks. I feel like I had built a goodwill over time as a solid team member, and it is now all going down the drain. I don't know what to do. Every time I try to work on one thing, another thing gets messed up. I sort out one issue, another complaint pops up. At this point I feel like I have become a burden on my team. I want to resign, but don't have enough financial security to resign in this bad job market. I have spoken to my partner, and she says I should quit and take some time to recover and work on myself. But leaving my team to clean up my messes seems like a horrible thing to do. But I know if I stay I'll keep causing more issues, because my brain is just frozen and I can't seem to do anything right. 

I don't know what to do, so I guess I am here looking for advice. Please help!

What should I do next?,"My day to day work is fun and mostly deals with ML, web dev and cloud. I occasionally work as PM for few projects. The issue is that these projects are mostly internal or don't bring in much revenue. The revenue I bring in is mostly used to support other people. 

I am expected to work for a client that pays a lot but doesn't have much work. The only reason they hire is to handle bureaucracy. Any work I have, comes from client representative who is famous for being difficult to handle. She makes sexual remarks, questions manliness of guys and complains that she is being discriminated against if we complain about her behavior. Her existence has reduced the quality of work and she trys to control every aspect of work by redoing whatever is done by her juniors. 

Once ever few months my manager asks me to pick up projects for my client but doesn't assign me any. Any project that is assigned to the team goes to others to maximize billables. I have no idea what the client does and want nothing to do with my client representative. I would prefer staying in this job but I am worried that my client would figure out that I am not working for them much and ask me to leave.

1985vmr,Career Crossroads: Seeking Guidance and Opportunities,"Hello everyone, I'm Jake, 29, from Chicago, and I find myself at a major career crossroads. About a year ago, I took a significant risk. I left a stable job where I had successfully built a book of business generating over $100k/month in profit. The reason for my departure, an irresistible offer that started from a message on Linkedin: Triple the salary, double the commission, and comprehensive benefits.  
The first four months in the new role were promising. I managed to build my book to about $35k/month in profit. However, a sudden corporate restructuring across the company drastically changed things. I faced a 65% cut in my income and lost my 401k benefits. In response to this upheaval, I made another bold move. I became an independent agent at a different brokerage, where I could keep 75% of my commissions, but this time without a salary or benefits.  
Currently, I'm encountering several challenges. The economic downturn has severely impacted my business, with a key client recently shutting down. This has made growing my client base exceedingly difficult. As a one-man operation in a saturated industry, I'm juggling sales and operations, which is proving to be quite a challenge.  
I'm now pondering over three options:  
\- Should I persevere in my current role, hoping to ride out the storm and rebuild my client base?  
\- Is it wiser to return to a more stable corporate job, even if it means accepting my losses?  
\- should I consider a complete industry change, leveraging my sales expertise in a new field?  
I have always been committed to hard work and have a natural flair for sales, but this situation is unlike any I've faced before. I would greatly appreciate any advice, insights, or potential job leads from this community.

I want to find a new job and quit, but I am worried how this will look on my resume since I’ve only been at the company for a few months.

197vbi4,33 with 45 different jobs (that I can remember) over a 12 year period.,"Exactly what it says. I’ve excluded 6 years of my work history where I was self employed and going to college. I have an Associates with a focus in Construction Management, a Bachelor’s in Accounting, and am a certified yoga teacher with 200 hours.

All of the jobs outside of when I was self employed, my departure was somehow related to having a panic attack. I either was let go, bolted (flight), no call no show (agoraphobia).

Luckily I’m really good with resumes, and despite the manner in which I may have left most of the jobs, I almost always managed to leave with at least one positive reference from someone higher up.

Fast forward to now. Recognizing that what I’m doing isn’t working and the burnout is coming in hot, decided to make a huge career pivot towards an industry and a position I am passionate about but have zero experience in. My superior is very patient and understanding, and I think we’re both surprised at how well I’m performing.

Day 89, hours away from my 90 day review/assessment, what can only be explained as a series of unfortunate events led to my being let go the morning of day 90.

My confidence, my drive, my enthusiasm, practically my entire personality has deflated since then. That was November 9, 2023. Obviously with my job history, I’m typically a shit employee. When I was self employed, I had a lucrative creative outlet in a setting where I was comfortable, a sense of comraderie with people I worked with, everything I could ever ask for. At this point in time, going back to that line of work is out of the question sadly.

I’m amazed I’ve made it this far with my work history, and now am at a complete loss at where I should go next. Anyone have a ridiculous work history like this? Suggestions? I can’t be the only one… right?",Spare-Garlic-8468,1,1.0,1,1705383649,2024-01-16 05:40:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/197vbi4/33_with_45_different_jobs_that_i_can_remember/,1,2024

197uyo3,How do I push for a bigger raise for a promotion?,"I've been at this company for about 6 years now and they had decided to promote me to Senior Designer during my review last week. They did not tell me how much my raise would be during the review - not sure if that's normal. And also said repeatedly that I was young for the position, but they felt I was mature enough to be promoted. Again kind of weird to express that.

Fast forward to today, my manager notified me by email that my raise is a 5% increase for the promotion which felt low as that is about 4k. I had received about 5k before for a raise the other year with no promotion. 

This was probably a bit rushed, but I asked to talk to my manager privately and to check if that was the only increase they planned to give me. Unfortunately it is, and she had offered instead that she can push for a bigger raise if I decide to move into essentially an associate manager role and manage her other half of the team. 

She'd been unable to find others for the role that she could trust though the red flag was that she said she wanted to save the company money which meant the ones interested were likely requesting high   
(reasonable) salaries for such a high stress job. At this point I was starting to get uncomfortable as it seemed like she did not want go to bat for me again and she was trying to take advantage of me to take on more responsibilities that would alleviate her workload while getting a cheap manager.

In the end I told her at minimum I was expecting a 10k increase for this promotion and I was not interested in a manager role that would deprive me of doing any design work. Also called out to her that my responsibilities would stay as is since I've been performing at a senior level for several years now anyway. 

She told me that she'd think about how to address this with the CEO and higher ups, but she couldn't promise anything. After praising me so much that she could trust me to be her right hand person and the CEO has given me similar compliments, all of a sudden it seems so difficult to give me fair compensation. 

Did I mess up this talk or should I have waited a few days to gather my thoughts before actually discussing to negotiate? I've never done this before and it's honestly very upsetting to know my efforts are being rewarded with a slap in the face. 

They had given me larger pay bumps before, but I think since I'm closing in on 90k and will hit 100k at this rate, they do not want to pay anyone that much unless they are a manager role. I'm not sure how to move forward if they give me another disappointing response as I don't interview well and I'm afraid they might try to drive me out.

197uwhc,Should I disclose medical information in job interview?,"For the past few years I've been dealing with abdominal migraines. They are totally random and can happen at basically any time. Each episode consists of excessive vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pains and headaches, basically I am 100% out of commission for one to two days when I have an episode. Sometimes I will go a few months without an episode, other times it will flare up really bad and I'll have one to three episodes in a single week.

Today I had an interview for a manufacturing job and the manager said his number one priority is hiring someone reliable who will always show up on time when scheduled and I kind of panicked and said that wouldn't be an issue for me without mentioning my health issues.

Should I have disclosed here? I know I don't have to legally but I'm really worried about getting a job without disclosing this information and then having angry managers whenever I have an episode. On the other hand I worry if I do disclose this information then I won't get any job offers.

197utih,Went through 2 layoffs as a leader and this is what I understood,"Was recently part of the board deciding the layoffs for the second time in my career and this is what I noticed was a common theme 

1) Layoffs were not for financial benefit: ultimately they were, but not the way people think. It was both times a marketing gimmick to get stock prices up and not really any cost saving by getting rid of people because we hired almost the same strength within 12 months (second instance - we already have positions up oncareer site in less than 4 weeks). 

2) People who resisted to follow instructions rudely or showed unprofessional behavior were mostly top of the list. 

3) People who were high paid hires but were still just borderline performers (low ROI) were next to go - obviously bad leadership decisions were fixed during layoffs. 

4) People who stayed in their roles longer without much movement were given preferential treatment as that meant they did not have to give them promotions or raises that often. 

5) HR were not involved in these decisions until late in the game (they played bigger role in WARN notice, formalizing communications etc…) 

6) In both my instances race never came into the conversation nor hinted except for a person who played the race card un-necessarily and was removed for sheer toxicity. 

7) There was not major feedback or documentation that was used to really rate people’s productivity, nor direct supervisor feedbacks were reviewed from annual reviews. Department heads (VP and above) had a strong and confident feedback on people. 

What you can manage?  Don’t be a jerk (that you are remembered for being a jerk by department heads) , don’t remain a floater with high pay, be positively visible to your department head.

197uq5k,Deciding between two job offers?,"After a lot of interviewing, I was able to get two job offers recently, and I'm having trouble deciding between the two.

One of the jobs is a mostly remote position where I'll be producing and editing virtual content for an online channel.

The other job would be a Social Media Manager for a company where I'd produce content and oversee all their channels. It would essentially be hybrid where I'd have to go to various locations to capture content, but could edit at home if I wanted.

They both have the same compensation, however, the caveat is that the social media position does not have PTO for the first year, and is paid hourly whereas the other position is salaried. The first job also has a lot of PTO (and more pay if I deny insurance, which I probably would).

I was leaning towards to social media position until I found that out. However, I'm still inclined towards it since I would have a better title, and I feel the work would be more exciting. With that being said having a fully remote job that offers decent PTO is also enticing.

I've recently received an intriguing offer – the opportunity to return to university for a PhD in a biological/chemistry related field. The prospect excites me because the advisor mentioned I could graduate in 3 years, with covered tuition, and significant control over both my research and schedule.
A bit of background, I graduated in 2022 with a master’s in the same field and have been working in the industry since, specifically at a startup. The job is highly stressful, and overall, I'm not very happy. While I've learned a lot, the constant stress has led to some stress-induced tendencies like OCD, which I never had before. Additionally, my confidence in my technical skills has diminished due to unfounded accusations at work. My friends and family have noticed my deteriorating well-being in the last 6 months.
Considering other job opportunities in my field often require a PhD, my question to the community is whether it would be wise to go back to school for an additional three years or seek a new job. Clearly, this decision involves a significant pay cut.

I'm 35, 800k NW, was just laid off from my job of 6 years making approx 240k a few months ago with a decent severance package. I had been saving anywhere from 50k to 70k annually. 

During covid my job went completely remote which gave me the autonomy and freedom I've always dreamed of. Rarely did I get the ""sunday scaries"", I had time to do things during the day, my wife and I got a dog that spends the whole day with me, I'm able to be extremely on top of my fitness and eating habits. 

Sometimes the job sucked, but I would leave my office and be in my living room and everything would be fine. I'm not exactly passionate about what I do but I'm good at it, it was great money and I had a fantastic work life balance. 

I'm interviewing now and fully remote jobs are few and far between making anywhere near my expectations. Most jobs I'm interviewing for are 3 days a week in office making $40k+ less than I was previously. **The thought of doing what I was previously, starting from the bottom at another company, commuting 3 days a week, making less is not inspiring.**

I have also been reading about purchasing a profitable small business and trying to grow it because I really like the idea of building something but I understand that that could take years to replace my previous income with no guarantees and that the prudent choice would be to leverage my almost decade of experience I have. I've mostly written this off as a pipe dream.

I've been trying to figure things out over the last 2 months of unemployment, and took a nice vacation with my wife this month. It feels really good to pursue personal passions and continue the autonomy I've enjoyed. I could theoretically continue to do this until I feel more certain about something but the opportunity cost of continuing to sock away money for an early retirement eats at me. I don't know, anyone have any general advice?",throwaway_01988,1,0.5,0,1705369030,2024-01-16 01:37:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/197qeyw/feeling_lost_about_my_next_step/,1,2024
197q402,Negotiating when offer is already above salary band?,"Hi all,

I'm in a little bit of a confusing situation. The range for a role I've been offered was originally 60,000-65,000. I'm definitely overqualified, but really think the position would be interesting work and my personal finances are in a very strong position so I'm not too fussed about making more money  for the sake of money. When the offer came through, it was actually for $70,000, with the HM noting that they recognize I'm overqualified but a perfect fit, and were therefore able to get a higher hiring budget. This was amazing! The benefits package is stronger than I expected as well, it seems like everyone who works there genuinely loves it, it has a great work/life balance, and it's fully remote; all stuff I really value. 

Here's the rub, I'm actually in the late stages of interviewing with another company. That pay range is 100,000-130,000, should they make an offer tomorrow (which I strongly expect they will). From the outside, it does seem like a more toxic environment, less of a great work/life balance, and it's hybrid with three days in office. I also find the work less interesting.  

I'm wondering what you would do in my situation. Would you negotiate, recognizing that they already gave an offer that was over their stated range but also recognizing that I could be leaving a ton of money on the table? I'm in no universe expecting them to match the other company's salary band (its non profit vs. private consulting work), but it feels like a disservice to myself not to check if 70,000 is a best and final offer when I have this other job in the back of my mind. And how would you go about neotiating without getting them to rescind the offer entirely? I've been unemployed for about 6 months now, and I'm eager to get back to work.

197ofwa,Wanting to work in drastically different fields. What do I major in?,"Want to work in drastically different fields. Not sure what to major in?

Hey Reddit, I’m typing this out because I’m having trouble figuring out exactly what I’m wanting to do/major in and need some serious guidance. I have many passions and while they all have some kind of overlap, their differences are still prominent enough that deciding exactly WHAT do major in has become a serious concern of mine. 

     To begin, I absolutely love the sciences and know for a FACT I want to pursue STEM.

I’m passionate about the medical field and engineering know for a fact that I want to pursue both, but I’m now entirely sure how. 
I’ll start off with what I know I don’t want to do:

I do NOT want to:
Be a care physician. I love people and want to help them/care for them but not like a nurse or doctor would. 



Now my problem: the things I WANT to do:

I’m very interested in biomedical engineering and making real devices to help the body thrive. I actually work with 3d design a lot because of this love and my desire to improve.
     
However I also want to pursue bioengineering and work with the body itself and tissue engineering/looking deeper into the structure of the body itself and work to repair it without surgery if possible. I’ve done some karyotyping work along with forensics and also fell in love.  
     
Next, I want to work in surgery and find myself fascinated with the thought of actually preforming on people. 
     
Then, I want to work with astrophysics and aerospace as I am obsessed with space and what we can explore and want to work in a field that allows for that. But, I also want to explore the ocean as I believe that there are several connections that we can make from the sea to the sky.

So….I’m stuck! I want to do everything at once and it’s killing me because I don’t know where to look/turn to. I love research but DON’T want to be isolated all day. I’m passionate and will work towards anything but I’m at a point that I don’t know exactly WHAT I’m supposed to be focused on.  Does anyone know what I should focus on? And also, what is a realistic goal/major that I should pursue because I don’t want to be at a point where I struggle to find work. Should I choose such specific majors or do something more broad?

More info: 
 I want to double major so how would this affect it? 

I was thinking of minoring in psychology and linguistics to be safe/give me a boost when looking for work but will that actually help?",supportFtMFems,2,1.0,1,1705363661,2024-01-16 00:07:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/197ofwa/wanting_to_work_in_drastically_different_fields/,1,2024
197oa40,What sort of career should a 20f with A levels try for that can be studied at home?,"I'm based in the UK, live at home but don't have anything beyond A levels. I didn't do badly in them, recieved an A in History and Bs in maths and English Lang, but I took them in a year. (History age 17, the other two started and completed within 9 months age 19 whilst working full time. Long story that was out of my control)

I've been working minimum wage jobs, because I'm not sure what I want to try for. Accountancy, economics and the like have been suggested, but despite being good at maths, I dislike it, and I don't think I could do it myself learning at home from a textbook.

You see, I come from a culture where we marry young. I can't commit to staying and studying for 3 years in a university when i may need to move city. (I definitely intend to live in England though.)

I love English and History and anything related. But I've searched for online degrees in English and couldn't find anything beyond Open Uni, which is a great thing but I have A levels. Plus, will an English degree help me find a job? (If there is one thing I'm certain of, it is that i do not want to teach.)

I completed a copywriting course, but I couldn't find a position in the marketing sector, and I'm struggling to go freelance. 

To clarify, whether I will remain in the same city is unknown, but that would not stop me from applying for/taking a job. 

I know it's a tall order. But I really feel like I need to start studying, figure things out. Any and all advice would be highly appreciated.

I worked for this program in a different capacity years ago and returned last year to take the reins. I deeply regret it.

197nn7i,How to be patient for career growth while in the hole financially?,"Hi all,   
  
I’d love to get different perspectives on the situation I’m in because I don’t know how to move forward objectively. Sometimes I find myself being too greedy, and other times I feel like I’m holding myself back. I’ve been a chronic under-earner for years (which is no one’s fault but my own!) and until recently I was okay with floating by with low pay as long as I have great benefits, security, and understanding that the firm I’m with has ample growth opportunities in the future. However, I dealt with a serious illness recently and though I've recovered, I’m finding myself barely getting by to cover all the medical bills on top of everything else in life. I’ve cut spending in every possible area, even listing random household items on Facebook marketplace at this point.   
  
For background– I’m a 30-year-old woman living in the Northeast USA and I support myself. I’m currently a Legal Assistant with a growing insurance coverage law firm but have also worked in Information Governance, SaaS, Business Consulting, and Customer Service industries in the past. I am confident that I could find myself in a better spot financially if I start applying to new jobs… but it’s conflicting. I’ve only been with this firm for 8 months and told myself to at least make it 2 years and best case scenario stay indefinitely because it’s a great place to work (literally, the pay is the only huge downside, I am immensely grateful). I think I’m also afraid of leaving because I have a job-hopping history and I want my resume to have more staying power. My skills and experiences are unique and I’m an insanely hard worker, but even I know I look flighty on paper alone. I’m also self-aware of my age now playing a factor in job prospects too so I’m trying to be mindful.   
  
I’ve already tried to negotiate a more substantial raise but they didn’t budge. Maybe if I had a job offer on the line that could be leverage, but I’m not sure if I am getting ahead of myself. I know I’ve accomplished so much in this job so far, but I’m still in an entry-level position and this firm is very focused on gaining respect through longer tenure, so I don’t have much power. It’s just so conflicting. Following money alone for the sake of my health and security? Or being patient, practicing gratitude for even having a job, and cutting costs creatively to get by? Hell, I even debated on getting a 2nd job waiting tables or something, but because I was so ill I’m afraid that’d put even more strain on my immune system.   
  
Any thoughts or advice? Preferably from a parental wisdom point of view because I could use some warm yet tough love. I’m probably overthinking it all but my analytical brain loves to make me suffer.

197m1ca,"Independent Musician/Artist: ""Doing Well"" but Seeking Change and Advice with Moving Forward and Sorting Finances Out","Hey r/careeradvice, 

Posting on a throwaway account so I can be totally transparent and honest.

I'm a 30 year old independent musician in the indie/pop/songwriter space, feeling burnt out and needing to reconnect with my creativity.

I have a few musical projects that are doing quite well, and I run a social media consultancy/artist consultation service for private clients based on my industry experience, and I also teach private piano and guitar lessons.

I currently have no home, and live wherever I can. I have spent the first two weeks of the year at my folks' place, but will be touring from Feb -> April in a different city every day before moving over to Australia.

When I say ""Doing Well"", this is what I mean:

MUSIC WORK:

Artist project 1 - Main project: \~50,000,000 streams to date, 165k monthly listeners (of the 10 million artists on Spotify, I'm currently \~top 40,000), represented by a small-but-growing label with a roster of 30 artists (and 25 Grammy nominations), social circle well connected; Grammy winners, multi-plat producers and songwriters, high level touring artists, right the way down to grassroots and DIY artists/venues, etc. Have been doing this for 13 years full-time, so found some long term friends who have done well.

Artist project 2: Recently launched (December), campaign via my social agency, immediately at 40,000 monthly listeners. 1.5m views on Tiktok in 4 weeks. I liked the sound of this particular project as it was more organic and ""authentic"" than my indie-pop side. Would like to do more with this. 

Artist project 3: Ambient/Neoclassical, smaller, around 500k streams a year (so negligible for income in comparison to the others).

Touring: Pre-COVID, I was performing \~150 shows a year. Since COVID, the grassroots venue scene has changed. I'm performing less than before, but bringing in some money through this. Financial breakdowns to come.  


Social Media Business:

\- 100,000,000 views every Quarter across my Social Media Accounts, 2m+ comments a month across Tiktok, high engagement and a powerful tool for organic traffic. Use this to run campaigns for musicians, submitted to me through various submission websites. Can't help but feeling like I'm undervaluing the space here. Surely this could be a paid advertising space for some? 

\- Strategy and campaigns for other artists (this is longwinded work that I don't enjoy but it can pay well)

\- Consultation/one-to-one education and development with artists

&#x200B;

Teaching:

\- Private Guitar, Piano and Production teacher (used to have lots of pupils but let them all go for touring purposes)

&#x200B;

\-----

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

FINANCIAL BREAKDOWN AND THOUGHTS

&#x200B;

I was running the business at around break-even before COVID. Every bit of money I made on tour I reinvested in recording and making songs and growing this thing. I was gathering momentum and doing a few hundred shows a year. Then COVID happened and I had to cancel 150 shows, losing all guarantees, and couldn't claim much money from other sources.   


Over 2020, I took out loans to cover my living expenses. I have no family money, and no real connection with my family financially - long story - but I ended 2020 with around £20,000 worth of debt to my name.   


I couldn't get myself back on track in 2021, because both of my parents were unwell/hospitalised at various points throughout the year. It meant having to split my time between being at home with them, and being in my sublet in a European city.

By the end of 2021, I had 30k debt from this time, and no way to pay it off. So I raised capital through a private equity investment on a 70% share of my streaming revenue for a 4 year term, for the value of £40,000. They will make around £50k back from this, but it allowed me to pay off most of my debt.  


A few years later, and things have taken a while to get back on track, and I've had lots of looming deadlines from the label, and lots of other stresses in my personal life to deal with. 

I have managed to complete all of the recordings that were asked of me by the team, and will have them uploaded and pitched through internals by the end of the week for an early March release. I'm touring Feb -> April, but after that I'm ""free"". I need change. 

&#x200B;

STREAMING INCOME: \~£15,000 P/A

TOURING INCOME: \~£10,000 P/A

SOCIAL MEDIA INCOME: \~£12,000-15,000 P/A

TEACHING INCOME: \~£5,000 P/A

CONSULTATION INCOME: \~ £2,500 P/A

PRODUCTION INCOME: \~£2,500 P/A

&#x200B;

I'm overpaying on my investment advance on the streaming income, so 100% of that goes. From the touring income, around 30% goes on personal expenses/insurances/whatever, social media income is a timesink but at least I can work from home, teaching is always possible but finding pupils is a job, and I would like to do more consultation and production, but the idea of being hired as a critical mind/valued input in someone's artistic vision is a pipe dream.   


I want to move. I'm planning on relocating to Melbourne in May. I need change, I need inspiration, and finally I need a home that is mine and somewhere to put roots. 

  
I would like to use my residual streaming income (I also will receive all 100% of new material that isn't invested catalogue), and social media income to pay for rent. I would like to get a 2 day a week lil cute cafe job for the sake of community, and to leave the artist ego to the side for a brief moment. Make friends, earn some small cash, give myself a breather. I would like to rent a 3 bed place to myself, these cost around £1750 in the locations I like. I could turn bedroom 2 into a studio room, and find clients to teach, produce for, and live from that, the social media work, a part time job and the residual streaming. That sounds the most sensible to me right now. But is it? 

I have developed such a position in the industry that I can't ""give up"" now. Art is the only thing I'm here to do. The rest of it - the social media businesses, the production work, the talking about it all - are all means to find the financial freedom to create more. I don't want to do anything else. There's literally nothing else on planet earth I want to do than to sit and create and not have to do these sideline gigs to make it happen, and despite being in the top 0.04% of artists, I can't do that yet. So I'm trying to figure this out.   


How can I best capitalise on my position here? I'm a little overwhelmed and would appreciate any advice.   


Sorry to ramble.   
Thank you for reading and for your time! :)

197lf6s,Confused what I should do…,"Here is my situation...

I work in finance. I worked at a very large employer in Healthcare for five years. Left in October 2021 finally because an offer literally fell in my lap. My current company headhunted me and alongside getting me more money an hour, offered me 401k (with match), cheaper medical benefits then my existing employer, and fully remote status. When I accepted the new job, I went from a salary of $48k to $55k (plus bonus potential). When I started my new job, I found out that my new company did not match the 401, that was in fact a lie and the medical benefits were more then originally mentioned when trying to recruit me. 

Old job: $48k a year, 401k but no match, could make my own hours, no monthly bonuses, medical benefits were way too expensive so I couldn't afford it, hybrid status (1 day from office, 4 from home), company culture was ok and great team to work with, very laxed work environment.

New job: $55k a year, monthly bonuses if I hit my metrics, 401 but no match, affordable medical benefits, fully remote, culture is ok and team is so but my manager is HORRID. This place has also turned me down twice for a raise, stating I'm at the highest pay scale with my bonuses (which aren't guaranteed) and they'll ""consider me next year"", very very strictly monitored work/lots of micromanagement.

I am now in a position where my old company has restructured, changed some negative ways about them and is now recruiting me back. They are offering me $65k/yr ($10k increase), their medical benefits have dropped down to an affordable price, still with the normal 401k and no match, I can make my own hours, but would still need to go back to a hybrid status, which they've now changed to four days in office and one day from home, management is good there (I know them). 

New proposed job: $65k a year, no bonuses, normal affordable benefits, can make my own hours, hybrid (now 4 days office and 1 day home), 401, good management, husband works there, more relaxed work environment.

197kjmm,Middle manager hired to manage me. Good or bad for career development?,"Hello everyone.
So i am currently experiencing the following situation and would love some advice/reassurance. 

I work as a campaign coordinator for 5 months now. This is my first big boy job but I have done 2 internships for a total of a year before that and that is what got me the job in the first place. In both of my internships my managers left 3 months into my internship( i know, what a coincidence) and I was left doing a bit chunk of their responsibilities (planning, copy, digital, stakeholder alignment with web and product teams etc)
I gained a lot of value from that and especially in my second internship where i was working directly with the director of marketing as another manager between us left so she was the first in line left to manage me. I even was the one training the next manager when he came. This gave me a lot of value and knowledge in the industry and really cemented my desire to continue working in marketing.

Well fast forward to now and guess what! I am getting a new manager again 5 months into my first job.  I am currently managed by a senior manager and the position they will open will be for a non senior one. 
The new manager will be doing exactly what i do as the reason he is hired is mainly to support with the work load but also to have more experience than me. So this makes him more experienced than me but less experienced than my current manager.

I want to know do you think this is in a way cementing my position as a junior and limiting my ability to grow or is it possibly a good thing? I have already been proving myself to my manager for 5 months so i feel like when this new person comes it will delete 7-8 months of my value and destroy any chance of me becoming senior by the EOY. I am really ambitious about my personal goal as well as the company ones and was definitely planning on wanting a promo after 1.5 years. Do you think that new manager destroys this possibility or it will not affect it? 

I am open to your advice and recommendations! Thanks",OwnHall224,1,1.0,1,1705354192,2024-01-15 21:29:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/197kjmm/middle_manager_hired_to_manage_me_good_or_bad_for/,1,2024
197kgt8,"I have a very Senior-level resume, but it seems to be hurting me rather than helping.","**TL;DR: I want to work, even if it isn't a VP or Senior-level position. Am I just a casualty of the ""you're overqualified"" mentality? If so, how can I fix address that and find work?**

Hey folks.

**Some context:** I have twenty (20) years of experience in employee benefits and working with HR teams across multiple industries. My firm is closing/selling at the end of the month because my partner is retiring, so I was hoping to use this opportunity to move into a new(ish) industry (ie, from benefits/HR in insurance and finance to benefits/HR in something else). They know I've been looking and fully support it. My resume states I'm a VP at my firm, a senior benefits specialist, and that I'm getting my SHRM-SCP in May/June.

**How it's going:** In four (4) months of job searching, I've had exactly one (1) reply, which was in my current industry. I reached the final interview with the Department Director, and they even said how impressed they were with my experience, knowledge, and attitude - but then I was ghosted. I'm fine taking a 'lower-level' job and working my back up; I just care about being able to provide for my family. If I were older I would assume that could be a factor, but I'm not.

**My questions:**

- Did I just happen to pick a *terrible* time to job hunt?
- Are HR departments/recruiters looking at my LinkedIn/resume and automatically assuming I won't settle for a 'lower-level' HR/benefits specialist job?
- If so, how can I remedy that?

I've always hated the ""you're overqualified"" mentality because I was taught that everyone has something to contribute and learn, but it feels like that's the trap I've fallen into.

197ka89,I feel lost any advice?,"Hello everyone,  
I'm seeking advice on starting my career. I just turned 25 and looking into something more stable as I just had my fist child. Brief overview on my employment history:  
I started my first ever job at McDonalds at 14 years old - loved it at first then hated it after my first paycheque. I don't look at McDonalds employees as anything less than me but it just wasn't for me and (sorry if this sounds awful) I felt like I worked way too hard for the amount I got on my first paycheque. I left after a year and then I started window cleaning at age 15 doing some commercial stores as a side hustle paying much more than McDonalds. I still do window cleaning to this day but during the winter when it's slow I average about $1300 per month. Anyways, from the age of 14 to about 19 I worked a few retail jobs at the mall as a typical high school student would as well.  
I then did 1.5 years of university in Economics and then transferred into Marketing. I stopped because I didn't feel like it was for me. I cam back to my hometown after that uni experience and started my own airbnb business which was amazing. It was airbnb arbitrage so I would pitch homeowners to see if I can put their spaces up on airbnb. I did very well in my first two years scaling revenue to about $450k and was profiting about 30% after break-even.  
Then, the pandemic hit and I lost more than half of my portfolio as I got cold feet and didn't know what to do as it was my first experience with business. I still hav two units bringing in about $1700 net per month on average. I don't really enjoy it anymore and I was looking into possibly schooling or other business ventures but I just feel lost. Should I start a business? Should I even go back to school? If I go back to school should I start a new program or finish up where I left off with my marketing degree?   
Any advice or tips would be amazing! I know the overview is kind of all over the place so if anyone needs more info or clarity feel free to ask! ",1337w3t,1,1.0,0,1705353566,2024-01-15 21:19:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/197ka89/i_feel_lost_any_advice/,1,2024

I know I made mistakes in college: didn't do enough research on what careers actually looked like, didn't do any internships, only aimed for passing grades, didn't make enough connections.

This has led me to start considering applying to the community college in my city and learning a trade, since I've read that these programs are often much more career-focused than a four year degree, often connecting students directly with employers by the end of their time there.

I’m having to learn a new software that’s quite technical, manage a new book of business that includes in depth understanding of the ins and outs of the media world as well as how my clients’ businesses operate, on top of that contribute to the customer success team in terms of thought leadership and account growth strategies, and ontop of that manage 2 direct reports.

Is it normal to be feeling this way?

Because I’m not up to speed yet I find myself second guessing everything I’m thinking of saying in meetings, not participating as much as I think I should, and in general not being this confident and strategic person that I sold myself as in the interview process.

197g8f7,31 years old and considering a (second) career change from Software Developer to Mechanical or other type of Engineer,"When I was graduating high school, I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I was always quite good at math and science, so a lot of people suggested engineering, but for some reason, that made me not want to do it. 

I transferred schools and switched majors several times, but ended up with a social science degree. I took math classes for fun, even though they weren’t required. I took calculus 1, 2 and 3 for engineers, linear algebra, and discreet mathematics and got a 4.0 in all of them. They just filled the same credits where other people were taking “history or rock and roll"" or ""skydiving"". 

For two years, I worked in sales and analytics and was miserable. It wasn't surprising, I knew none of the jobs for my degree were a good fit. I wanted more math, and I had heard software engineering could be self taught, and used a lot of math. So I started teaching myself, and got a job as a software developer within a year. 

6 years later, I am so sick of software development. I like the problem solving, but the way projects work is killing me. I have worked for companies with 20 employees, all the way up to 50,000. All the ""Agile"" stuff seems like BS to me. projects just go on and on, and theres no phases. I feel like everything is a feature factory. 

It's not just the project stricture, but what i am building. i want it to be a part of the real world. Id love to get into a lab and build and test a real physical product. I'm sick of just moving data around. 

So I've been thinking about going back to school and becoming an engineer. Maybe a mechanical engineer, or a civil engineer, or a structural engineer. Im most interested in things like public transportation, and renewable energy. 

I would love to hear from people who have done something like this and whether or not they thought it was worth it. 

Another thing is that I worry about compensation a bit. I  currently make $165,000 a year, which isn't all that high in my HCOL American city. Im doing better than scraping by, but cant really afford the homes in my city. I know that I do not want to let the ""golden handcuffs"" keep me in a job that makes me miserable, though.

197esee,Unsure of if I should make a career change because of pay-cut.,"For some context I am a 30 year old woman in a midsized Midwest city. I’ve been in the current industry to 12 years. I work hourly/comission. On average per year I work 28-32 hours a week pulling in about $90k a year give or take a couple thousand. I have a lot of flexibility with my time off and genuinely enjoy the work I do and the small local business I’ve been with for 7 years.  I’m able to live comfortably while maxing out my Roth IRA and providing myself with healthcare coverage and a decent amount of yearly savings and other investments. I have no debt, I’m single, with no children. 

A persons longevity in this industry is hard to predict. Most people 40yo+ turn to the side of ownership, but I’m not sure that’s something I’m interested in. 

I’ve been curious about becoming an electrician lately. Applying for a union apprentice job. The qualms I have about this is, for one, I’ll be taking a substantial pay-cut for an estimated 4-6 years. That paycut will also come with a big increase of work load and hours plus a loss of flexibility with my personal life. The upside is the longevity of career stability, pension, healthcare, etc. 

To be blunt, I’m also terrified to start a new career at 30 years old.

197cqsv,"Dream job at 28/29 - start at entry level, yes or no?","Hi everyone,

Need help making a decision about my desired career path but having to start at entry level? 

I want to keep this short but sweet and need to make sure I'm covering all basis. I'm going to lay out my background first so that it provides context.

Background 

- 28 year old earning £35k and excluding bonus in a city that I went to uni in (UK)
- work in sales - title has manager in it, however I don't manage people - think account manager for example. I do not particularly enjoy it and not interested in the industry I work in at all
- have a 1st class degree in music (I know) but with a focus on a very relevant technology that is being utilised now with AI and how this technology could be implemented into industries.
- my experience pre and post uni ranges from business development, sales, operations and market research - it's all quite varied and this is part of my problem
- I recently broke up with my girlfriend and don't really have a support network here in this city, as well as no real reason to remain here 

Situation 

I'm itching for a career path that I can grow in, within a particular industry, and that I enjoy the daily aspects. I love managing people and I had a taste of project management in my previous job which I loved. NOW here's the thing - I got offered a grad role in a management consultant company, starting in September 2024 (I'll be just turning 29). It's a big company 3500 consultants, offices in over 19 countries, and the role is within an industry I find fascinating, an industry in which I could see myself grow in as a proper career long term - it genuinely feels like my dream job. 

Issues 

The downside is this role is offering my current salary £35k, but in Euros as it's not in UK. The standard of living in the new city will be extremely high and it'll be a change for me than my living standard now. The company promote every year of being there - this is evident of all grads I've checked on linkedin, and I also know a senior consultant who works there too. So I think after a year or two I'd be back to my equivalent salary or probably more, however I'm reluctant to do this for two years. More so just having to live on a not great salary, not feel adequate as I'll be 29/30 on a not so great salary, can't save etc etc. I have quite a bit £17k in a Lisa and about 4/5k in savings and want to continue to grow this.


At the minute I already feel behind in life not being in a career I see being anywhere near long term, I hate the industry, I dont see salary growth potential in sales unless you move to different industries, which would likely mean moving to entry level again in another industry I don't find interesting. I don't see sales as a long term career. 

Question

I guess the question is obvious, should I jump at this even though I feel like saving money is important now and I won't be able to do this for 2 years, maybe a bit longer? I know if I stick at it, in 3/4 years it'll pay off and I'll regret if I don't take it but man it's such a tough decision to 'start from the bottom' in an industry when I'm this age. 

Could anyone please give me advice? Ask me some probing questions to delve a bit deeper so I can make an informed decision etc - I'd really appreciate it...

197aqqw,I'm really confused and lost. What career path should I go into?,"I'm a UG 3rd year student majoring in Computer Science. I detest my degree. Programming, data structures, AI, etc....really not my thing.  
I'm looking for an opportunity to get into a non-IT job. I'm very good with people, communication, team management, leadership, negotiation, and problem solving all of which have been tested and tried successfully.  
I plan to work for two years after graduating college. Relationship management, sales, and marketing caught my eye at first. I even landed a job in sales, but I didn't take it(other concerns).  
After two years of work, MBA. I want the pre-MBA job experience to align with my MBA specialization(is that really important, though?), which brings us to the next question.  
Specialization is important to consider because it will define my career. I was considering International Business because I'm learning French, and intend to learn more languages. However, the salary isn't compelling, given that I'd be paying off the MBA college debt for the first few years of working. Human Resources seems like a better option, in terms of salary, but not much of any career advancement(from what I can see). I'm overwhelmed by all the options. I'm considering marketing and operations(considering because I'm good at problem solving and analysis) as well since they're higher paying, with career advancement opportunities.  
If it helps, here's a little experience I've had:  
President of a college club(1 year - managed HR, communication, operations, PR, leadership, etc.)  
Market research intern(1 month - negotiation, research, communication, data collection, market research)  
Junior Manager intern(6 months - cold calling, sales, marketing)  
Content writer part-time(8 months - SEO, article writing, editing, proof-reading, etc)  
Please note that I may be wrong about a few assumptions I made. I haven't even started my career yet. I'd really like some help figuring things out.

Should my pre-MBA job align with my MBA specialization(and post-MBA job)?

1978ipl,My wife needs purpose,"So, my wife is feeling lost and a little worthless of late. We had children young (we’re 30) and used to work in care out of necessity rather than want as she never went on to college or university. It’s a shame because she’s very intelligent, far more than myself, I’ve just been lucky as I’ve ended up in a well paid job through shear luck than skill and self taught myself skills to further my work.

She’s been stuck being a mum for two years whilst our youngest was a baby and at nursery etc and our second eldest has Autism and was removed from school as they couldn’t meet his needs. He’s been in limbo for two years also with no school but that is to change come September when he goes to a specialist school. At the same time, our youngest is due to start school too and so, my wife is hoping she can finally reenter the working world.

But, she feels like it’s impossible for someone who’s currently untrained, unskilled and inexperienced besides care work of which she could easily excel if she wanted too, but she doesn’t want to go back into care work, to find other employment. 

She’s looking at becoming a nurse, but isn’t sold on it as she is worried she is just doing it because she has nothing else to go into. She’s open to paying for education and/or courses but ideally, can’t do college due to child restrains (I work full time 0800-1730). 

Does anyone have any advice they could give on what avenues she can look into? She’s extremely organized, her time management is amazing, excellent communicator and team manager. I personally believe she’s wasted in care work and can achieve so much if she knew where to focus.

Due to financial reasons, I had to defer for a year and am now supposed to start in August 2024. In the meantime, I've been selected for a 6-month Traineeship at NATO, which is a tremendous opportunity for me and I'll accept it for sure.

The university informed me that I could attend the first year online but without scholarships and paying the full tuition (only for the first year; the second depends on whether I receive a scholarship). Coming from a poor family, I can't easily afford $30,000.

What do you recommend I do? The options are three:

Give up the Master's for this year and, with a stronger resume (thanks to the NATO Traineeship), reapply next year.

Take out a loan and finance the first year of college.

I’m 29M and live in the UK. 

  
This year I really want to turn my life around and I have mapped out a few things already.

  
One thing that I do need to fix is my job and look at an actual career. For around the past 5 years I have been working in factories/warehouses and I absolutely hate the roles as well as most of the people that work in those environments. It suits few people, I have met some good ones but generally speaking it just isn’t for me.  
  
Now…

  
(1)	I have a small amount of debt (around £5k) that I’ve arranged to pay over the next few months so by the summer it should pretty much be gone.   
  
(2)	I do not drive which limits my options but I am going to start lessons once I’m more stable financially.  
  
(3)	College is pretty expensive; I wouldn’t be able to afford to attend in September when they restart as well as live on a part time wage.  
  
(4)	I don’t hold any impressive qualifications nor did I attend university for a degree etc. I am pretty smart, I’ve just messed around for the majority of my life for numerous reasons that aren’t important right now.   
  
  
  
I’d like to know what paths I could take from here.   
  
I really enjoy learning, get on well with other people and I am more than capable and confident enough to perform by myself.  
  
The bigger picture is I’d like to go from earning borderline minimum wage to a comfortable living salary. So £23/£24k to £35k+.   
  
My mind is open to any suggestions as to where I could begin, steps that I could take, careers that are achievable etc.   
  
Any information or bit of guidance at all would be massively appreciated.   
  
Thanks all!

19732y1,What can I do?,"To preface: I'm 20 male I didn't and won't go to college (funds and I have no desire to) and I don't have many skills.

I was talking to a friend of mine (also 20m) and he is making about 50$ and he puts piping in for pools and when he use to dig the holes for pools he was making 20-30. He also started a small towing business. He told me to start as a laborer and work my way up (that's what he did). I mentioned how I don't want to do back breaking labor as I already have many injuries specifically in my joints at my age. But he said it's not that hard and I shouldn't be in that position long if I learn sim skills. 

I believe him and I think it's mostly a good idea but idk where to start. How do I apply to these places that require 2+ years of construction or other skills or certifications or are 45 mins away from me on the highway. My idea was to go to one of the many current operations near me and ask for a job. But he said they won't even bother if you don't have gear (PPE) and tools. Which I have tools but a very cheap harbor freight set with a cheap impact and drill combo from Milwaukee. 

So ig what I'm asking is why should I do to get a job that I can, preferably, quickly move up in. I have goals beyond work but that require a lot of money and I don't want my body destroyed by time I get to those plans. Also I have a PC although I don't have many skills on it (light coding but everyone has a bit of coding skill) I plan on learning how to video and photo editing and shoot stuff. Hell if I could work from home I'd love that but that unlikely for me and my position.

Sorry I got of track. So again what should I do. You can be harsh, ik I'm trying to have my cake and eat it too. Thank you.",Iwanttolive87,1,0.5,0,1705304030,2024-01-15 07:33:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19732y1/what_can_i_do/,1,2024
1972ccg,I feel like I am being scammed.,"When I turned 18, I had no ambitions of going to college. I spent most of my high school years doing stupid shit and the area I grew up in didn't provide any opportunities outside of getting a job after high school. Eventually, I started working 2 to 3 jobs at a time to make ends meet. I remember one day I was working a landscaping job and it was just a really hot day and I thought to myself that I didn't want to do this for the rest of my life (and by this I meant working 80 hours a week at these mediocre jobs that didn't pay me shit and destroyed my body). I figured the best thing I could do was go to college and get a degree. The next year, I enrolled at a tech school and still worked these jobs eventually earning my associate's degree.  


Currently, I am working on my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a dual focus in Cybersecurity and Cloud development and a minor in Data Science. For the past year, now that I have a significant amount of knowledge and years of work experience, I have been trying to find an internship. From what people in my field have been telling me, most companies want people with some level of internship experience when being considered for Full-Time roles.   


Currently, I have received nothing but rejection letters. I have applied to over 100 companies and have yet to hear anything close to scheduling an interview. I was invited to do a coding interview for a really serious financial analytical company but I was ghosted when they said they would contact me about the next steps. I have had my resume checked and vetted more times than I could count, I am pretty good at communication and having a conversation (unlike some people in engineering), and I have really good references. I don't need a job at Microsoft or Apple or anything, I applied to any company that was hiring for positions related directly to my current degree (Data and Cybersecurity roles primarily; I also applied to a few Systems roles and Software positions as well).   


I had to prolong my graduation for a year just so I could devote my time to trying to gain meaningful experience. Now I am starting to feel like I'll get through my degree and the only place that will hire me is the Amazon Fulfillment Center (I know Amazon is a great company and they do hire college grads regardless of the degree but I would like to do something in my field) up the road. It has been an uphill battle for the past seven years trying to earn my bachelor's degree between things like COVID and having to pay for school out of pocket because my financial aid was garbage. Everyone says I'm overreacting but I grew up very poor and I didn't have shit until I became an adult; since I started school I haven't been able to save as much, and with no support from my family, my savings have been slowly dwindling. I'll have enough to make it through graduation but with my student loans and my current job outlook, I just feel like I'll end up wasting all this time and money just to end up worse than I was almost ten years ago.",orthogonal-vector,3,0.800000011920929,2,1705301187,2024-01-15 06:46:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1972ccg/i_feel_like_i_am_being_scammed/,1,2024

196y9h1,More of a rant than anything,"As the title says this is more of a rant than anything, but I also have some advice as well. Well here goes:

I live here in the U.S. in what we call an at will employment state, and for very few instances I can see the benefits of ""at will"" employment. However, there are a few instances where this kind of arrangement can really suck, and while it doesn't happen often, when it does happen it is bad. The situation I'm talking about is transfer of ownership. 

Up until recently I was the General Manager for a restaurant where I had started out as a team member and worked my way up to GM in 3 years, and had been the GM for the last 2 years. I was with this restaurant for 5 years before the owner decided to retire and sell the restaurant to someone who now owns 23 other locations besides the one I was at. Anyways we had to keep the sell of the business secret from employees not in management (for obvious reasons), but for some reason still raised some red flags for me. Then after the deal was officially completed every employee at the 3 newly acquired locations (21 people total) had to redo all of the hire paperwork, which happens with a transfer of ownership. 

Now for the juicy part, within 48 hours of transfer of ownership, and redoing the paperwork the new owners fired two of my best employees due to ""conflicts with availability"" and had already hired 2 others without bringing me into the loop which raised a red flag for me. I immediately started looking at open positions available in my city because I felt like I was about to get cut out completely, and man was I right. 

Within the first week they had terminated 3 team-members, 1 shift lead, and 1 of the other GMs, and had already replaced all of them. This meant that only 16 of the original 21 employees remained by the end of week 1. By the end of week 2 they had terminated 2 more team members and the other GM and replace the team members, but not the GM. This meant that only 13 of the original 21 employees remained. By Thursday of week three they terminated 2 more team-members and 2 more shift-leads due to ""availability conflicts"". This meant that only 9 of the original 21 employees remained, or should I say 8 because I received my termination letter the following morning. What for you might ask??? You guessed it ""availability conflicts"". As far as I can tell every one of the 12 employees terminated before me were told it was because of ""availability conflicts"". But you could tell they were just clearing house and bringing in people they knew. 

Moral of the story, no matter who you work for, if you're in the U.S. and live in an at will state and your business comes under new ownership, start browsing other career opportunities. When they start terminating employees start filling out applications, and when they start terminating frequently get another job offer and jump ship before you can lose income.",MalevolentLord4479,1,1.0,0,1705287904,2024-01-15 03:05:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/196y9h1/more_of_a_rant_than_anything/,1,2024

 I also have done a decent job of letting my co workers, primarily my higher ups, in on my personality at the surface. I’ve also proven commitment - I travel for work events even when I didn’t have to, volunteered to help out and I made a good impression on some donors. 

NOW, my supervisor wants to teach me to be a relationship manager with our family donors.

I am good at hiding it but I have some social anxiety that is still hard for me to overcome. I Can be quick witted but I’m not really much for long conversation. I kind of dim out in a way that I think other people notice or think I’m not engaged but it’s because I ran out of words.

First post here. Currently in payroll sales, doing good currently top 20 in country. Not really enjoying it. I like solving problems and using my brain and I feel like sales is solving one problem and I really don’t enjoy going out and looking for people with problems to solve. Plus the PR industry is pretty cutthroat and has terrible implementation and customer service and I feel bad when my company can’t deliver on promises. I also am 100% an extrovert and hate the outside sales or remote sales environments. I get lonely. 

Here is what I’m thinking. 

Masters in finance and go into commercial banking. Not really into the Wall Street life.

Or making some transition into HR or marketing as I have some level of experience in it. 

Or I have a background in insurance and especially payroll workers comp. Should I look at relationship management for a underwriting carrier? 

Is there anything else I should look at? I love to solve problems and be creative.",Agile-Arugula-6545,2,1.0,1,1705284119,2024-01-15 02:01:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/196wzmw/sales_to/,1,2024

196wvs3,"Hate my career path, but it's too late to make a change","Hi all,

I'll start by saying I know my title isn't 100% accurate, but it's how stuck I feel. I (29f) do hate my career path, but I know (somewhere.. deep **deep** down..) that it's not to late to make a change. Some background: I took up this career path in 2011 as a passionate response to some political events that took place in my home country. Went to college with the mindset that this would be my way to make a difference. Got my BA and MA in a relevant field, working full time while I was doing my masters at a job that I liked (didn't love, but it was a good working environment and I liked my coworkers). Then came the pandemic, funding cuts, and a hustle for a new job before my contract ended. That second job in this career was 2 years of a living nightmare -- terrible boss, terrible coworkers, topics of work I was not at all interested in, etc. I'm now at a different job where I am not necessarily happy nor unhappy with where I'm at. It's back on track with regards to working on topics I was once interested in, and the hours are flexible, but I am just so incredibly depressed thinking that this is what I will be doing for the rest of my life. I've been here for over a year at this point and I feel like I've hit a wall.

For the last few years, I've felt like I made the wrong decision pursuing a career just to ""make a difference."" Anyone familiar with the NGO/political space knows how jaded you can get working in these spaces, and I just don't know if it's worth it anymore. The biggest (and only) reason I haven't quit on the spot is that I feel so lost in what to do next. Everyone keeps saying I'm young and the world is my oyster, but I am having such a hard time believing them. I would love to be doing something more creative, but I've always been in the mindset of ""you get a degree to get a job"" so I don't know where to start with switching career paths without fully re-doing school. This subject has been my life for the last 13 years, so I don't even know what I would be good at. I have plenty of hobbies that I enjoy, but nothing I excel in.

How would you approach this? Should I look into certifications? Should I try and turn a hobby (like photography or coffee-making) into a career? How do I know what I can be good at!!!

196swvj,Should I do an internship in Hong Kong as a fresh grad?,"Canadian recent graduate with a BA in Psychology and currently job searching. Not really sure what my passion is but my work experience and interest align more so with marketing and business (2 marketing/social media internship, 1 freelance writing position, 1 communications assistant position).  
I recently heard back from a luxury retail company offering a global merchandising internship position I applied to a while back. It's 6 months long and supposed to start in two months. I feel like the role itself is competitive and I was just excited to get a response from them.  
I'm interested in it especially since I did not do a study abroad during my time at university. I feel like this is a rare opportunity which would let me live in a city that I love for a brief duration. Given that Asian internship are so much more intense I feel like I could get more out of it and learn skills in a different department.  
My family does not want me to go as HK intern pay is minimum wage and I would likely come out of the internship slightly less well off. At the moment I have just enough to cover my student loans.  I know that internships in Asia are much more intense but they have more learning and growth opportunities. In terms of getting around, I can speak okay Cantonese but cannot read or write and I don't have any friends or family in HK.   
I totally understand where my parents are coming from and I'm also a bit scared of completely readjusting socially and culturally to a new environment. However, I'm torn between that and wanting to explore in my early 20s and not let this fear hold me back. I'm going back and forth with whether I should take the offer, especially since I already started applying to permanent roles in Canada and am waiting to hear back from them. What should I do?

 ""Dear employer,

 My name is HowToSquat, and I have eight years assiting in running profitable operations within the restaurant industry. I have worked many hours for a third of your salary and comission structure. I have fought, bled, and worked for 35k a year, often for months at a time with no days off. 

 For the advertised salary, you will have every ounce of me until I have surpassed company standard. 

  My values as a person have changed, and am seeking a role in which I can work toward having a family, and settling down, forever.""

 Keep in mind, this is what I want to say. Any advice is welcome, but I applied to many sales roles years ago. Got a couple interviews, one being furniture sales, and another being car sales. Both could not hire me as I have a MMJ card due to either insurance or company policy. 

Got a lot of life insurance comission only position offers, but I can't afford to mess with that.

 Both managers really wanted to hire me, and said to come back if I could manage my disorder without. 

 This is kind of a hard line, as I have a disorder in which I can't regulate stress hormones. Now that I take BP medication, I don't need to use my card for anything daily other than sleep, but my quality of life is too good for me to mess with it right now.

I only have a Bachelor's degree in Political Science. I was supposed to go to New York in September for Columbia University, but my commitment to NATO has (almost) ruled out this possibility, as the program is intended to be in person, and attending online would exclude me from scholarships – something unfeasible for me, being the child of parents who barely make 40k RAL together...  
I wanted to ask you:  
1. Since the office where I'll be working at NATO is exactly my dream, what advice do you have for when I'm there? What can I do and how can I behave to be reconfirmed at the end of the six months (and start earning good money)?  
2. Regarding the Master's degree, all the people chosen for the Traineeship have a Master's, and the average age is 25/26. I feel younger, which is positive, but also academically disadvantaged, which is negative for the future. What do you recommend for the Master's? Should I abandon the dream of the USA, talk to NATO, and look for something in Europe?

196pgni,What other job can I find after working in health insurance for 10 years?,"I’ve been working in the health insurance industry full time for 10 years now. It was never a path I wanted to take, I just needed a full time job. Got a job offer working in the mailroom, then moved my way up from there.

I am a 33 y/o male living in Miami, if you are not familiar it is an expensive city. I’m currently making 70k a year. Whenever I mention this to people I know, they view it as good money, but the truth is that I just don’t see it. 70k in Miami is not enough to live comfortably. Housing/rent has gone up significantly over the past 3 years, along with inflation, everything is crazy expensive. 

Like I said, I never wanted to get stuck working in health insurance, something I always told myself when I started working it. Now, 10 years later I can’t believe I’m still here. I am not happy, I want to do something else. I don’t want to work in the health insurance industry.

I’ve always considered myself to be a creative person and before full time health insurance drained that out of me I always wanted to end up working a job that required more of my input in creating something. Whether it be ideas I have coming to life, or things such as writing or media/journalism.

After working in health insurance for 10 years I am at a loss as to what I can do now. What can I possibly put on my resume to work anywhere else that is not within the industry? 

I am open to suggestions here, ideas. What career path can I possibly take on and how possible would it be for me to even make this change? I also can’t sacrifice losing how much I get paid, and I worry about not finding something that will pay me as much.

A few weeks went by and I knew my managers were working on it because they told me they were having meetings with HR about it. Two months after they told me I got my promotion, I asked them if it was still occurring and they told me it was after the hire freeze so the company could close out the year well. And I hate being pushy or impatient so that was the only time I really asked about it. Now it’s January and my manager mentioned it me again so I know it’s still happening but will I have to wait until April for this raise? Once they told me about the promotion, my job responsibilities changed and I got a lot more tasks (which is fine) but I’ve been really stressed with work and putting in alot more time and effort while getting paid the same amount for less tasks and responsibilities.

I do industry research and produce editorials, podcasts, webinars, and live conferences from the initial research through the editing, publishing or running the live webinar or event.

I just had my annual review and my boss had only good things to say for the full hour and 45 minutes. Literally the only ""negative"" was ""I think you can be more ahead of deadlines"" when asking herself the ""areas for improvement"" question.

This week, we're having part 2 of the meeting where we talk about compensation and I want to effectively negotiate for something in the double digits.

Some numbers because numbers are fun: in my original area, my confrerence grew 80% YoY in revenue and 40% YoY in size. In my new area, my boss said I completely took ownership and she was very happy (the conference made about $1.5M). My editorials have been widely shared. The linkedin pages I run have grown by 500-1200 followers this year. And we launched a new website which I am now responsible to maintain and produce biweekly content for (before we worked on a quarterly basis). I get a base salary as well as compensation based on a percentage of the revenue my conferences, editorials, etc bring in.

Last year I got an 11% salary increase to take over the big conference plus the bonus associated with that conference.

196mnt4,Will it be fine to take a 2 year gap after high school?,"For context, I'm a first year Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto in Canada. I had taken a gap year after high school because I was severely burnt out and needed a break before beginning my engineering degree. I had planned to do a lot of things to spend my time productively but most of the things didn't work out because of a few family problems and I essentially ended up ""wasting"" my year. 

I'm an international student and ever since middle school I always wanted to study in the US for my undergrad and thankfully I even got in a bunch of top tech schools there as well last year. But a lot of external reasons and factors clouded my judgment and I ended up making the wrong decision of choosing Canada over the US. I won't get into the details of what happened coz this post will get way too long. Essentially, I prioritised the wrong things, made a lot of poor judgements/decisions, and overthought every small thing. 

Last semester when I first came here, I couldn't stop regretting and beating myself up over how stupid I was to come here. I thought about dropping out and going back to my home multiple times to the extent that I ended up failing a bunch of my exams and midterms because I couldn't stop regretting. I even joined like 2 weeks late because I was contemplating what to do until the last minute and so the last semester was a complete mess.

The University in itself is not bad, it's one of the top schools in Canada and I don't mean to be ungrateful. But I'm just not happy here and keep feeling like I don't belong here. I also don't wish to work in Canada so idk why I'm working so hard here staying continents away from my family. It doesn't really align with my future goals.

I know there is the option of transferring but considering what my gpa was last semester, realistically I have very low chances of getting in a good school (I've been put on probation and failed 2 courses). So that option is basically closed, at least for another year.  When I went back home over the winter break, my family suggested me to withdraw from the University and reapply to schools in the US and start fresh. But that would mean taking another gap year. Now I already had taken a gap year so this would be my 2nd and idk if that's a wise option because I'd be 2 years behind my friends. They'll be starting their 3rd year while I'll be restarting as a freshman.

Idk if I can handle that level of setback. I'm really unhappy here but also the option of taking another gap year also doesn't look good either.  It's such huge conundrum and I'm so lost.

Should I just suck it up and continue or leave this place for good?",whysoserious011_,1,1.0,0,1705257331,2024-01-14 18:35:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/196mnt4/will_it_be_fine_to_take_a_2_year_gap_after_high/,1,2024

196mkfm,Move out of the Netherlands this year?,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 24M from the Netherlands and grew up here. A little background information about me: I graduated in August 2023 in Business Informatics and did a Computer Science minor in the US in 2022. I currently work as a data engineer and don't have to complain about money but I'm not growing as a person.

I still live at home with my parents, I can afford to live on my own but I won't want to in the Netherlands since rent prices are nuts. I studied for a few months in the US (Utah) and had the best time of my life. I'm very ambitious and find something to work on in my free time but for the last few months, I just felt sad. At the end of the month, I have money to save/invest but I don't like the life I have and I think it's just time to leave because I started to feel this quote:  nothing changes if nothing changes.

I can stay but I know that I'm gonna be more miserable later on this year. The energy I used to have is slowly dying, my friends are cool but most of them are not inspiring. There are some options that I had in mind but I'm stressing too much about what I want to do this year. The things I had in mind:

* Going back to the US this year for a CS masters 
* Move to another country (some other friends wanted to move out and had Spain in mind, I've currently learning Spanish for almost 7 months)
* Quit my job and start something to do for myself (I'm trying to do this while maintaining my current job)

I think money is an important factor but it's not the most important for me. The weather is just depressing in the Netherlands and most of all I just want to move anywhere to grow as a person, I just have 0 idea about what to do but the most important thing I know is that if I'm not doing something different, nothing will change. I would appreciate any advice!

High schooler from France here; just to give you a bit of background, I'm 2 years ahead of school, very high general average.I'd like to be a scientist when I'm older; this is not a childish dream, although the word ""scientist"" might sound like it, it's really a field I like, and I would love to work in it.

Hopefully, the idea is, to get my Baccalauréat, get into a very good Classe Préparatoire (weird thing in France : it's a very difficult school that allows you to enter a real college...), then one of the best Engineering Schools in France.I would then be old enough to go to the UK, where Oxford wouldn't be too far away from some family I've got there.I would have liked to go to the US to study, but firstly, I'll be too young then to go by my own (and I haven't got any relatives in the States), and secondly, I fear the price of US colleges will be above my parents' fortune...

Has anybody here been in a similar situation ? If so, how did it turn out ?

OK, now for the questions about the job, scientist.How do you start working ? What diploma do you have in the end of a college such as Oxford or MIT ? I read scientific magazines (Scientific American), and I usually see '<somebody> and his students who conducted the experiment...' ; how does that happen ? How much time is spent with lecturers, and how much with a specific teacher ?

Sorry for the amount of questions...

Also, beyond the passion for science, I would like to get a reasonable (if not good 🙂) income. Does the scientist job allow that ?Can you get a well-paid engineering job in a big company once you finish your studies ?

(I know the MBA with little work experience and not being from a top school doesn’t mean much, it was a 5 year combined program and I wanted to have the background in business since I realized halfway through college that I wanted to pivot from poli sci). Always achieved highly in school (3.97 gpa) but never knew what I wanted to do for a career, always thought I’d figure it out at some point but never did. Regretfully neglected internships in college because I was a student athlete and was also working part time.

Took a job as a purchasing assistant with a small wholesale company after graduating only making mid 40ks, but in 1.5 yrs have been bumped up to the low 60ks and promoted to purchasing/inventory specialist (which is rare at my company, most are underpaid and I’m already at the higher end). I liked it well enough at first, but have started to dread it as more working has been piled on me (friend left and instead of filling his role, his work was dumped on me). Also not a great company culture.

I’m pretty introverted overall and deal with a bit of anxiety so I don’t think I’d do well with anything with a high level of interaction, and I don’t have many actual skills aside from being good with excel and a strong writer, which has caused me to feel stressed and unsure of what I’d actually be good at.
What are some potential paths I could take?
I’ve considered trying to progress within procurement, negotiation would be the biggest skill I would need to work on to do so. I definitely enjoy the inventory management side of my job more than dealing with vendors). Also considering other roles within supply chain since, but I’m not sure if the grass would be greener.

196khez,SWE vs. AI: Who Automates the Automators?,"TL;DR: AI could be coming for software engineers' jobs. Will AI engineers be the next big thing, or is med school the escape hatch?

Childhood Dreams and the Ghosts of Automaton

Remember that architect friend of my dad? He was our deity, his engineering setup a mythical paradise. Money flowed like the drafts he drew. Back then, I thought ""architect = rich,"" which, let's be honest, isn't always true. But the seed was planted: creative fields promised fortune.

Fast forward and reality bites. I wasn't Leonardo da Vinci reborn, so architecture wasn't my path. But I witnessed something fascinating: automation. AutoCAD decimated an engineering field, turning five 30-day projects into one-day wonders. Electrical grids felt the same sting. ETAP + 1 engineer + 5 technicians now conquered what once needed 30.

Are SWEs Next in the Firing Line?

Now, AI looms large. Those fancy models and their application factories… I don't know when they'll hit peak efficiency, but 10 years feels generous. And guess who automated all those other fields? Yep, software engineers. So, it's their turn to face the music.

Looking back, 20 years ago, becoming a SWE meant playing automation puppeteer. But now, the question hangs heavy: who automates the automators? Are AI engineers the next gold rush? Is that the escape route from impending software oblivion? Or should we all just pack our bags and head for med school?

I cherished my time at my previous company during my internship with an amazing mentor and colleague but did not continue working there bcs I wanted to have a fresh start in a bigger company and wanted to gain more experience.

In the new company, not even one month in, I got transferred to a different department which is notorious for being a bit busier by a guy (lets call him Z) from that department ""scouting"" me just like that. Z got my previous head of department annoyed because he didnt do it in a formal way and kind of ""stole"" me from the previous team I was in. At first I was fine with it because I wanted to gain more experience.

His guidance is total shit and he has shit communication skills and expects zero mistakes from me and expects me to know everything since ""im a part of the team now"". When im sick and had to take medical leave he would harass me through text and kinda makes me feel guilty for being sick and ""leaving my work to him"". Z totally destroyed my confidence and made me feel incompetent in everything I do.

My anxiety is at an all time high and Ive started seeing a therapist for anxiety. Everyday feels like a battle going to work and enduring 8 hours of intense stress and pressure is eating me alive to the point that I cannot even enjoy my weekends without stressing about work. I have frequent mental breakdowns and will cry almost everyday because of this. 

I did confront him to talk about me feeling overwhelmed and pressured but that just turned to him gaslighting me that this is normal and he implied that im the problematic one, that I need to know that everybody else is stressed too and I should be grateful that my workload is not as heavy as other projects, he has a lot of things to do as well, other staff in the office had to go back at 10pm, so why am I making this a big deal? I felt totally disregarded by him but I still applaud myself for being brave and talked the truth to him.

Ive been thinking about whether I am the problem or is it the workplace problem because all my other friends seem fine with their work life, while me feeling depressed and anxious everyday, cry almost everyday and cannot even enjoy things I used to enjoy. 

Please let me know your thoughts on this and whether resigning at 3 months is reasonable.

196k8b8,Any advice?,"I am a 20F my career Id say has started and many of my higher-ups and coworkers believe I am set at this point to go higher. I started last year in the company as a cashier within 4 months I was promoted into a grocery department manager and excelled to the point they moved me to a higher volume location at end of November with a raise. Again exceeded expectations and have had nothing but high praise from higher ups. The next steps would be a shift supervisor, assistant store manager and then one faraway day possibly a store manager. I’d really like to get back to school but not sure if it’s dumb or what options I assume in business education I should consider that will align with that possible mobility or even in my current position.

196j8bl,[NY] Placed on 45 day PIP for mistakes that occurred 3-4 months ago,"I began this position in December 2022, and my year-end performance review, conducted last month, resulted in a 2/5 rating, indicating partially met expectations. Notably, I experienced an improvement in my monthly reviews during August and September, with my rating increasing from 3.6 to 3.7/5.0 within a one-month span. However, I have recently been placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) due to mistakes made nearly four months ago.  


Despite my belief in substantial improvement since then, I have not received feedback after actively seeking it. The PIP outlines specific metrics for the next 45 days, including reasonable expectations such as completing a certain number of cases weekly and achieving the team's average Quality Assurance (QA) score of 4.2/5.  


Considering these circumstances, should I approach HR to discuss the reasons behind my placement on the PIP, or is there a limited course of action available to me at this point?",Switchacky,1,1.0,2,1705248478,2024-01-14 16:07:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/196j8bl/ny_placed_on_45_day_pip_for_mistakes_that/,1,2024
196imzi,Pursuing Master Degree after Bachelor,"First section of the text is background information: 

Hello! I study Communication Design, which is a mix of copyright and graphic design, sort of. 

I will bachelor in one semester. 

I did a 4 month internship at a successful company in Berlin called Common Goal in the Brand & Advocacy group. 

I worked on graphics and material for the Brand (internally and externally), partners, and social media. 

I am 20 years old, 



FINALLY, the most important part.
I want to pursue a master and I wanted some feedback on the course choice: 

[Click this text to go to the master’s information](https://www.srh-berlin.de/en/master/creative-leadership-berlin/)

The course is called International Management and Creative Leadership. I am not considering it exactly because of “management” but rather because of the marketing and business side mentioned in the Curriculum that I think may come useful in a lot of different ways and make me a more complete marketing, communication, practitioner. 

Also the “final projects” mentioned on the info page really captivate me. 

Would be nice, in my older years, to land a job similar to CMO (chief marketing officer somewhere). Or just see where life takes me.
 this is not a post to how to exactly land a graphic design job, but rather how to use a graphic design and communication background to jump into a prolific career. Any sort that uses this skillset.

196ih2t,Leave teaching to pursue school psychology?,"Hello! I (22F) am a first year first grade teacher. I currently have a class of 30 students. While there are a lot of aspects of teaching that I love, like building relationships with my students, their families, and my coworkers, I have been struggling a lot with classroom management. I feel stressed out at the end of every day when I spend so much energy trying to handle behaviors. I have implemented a lot of strategies to improve classroom behavior and have actually seen a lot of progress, but my administration still gives me feedback that it’s not up to par. I’m questioning if maybe I just have the wrong personality to manage a classroom.

I applied to a specialist degree program that would allow me to become a school psychologist. I think it might be a good role for me because I really love giving assessments, working one on one with students, and writing. I also am passionate about supporting students with learning disabilities and special needs. 

But I keep second guessing myself. Will I regret leaving teaching? Are my admin just expecting too much too soon, and maybe I’m really not doing so badly? Or should I just accept that teaching is not the role for me and move on to a field that will allow me to help students in a different way?

But I also don't know in which country I should study, I like big metropolis like London or the US metropolis or Singapore, but i'm afraid that I will spend a lot of money and maybe after my studies will have to go back to Italy because these are extra UE areas, studying in EU countries will be less expensive but also I don't feel like there many choices, (Spain, France, Portugual etc are good countries but they don't have the best economies, and also I would like to use English as main lenguage)

196f0rh,Leaving a job and job hopping etiquette?,"Hi there! Thanks in advance for all the advice, I’ll explain my situation here. 

I (F21) have been working in marketing for roughly a year in a company that I kinda liked, but wanted to job hop to get better conditions and learn more. 
I have just accepted an offer this Friday in a role I like a lot more with better pay and conditions. 
In my country it’s mandatory to let the employer know of a career change 15 days in advance. Thing is, I was on a work trip with my boss from Wednesday to Friday, when I got the offer for this new job. I chose to wait to tell my boss on Monday (perhaps Tuesday) because a work trip is a stressful and not so ideal situation to talk about these things.
How do I tell my boss and colleagues? Will telling her on Monday make it seem like I knew beforehand but just wanted to go on this work trip before exiting the company? (I really don’t like work trips but for some reason people in my job love them and are eager to go, my boss asked me to so I never wanted to go on this trip, although maybe it’s perceived differently from their side?)
So I need to announce it in a specific way to my colleagues? If they ask me where I’m going after, should I mention the business or no?

196f04i,Will there be any consequences to me leaving my Job mid project?,"For context, I just recently graduated last year and I was working from home, my salary was low, even for the standards of the country I lived in (around 300 USD monthly), however it was a WFH set up and I was only training/studying. Before the year ended, I was approached by my manager with a job opportunity in a field slightly different to the one I was in training for. I expressed my concerns about the job as it was in something I had no past experience in. The management told me that it would be a good opportunity, it would be a team base project, we and a few others would be outsourced to a different company, there would be a training period, and that I would get monetary benefits upon taking the job. Now a few weeks in and after my first paycheck I am ready to resign.  The ""training"" I received was a day and a half of studying followed by immediate work into the project. Additionally, the office to my new job site is 2-3 hours away from where I live and the ""monetary benefits"" promised turned out to only be travel and food allowance (an additional 3 USD per day I attended work \[the cost of food and travel is around 5 dollars on a tight budget\]). I did research on the company we were outsourced to and to my shock new hires and trainees who work there make double the amount that I do (I've asked my friends I've made there who are still in training \[not in project yet\] and they confirmed as such). I do have the option to find an apartment nearer to where I work however, to my disappointment, my salary did not increase a single cent. If I were to move closer to my office, I would be in debt. I am also manning my project solo (not in a team environment as I was told), and my workload is 3-4 times the normal amount (I've talked to other people who work there). So I find myself here burning my savings from back when I was WFH, waking up at 4 am and getting home around 8 pm if I am lucky making half as much as the people around me and working much, MUCH harder than them. I have talked to my Manager about my situation but they have only recycled to me the same speech they give to my other coworkers who wish to resign (keep going. you got this!). I have applied to other companies and have offers for jobs WAY better than my current one but I am worried that resigning will lead to any bad things on my record. I also did not sign a contract as we are outsourced so I am unsure if I am free to resign or not. Sorry also for any grammatical errors. I am typing this on less than 4 hours sleep.

196e3tk,Normal jobs do not give me the challenge I am looking for - what to do?,"Hey Reddit,  
  
First of all, let me give you a quick intro into my life: Grew up with my single mother and my grandmother in a shared house. All my life, I had to fight with and solve all kinds of existential problems, such as but not limited to the bad things my alcoholic mother did, the fact that my father was in prison, the daily struggle of having days without anything to eat, in high school having money only for a bus ride there and back home, being bullied regularly, all kinds of family drama. Basically it can be summed up in one sentence: I grew up fighting and solving big, sometimes existential problems on a daily basis - I got used to it and I got good at it.  
  
Fast forward 10 years, I am 26 now. My family situation got a lot better, money wise it is also a lot better, I live with my girlfriend in our rented flat and have a full time career at a marketing agency.   
  
The only thing is this: Almost everything I do on a daily basis (mainly tasks at work) feels boring and non-important. My mind is so ready to solve some bigger problem, some crisis - but they do not really exist anymore. Because of this, I don't really give my 100 % at work - because I do not see the point, my mind is always wanting to have a bigger problem to solve so that I can thrive and figure out a way to do it.   
  
I thought of changing my career to something that is more unpredictable - like police officer, firefighter or EMT, I even went for a Special Ops selection but did not push through. I am always “hunting” for a new job or opportunity, because I get bored with any job at around the 6 months mark. I have colleagues that are working the same thing for 10 years - even the thought of myself doing this feels like hell.  
  
I don't really know what to do - how to calm my mind down and really enjoy the more “basic” work related stuff? What career will give me the satisfaction my mind is looking for without the need of changing the job every 6 months?  
  
Any advice or feedback is appreciated, thank you.

One is Woolworths doing nightfill only on tuesdays (when they wanna roster me anyway) only 4 hours, I did nightfill for 1.5 years during my gap year after graduating high school in 2020. Anyway the pay is surprisingly great $39 an hour. My main job is just a pick/packer for a pharmacy. It’s literally just labour, take an item off the shelf put it in a tub rinse and repeat. That’s $30 an hour casual and I used to do 37 hour weeks but now it’s winding down and I’m doing 21 hour weeks. 

I managed to save a lot of money this past 6 months especially. Finally having a full time gig and only having to pay $50 a week in rent (living at home still) i have $29K AUD in my bank right now and I’m pretty proud of that.

But I can’t help and think like I need to get off my ass this year especially and go study something or pursue a real career path. This money I’m earning, on my best week 41 hours at both jobs nets me $1080 after tax. For me it’s not even about the money anymore it’s wanting a proper career path where I can continue to progress and do meaningful work + grow my income as I get more qualified. 

I looked at TAFE courses and uni, I got into uni last year actually for high school teaching, but I dropped out because I just wasn’t ready to commit to it. Now I have some savings and I just really don’t know what to study or if I even should be. I graduated with an ATAR of 75, which is ok to me, but I’ve realised I really don’t have many skills.

I found a role that is completely different to what I was doing. It's 10 mins from home, a Monday to Friday role... Offering complete home/life balance. I came from a role that I would work weekends and late evenings at. The new role is $130k pa. 
I enjoyed the company that I did work for... Until around 18 months ago they did a huge overhaul of all of the senior managers and hired a bunch of wankers who spruke nepotism and favouritism of their friends. I wasn't in that in circle and they had a target on my back for a while.... Giving me additional responsibilities and responsibilities they knew I just could not fulfill with my family. Lots of changes to my set roster just to muck me and my family around (esp on late notice).
My recently new boss was picking on me, micro managing me and putting unnecessary pressure on  me and I honestly thought no amount of money is worth this shit so I quit. 
Colleagues of mine were lazy. Not putting in half of what I was.... Some not even turning up for shifts, not putting in leave forms and getting paid for it (yep they are smart and their CBF attitude was solid). Management has done nothing about their poor attendance.
When I left no one did my exit interview. I assume they filled it out on my behalf without sitting me down and actually asking why I'm leaving after so long. 
They seemed happy to let me go. 
I am yet to commence the new role but I'm silently shitting myself because after 15 years with the old role.... The new one is completely different. I am scared it is not going to work out... Silently shitting myself. My family (5 of them) are relying on me as the bread winner and I can't let them down.

Long story short, I gave a documented verbal warning to an employee, 4 months ago, for insubordination. Boy, do I regret that. Every day of my work life since then, has been absolute HELL, and this chick has made sure of that. 

She has made it her mission to completely sabotage and harass me, since then. I’m talking LITERAL sabotage. Purposefully hiding things that I need to complete my job. Slander, and defamation. Constantly throwing me under the bus, every chance she gets. But when approached about the situation, she pulls the victim card, and acts like she doesn’t know what’s happening. 

What the hell can I do here!? There are multiple witnesses to this behavior, some have even put their statements in writing. I have gone to my store manager. Nothing. I’ve gone to HR. Nothing. I’ve gone to my district manager. NOTHING. Nobody seems to want to address these issues.

What can I do, short of just obviously up and quitting? This job pays really well, and I’m not trying to screw myself by quitting, but I can’t continue with this constant harassment and sabotage.

196a6k0,"Just got promoted to a new position at a SaaS company, and seeking advice on how to proceed.","Read if you want some background, or skip to the bottom:

So, my professional life just changed dramatically. I've always been a worker bee, never in an administrative or management position. However....

I've been chosen to be the trainer for our new hires/current reps in the support department for a SaaS company. The company is a pretty well known business software company, but we've been super slow to expand in the US, so we're constantly growing and discovering new needs we need to fulfill. 

The department only covers one application right now on the US side, but we have about 60 apps, and likely 10 we'll try to offer direct phone support for in the next couple of years. The support position is really involved, and more like custom solutions work with some tech support mixed in for our customers. 

Due to the success of my current department, we've been given the green light to start expanding, hiring more people, and basically creating the framework for how software support for this company will proceed forward in the US market. Management has their hands really full with other things, and decided we needed to create a position for someone to do just the training/education portion of the job. 

I think I can do well at this job, but I don't really have any official experience doing this type of thing, and zero management experience. I've been doing a lot of it unofficially to improve processes for me and my colleagues, but it's been a lot of quality of life stuff for myself and my comrades to make work easier. That's more or less landed me in a management/training role as of this past week. 

I'm excited for sure, and probably twice as stressed now. I really want to show management that the future of the department is in good hands. I've got some rough ideas listed in multiple documents, along with some articles I wrote for my buddies in my department for quick reference. I'll make those docs into official SOPs, but I'm really at a loss as to how to structure what I work on first. 

&#x200B;

If anyone has experience in a role similar to this, I'd like a little advice on where to focus first. It'll be a self-directed position. I do have a couple weeks to brainstorm and present my ideas to upper management, and I really want to show them how committed I am to this. 

&#x200B;

The rough guidelines I've been given are:

\-Create a 4 week course for onboarding new reps on our software (schedule done, need to create about 80% of the material before March)

\-Keep an eye on software updates/new features and train new and seasoned reps on new features as they release. 

\-Create short videos/lead webinars for feature training and retraining

\-Put together documents on training and retraining procedures, outlines for lessons, slideshows, and other materials pertaining to training (a lot done, but this will always need to be added to)

&#x200B;

Ideas I've come up with are:

\-Put together a sterile sandbox environment for training where management or guest course leaders can demo features and host courses from live. 

\-Create a department repository for common issues or nuanced issues that would help. Like a Wiki or quick reference guide to help reps solve complicated issues quickly, or give them insight into troubleshooting an issue. 

\-Take a monthly poll of lesser-known features in our system, and the ones that the majority of reps request will be chosen to do a training/re-training course on. 

\-Eventually, take the materials I'm putting together here and offer it to our software partners or our more independent customers. (Currently, our official Knowledgebase covers features at a high level, and are not useful for in-depth troubleshooting. I want to fix this for both reps and customers.)

&#x200B;

So what I'm asking is:  
If anyone has literally any experience with onboarding new employees, creating SOP docs, or hell, being in a self-directed position and staying on track/organized, I'd appreciate any advice. This is all really new to me, and I think I can do well if I have some starting goals. But if you've got any organization tips, or commentary on any of the above, I'd appreciate it all.

1969j37,Haven’t been back to office since RTO,"I work for a large bank that required RTO 2 days a week last summer. This year they’re enforcing 3 days a week. When first enforced I was going in but encountered some legitimate physical health complications making it impossible to go in. I could still get my work done with the nature of WFH but going into the office was physically painful so I stayed home but still worked. This persisted and ended up impacting my mental health and sleep and caused a spiral of not making it in. In the course of this I’ve been to doctors and therapy for support. I’ve been transparent with both my boss and VP with my concerns and have been met with reassurance however I am afraid that HR will come down on me. I am newer to a large corporation and am only now realizing how little control I or my boss has. The office attendance wasn’t mentioned during my mid or end year performance reviews and I received great marks overall. However I’m afraid HR is building a case in the background to let people go and avoid layoffs. The only reason I have to believe this is by reading accounts of others on Reddit. 

I am not intending to blow off the policy, and plan to get my attendance in order over the coming weeks but wanted to get others perspective and a temperature check on my situation. Should I be worried about being fired? Do I have the right justification to push back?

19694is,Account Management - want to transition out but lost on my options,"I have been in Account Management for the last 5-6 years. I worked in employee benefits and now for a digital health vendor. 

As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized I think I would be more successful in a less client facing role. Whenever I look at jobs with similar skill sets, they are mostly client success and sales roles which is not what i’m looking for. 

Has anyone transitioned from account management to something less people oriented without taking too big of a pay cut? 

I have an MIS degree and I’ve thought about analytics, however it seems like all I see is how saturated the market is and how people are struggling to get a job. I don’t have any experience outside of college classes and it was never something that came super naturally. 

I am open to spending a couple years learning something new but am afraid to spend the money and time and something end up not being useful/not enough to land a job.

1967i9o,"I'm an overworked executive assistant, how do I better my resume so I can finally leave my job?","You'd think that as an executive assistant my job would mostly revolve around scheduling and coordinating with key shareholders. Well my company seems to disagree as they think ""anything we need, let's throw it to him."" 

This has led me to become my boss' speechwriter, permit processor, emcee for events and program coordinator, liaison officer, voice actor, marketing consultant, production manager (for videoshoots), personal driver, minutes taker, and many many more. It has even come to a point where I help him with personal endeavors that no longer relates to my position (I'm supposed to be his executive assistant for all his businesses) which makes me feel more of a personal assistant, to be honest.

With that said, I'm done. This amount of workload is absurd and I'm not paid enough. I don't want to stay here any longer (I'll be working here for 8 months now starting this February) as I can see them doing this to most of their employees (hell, our HR manager is also his sales manager, maintenance head, and OIC when the general manager isn't around, and more). So I know that the problem is with the system itself and how my boss and his family sees their employees.

How do I better market these skills and experiences of mine without overdoing it? 

I currently want to branch out into a more specific role, for what specific position, that I'm not sure. Maybe somewhere in PR or business development. But my passion truly lies in environmentalism and psychology (the latter of which is what I graduated in actually).

1965xhd,What's a normal amount of workplace dysfunction?,"I have been with the same company for several years, and my team sometimes jokes about it being dysfunctional. 

However, I wonder if I’m being too hard on a particular coworker for what I feel is a lack of communication and sharing important details needed to complete my work, or it’s all just part of the job, and these things happen just about everywhere. And to just roll with the punches because it will be the same thing anywhere I work.

This person is a project leader for one brand, and I understand she’s likely quite busy, and as a person she’s lovely, but over the years I’ve become quite frustrated with some things that happen regularly. For example…

For just about every project I’ve worked on for her, I’ll complete it by my due date, but then she lets it sit for weeks without reviewing it, which is the next step. Eventually when she gets around to it, she needs the updates completed by end of day. Since I’m quick, I can typically do this, but it makes me feel like a taxi driver being told to drive faster because the passenger is running late.

When I have a question so I can finalize the work, she doesn’t always have the answer, so says she’ll get back to me on it. After a project follow up call two weeks later, it’ll come up again and she’ll ask me to remind her what I’m asking about. Again she says she will get back to me, but does not. Unfortunately there’s not really anyone else who we can go to for the answers we need. I just wish she was a better resource or made me feel more confident that she was someone I could count on.

There have been several instances where things in her brief don’t make sense and a couple others on my team are equally confused. So we explain to her why she may want to reconsider, but she doesn’t seem to understand why we are suggesting this and the direction doesn’t change. So we end up spending considerable time on making what she wants us to do work. Eventually her manager or another leader will point out the error, which we originally asked about, and then we have to redo work and spend more time on it.",museyourname,2,1.0,0,1705201908,2024-01-14 03:11:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1965xhd/whats_a_normal_amount_of_workplace_dysfunction/,1,2024

196239a,Could I/Should I Ask For a Raise or Better Benefits at My Review?,"I understand this post might be a mess. To break it all down, I've put in a lot of extra time and energy into this job and have definitely gone above and beyond in my position. However, we are non profit and haven't even been open for 6 months. So is asking for a raise reasonable? Would I have more luck with asking for a larger PDO accrual? 

Before I start, here's all the workplace/wage information I can give

Located in Minnesota, US

Nonprofit organization dealing with mental health

I started in September 2023, which is when my ""department"" opened

The only relevant benefit I'm receiving is 3 weeks of PDO per year/ 5 hours of PDO per pay period.

I'm currently getting paid $17/hour. As far as I'm aware, support staff gets $14/hour and the position in between that and my position gets paid $15.50/hour.

Last raise was effective in October. This raise was given because I achieved the status of Mental Health Practitioner per the Minnesota requirements.

I have not received an official date for my review. 

Since starting, I've done almost all of the intakes and plans (this is a regular responsibility for my position, the intakes just somehow mostly happen on my shift and I've been doing the plans because the morning shift hasn't been doing them). 

I've also (voluntarily) taken on most of the office work. I've established the organization for our part of the office and maintained it. I've maintained our binders to make sure they're always ready. I keep the office stocked with supplies, as well as keeping our other supply closet stocked (toilet paper, paper towels, cleaners, rags).

I've also recently been informed that I'm one of two staff that will be receiving training for some extra paperwork that we're going to start being responsible for, and that I will be the unofficial office assistant on top of my extra duties. Just to note, we're supposed to have that as an official position, but things are slow with the state and despite them not yet approving our staffing plan, we really need the new positions to be started in order for our ""department"" to run smoothly. We all work here because we're passionate about the service we offer. Our particular service is not offered anywhere else within at least 100 miles and is very much needed, so we don't want to see this end before it has a fair chance. 

I've also worked a lot of overtime, taken shifts very last minute, and I've always come in early or stayed late when asked to do so.

In conclusion, does it sound like a good time to ask for more compensation? The last nonprofit I worked for did not do raises besides for when the state increased our budget. The difference between this job and that one is that the last job did not receive ANY money for their services. This jobs services are covered by insurance and grants. Raises have not been discussed with me at all, so I don't know if I should expect any. They also are not mentioned anywhere in the employee handbook.",Human-Cauliflower-85,2,1.0,5,1705190551,2024-01-14 00:02:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/196239a/could_ishould_i_ask_for_a_raise_or_better/,1,2024

1960eaf,What did you do after gaining a bachelors degree in psychology? How has this led you to where you are today?,"Hi Guys!  
I am entering my final year of uni with major in neuroscience and a minor in psychology and am looking at my potential options after this. I would a love if people wanted to share the pathway's they took after uni regardless of whether I mention their careers in my post!  
I want to preface this by saying that I find psychology very interesting, especially from a neurological/biological/medical (if that makes sense) perspective, hence my major being neuroscience. In saying this, here are my current options that I am considering:  
Doing Med with the hopes of becoming a psychiatrist:  
I have done premed before and wasn't the biggest fan but I do like the idea of being a psychiatrist due to its mixture between neuro/med and psych. However, while I find it interesting, I also think I would find it hard to go through all of medical school before I begin to specialise, it would take so long (10 years+) and I am unsure if it is worth it. I would want to be 100% committed before pursuing this due to how long it will take.  
Clinal psychology:  
This seems like an obvious choice to consider, however, I feel as though I would miss the more medical side of things? I don't have a great understanding of what clinical psychologists do beyond therapy/diagnosing disorders etc. (please correct me if this is incorrect). I don't think this is the right path for me but if anyone can shed some light on their experiences within this field I would really appreciate it! I have an open mind  
Clinical neuropsychology:  
I am not completely sure what the difference is between this and clinical psychology but from what I can tell online it seems to be more of a mixture between psychology and neuroscience which is what I am after. I was curious if anyone works in this field and can tell me more about their job and what this career pathway would look like? Is this similar to psychiatry?  
If anyone has any experience in these fields I would love to hear more! Any advice on what the careers are like/how to choose is welcome and please feel free to suggest other pathways that I have not yet considered.

  
Thank you in advance :)",PerryThePlatypus04,1,1.0,2,1705185868,2024-01-13 22:44:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1960eaf/what_did_you_do_after_gaining_a_bachelors_degree/,1,2024
195zidt,Software Engineering or medicine ?,"
I’m going to apply for college in two weeks but I still haven’t decided which career to pursue. 
Both options has their pros and cons . What I like is not as important as a good and well paid career.

Medicine 
     - pros 
. more secure jobs 
. Higher social power ( especially in the Middle East )
. Mostly higher salaries 
. More social and active in the uni years 
. Stable job
. Harder to be unemployed 
     - cons 
. Longer study years
. Takes longer to get well paid 
. Personally I can’t handle gore or blood but I’ve heard that I’ll get used to it 
. More stressful 

Software Engineering 
    - pros
. Get well paid fast 
. Less study years 
. More demand on it now
. I kinda like it more 
. The ability to work from home
    - cons
. Danger of Ai
. Less social and active during study years 
. Unstable jobs 
. Bigger competition 
. Can get unemployed",moustafa_mah17,1,1.0,7,1705183483,2024-01-13 22:04:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/195zidt/software_engineering_or_medicine/,1,2024
195zfzk,how to renege offer,"Back in November, I received a new grad offer for a rotational program at Company A that is set to start in summer 2024. The total comp for the position (adding 401k benefits) comes out to about $85k or so. The base salary is pretty average for new grads, not bad but nothing too special. Company A flew me out for the interview and invested a lot of time and energy into the interview day - we got to meet several senior leaders at the company, stayed in a nice hotel, and were overall treated very well. I also made a lot of connections with the other candidates interviewing, as well as the folks already in the rotational program. When I got accepted to the position, I was ecstatic, it was the only other offer I had at the time and the job market has been quite rough, so I felt fortunate to get a position in an area that I was excited about, even though the pay was pretty average for the field that I'm going into. Therefore, even though I had other interviews coming up, I accepted the offer at the time, as I didn't want to make the company think they were my second choice and also, the other interviews were sort of far away and there was no guarantee I'd get those positions. Since accepting the offer, the recruiters as well as the folks already in the program (\~10 people or so) have been sending us emails to set up different events for everyone to meet each other like a welcome call and whatnot. Also, some of the other candidates who accepted the offer probably know that I received/accepted the offer as well (these folks all met me at interview day) as my email shows in all of these group events that the company is trying t set up before we start in summer 2024. the program is like a ""family"" where you get different rotations and have a lot of mentorship, which separates it from just any other corporate job. The idea is to develop the ""future leaders"" of the company, so they try to build connections early on. 

&#x200B;

A few weeks after this, I received an INCREDIBLE offer from Company B - with all the benefits, the compensation package comes out to about 150k and the work is in an area I'd be super excited about as well. Company B also invested a lot of time into the interview day - flying us out, putting us in a nice hotel, etc. Like any reasonable person, I knew I couldn't turn down the offer with more than a 60k difference between the two in terms of salary, so I went ahead and accepted Company B's offer. How should I now go about reneging the offer at Company A? When I accepted this offer for the better position at Company B, I didn't anticipate that Company A would keep sending me emails to attend various welcome events and get plugged in with the community there before even starting. Now, it's evident that several people at Company A are anticipating that I'm coming, including the recruiters, all the people already in the rotational program, and the folks that are going to be joining in my class for the program. I also believe a part of my success of even getting into that rotational program at Company A was because I networked a lot with current folks in the program. Because of all the connections I built at Company A, I'm super worried about reneging my offer there, even though I have this opportunity I can't pass up at Company B. I'm scared I'm ging to burn the bridge with 20+ people at Company A who are inevitably going to find out that I'm not joining. 

&#x200B;

In need of some advice: 

1) should I tell Company A the truth that I got a job that is so much better paying and well aligned with my interests or should I tell them a white lie with a more excusable reason (like needing to live closer to family or something)? Or, should I just not give them a reason at all and say something like ""personal circumstances""? 

2) Should I communicate with the recruiters at Company A over phone or email? 

3) Am I an idiot for accepting the offer at Company B and even entertaining the idea of reneging the offer at Company A? 

Would love to hear everyone's thoughts. Thanks!",mickeymouse611,1,1.0,1,1705183314,2024-01-13 22:01:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/195zfzk/how_to_renege_offer/,1,2024
195yzrm,Anyone have advice for getting remote work in the south?,"I am legally blind, and have had a number of different jobs... mostly low paid service work or office jobs. My longest employment was for 4 years as a purchasing agent, which is a field I'd like to go back into if only for the money and relatively predictable workflow. I had the opportunity to change jobs and get a higher wage, which ultimately has led me to be back home.

 For 6 months last year, I moved up to Washington DC for a low paying public sector job, thinking it would be a step in the right direction. The work was deceptively easy, I was constantly working beyond my hours and was not accomodated in the role. My supervisor seemed supportive of my reasonable accomodations, but it quickly became clear the reality of working with a disabled person was not a good fit on their end. I was called into a meeting because I had a small typo in an email, and asked to read a printout. My confidence has really been shaken, I constantly replay the events in my head.. but I am driven to move on and show my next employer that I can do the job well and succeed if they just show an iota of compassion.

I am really struggling to find work that can pay *something*, and be remote/hybrid. I can't drive, and my parents are not in the best financial situation, so I need to find some way to make $15-20/hr, which around here is not easy to do.

195yl82,Quitting a decently paying job for an internship in a new career field?,"Hi  


Some information quickly: European, very late 20s, no debt, currently working a stable full-time office job with the above median salary for roughly 4 years now and for the past year also studying full-time at the same time so basically my life right now is work-school-sleep-repeat. I have enough in savings for a bit over 2 years of living expenses.

My current job is good in the sense that it is mostly WFH (and kinda sure it will stay that way due to some inside information), good boss and I have maxed out internal growth opportunities (i.e. I am in a high enough position that anything higher I wouldn't accept even if offered). There are plenty of other issues though and I would have likely resigned within the next couple of years regardless but now I have a decision to make in the near future instead.

Issue: I am currently at university for a degree in a totally new field that requires a quite long internship for graduation and for several reasons I have decided that I will not strive for an internship in the company I currently work at. The internship would have to start at around summertime, autumn the latest in order for me to finish it on time for graduation. For the life of me I cannot decide if it would be better to quit already in the near future to have more time to build a better portfolio for internship applications or to stay at my current position until I am able to secure an internship if perhaps people who already have a job look better in the eyes of the recruiters etc. It is important to keep in mind that where I live, it is mandatory by law to give at least a 1 month notice upon resignation (this also goes the other way and firing people is actually quite difficult)  


Anyone been in a similar situation and which way did you choose? I am interested in hearing both opinions as there are so many pros and cons to both and I've come to realise that having come from a family of very high achievers, my own opinions about myself can be very biased especially when it comes to potentially not having a job for a while.",Short_Bus8309,1,1.0,0,1705181044,2024-01-13 21:24:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/195yl82/quitting_a_decently_paying_job_for_an_internship/,1,2024

195x6bq,Career advice for a soon to be MSN graduate?,"  
For the last two years, I have been pursuing my master's degree in Nursing Administration and Leadership after 6 years with my BSN. I graduate in the spring, and I am looking for some advice.  
For context, I am working at an skilled nursing facility full-time as an RN. I like geriatrics and would like to continue working with this population. I was a supervisor, but I had to step down from that role due to management changes I disagreed with; now, I only work as a supervisor on weekends. I initially thought that once I got my MSN, maybe something would immediately interest me. It was a degree that did not require a clinical component, and I got to think critically about the internal workings of the healthcare system. Still, I don't think pursuing a position like ADON or otherwise elsewhere would be worth it for me right now (I am contracted to work for my company for two years due to a tuition program).  
Most of my focus in my program was on dementia care or resident care in general. My capstone is even on a quality improvement project on the Montessori dementia care program which I am excited to start next semester. My only worry is what to do once I have the degree. I don't regret being able to get the degree I worked hard for, it's only what goal to pursue next.  
Has anyone had this issue when they got their graduate degree and seemed lost on what to do next? Any advice would be great.

195vp2l,How to get out of gaming,"How to get out of gaming


Hola everyone. Is an odd title as usually people ask how to GET IN the gaming but here we go.

 My whole training and career have been in the gaming industry. I've worked as a game and 3D artist and honestly I've been unemployed now for one year and I'm hungry and my family is desperate because I'm stuck. And after seeing the depressing linkedin posts about the mass layoffs, the directors explaining the nature of game jobs and how there will never be a stable job and recruiters snapping that we should stop applying and complaining of the contract conditions, I realised that this isn't a long term and feasible life to follow anymore, even though I really loved and respected my craft.

 I have tried in the last year to apply to other jobs while upgrading my portfolio. Call centers, deposits, shop keepers etc. EVERYTHING. Unfortunately I got rejected because of lack of experience I guess. I'd take a course but I don't know which are good and what industry actually needs people. All I'm looking is for an insight from fellow ex game devs that switched carrers. Where would my accumulated skills be used or if they are a good enough foundation to be used somewhere else? 

Seeing how I've been mostly into art and technical details such as integration and reading projects needs for assets, I'm guessing that places like Pharma ain't really on my way.
I respect the people working in the game industry now and I love your work guys, but unfortunately this is a sign that I can't have a place with you.

195tvxj,I think I'm losing myself. Any advice?,"Okay, this might be a different post from all the others that I've read on this page. But I need to vent everything out, truthfully for once. 

I graduated and got a sales/support role in a startup and things were great (I was partying a lot, practically saving no money and getting hooked to weed) 
Then COVID hit, and suddenly, my company that was very reliant on social aspect, started going under. Since I always wanted to create something of my own and felt I belonged in a creative field, I quit to do design (in the efforts to discover something that I truly love working on)
What else are 20's for, am I right? 

I learnt everything there was to, took most esteemed courses and started freelancing and even landed a couple ful time jobs. But no matter how hard I worked, I felt I was not good enough of an artist, especially in a market where they are already not valued much. 

Out of the two full time positions one made me resign, because my asshole manager (who was an authoritarian, had no design background wanted to feel special and superior acc. to all my team members) didn't go along with me and had my ass put on PIP and then asked for my resignation, cause I used to be the only one who spoke out when he pulled shit, like when he made us work weekends. The second company had no money to pay me and became almost poisonous so I quit on my own so they don't have to pay severance

My problems as a freelance designer were completely different from all my design peers, where people won't find business, I could very well talk, negotiate and land clients. 
The problem was the end result used to come out a little underwhelming, which used to feel shitty. But I was making ends meet, although as little as possible. 

Then came the AI. 
And the entire industry that was over saturated, became highly uncertain as well. Yay 😒
Although my work is complex enough that it won't take it over instantly, there were already talks of products that were aiming to make it videos and animations directly from promts. 

It didn't help that I used to run towards weed as an escape. And now after 6 years of heavy use, I feel I've killed a million brain cell and noticing a slight memory hit. 
If that wasn't all, here comes the cherry on top. I think I might have a nightmare disorder, cause of all this the depression has seeped in for the first time in my life. I don't remember the last time I've slept and not woken up panicked that I've fucked up my life. Imagine every time you sleep, just have nightmares exclusively. 

Last year I think I started giving up a bit. Seeing everyone of my old peers racing through by me, when I'm living paycheck to paycheck. 
I didn't work a lot last year, cause I've started feeling soo disassociated with all this, and thinking if I should just call quits. 

I'm not sure if I've started disliking design, because it became my primary source of income and hence became ""work"" or because I've moved on. 
I still think that I would rediscover my liking once I change my primary source of income. 

But more importantly, have no clue what I should be doing. I'm 25 and I'm from India. So I'm just on the borderline of being a failure at this point, that's if I'm not one already.

All I got is, working at a startup as an account executive or client success (sales and support role) because that's the only thing else I actually have any experience in. 

Do you think my years as a freelancer would be considered as a gap in my resume? (2-3 years) 

If you've made it this far, I'd just like to say thanks for reading. I think I'm feeling a little bit better just saying all this finally, out loud, even though It being through behind a screen. But you reading this, means a lot :)

I'm open to listening to all suggestions. Don't know who even to talk to because I feel no one would understand.

I, 38f, am in a cross roads position. I had children way young and never made it past an associates degree. I’ve done ok for myself, but last year was kinda the tipping point of being stuck in a career I felt was going no where. That, coupled with a shit show of a year (thanks 2023), I left my last job in sept with nothing new lined up. When I say it was a horrible year, I mean my immediate family went through 6 surgeries, 3 deaths, 2 car accidents, 1 gun shot wound, and a partridge in a pear tree. My mental health all but peaced out. And, I neglected my friendships to the point where I don’t have many left. 

My husband makes good enough money but doesn’t have health insurance available so I’ve always provided it through my job. Because of this and the fact that I am going stir crazy, I started applying for jobs in my field (procurement) again and have almost no luck except for an interview coming up next week. So here are my options:

A. If they do offer the position I’m interviewing for, take it. Details- gov job, good benefits, pay’s decent but minimum I would take to stay in this field, and 15 min from my house. The “safe” choice. If they don’t offer, keep applying in my field. 

B. Find another job that offers health insurance and a flexible enough schedule that I could go back to school in something I actually want to do. Pay wouldn’t really matter, I’d really just be looking for a place that could put me around people and insure my family. I don’t know that I could do fast food, but just about anything else is on the table. 

C. My husband wants me to stay home and take a break. We could cover health insurance through the marketplace (we’re paying for cobra at the moment) and I could just do me. Problem is, I have no idea what to do. We’ve had separate bank accounts our whole marriage because we married later in life. I hate the idea of not contributing and being dependent on his salary only. 

D. Therapy 🥸 which I should probably do anyways…

195qu1d,Seeking Career Advice,"Hello everyone ,

I’m at a crossroads in my career and could use some advice. I’m 36, with a one-year-old and a supportive wife, living in one of the countries in Caucasus. My background is in history education, but I’ve spent the past few years in the hospitality industry, working as a night supervisor at a 5-star hotel and later transitioning to a sales director and incoming manager role in a travel agency.

Recently, I’ve come to the realization that this path might not lead to the bright future I envisioned for myself. With a newborn, the challenges seem even more daunting. I’m reaching out to the community for advice on what to learn, whether it’s through courses or other means, to make a successful transition to a more promising career.

Would i be shooting my self in the foot here? Would my manager lose trust? I know promotions and evaluations are every 6 months. Would it be better to wait it out and request a different role and responsibilities once i prove myself?

They consider me super highly in my current startup given my background and project experience. Honestly I joined the company more for the company and its potential rather than the position.

What do you think I should do? Ask about this role or wait it out?

195p9w1,"Take lower-paying job for a great foot in the door, or hold out?","I'm just gonna get right to the facts.

I'm (23M) married with one kid (2 years old) and another on the way due in March. Currently I make about 50K/yr after tax between two part-time jobs and a small pressure-washing business I run

Right now our yearly budgeted spending is 43K for 2024 - if we got really strict, like worked out at home/never eat out/try to cut the grocery budget, we could get that down to 40K.

We both place a high value on my wife being the sole care-taker and nurturer of our children until they are school-aged at least, so her going back to some kind of work is not totally off the table but not ideal

Here we go... Obviously, I can't work three part-time jobs and 60 hours a week for the rest of my life. And one of these jobs (21K/yr of that 50K) has a contract ending in 5 months. I need to get started on a new career

I have an offer for $35K from a small, very reputable financial advising firm to come on as a service associate for their clients. Pay will increase a little when I complete a couple of different licensing things. The thing is, my wife would have to go back to work unless the pay increases by like $10K/year. She has a good connection with a remote job where she can make $1K/month doing 10 hours a week. It just would stretch her pretty thin with 2 kids 2 and under.

Finance seems like a really good career path for me. I love people, I am good at relationships, was pretty good at math in school. I'm just wondering if we should try to make it work for better work-life balance and a good foot in the door or if it's just too low.

Side-hustle ideas and budgeting hacks are welcome as well. Thanks, reddit.

PS don't be a jerk about having two kids at my age and how that's hamstringing us. I'm sick of hearing that. First kid wasn't planned but having him is the best thing we have ever done.

I am an unemployed person with a B.com from India. I have been a very analytical type of person, always interested in human beings and the way they behave. I was always curious about that and I know quite a lot of ways to recognize behavior patterns.

The other option is I go for psychology as an academic career. I aim to have a positive impact on society and I think psychology mastery can help me do that.

1) would you stay in this postdoc until the end of the contract in order to get the 2 full years of industry experience, despite the frustating conditions?

195k90f,Is it time to leave?,"TLDR: I’ve been with my current company for nearly 5 years now and haven’t had the growth I’ve been promised and overlooked for promotions, is it time to move on?

I joined a small company 5 years ago because it took over for the larger company I was working for. Right off of the bat my manager (who was also my manager at my other company) was promising me that once the company got big enough, X position was mine.

I worked incredibly hard to be the best employee, saw some job growth, though not given X position because it wasn’t yet needed for the company’s size.

Then in 2021 an outside hire was brought in out of the blue for X position. Shocked, I asked my manager what happened and they explained that there was a demand from a client for the person being hired for X position to have a specific type of experience which I didn’t have, neither did my manager for that matter. Manager assures me that if that wasn’t the case, they wouldn’t have made an outside hire and it would have been me.

Three months later I request a conversation with my manager about my future with the company, what I can do to secure the promotion when it comes available again, etc. 
 I’m assured that I’m doing a great and they would get me more training on a few certain things to prepare me.

Seven months later I’m still given none of the promised training, and whenever I check in my with manager about it, they more or less tell me they’re too busy. I’m given my review which goes great, they have nothing but good things to say about me and I reiterate my passion for moving into X role when it’s available. Again manager promises training. 

Now a year later from when that first position came available my manager calls me to inform me that the person hired is being terminated, but they’ve also already found someone to fill the role. The excuse I’m given this time is that they have experience doing X project, which is one of the projects I was told 9 months ago I’d be given training on but wasn’t. 

It’s now been two years since that original person was hired for X position and the second person hired for that position was terminated and yet again, an outside hire was brought in immediately. My manager offers no explanation or warning this time, I find out in a weekly newsletter.

It’s obvious to me that my manager does not want to promote me. My supervisor has always expressed confusion as to why because they feel I’m invaluable and would be great in the position. 

I think it’s because either they are too comfortable in the role I’m in because I would be hard to replace, or that I got pregnant and had a child. I’m leaning towards the latter because my year end bonus was 1/3 of what it usually is and even 1/2 of what my assistant got on the year I had my child and took maternity leave. 

My dilemma is that current position offers WFH with little overhead which is unheard of this field. WFH also provides me with a lot of flexibility with my young child.

Do I look for something else in my field that would pay me a bit more, though not significantly and no WFH option for potential growth opportunities? I thought I could stick it out a few more years until my child is older, but constantly getting passed up for promotions I truly feel I deserve is draining.",PeachaRon326,1,1.0,1,1705138009,2024-01-13 09:26:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/195k90f/is_it_time_to_leave/,1,2024

One of the vendors I work with is trying to poach me. They are a SaaS startup with a great company culture and are in a secure industry. They are asking if I am free to fly me out to their HQ (on their dime) to meet the team before even making an offer.

But they want me to start in an entry-level role doing tech support as part of their customer service team.

Say No, move to a different team in the same role as today, prove myself and get to PM in a few years. This would mean I learn a whole lot and get excited/challenged again.

 I however what I don’t want to accept the promotion and just leave as that’s not who I am.

The logical thing to accept it just doesn’t feel right somehow.  Do you have any advice?  Thanks!

195ipc0,Anxiety and guilt for resignation,"Hi everybody. 
At the moment I work in a small company, I got it when I was 21 and it's my first job experience. As soon as I got in, they offered me to pay for my education and they made me a manager of the company. I have important responsibilities, so I worked hard (often overtime) but this also caused me a lot of stress. Plus, I don't like so much the environment (not much flexibility and smart working, too much responsibilities for a normal income, I can't plan any vacations until the very last moment because there could always be an urgency) and I don't have a senior person to look up to, so I also feel professionally stuck. In general, I started to loose interest in my job and the company itself. 
Last week, I got offered a new job, full remote (that could help me a lot since my girlfriend is from another country), better income, less responsibilities and much more flexibility. Other than that, I would like much more what I would do. 
Problem is, I feel so terribly anxious about telling my boss that I'm about to decline the job offer. I'm afraid they'll get angry and I feel guilty that they hired me when I was no one, educated me, gave me an important position, and now I would leave then in a bad timing (financial situation is quite bad), with a lot of overwork to do. Lately, they've made me attend meetings to discuss 2024-2025 and said how much they rely on me and the other board of managers.

195gzno,Need a refresh on salary negotiation after fumbling with the recruiter,"I interview extremely well. I know this not from being conceited, but being offered the role each and every time I’ve gotten the interview. Still, I’m such a dork when it comes to salary negotiations. I’ve been on both sides. I know the game, but still: awful when advocating for myself.

Current situation: 2 months unemployed. Not sweating. Picking and choosing next gig in digital marketing. Mid-senior roles.

Recruiter and I hit it off. Convo ends with salary. She asked if I’m currently working at former role, I state no. Then says my asking salary of $150K (forced field entry on application) was out of scope and that this role would be $125K tops, but that she could get that done.

I state (like dork) that I’m solely interested in this role and no other. Salary is just a number. Happiness and fit mean more. (Ugh). She laps it up. OK great. 

Then, had a lovely interview with my would be manager. Awesome. Next now is the team at large and then I’m told that’s it. It’s my intention to nail this last step and then say something like “Now that I’ve gotten a better sense of the role, I would like to revisit salary as there’s more being asked of me here than originally understood. I feel we need to start at $140K.”

But I’m worried I anchored myself too hard to the recruiter’s original stated salary, a salary that I believe was deflated due to knowledge I’m unemployed. That I’ll take anything (partly true, partly not). Is it a good tactic to revisit at the end, when you’ve got them showing their hand in interest to hire? Is that expected? Will they balk because I’m on record saying $125K is “fine”? Any guidance on phrasing dos/don’ts in order to get that $140K+?",afriendlynyrve,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1705125147,2024-01-13 05:52:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/195gzno/need_a_refresh_on_salary_negotiation_after/,1,2024

195gmql,I [F31] got ghosted by previous employer twice…is it me🤔?,"I worked for a company and I was happy. I received a lot of praise and got along with everyone. I wasn’t looking for other opportunities but I was recruited by another company who offered me 23k more than I was making to leave them. I set a meeting with my managers and told them I had another offer but I really wanted to stay with them. They told me that they would promote me and give me a raise but the raise would only be a 3k increase. I said I’ll take that and turn down the other job. I wanted to stay because I was comfortable and they promised to put me in a position that would look great on my resume. 

Anyway long story short the other company offered me a 50k increase and the current company at the time never submitted me for a promotion so I ended up taking the other job offer but left on good terms. It was a risk but I did it. I ended up getting pregnant and when I was 9 months pregnant the new company laid me off. 

After baby was born I reached out to my old manager and she ghosted me. I assumed maybe she was just busy and forgot to respond. Then I applied for a couple of jobs in my field for my old company and I just received a rejection letter. I didn’t even get an interview. I’m really trying not to take it personally but I feel so hurt. I feel a lot of rejection and ultimately stupid. Is it me?

195ggl9,What path should I take for my career?,"**Background Info:** Im currently starting year 12 and am doing all general classes. I get regular grades and am an average student, although I do above average in mathematics and could've chosen ATAR. In terms of subjects at school, I would say that im stronger in mathematics and slightly stronger in science, whilst being weak in english and similar areas.  
  
As for my future career, I dont have any particular interests or passions. I know its shallow and discouraged, but because of this my main motivator for a career path is money and a good WLB (and perhaps in a field where there is a chance for remote work, as it would help in my passion of exploring the world). I currently work at McDonalds as well as an irrigation supplier, and whilst I don't find either of these particularly interesting, I wouldn't mind working them for a longer period of time. This makes me feel that I could probably apply this similarly to something in the future, where I just work through whatever role im in, and it doesnt necessarily has to interest me or be my passion, but just as a means to live and thrive.  
  
**One path** I was considering was maybe dropping out this year at 17 and starting an electrician apprenticeship, to then go on to do FIFO for a few years just to get some money whilst younger and to fund a degree in Electrical Engineering after my fifo work, maybe starting around 24-25. My reasoning behind this is I wouldn't be in the trades for a very long time, and with the practical knowledge behind me, it would hopefully make the difficult degree easier for me, as due to my grades and me only doing general, I feel it'd be very hard trying to do this straight out of school.  
  
**Another path** I was considering was going to tafe after school for an IT diploma which would allow me to go for my bachelors in computer science at uni. Then I would get an entry level IT position (perhaps a help desk) and complete certifications on the side to level up to somewhere in data entry, cyber security or software engineering. I've watched some videos in the past on python and it did seem like something I could probably see myself working with in the future. I am unsure though as it seems like a hard career to break into and even harder considering that Australia probably isn't the ideal place for an IT career  
  
**So for my questions:**  
  
What would path would you think would be better suited for me, and if there was another path I hadn't considered that you'd recommend.  
  
Was there an easier/faster way in order to be eligible as a FIFO electrician then completing a 3 year apprenticeship?  
  
If I went with the EE route, do you think that It would be too difficult for me, regardless of the practical knowledge I'd have going into it?  
  
If I was to do an apprenticeship, would your recommend as I am so close to getting my WACE and graduation, I should just stay and delay the apprenticeship until after my certificate?  
  
If you took a similar path to one of the ones I had stated, what was your experience like and did you have any regrets?  
  
  
  
**If there was any questions you had for me to get a better idea on your answers, please just ask in the comments.**

195g540,How to ask for raise as an essential worker?,"In a post-pandemic world, it seems like so many people still get to work from home. But for many of us “essential workers” that isn’t the case. In my company about 80% of the staff are fully remote. The rest of us are hybrid, with many of us working in the office 4 days a week. 

So the past year this company froze pay increases and retirement matching. And recently I read an article that said that work from home / remote employees stated that they are saving 5-10k per year due to not driving as much. I guess this is from both time saved, and less gas and vehicle wear and tear. 

My point is, if 80% of my coworkers are saving 5-10k a year, and I am not. And neither of us are getting a raise. How is this fair? 

If I’m thinking about this right, shouldn’t essential workers that are required to be in the office 4 days a week be entitled to 80% of 5-10k more than people working fully remotely? And if so, what’s the best way to argue this point to my boss and HR?

3.I have no safety net, no family or good friends to make up for may mistake I may make or expense.


So I am trying to leave my current job to go to a new job and I have a few options.
1. Entry level management position for supervisor experience and training ( I thought it might help for the field) and attend some sort of college if possible.
2. Military, obvious pros but I was wondering if infantry or MP was better for the experience? I could aslo get college assistance from it but with no safety net I was worried about homelessness in this economy.

195ekqu,"Should I keep my job (150K, Remote) or take this SWE training program?","  
Hello all,  
  
I need help making a decision between keeping my current job (150K salary, Remote) or doing this training program. The program is 18-weeks, full-time, geared towards teaching you to become a software engineer. I got a scholarship so it is completely free. I want to be thoughtful in my decision so I listed out context and my considerations below: Why the Program, The Pros/Cons, how I feel about my job, 

If I can provide more context to inform guidance please let me know.  
Thank you in advance :)  
  
**Why the training program?**  
I found the program when I was googling different coursework on-line for my job. As part of my project, I work with a lot of technical-roles e.g. engineers, developers, data stewards. It was difficult for me to understand what they do and why, even as it relates to the project. I found myself hitting a mental wall trying to understand their work. I saw the program and thought there was no harm in applying. Here I am.

 I don’t think this 18-week program will teach me to become a software engineer. However, I do think it will provide me the basics so I can building a depth of understanding. Depending on how I do in the program, my plan is to pursue the longer road become a software engineer. I can also find another role where the education from the program + my current skill set would be a good fit. Reflecting on why, another reason is I want to prove to myself that I could learn the subject area. I have a chip on my shoulder. In university, I tried to become a CS major, but I was working three jobs to put myself through school. I didn’t dedicate enough time and didn’t know how to ask for help. I see this as an opportunity to give it a solid attempt.  


**Pros:**  
  
\- I have at least 20+ years of working ahead of me, 4.5 months in training is a drop in a bucket in comparison  
  
\- Fridays of the program are dedicated to job support ex: career fairs, resume support  
  
\- In my research, most alumni in the program have found entry-level jobs in tech  
  
\- Program provides classroom structure that helps me learn. I have tried self-paced learning and I do okay. It's much easier for me to learn in a classroom setting.  
  
\- Program qualifies for unemployment insurance benefits  
  
\- The program is fully remote. For the last 2 years, I have been living in a different city in the US ever 4-6 weeks. It's great and I love it. This program would continue to let me travel.  
  
**Cons:**  
  
\- I would not be earning income at this time. I have an emergency fund + savings. I could take on a part-time job but this program is intensive and I don't want to overextend myself.  
  
\- Alumni in the program have found jobs in tech, median income is lower than what I currently make.  
  
\- The program is full-time which would mean I would have to quit my job and lose my health insurance. I am pretty healthy. However, there was a time when I didn't have insurance and I had to go to the ER. It is awful and I would not recommend.  
  
**How I feel about my job:**  
  
My job is just that, a job. I don't feel a strong attachment to it. However, I recognize that it has enabled me to live a comfortable lifestyle so I work hard but I don't overdo it. There is opportunity to grow in the company but that would require sacrificing personal time and I don't feel a desire to climb the ladder.  
  
Coincidentally, the day prior to getting offered my seat in the program, I was removed from my project due to budget constraints. I will be sitting on the bench starting next week.

195cd26,Should I change fields?,"I’m currently a director in a field I’ve specialized in since college. Going on 15 years. In my current role, it’s not horrible but I have a bad relationship with my boss and think he is a horrible/person leader. I have felt harassed for over a year now. I am also facing quite a few challenges/roadblocks and he is not supportive in helping me address them to improve operations. Many times I have brought issues to light and my thoughts on solutions, and he bites my head off (his fav phrase is “that’s YOUR way”); however, when a problem eventually results or someone else brings up the same thing I said, he is receptive to it. I’m just tired of it.

So I have several allies on the c-suite (my boss is also c-suite) and I told one I trust about my issues and asked if he saw any other opportunities for me in the company. He was pretty excited and told me my skills could definitely be used in a few different areas and that he and our COO could find a role for me. But, he told me I should tell my boss my issues with him before I make any decision to leave my current role.

So I’ve been putting off that confrontation because I think it will be ugly and not sure it will help. Plus, as time has gone by, I’ve really considered whether getting into a new field, developing new skills, and diversifying my experience would be a good thing for me. I think I am getting kind of burnt out in my current field.

I’m very excited about the opportunity because it’s in the field that I want to be in whereas my role right now isn’t what I wanna do for the next 40 years of my life. I forgot to ask the recruiter how many interviews there will be for this role, but I suspect the second one is likely the last since it’s with the director I would potentially be working under.

The only problem is the Glassdoor reviews for this company are pretty bad tbh. The positive 5 star reviews are very obviously written by chat GPT or some other AI tool (the reviews are posted within a day of each other and have very similar language - the words and phrases used aren’t what the average person would type up).

Is it fine for me to reach out to a few current employees on LinkedIn in the same role that I’m applying for to ask about their experience there? I’m not sure if it’s best to wait until I have an offer in hand (if I happen to get one) or ask them now and just preface that I’ve had interview one and have another coming up. I’m not sure if they’d even be able to due to how soon the next interview is, given the weekend as well. Like I said, I’m very excited about the role as it’s in the city I want to relocate to and the role aligns with my professional goals. However, my current company has fairly decent benefits (granted I’m not enjoying the work I do and would hate to be stuck doing this forever), and some of the Glassdoor reviews for the potential company said benefits are pretty awful, so I don’t want to make any rash decisions.",SurferBoi_,3,1.0,5,1705110017,2024-01-13 01:40:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/195c4hm/is_it_okay_to_reach_out_to_current_employees_at/,1,2024

195bvh2,"For those who make $150k+, what do you do for a living?","Hey Everyone,

For those who make $150k+, what do you do? I graduated with a B.S. in Management Info. Systems, 4.0GPA, from a state university. It is considered an IT/Business degree. For the past 7+ years, I am employed as a logistics coordinator. Additionally, I’ve held a position as a process analyst at a F500 energy company. Unfortunately, due to many reasons, I left the role after 8 months. 

I’m currently 27 years old and feel I’m running out of time. All the roles I’m interested in, I constantly get rejected due to a lack of an applicable degree such as accounting, finance, and economics and/or lack of a target school. I wanted to try Commercial Real Estate  particularly acquisitions or development, but pivoting is difficult, the same applies to IB/PE. I also don’t know whether it’s something I’d enjoy.

As most, I’d like to reach the American dream and improve the lives of my family members. It’s a goal I set for myself when we moved to the US.

195biy6,In my last year of high school and can't decide between following my passion or being realistic.,"Hi guys, I am a 17 year old from Canada and I'm at a complete loss on what to do with my career. I've already submitted all my university applications for computer science; I choose computer science because I took courses for it in high school and found it fun, easy to grasp onto and I got high 90s in those classes.  
  
As of two months ago after my first ever gig, I realized how much I truly love music. I play the double bass and I do a bit of jazz but mainly orchestral music. I only realized so late because I simply haven't been playing that long, I only began at the start of high school. This does seem kind of sudden and last minute to decide I want to do something completely different now, but truth is that I think I've always loved it and it always took priority over everything else, all of my friends are musicians, thinking about my next performance or concert is what gets me through the week and it's all that I think about.  
  
I feel like my concerns with changing career paths to music are obvious. If I did music I would want to play full-time with a professional symphony orchestra and although double bass does not have a lot of competition in comparison to let's say violin, it is still very competitive. All of the orchestras that pay a comfortable wage ($100-150K) are the famous ones, although I've done my research and it seems like everyone in those ensembles studied at Julliard. I've looked at some smaller professional orchestras but they wages closer to $35k a year and I really doubt that I could live on that alone. I'm sure many musicians do other things or a few gigs on the side but I do not want to do gig work alone for a living, I want to have a steady income and having a high income is also important to me.  
  
I've never really felt passionate about computer science, I like it right now and calculus is going okay for me right now but I wouldn't be surprised if I got to university and did my computer science degree and completely burned myself out and hated higher level math and computer science. I mostly just chose it because it can generate a good income, I was good at it in high school and it was the one realistic career I could think of that I could tolerate the most.  
  
Even if I do go into computer science I will always do music, there are a multitude of community orchestras out there. But just the idea of never really being able to fully commit myself and give my all to what I truly love scares me. If I did go into music, I'd want to take a gap year or multiple and just focus on practicing and getting better while working too but that also brings in the question of parents and finances and not wanting to depend on them for so long. Even if I go somewhere good for music, it's definitely still a huge risk with my career but on the other hand the computer science job market is also pretty terrible right now and basically everyone else my age is also applying to computer science. I'm entirely stuck on what I should do with my life because I love music, but I don't come from money and I don't want to be dependent on my parents for too long.

195bhyw,Lost in the Party Haze: Navigating College and Seeking Career Fulfillment as a Freshman,"Hey r/careeradvice

As a college freshman, navigating campus life has proven to be quite a challenge. Amidst a culture where the primary focus is on partying and earning a degree, the lack of consideration for what comes next leaves me questioning the meaningfulness of my efforts. The struggle intensifies as, despite taking my career seriously, it feels like nobody personally cares or wants to engage in conversations about anything related to careers besides professors. I'm seeking advice on finding fulfillment in a college atmosphere geared towards partying, where career dedication often goes unnoticed until one's last semester.

195astw,Opinions,"Hi! Throwaway account for obvious reasons, don’t want to jeopardize a potential employment opportunity in the insanely rare chance a member of the organization is on here.

About a year I applied to and ultimately withdrew my application to a company locally (company b). My current employer then had changes and I wanted to be apart of growth.

I called and spoke with their hiring manager who was incredibly pleased and left me a voicemail telling me if I was ever interested in that company again, to please reach out to him directly.

Well it’s been about a year, my current employer isn’t meeting my expectations, I saw company b hiring for that position and I applied. I’ve regretted not following through since last year.

My question is, while my application is being reviewed, should I reach out that that hiring manager again and let him know I’m interested in a position they’re hiring for, like they’re original offer in the voicemail?

My what-if’s are getting me; what if he’s gone, what if I’m being impatient, what if I’ll come across as “pushy”, etc.

Anyone care to shed some opinions or their $0.02?

On one hand I feel it can’t hurt given his voicemail was verbatim “if you ever are interested in company b, please don’t hesitate to call me back” but I also don’t want to jeopardize my opportunity with my pending application, if that’s possible.

I pursued an internship as a web developer at TATA Technology in 2018 and in middle I started with my Master's in Computer Application, which I had to leave unfinished due to personal reasons.

Despite my educational background, the employment gap since my post-graduation in 2020 poses a challenge.

I currently work for Company A and enjoy my job. However, I recently got an offer from Company B for way more money and I accepted their offer a month ago. My start date for Company B is Monday, January 22nd of 2024.
I started my background check a month ago for Company B and hoped it would be done on time for me to give a 2 week notice at Company A. Unfortunately, it is now a week and one business days until I start at Company B and my background check has still not been completed (I’ve passed everything but the felony related background checks according to my recruiter. I have never committed a crime so I know I’m fine).
After having been recently laid off, I don’t want to give notice at Company A until I’m 100% guaranteed to start at Company B, which is dependent on a successful background check. If my background check finally goes through next week and I give a three or four day notice to Company A, are they going to black list me? My friends and family are saying it’s rude to have not already given notice but I don’t want to risk the (admittedly highly unlikely) chance of giving notice to Company A and then my offer somehow being revoked for Company B.

1957crf,Honesty in my review? YAY or NAY?,"Sorry for this long post but I wanted to provide context. Any insight is much appreciated!  
I've been working for a small company (<50) employees for the past 1.5 years -- they found my resume on Linkedin and offered me a job based on my relevant work experience. This is a company that creates a small artesian niche product so most of the staff are production laborers and artists. Most people make under $20/hr. The deal was that I would work as long as they were lenient towards my ever-changing availability since I'm currently working towards a college degree. So every 10 weeks I've been changing my availability which usually gives me 3-4 days a week in the ""office"". During my time there I've had great reviews, I'm reliable and likable. Seriously, I never get negative feedback about my work.  
So about 9 months into my employment I realize I dont have the same PTO as everyone else and I go to HR. They said I’m classified as a part time employee and I dont get benefits. To change this would require lots of paper work – implying they weren’t going to do it. The next day my direct supervisor informs me that if I have anymore questions I should come to her first – so thats when I asked about my benefits and my job status. She gets defensive, says she doesn’t know and when asked if she could find out and give me answer at a later date  I’m given a hostile “SURE but honestly, I'm can already tell you I wont find an answer”.   
I never got a follow up and many weeks later I'm in a review for my one-year anniversary -- I get an amazing report about the quality of my work but before it's done I ask about pay raises and benefits to which I'm told ""That's not a question for us"". At this point everyone in management has been passing the buck -- I've done everything I'm told in regards to getting my question answered and I still have no answers. So -- my boss wants me to create 2 goals or objectives to set to accomplish during the next quarter. So here I am in a situation where I’m not being compensated fairly for my job and they want me to do MORE work without taking the time to address my concern in the first place. I decided one of my goals/objectives this quarter was to sit down and discuss my position and benefits at the company, including benefits and salary, with a manager. I penciled that into my goal sheet and turned it in.  
This caught the attention of the big boss – the director of operations – who pulls me into a meeting room with my supervisor. They are upset that I’ve been requesting clarity for my role and instead of helping me, they say I’m limited to 3 days a week at work claiming that my letter sounded angry and unprofessional. I mentioned that I understood it's a touchy subject but I intended to communicate clearly about my concerns and intentions and that if it was interpreted as ""angry"" that would be on them.  I imagine these conversations have been heated in the past which is why they get defensive -- but I kept my cool and was dismissed back to work.  
A few weeks and two more meetings go by, an audit ultimately shows I'm averaging FT hours and the company granted me all the benefits of an FT employee including a raise! Before leaving the office, HR made a point to tell me how unprofessional I was to which I responded I was only advocating for myself through clear and direct communication. If they wanted to discuss it further I’d be open to the discussion. (I never heard about it again.)  
Fast forward, to my next review coming up this next week! Our HR person is new and the company has restructured the review process -- they want us to talk about how we feel about our place in the company and provide feedback for management. I know there's currently a mass exodus of people leaving the company because of the low wages and the disrespect from management. I'm still a great asset to this company and give 100% but I haven't forgotten about how they treated me during this last review process.  
I'll be graduating this year so until I find a job this position: is my livelihood. Because we're short-staffed currently, I've been asked to help in another department and I've been enjoying the supervisor there quite a bit. I've mentioned a couple of things they could do to improve efficiency and there's talk of me creating a system of reference materials to help with training in the future. Because of my schooling -- I am savvy with software and have the skills to do this -- I'd like to offer this as one of my goals for the upcoming quarter but this also, in my opinion, requires more money than I currently make hourly.  
My question is: how honest do I get in this review? I would like to talk about how awful I was treated during the last review but it's been made very clear to me how management works at this company. Anyone who speaks up has concerns or questions the upper management gets attacked, punished, or fired. I feel like my best bet is to just smile and nod because this question/conversation feels loaded.  
Also, if I'm creating these reference materials, I need to be paid more -- is that fair? An old colleague ran the Instagram. He's a professional photographer on the side so when he did that work for the company he made a different salary than he did when working on the floor. I'm happy to help but if we're tapping into my skillset I need to make more. Am I being fair? If so, how do I navigate getting through this without upsetting upper management?

1957aq9,Did I miss a $200k/year opportunity by signing too soon? Re-negotiation possible?,"I'm currently navigating a very fortunate, yet challenging scenario involving multiple job offers and could use some guidance on the negotiation process, a terrain I'm relatively inexperienced in.  
Here's the situation:  
Offer 1: $165k + good equity (declined)  
Offer 2: $175k + very good equity (signed within 48h, verbally accepted after 12h because of huge pressure from the recruiter and the company)  
Offer 3: $200k + very good equity (received two days after offer 2)  
I told Company 2 about Offer 1, and they immediately outbid it by $10k and offered double the original equity. That came with the drawback that they wanted me to verbally agree within 12, and sign within 48 hours while stopping all other negotiations.  
Shortly after committing to Offer 2, Offer 3 came in: I mentioned Offer 2 to Company 3, leading them to immediately increase Offer 3 from $140k to $200k and tripling their equity offer.  
Now, my dilemma is that while I prefer Company 2, the financial terms of Company 3 are more attractive. I feel I may have prematurely committed to Offer 2 due to pressure, possibly missing out on a better deal. Had Offer 3 come in just a bit earlier, I believe Company 2 might have been willing to match or exceed it.  
I'm aware that this might come off as greedy or unethical, but I'm curious about the norms and experiences in such situations. Is it too late to renegotiate with Company 2, considering my acceptance of their offer? My gut tells me it's a lost cause due to my earlier decision, but I'm eager to hear perspectives from those more seasoned in such things.  
(It's worth noting that all non-financial aspects of these offers are nearly identical.)

1956r5x,A little insight on where to go!,"Just wanting to post here and see if anyone else has been in similar situations, and can offer some friendly advice!

I graduated back in 2016 with an Ops Management degree. Decided not to pursue a career in it, but stay working graveyard at a growing coffee chain. Worked my way up, and over 2 years landed a job at headquarters in the social media department. Stayed there for 3 years, and landed a spot as a digital marketing specialist that would oversee the entire southern region of the company. Pretty cool actually.

Got let go in 2021 right after I came back from my honeymoon. Hit the ground running in applying to anything and everything I could think and see. I started trying to freelance my social media and videography skills. I applied to thousands of jobs, but never landed anything.

I'd spend weeks doing 50 or so a day. Then take a break, then do it again for weeks. Not just in the social media/digital marketing space, either. In sales, IT, operations, anything I feel that I could do. I would tweak my resume, fix my LinkedIn, connect with recruiters, etc.

Changed my resume countless times, sent it to ""professionals"" to tweak it or coach me on it. Studied interview skills, etc, etc. I did everything that everyone suggests.

I did some odd jobs as side work, and focused on pouring into my business. Worked for a local social media marketing agency and managed 7-10 clients for about 2 years. They got slow recently, so they took those accounts back.

Mid 2023 I decided to say ""forget social media"" let me dive all in on videography since I'm good at it. I got busy fast, and had a busy summer. Then it slowed down in the fall, and I haven't had any projects for 2 months now. BUT that showed me that I CAN do it, which felt SO damn good inside.

I'm working at a higher end steakhouse as a server now, and still doing what I can to build my videography business, but I just struggle mentally at times and feel defeated.

1956p7x,Brit Trying to Move to Canada Looking for Advice,"I am a UK resident who in November got a 2 year work permit (IEC) for Canada. Since then I have been actively applying to data science positions across Canada, although ideally I am trying to move to an on-sight / hybrid position in British Columbia.

  
I appreciate that hiring slows down over the Christmas period so am hoping things start to pick up over the coming weeks as I continue to apply, however have not yet had any luck even getting to interview. Unfortunately, most rejections I have had are from automated mailboxes that do not offer any feedback on the application. I had a couple rejections that were almost the same day as the application, making me think that the hiring team did not even look at my application or relevant information!

  
Because of this, its difficult to know what I need to change in my applications but in my mind, a few things jump to mind as potential blockers:

  
	•	UK address and phone number on resume  
	•	Finite work permit (although I do not specify the length of time)  
	•	Qualifications in British standards (eg Distinction versus 4.0 GPA)  
	•	Canadian natives preferred  
	•	LinkedIn applications only considered from Canada

  
Now I know another obvious blocker is the pure competitiveness of tech positions against potentially hundreds of other candidates, but currently there are so many possible variables that it is difficult to know what I need to change to make this work!

  
Has anyone here had any experience moving to Canada from abroad? I am trying to avoid moving out there and looking for work from a residence in Canada but is this the only way nowadays?  
I'd love to hear anybodies experience in this and whether there is any general advice to pass on!",couplezuts,1,1.0,0,1705095830,2024-01-12 21:43:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1956p7x/brit_trying_to_move_to_canada_looking_for_advice/,1,2024
1956meh,Company very much underpaying me but I cannot leave because I don't have enough experience. What can I do?,"Throwaway account because my other is too personal... After I got laid off 1.5yrs ago, I managed to flip industries and became an engineer like I had always wanted to be. I was in finance but ended up hating it mostly. Now, I am an Infrastructure Security Engineer in the US making about 75k often without even a bonus. I have very weak benefits overall, I pay a decent chunk out of pocket for healthcare because I am not perfectly healthy, my ESPP and 401k match are both pretty garbage too. Overall, benefits package is pretty shit.

Upside is, I love my team, my job is what I enjoy doing and the work life balance is phenomenal. I actually do feel like my company is nice to me and not constantly screaming at us or toxic (honestly a far cry from the finance industry where I made even less and was constantly miserable). Typically I don't actually have to do much unless something breaks, which is a gift and a curse.

So my problem now is, in the broader market, I am pretty dramatically underpaid. Average pay for this same position at other companies starts at 90k with no experience. I would really like to work on increasing my earnings potential but my company just refuses to assist me in that regard. My raise last year was 1/3 inflation and I haven't even heard anything about them this year when I already should have. My boss and my director have both been trying to get me promoted but ""the company doesn't have any money"" (meanwhile record profits and the whole nine yards). 

My boss even told me if I could produce an offer letter, HR would work with her to keep me. The problem is, I can't do that because I have virtually no experience. I have only been in my position 1.5yr but I have been doing what I do in my own personal projects for almost 8 years now. I took this job because I already found it fun, I do home server engineering on the side. My degree is also in a field entirely outside what I currently do. My boss just gave me a break because she could tell I knew way more than my resume showed on paper and liked me.

So now what? How can I try to find better pay or try to get more from my own company with so little experience? It pains me to see my salary just evaporate year after year because they don't give a fuck. Any ideas? I was sort of thinking I need to just stick it out for another 2.5yrs before I can get any job better than this. That sucks but idk what else to do. Thanks folks.",Infinite_Resolve5526,5,0.6700000166893005,21,1705095626,2024-01-12 21:40:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1956meh/company_very_much_underpaying_me_but_i_cannot/,1,2024
1956c6y,Quarterly Review Honesty...,"Sorry for this long post but I wanted to provide context. Any insight is much appreciated!

I've been working for a small company (<50) employees for the past 1.5 years -- they found my resume on Linkedin and offered me a job based on my relevant work experience.  This is a company that creates a small artesian niche product so most of the staff are production laborers and artists. Most people make under $20/hr. The deal was that I would work as long as they were lenient towards my ever-changing availability since I'm working towards a degree in college. So every 10 weeks I've been changing my availability which usually gives me 3-4 days a week at work. During my time there I've had great reviews, I'm reliable and likable.   


I noticed about a year in that I was averaging FT hours but was classified as PT, meaning I wasn't accruing any benefits or holiday pay. I brought this up to HR who said it would require extra paperwork -- which I shrugged off. (my mistake!)  When my direct supervisor found out she told me that if I had questions I should go to her first -- so I emailed her a few weeks later and asked if we could discuss my position, benefits, pay, etc. I never got a response, and she never approached me, so I started the conversation before I left that day. She was defensive about explaining how raises and benefits work and brushed everything off because she doesn't have an answer -- I was gentle but direct and asked her if she could find some answers and get back to me.   


A couple weeks later I'm in a review for my one year -- I get an amazing report but before it's done I ask about pay raises and benefits to which I'm told ""that's not a question for us"". At this point everyone in management has been passing the buck -- I've done everything I'm supposed to and I still have no answers. My work wants me to create 2 goals or objectives to set to accomplish duringthe next quarter.  One of my goals was to discuss my role at the company, including benefits and salary, with a manager.   


A few weeks later I'm pulled into a meeting with the director of operations and my supervisor who then limit my hours to 3 days a week and made me feel horrible for questioning my role. They claimed I was angry in my wording but I explained that I was direct -- how they interpret what I wrote was on them because it wasn't rude. I also explained that I did everything I could to get an explanation from management but was brushed off and I was simply trying to advocate for myself and now I feel like I'm being punished.

A few weeks and two more meetings go by, HR says I'm unprofessional but ultimately an audit shows I'm working FT hours and I end up getting all the benefits of a FT employee and a raise!  


Fast forward, to my next review coming up this next week! Our HR person is new and the company has restructured the process -- they want us to talk about how we feel about our place in the company and provide feedback. I know there's a mass exodus of people leaving the company because of the low wages and the disrespect from management.  I'm still a great asset to this company and give 100% but I haven't forgotten about how they treated me during this last process. 

I'll be graduating this year so until I find a job this position is my livelihood.  Because we're short-staffed currently, I've been asked to help in another department where I've been enjoying the supervisor there quite a bit. I've mentioned a couple things they could do in order to improve efficiency and there's talk of me creating a system of reference materials to help with training in the future. Because of my schooling -- I am savvy with software and have the skills to do this -- but I'm thinking 

My question is:  how honest do I get in this review? I would like to talk about how awful I was treated during the last review but it's been made very clear to me how management works at this company. Anyone who speaks up has concerns or questions the upper management gets attacked. 

Also, if I'm creating these reference materials, I need to be paid more -- is that fair? I'm happy to help but if we're tapping into my skillset I need to make more.  Am I being fair? If so, how do I navigate getting through this without upsetting upper management? Or should I just put on a happy face and keep doing work until I start my new career?",zacharyjm00,1,1.0,0,1705094892,2024-01-12 21:28:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1956c6y/quarterly_review_honesty/,1,2024
19567y8,"I feel like I’m being mistreated at my job, should I quit?","Hi guys, I would like to ask for some advice. 

So for the past month I have been working for a “fast food” place (we make sushi bowls) and everyday it gets worse. For starters they have yet to made me do the HACCP certification, which is essential when you work with food, that was stipulated by the contract. And yet I do all kinds of food preparations, I cook salmon, shrimps, chicken (which is the most dangerous as any kind of mess up could potentially kill someone), cut and wash most fruit and vegetables. 


I have a training contract which should last over the period of 6 months in which I should be able to learn and apply all that there is to know about the job, and yet for the past month I was supposed to know everything beforehand whit my every question being met with huffs and rude answers, I was never given proper training and am being constantly scolded when I don’t know how to do things and when I do them wrong while being thought mostly none of it.


 Today I had for the first time a shift with the new manager and she was horrible, she knew nothing of the place and reprimanded me for doing things wrong (the little of which I had actually being thought), she constantly asked me to do things I didn’t know to which I always politely replied with “I’m sorry I don’t know how to do this thing, I haven’t done it yet” and that made her so mad that she pulled me apart to tell me very angrily “if you don’t stop saying you don’t know how to do things because you’ve never done them I’ll get fucking mad”, she also scolded me for every little thing I did wrong, while she made some heavy bottles of water fall by very high up on the ground barely missing some customers and laughing it off because it was her mistake. If she did “teach” me something I asked her she did it angrily and fast so by a result I learned nothing. 


Oh and she also said to me that I should do the training courses provided by the store app to learn everything, OUTSIDE of my working hours. She also came up to me and physically adjusted my hat without my consent and without telling me what she was about to do because she didn’t like that my visor was so low.

19562oi,23M opera singer and feeling lost,"I am currently pursuing a masters degree in opera performance and have an undergraduate degree in the same degree. I'm feeling very lost right now as to what path I should take and thought I'd ask here for advice.

My dilemma:

I have to give so much energy to this field and I feel like I’ve only been slightly improving over past couple years, despite having worked with several acclaimed teachers and practicing diligently. I’m facing serious burnout and am almost always depressed at school. I feel like I’m in a toxic relationship with opera. I enjoy singing but I’ve come to realize I don’t have the same level of passion that many of my peers do (even before burnout) and I get more frustrated by the day due to lack of improvement. As I’ve learned more about the industry, I’ve come to realize how bad the working conditions truly are–not to mention it’s a dying field and pay is horrendous. At the same time, it is still definitely something I care about and I’m afraid if I quit I will live to regret it. I’ve put so much time and effort in and to be frank, I know I am quite skilled but I just don’t know if I’m skilled enough or if it’s worth the sacrifice. I will definitely at the least stick out grad school as I have a good scholarship and frankly no other plans right now but I need to find a plan B. I have enough free time for a part-time job right now so I’d like to  use that time to develop a plan B while I am in grad school. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

1955gmy,New grad seeking advice on managing relationship with your supervisor,"Hello everyone! I've recently graduated from college and embarked on my career journey with a small commercial bank in the accounting department. The beginning has been a bit challenging. Our work setup is hybrid, with Mondays and Fridays dedicated to remote work and the rest of the week spent in the office. On my first day, which was a Tuesday, I completed my onboarding and was issued a company laptop for remote work. Unfortunately, the heavy rain that day made it impractical to carry the laptop home, as my bag was already full. That evening, around 8 pm, I received notice to work from home the next day due to severe weather, but without the laptop, I was unable to work, and my manager was not happy. I was very hesitant to explain the situation to her because I was uncertain if such explanations were appropriate.  
Additionally, my role in accounting often necessitates access to a specific account, which requires approval from our head office. This process took more than a week, and my manager wanted me to get my hands on it on the second day. Despite my repeated communications with the IT department stressing the urgency, they informed me that the matter was beyond their control and rested solely with the head office.  
Given these experiences, I'm concerned about future workflow issues and their impact on my relationship with my manager. I'm seeking advice on effectively communicating and justifying such situations. Any advice would be immensely helpful. Thank you!

19550y9,35 yo teacher desperately in need of a career change. Please help 🙏🏼,"Hi everyone,

Thanks for your time. I’m a teacher at an independent school in Los Angeles. Been teaching in various places/schools for over 10 years. This is the worst school I’ve ever taught at. I’ve been wanting to change careers for some time and this place has hammered the final nail into the coffin. 

I’ve been trying to figure out what else I’d do for a while and I’m having trouble. I would immensely appreciate any guidance or advice. 

Some things about me:
- I have a lot of hobbies and also own a fairly successful, highly rated small business. This is to say my skills are wide and extremely varied. 
- I’m an adventurous, explorer type. I’d be happiest in a career where every day is different and involves travel/time outdoors 
- I’m an out of the box thinker and thrive in places that appreciate that
- I’m not into programming/coding. This is one thing I’ve tried to learn many times and my interest just isn’t there
- I’m willing to stay in this job for one more year if there’s a certification I’d need to change careers that I could complete in a 12-18 months
- I thrive in positive environments and hate toxicity
- I need a good work/life balance 
- I work extremely hard and learn very quickly 

Anything between 60-80k 

I never speak badly about any place I’ve worked and I won’t name the school. And, this place/career is crushing my soul and livelihood.

Again, thanks for your time 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼",trovitapersono,8,0.9100000262260437,17,1705091583,2024-01-12 20:33:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19550y9/35_yo_teacher_desperately_in_need_of_a_career/,1,2024
1954v95,Lost an excellent job in IT. Feeling defeated. Looking for advice or encouragement.,"I had a great job in IT doing support. I was making a lot of money with three days remote and two in-office. I have no degree in IT, but I've always been good with tech and maintain an active interest in it, so computer janitor (what I used to call my role) fit me really well. Because I have a disability, no formal IT degree, or had much experience prior to my hiring I considered this job a huge stroke of luck. I was there for seven months.

I genuinely was learning a ton, getting my foot in the door in the industry, and was helping people, so I was very satisfied in my career. Every bit of feedback I got was that I was killing it, and that they were planning management roles for me. That's not something I've ever been able to say about my work. 

Around middle of November I was brought into a small room and fired on the spot for reasons they could not tell me, only that my conduct was inappropriate. When asked about my conduct they said they couldn't tell me anything, just that I was getting fired. I was given a huge severance payment and signed some paperwork saying I wouldn't sue them for it (in exchange for the payout)

Now it's January, almost two months to the day I got fired, and I'm still jobless, hopeless, and frankly don't feel like trying any more. I'm still hung up about the role. I still wonder what my conduct was. Now I feel despondent about everything, and I've been applying to jobs for weeks and I haven't heard anything back.

1954emb,How Can a Passionate Problem Solver Thrive Outside the Corporate Box? My Journey from Gentrification Studies to Non-Profit Leadership,"Hi, I'm not really against going corporate but I'm at a crossroads and could use your insights. Here's a bit about me:

  
Background: Studied cultural anthropology and did my thesis on gentrification in college and transitioned into a small non-profit (\~$5mil) where I rose to a director role and then scaled back to manager. Problem is, we recently re-hired an ED who hates me and it's time for me to go.

  
Interests: I thrive on creativity and alternative perspectives. I admire brands like Channel 5 with Andrew Callahan for their rawness and honesty. My interests span thru-hiking, urban exploration, alternative fashion, and technology.

  
Strengths: Problem-solving with a creative twist. At my non-profit, I initiated a unique financial assistance program that allowed for unorthodox requests like DACA renewals etc, yielding significant impacts. I'm also tech-savvy – I've leveraged AI to help me write code for fantasy basketball, winning multiple leagues.

  
Challenge: Interviews are tough for me. I value authenticity and struggle with traditional professional environments.

  
Goal: I want to pivot into a role that combines my creative and technological skills while staying true to my values. UX/UI design has caught my interest due to my tech affinity.

  
Question: What industries or career paths would suit someone like me – passionate, creative, and non-traditional. I guess I am just looking for exposure and inspiration for what's out there. I'm in Los Angeles if that matters.

  
Any advice, insights, or examples of unconventional career paths that might align with my profile would be incredibly helpful.

I don’t know what I really want to do. I was to feel like I am making a positive impact and be respected. 

In school, I was always a really great student when I applied myself and wasn’t dealing with depression issues. I had straight A’s my last two years of high school and earned student of the year. My strengths were always in English and writing. I am a very quick learner and very adept and insightful. 

Personally, I am a sort of timid, quiet, and anxious person who can be very shy. I am definitely an introvert. 

What sounds like a good path forward for me? I am incredibly indecisive and have no mentors.

1952yv8,Looking for feedback in my next career steps in manufacturing management.,"I am planning to leave my current position at my family's manufacturing company. Long story, happy to share if there is interest!

I want to be sure I am taking a good approach to choosing my next position. Please let me know if you see something I haven't thought of that I should take into consideration. Finding a job is not the problem. I want to find a well-paying position that I can excel in and that provides me a sense of fulfillment.

I graduated with my BS in Mechanical engineering back in 2015. I have been out of a formal engineering role for a few years, but am still in a heavily technical manufacturing role. I am considering an eventual transition to Data Science, but need to quickly exit my current role and first take on a role I am currently qualified for.  
  
I will be seeking a position in manufacturing as a Product Manager or Production Manager. I am also considering a riskier path of COO with a startup manufacturing company if I find the right business partner. Once my resume is ready to go, I will be having conversations with a few business owners I know to get their input and see if they have any industry connections they can introduce me to.

Part of my struggle is I am not excited to go work for a large corporate manufacturer. I know I can do whatever the job is, but I prefer working in a smaller scale environment that is fast paced. I want to have a very direct impact on the company I join.  
  
If you want to read, I have posted a draft of my resume on /r/engineeringresumes 

[https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2F09kkrzi18wbc1.png%3Fwidth%3D5100%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D94c3d386079b91ccf114bfe9c25c1fda76449162](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2F09kkrzi18wbc1.png%3Fwidth%3D5100%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D94c3d386079b91ccf114bfe9c25c1fda76449162)

It's hard to define these past 5 years. I have worn so many hats. I often don't feel like I am well qualified for these roles I am seeking, but many business owners have told me otherwise and I have already received a few soft offers for a new role. I also have an investor trying to get me to start my own business, but do not want to force it without an idea I am confident of. Would also love any feedback in general about my next career steps.

1952gx3,Navigating Career Satisfaction and Mental Health in Tech,"Hi Reddit,

I’ve been in the programming field since 2018, about 6 years now. My background is in engineering, not computer science, but I tried this due to a lack of jobs in my Spanish city around 2010-2013. Programming became my salvation during a tough period in my life.

I started teaching programming to kids, then moved into a junior WordPress developer role at 28. This experience was marked by intense imposter syndrome and little support. Seeking change, I moved to the Netherlands for a better opportunity which was initially fulfilling.

Fast forward, I’m in Amsterdam, well-compensated but overwhelmed and unhappy. Despite feeling unproductive, my company offered me a permanent contract, making me feel trapped in a “golden cage.”

A big issue is my productivity, especially when working from home, which is 4 days a week with a 90-minute commute. I struggle to focus, writing only a few lines of code some days. I’ve tried numerous strategies to improve focus – hiding my phone, the Pomodoro technique, noise-canceling headphones, setting daily priorities, and working in public spaces like libraries, engaging more with my colleagues in 1to1 calls... Nothing seems to work.

I’m considering requesting a reduction to 32 hours per week, using the extra day to pursue something more social and fulfilling. But, I’m unsure if this is the right step. Could this be depression, or just job dissatisfaction?

At the beginning of my career, I thought all I needed was experience and a good company. Now, having both, I still feel miserable.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you decide between job satisfaction and salary? How do you handle mental health in this industry?",Enrich_90,1,1.0,3,1705085214,2024-01-12 18:46:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1952gx3/navigating_career_satisfaction_and_mental_health/,1,2024

I'm new to this community and have been exploring the idea of making money online. I've seen many people share their success stories and it's truly inspiring. However, I'm at a bit of a crossroads and could use some advice.  
A bit about me: I'm a 38 yo woman and have worked a hodge podge of decent jobs including operations manager for home care company, lead designer for a green design firm, general manager of a restaurant, and finance specialist for an active travel company. It may not seem like it from my previous work experience but I'm 100% introvert with social anxiety and I really just want to work from home without having to go into an office.  
I've been researching various online avenues like freelance work, digital marketing, e-commerce, blogging, and so on, but it's a bit overwhelming to decide where to start. I'm particularly interested in drop shipping and/or digital marketing.  
I'm reaching out to this community for guidance:  
What are some effective ways for beginners to start making money online?  
Are there any resources (websites, courses, books) that you found particularly helpful?  
How did you navigate the initial stages of setting up an online income stream?  
Any common pitfalls or mistakes to avoid?  
Would love to hear personal success stories for motivation!  
I understand that making money online requires effort, time, and patience, and I'm ready to invest in this journey. Any advice, tips, or personal experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated.

My question really is, should I tell them  “today will be my last day” with me knowing 8 people who were let go on the spot as validation for doing so, or is it worth being caught up in having to backtrack on my words if they didn’t let me go the same day?

I initiated all the friendships here and manage to make my classmates my friends. Then we all started to open up. I used to validate them and support them about their issues. But they did me very bad when I opened up with mine. I once skipped classes due to endometriosis. The next day, I asked my new classmates/friends for notes. One of the girls who used to call herself my close friend told me that every girl has painful periods. She told me if we do the diagnosis procedure on every girl, all of them will have this diagnosis. She was also aware of my sinusitis, about that she stated that I just want to get attention and even she have it but she never had unexpected headache and breathing problem like me whenever their is a slight change in the whether. I was speechless and said sorry to keep the friendship. The next day, I was little late, I saw her sitting with the girl who bullied for being an introvert. They were giggling and one of the girls informed me that someone else replaced me in the group presentation which was to be held next day. I said sorry but my friend rolled her eyes. Its so much complicated. When I score more and get compliments from someone, my classmates' behaviour changes from okayish to worst and asks me why it didn't happen to them. I have never said this many sorrys ever.


Also to mention, When I initiated to learn football and basketball by texting and meeting the students who plays the games, my friends and few other people told that I'm doing it to get attention from the boys, so I stopped it then and there.

194zxf5,Regretting relocating for career and depressed,"
Hello All! Any advice? 

I accepted a position back in October for my dream job. I knew going into it that it would require me to relocate to a different state over 1000 miles from home. When I accepted the position, I was initially excited and nervous. I did everything I was supposed to, I resigned from my old position, started looking at places as soon as I was able, and packing my belongings. 

I had a lot of bad luck in the home/apartment department. Everything was either cash offer, bid war, or failed inspection. While my new position does come with a pay increase it does not meet the affordability of apartments within the area and most affordable places are over an hour long commute. After the last place I put an offer in turned up empty, I started getting anxious and scared. I started to think more about  other ‘what if’ scenarios and I just started to get depressed. The excitement faded I was concerned about missing my family, missing my baby niece grow up (my brother lives in a different state and I missed both of my nephews growing up). I’m not sure if it’s what I even want anymore. It didn’t hit me until the day before I prepared to leave that I just broke down and cried and couldn’t stop. I am in a month long rental but the entire drive down consisted of me crying not knowing if I would be able to do this. The pit in the bottom of my stomach continues to grow  and I just don’t feel attached to anything. I’m considering leaving at the end of the month and emailing my old supervisor (we left on good terms) to see if the position is still available. I don’t feel safe in the rental, I’m staying at so it just makes everything seem worse. No one else seems to really relate to how I feel so I was wondering if anyone had any advice?

TL:DR I accepted a position for my dream job in a different state. I was initially excited but after months of waiting and preparing and overall bad luck, I am having consistent anxiety attacks and I’m not sure if I want it anymore.",in2thewildz2002,1,1.0,4,1705078919,2024-01-12 17:01:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/194zxf5/regretting_relocating_for_career_and_depressed/,1,2024

After surviving two rounds  of layoffs, I am now one of two admin for a company for 200. I am the “unofficial office manager”, still assist the CEO and executives more so because most of their assistants left and were not replaced. I do our internal communications and plan 4-5 company events per year. Ive stepped in as an event manager for a few months while the role was vacant. I took on cashier work after one of our accountants left in April and did not get replaced. And I am now managing a non-profit we started (liaison to the board, marketing, website updates, donor retention, and now grant applications). 

I’ll be honest I burnt out pretty bad in March after taking on the event manager role, and have finally gotten my motivation and confidence back with the non-profit work I’m doing. I’ve gotten two raises at the appropriate times and a bonus, employee of the month, but no promotions or title bumps. I’m pretty sure I’m paid more than most of my peers with higher titles. Would it be appropriate to ask for either a promotion or title bump at this time? To be honest, they’d be dumb to promote me because I’m basically their “do anything” person and I can’t see them hiring another admin. But I REALLY want to get out of admin and move into communications/non-profit work. I fear the job hunt because my title is so entry level it doesn’t properly represent my experience.

I’m afraid to apply to certain “easier to get” but still enjoyable jobs and just wondered if I should just be applying to all of them or if I should just wait a couple weeks on those “easy jobs”.

Im afraid of getting an early job offer from something not as favorable as the big company, losing the offer due to stalling it, then not even getting the big company job. I’m not confident in my interview ability but still know I can get a good one in if I’m feeling good that day and prep well.

194vfvz,Looking forward advice on what degree I should get next- Biopharma Commercial side,"Hi all,

I’ve worked in biopharma for 7 years with a total of 10 years of experience post undergrad. My trajectory has been strong with 4 promotions in those 7 years and most recently landing a director role on a flagship launch asset. This is partially do to my work but also being lucky and fortunate to have a great leaders who prioritize development. 

My company has been very generous about supporting my growth and fully funding an MBA program at a T15 school, which I finished last year. I’m interested in continuing my education part time and have again secured support for full funding. 

I current work on a product brand team and am interested in continuing to grow into a senior leadership and eventually global leadership role on the commercial side of the business. What next degree would (a) differentiate myself from other candidates (b) provide practical knowledge and skills to be better as a senior leader someday (hopefully) 

Considerations:

(1) MS regulatory affairs: I’m looking at the John Hopkins program and feel like not many commercial colleagues have deep knowledge in this space. I work with legal/regulatory colleagues regularly and am regularly impressed by their understanding of the regulatory environment 

(2) MS in Law: something like the NYU MS in Health Law & Strategy. Recognize that these are not practical for those wanting to actually work in law, but for someone like myself was thinking it could help differentiate me by giving me specific knowledge in the healthcare environment I operate in. 

(3) MPH: looking at UPenn and Columbia. This is more of a generalist degree similar to my MBA and would be interesting and helpful for my overall healthcare and public health knowledge,  but likely not as applicable to my day to day responsibilities.


Appreciate any advice!",TravelingBlueBear,1,1.0,0,1705067213,2024-01-12 13:46:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/194vfvz/looking_forward_advice_on_what_degree_i_should/,1,2024

Anyone have experience/advice for any of these. I'm going through some bad anxiety about my future, maybe because I'm turning 40. Current job is posting products to an antique stores website. Boring, tedious tasks, not social.. but I have the schedule i always wanted. 

Drafting-Theres both a degree program and a certificate at my local university. My husbands a civil engineer. A former coworker says AI is quickly replacing AutoCAD(his wife is a civil engineer).

Digital Marketing(PPC area)- This is something I could probably get a job in. I took DM courses. Certificates. Worked at an agency(paid internship). I feel burned out and discouraged- Went on a long job hunt with many interviews( and went far in these interviews) paid good money for a resume redo.. but... nothing..

Coding- This is has been an interest for years but my focus is so bad and I have so far to go. I would love in person bootcamps but they are so intense.

194u6tu,Torn between two degrees,"I’m applying to study International Relations and Organisations (a bachelor of Science under Political Science) at Leiden University, and International and European Law (an LLB degree) at the University of Groningen. 

As someone who doesn’t speak Dutch, but is a Dutch citizen, I feel very apprehensive about studying law as a citizen of a country whose language I’m not remotely proficient in. My mum is arguing that with an International Law degree, I’ll be sought after everywhere and highly employable, but I don’t see how, and she can’t cough up any examples for me either. She also has the preconceived notion everyone has that law pays very well. I think she also somewhat wants to be able to say her son studies law. Obviously I would pursue an LLM after this degree.

I must admit, I also don’t know what I would do after the BSc in International Relations and Organisations. I know I would follow with a Master’s degree - I just don’t in what subject. I am much more interested in this degree, and it’s something that lines up with my personal interests. It is the course I’d rather study most. My mother keeps calling it “International Basket Weaving”, which tells you enough about what she thinks. She’s gotten the idea that the degree is useless into my head and I’m now doubting everything.

I’m open to study either degrees, but I’ve got my apprehensions for both of them. I’d like to make more of an informed decision and I’d appreciate any advice.

My ultimate goal is to move back “home” to Kenya, where I grew up. Kenya hosts one of the UN’s three major global offices, and two major agencies, UNEP and UN-Habitat.

194u0iy,New job hasn't drug tested- But I know they will at some point..,"My friend stopped smoking weed to prepare for the drug test at her new job. She is a couple weeks in at this point but they still have not drug tested her. It was mentioned with some of her coworkers and she was told that the same thing happened to them- Basically they got drug tested like three months into the role because HR just forgot to do it during the onboarding. Once they realized the oversight they then had the employee take their drug test, even if it was months down the line...

This is really upsetting her because she isn't sure when it is safe to smoke again. She wants to bring it up to HR somehow so they can just get it over with, but she isn't sure how to go about it in a way that isn't weird?

Please help with any advice!!!! Thank you 🙂

EDIT: Thanks all for the help! For those saying that she has a problem for being upset about this, I have to politely disagree! Never once was it mentioned that she will be smoking on the job. This is literally occasionally after hours to relax and unwind. There are no signs of random drug testing throughout the employment either. However we have landed on this solution: she is just going to be honest! She will reach out to HR and tell them that she couldn't help but notice that the drug test was never completed, and it made her worried that there may have been other pieces in the onboarding process overlooked. So she will just check in to see if there is anything additional that they need from her to complete the process. Ty for the help!

EDIT 2: Just want to say I can't believe how mean people can be when they know they're anonymous and know they're just being jerks for no reason. Like is your day/life really THAT bad where you let your steam off by just finding ways to spread negativity to people?

194rxqo,Presentation for a challenging salary raise?,"TLDR:I have been in my current role for 2 years in 2 months, I booked in a 2 year review with my manager (The managing director.) To which he responded “you better come prepared .” Over the past 2 years my role has evolved and changed drastically with no change in title and no salary or remuneration change. I am considering putting together a presentation for the review and am after advice. 

The details - I joined this property group 2 years ago as our head of talent acquisition at $150k salary. 
Since then I outsourced the entire talent operation to the Philippines. Reducing the talent headcount by $100k per year, whilst increasing retention, Glassdoor and time to hire.

I then spent 9 months optimising our sales and marketing teams, and day to day spend a fair amount of time as the marketing project manager, breaking down road blocks, ensuring our strategy is executed and assigning tasks.

Given the business was in the market of selling property, current interest rates significantly impacted sales, even after my optimisations, script improvements, coaching ect. 
I pitched and launched a brand new business unit offering B2B solutions to other real estate businesses. 
This unit has done fairly well, diversifying our revenue, it’s still early days but the new unit did $50k in revenue in 3 weeks. I am responsible end to end for this units strategy, sales, marketing, process ect.

My manager is a little narcissistic and seems to think most of the work was him or his idea. A few peers recently went for a salary review and only got a $5k bump. 
Given the dramatic shift in responsibility and work load I’m seeking a 10% raise and a title change (not sure what it should be) 

I know my manager will bring up market conditions, our decline in overall sales. Complaints that other team members have made about me been to stern, short and “a bulldozer that runs over anyone in his path”
How can I combat this, efficiently communicate my value and get what I’m after.

I love him with all my heart and I don’t know what to do… I see the man I love falling further and further into this state of depression and he keeps blaming himself… 

We’ve done different things like reworking his resume, sending thank you notes to recruiters and interviewers, looked out of state and processes begin but then they just stop for no reason, even with the NSA he got as far as the polygraph, he was told that he passed and then they scheduled him for his psychology testing and he waited a couple of months and then they told him that he’s no longer eligible which is confusing… my mother who is a former NSA employee told him that was strange and out of the norm as well. 


It’s just been this same kind of trend with people not contacting him even though they say they will, him getting into the middle of the process and then them ghosting him… I don’t blame him for being so distraught over this one bit…

For context, I’ve been given the impression you need to drop everything and post the instant you get an alert. Also that you need to respond to any notifications asap. This is important, you’ll see why. 

Then, a while back, one of the big, new companies discovered a typo in one of their posts. Misspelling the business name, definitely not good. My boss was not happy. She sent us a scathing email how this was not acceptable and essentially if we lose them, we are at the risk of losing our jobs. We realized this was autocorrect that messed up the business name but, the blame fell on me. 

It took me a while to recover from this one, especially because I was on probation. I managed to pick myself and take it as a learning lesson. It was hard… if you see my other posts, I had a lot of anxiety with a previous manager who belittled me quite awfully. 

I was doing ok, passed probation (that was another kick to my ego… usually I pass probation with flying colours… this time I was told I’m doing “good” but we will assess in 6 months and if this isn’t for me, that’s ok… yeesh). But ok fine. Ready to kick some ass. 

Then, I made another mistake. This time with a story post. Another typo. This time it was something I messed up. Because at the moment when I posted, it was a weekend. I was dealing with my three year old, my family and in hindsight, I should have stepped away. But because, like I wrote above, I felt I needed to attend to things right away, I didn’t. I did it distractedly.

Anyways it just gave me a sinking feeling and then I learned my boss has made comments about my “attention to detail”. She, again, was unhappy with this, had strong feedback that she communicated to a colleague of mine, and I’m right back to feeling like I’m on the chopping block. 

I guess my question is… is this unreasonable that I’m feeling this anxious? Every good and excellent thing I do and have done is overshadowed by these mistakes. It’s not like they are happening all the time but I feel so paranoid that I’m making mistakes without realizing, only waiting to get caught. I double and triple check my work and even there there are slip ups that thankfully don’t face the client, but my one colleague catches them. I feel like such a failure. It feels like there is no room for error at all, and I’m starting to question whether this is for me. Starting to question whether I’m becoming stupid as I get older (for context I’m 35 so I know I’m not “old”). Any advice would be so welcome. Feeling anxious like this about work all the time sucks!",discorap,1,0.5,1,1705045126,2024-01-12 07:38:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/194ph2e/how_many_mistakes_before_i_get_fired_at_new_job/,1,2024
194paog,BBA (India Premium Institute) Vs B.Sc Computer Science (UK- Decent University) Vs B.Tech/BE Computer Science (India),"Hi friends, I am in a dilemma. I am about to complete my BBA Ist yr from India but am not confident of career prospects after this. I have an option of pressing a restart and pursuing my education from UK [B.Sc](https://B.Sc) Computer Science. That would mean losing 1 full year. My questions are as follows:

Is it going to make a huge difference in terms of placement and salary that is offered?

Should I continue with BBA and work hard to get into a premium (India or UK/US) MBA instead of losing a year and starting again?

Should I look for BE/Btech in India instead of [B.Sc](https://B.Sc) in UK?

Do I need work experience for MBA admission?

I asked what I could do better - no response
I asked for additional training - they were too busy

194osl0,Post grad job offer in a career I hate. Scared I won’t find anything better. Should I just suck it up?,"I’m a senior in college with an Economics and Accounting double major and in the past summer got a return offer for Big 4 Audit for 85k/yr. I knew it wasn’t something I want to do but I accepted it because it was better than having no job at all. I know I don’t like audit and accounting because of the low pay long hours and general lack of interest. When I did my audit internship it looked miserable and I vowed to myself that I would not stay there.

What I wanted was to start in management consulting, but unfortunately got rejected by two of the Big 3 in final round, and the other boutique firms didn’t even give me an interview because my school isn’t a target school for any of them. Now that consulting application rounds are all over, I’m starting to feel more and more hopeless that I’m going to be stuck in audit. I also really, REALLY don’t want to take the CPA exam. 

I’ve applied to other jobs but its like every job is severely underpaying for entry level jobs or looking for crazy experience and qualifications. I’m scared that once I start my audit job I’ll be stuck with limited exit options outside accounting. I just can’t see myself doing that — I’m a very creative and extroverted person and my ideal job  would be something that pays well, not monotonous, and has career progression (hence why I really wanted to pursue consulting). I have consulting & IB experience through school clubs & organizations, product marketing experience from an internship, lots of art and design skill, and would be open to learning new hard skills that would make me more marketable. 

My parents are telling me that I am being ungrateful and should just take the job and the Big 4 name that comes with it for my resume. But if I know I don’t want to stay in accounting is that even worth it? Am I being ungrateful since so many of my peers are struggling to secure a job offer in this job market? Should I just accept it and hopefully pivot out? Or take a pay cut for a different job without a “big company name”?",Trippyspinner,1,1.0,6,1705042495,2024-01-12 06:54:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/194osl0/post_grad_job_offer_in_a_career_i_hate_scared_i/,1,2024

194oivj,DevOps and Business Intelligence,"  
  
Hello, I wanted to share my career journey so far and seek some advice on the path ahead. I recently graduated with a degree in Business Information Technology, all geared up to dive into the exciting world of Business Intelligence (BI). Unfortunately, I struggled to find BI job opportunities in my area, and it left me a bit disheartened.  
  
However, life had a different plan for me. I landed a job in DevOps that I still didn't sign, even though I didn't have any prior experience in the field. The hiring manager assured me that they would provide comprehensive training to cover everything I needed to know.  
  
Now, here's where I'd love to hear from the community. I'm contemplating pursuing a master's degree in Business Intelligence in the next couple of years. My question is: Can this experience in DevOps be a valuable asset when I transition back to BI after completing my master's? I believe the skills I will gain in DevOps, such as automation and infrastructure management, might complement a future BI role.  
  
Have any of you followed a similar path or transitioned between seemingly unrelated fields? How did your diverse experience impact your career trajectory? I'm particularly interested in insights from those who have worked in both BI and DevOps.  
  
Moreover, any advice on how I can leverage this DevOps experience to enhance my BI career prospects in the future would be greatly appreciated. I'm excited about the potential synergy between the two fields and want to make the most of this unique opportunity.

194nwlm,Should I switch from Bio major to Accounting/Finance?,"I'm currently a freshman at an SEC school with a Top 10 accounting program. Originally, I planned to major in Biology on a Pre-Med track, but I've decided that I don't want to spend my entire 20s in school. I miss math classes and am considering if accounting/finance might be a better fit for me. I've already earned a lot of college credit in high school, essentially making me a junior in terms of credit hours. I finished my first semester with a 4.0 GPA. I don't want to risk my GPA(plus my mental health!) by taking challenging Bio/Chem courses when I could explore other options. It's worth noting that I'll graduate with zero debt due to academic scholarships.  
While I enjoy science classes, the idea of being in school for over 12 years for a career in sports medicine as a physician doesn't appeal to me. I'm also concerned about the demanding hours and possibly inadequate pay in the medical field. Money is a significant concern for me, being the daughter of immigrants, and there's pressure to pursue a successful, prestigious, and financially stable career. I want to earn enough to sustain my lifestyle, including travel, supporting my family, and having more than just the basics. Obviously I don't expect to have FU money, but enough to do all these things comfortably.  
The dilemma is whether switching out of my science major is a mistake. Should I continue on an easier path to medicine, perhaps as a physician assistant? Or does accounting/finance seem more fitting for my goals?",EntertainmentIcy235,1,1.0,0,1705039289,2024-01-12 06:01:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/194nwlm/should_i_switch_from_bio_major_to/,1,2024

194nh83,Feeling lost with career and university choices,"I really need some encouragement and insight on my education/career choices. I am 25 years old and currently finishing my undergraduate degree. I have been “finishing” this up for 6 years now and it has taken extremely long, mainly due to life events and having to take breaks. I also had to transfer universities which caused some lost credits so right now I have roughly 2-3 years left if I stay on top of things and take full time course load non stop. At the same time I am working in the beauty industry part time on weekends to help with school costs/rent etc.

I am in a very confused position as to where I want to be in life and I feel discouraged from everything at the moment. I feel discouraged in my education as it has taken so long and I am no where near being finished, it has mentally set me back quite a bit and prevented me from living my life to the fullest during these years. The program I’m pursuing is definitely something I was initially interested in and picked myself but it was not within my first few choices and I am certain that I most likely won’t be using this degree. However I still want to finish it completely and not leave it halfway even though I have no interest in school anymore. Seeing my friends already start their graduate programs and families and careers has made me feel so behind. And I know everyone tells me I have so much time and I am young, but I don’t necessarily like this advice and don’t appreciate hearing it. I could have used the past 6 years more efficiently and have lost a lot of opportunities and time.

Because it has dragged on for so long I don’t even know what I want to do with my career and future either. I feel lost with my choices and interests. I’m lost with my current situation as well. I really want to have a proper job/career to be able to be more financially free at the moment so I can provide for myself and gain new experiences and try out different hobbies and what not. But at the time same I want to finish school which prevents me from doing all those things if I want to do full time course load. I just want my degree to be done with already so I don’t have to think about it ever again, but without abandoning it. I’ve put a lot of money into it and worked hard over the years when I needed to and even if I don’t end up using it it’s important for me to finish it, and I don’t want any regrets later on. But that means another 2-3 years of “wasting” time with school and not being able to do the things that could be more beneficial to me. I really don’t know. At the moment I can’t tell what’s the better option also because I don’t even know what I would do either way. I don’t have a specific career I am interested in or a job I want. I’ve even looked into other programs at school or even certificate options and nothing stands out to me enough to pursue it. There’s a lot out there that seems interesting but nothing I’m passionate enough to go after. I hope that makes sense.

This is just making me feel very discouraged and uninterested, and honestly causing me to do not so well in my classes. I have seen a lot of people that could help me from counselling to career services and have done activities that tell me what I would be good at or not. But I don’t end up with any conclusions. This new semester started a few days ago and I still haven’t looked at a single class because of the mental strain this is putting on me.

194l704,Amazing team vs career advencement,"I'm currently working in a great team, we are all friendly, not carrying those friendships outside of the workplace but definitely can rely on each other when needed even in personal situations. 
I have a lot of freedom in a way I handle my tasks, a lot of creative freedom and trust from my manager who I really like. My team respects my work-hours preference and my leave gets approved without questions. I receive a lot of recognition for my work in the wider team / department meetings and I generally like the dynamic in our team. We are known for flexibility and good projects come our way very often. 
I excel in my area and for years I've been told my work is well above my rank, unfortunately there are no advancement opportunities in my current team and there is no flexibility in this matter (I work in public sector where roles cannot be freely created without a complex process and seniority level ~ so called 'grade'~ of existing roles cannot be altered). 
I have expressed to my manager and my director my desire to grow and stated reasons why I think I have outgrown my role a while ago. My director agreed and told me they would look into it but nothing came out of it (again, the reason could be the current setting and the restrictions we face). 
Another team offered me a role that is of higher grade and would give me what I'm after title/pay/grade wise. I would finally be recognised as a subject matter expert rather than an ordinary analyst. I used to work in that team prior to joining my current one and they are not particularly flexible in the way they approach new projects and have been criticised for it in the past. As a result if their inflexibility, the projects they tend to work on are not as high profile. I am friendly with people from this team but I'm not drawn to them on a personal level like I am in my current team. They are also not the most helpful or cooperative bunch - a lot of them are lazy. I don't particularly love the manager I would work for although she's not a mean person (just not the most likeable person). 

Should I take this opportunity although it would mean less high profile projects and less friendly/cooperative work environment BUT would definitely positively impact my resume and potential future opportunities or should I stick to my team that means a lot to me on a personal level although I have outgrown my role? 

There might be an option to do it just for a year while retaining my current role (I.e. I could come back to my current role after that year).

194k8sl,Hired in role within my field but feel that project stakeholders don’t trust me. Should I look for another job after only 2 months?,"I started a new role in the Talent Management/Development (not a manager position) about 2 months ago, that I believe that I was qualified for but not sure anymore. I am a 27 year old black female, I have 3 years of experience in my field, as well as a masters degree.

In this new role, I transitioned from the Software industry to the Manufacturing industry. So far, the differences in the culture have been a learning curve for me. Also, the manufacturing company I work for does not have modern tools and functions as Lean as possible. 

During the interview process, I was honest about my experience but may have exaggerated my experience with managing projects. At the time, I did not think that I was exaggerating but now that my primary duty is to do that, I feel that I am not doing a good job at it. 

With all of the projects I have been given, I have been so confused about my role in the projects. With one I was told that I would be the project manager and that I would partner with the director of manufacturing to relaunch a training program. After a month, his manager told my leader that he is the lead on the project. Every time I have my meetings with him, I get the feeling he does not trust me and I’m not sure why. I don’t want to assume it’s because of my age but it’s making me feel that I am not competent because I would think that a training program relaunch would be lead by someone in the Talent Dev space. Also, when I give ideas, he doesn’t acknowledge them and tells me to work on smaller task, even though other stakeholders have the same ideas and he agrees with them. Again, making me feel that he doesn’t not trust me. 

Another one of my frustrations come from every time I ask my direct manager for clarity on my role in the projects she assigned to me, she never knows and always asks her manager for guidance. 

Lastly, one of the folks who interviewed me told me that didn’t agree with them putting me on a team that isn’t on the main Talent Management team (I support the plants while the main team supports corporate). He basically told me they lied to me and set me up to fail because of the lack of structure they provided me. 

I wanted this role so it can challenge me but it seems like I may have made the wrong decision and bit off more than I can chew. 

Is it me or would this frustrate you as well? With what I have told you, does it seem like there is a lack of trust or does it seem like I bit off more than I could chew? Should I find a new role?

Happy New Year. I posted in another sub about my current situation, but to recap: I’m a painting contractor, produce excellent work (all 5 star reviews on Google) Residential interior and exterior repaints. I’ve been painting for about seven years and owned my own business for one. My wife and I have a five month old who honestly is a saint, but still requires a lot of attention (obviously!)

I’m really struggling to get work right now and other Redditors gave good feedback on how to generate them. Currently I’m knocking on between 100-180 doors a day. This business has the potential to be huge, as I have seen from friends of mine all over the country. The most successful Painting Contractor I personally know is three years younger than me and producing $6 million a year. Ultimately, that’s what I’m looking to do. I have reached out to him for advice in the past and he says he gets a lot of his business from lead services, website and SEO, referrals and partnerships with other trades. He says he needs 120 leads a week.

A bit of background about me. I grew up very privileged [$3 million household income per year] and then the recession came along. It’s a long story, but we had everything stolen from us from corrupt bankers. So in essence, I am fighting to get back to that position and provide my family with the same lifestyle that I had. As the old saying goes, “easy to move up, very hard to move down”. Stressing at the end of every month over credit card bills definitely affects my mental health and I don’t ever want that life for my child.

So the plan is, grow my painting business, invest in real estate, pay off the mortgages of the rental properties as quickly as possible and start accumulating wealth.

Is there anyone in this sub that I has gone through a similar journey to myself? It’s all I think about and honestly takes away from all other aspects of my life. Any life advice at all would be greatly appreciated.

She even took on the CFO position without any hands-on markets and investment experience, according to herself. Yet she did incredibly well that many other financial firms like PayPal wanted her to be the new CEO. She mentioned that she works “really really really” hard to get to where she is today.

The CTO of Netflix, Elizabeth Stone, who begin her career in the finance industry as a trader, economist, etc before transitioning to the technology industry doing all things high-tech. 

The same goes for the CPO (chief product officer) of Netflix, who started off her career in the finance industry before moving to Google to be a director of product.

There have been developments happening for a few months and I will list them here.

- Dance teachers are now not showing up to work because they haven’t been paid in months.

- apparently we are late on payments with our buildings.

- Our marketing and theater production team have been wiped. 

- Some prominent figures of the company like company manager, and general manager have left.

- So far this week we have gotten three emails of people in administration leaving.

- The dancers themselves have dropped down to 80% salary.

- The custodians are no longer coming because they haven’t been paid. 

On top of all of this we have three tours left(which means we need to spend money on transportation, per diems, and housing) 

We have to pay choreographers to finish a work, which be around 50-70k, potentially more if bargained enough.

Last but not least we have to rent out a theater for our last show which can be costly.

I don’t understand how we’re still functioning and there seems to be little to no acknowledgement of the current state of things. I don’t have the actual numbers but it really doesn’t seem like this can go for that much longer.

Should I jump ship now or ride the wave and see it through? 


Tl;dr

- People are quitting
- Departments have been wiped 
- Teachers aren’t showing up to classes 
- Custodians are no longer paid 
- We’re late on rent

194ex7z,Not sure what to do in this weird work climate,"Navigating a weird work climate



For context, I am a manager and report to our VP.

I work in a growing company that has hit some headwinds as of late. I run a small customer service team of 3 individuals. In reality, my team should be more like 8, but it’s a smaller company that’s still growing (no budget).

I was brought in three years ago to start this department and I’ve done a terrific job of getting us the tools and resources needed to do our job.

The last three years have been great. Full of bonuses, giant raises, and praise from leadership.

However, within the last year, our sales have really slowed down. I think we have all felt it within the company. Our CMO was also let go at the start of 2023, and our marketing team was re-orged (CMO was the only one let go). This all took place throughout 2023 and we now have a new CMO with a new marketing strategy for 2024.

Now, it seems there are a lot of budget concerns. I, along with my boss (VP of my department) and an analyst on our team have been putting together a presentation for the president of the company. This included my team’s volume for 2023, and the proposal of hiring another team member to keep up with the volume. 

However, today, I had my touch base with my boss (VP) and there were some new developments. I guess there was an issue with vendors paying too much and we now have to credit them. This has thrown a wrench into our budget for 2024. My boss told me that because of this, her boss recommended we don’t present my portion as it’s centered around hiring a new team member. My boss said we could circle back with the president at the beginning of February.

My boss then went on to tell me that her boss was curious about potentially outsourcing and asked if I could look into what this would look like, or how other smaller companies do this. This isn’t new, I’ve been in meetings before talking to outsourcing vendors with my old boss and my new boss. My boss and I have also talked about potentially outsourcing part of our work to help support us.

However, this still made me feel extremely odd. So, at the end of the call, I just asked my boss “is there anything I should be concerned about” and she reassured me that there’s nothing to be concerned about.

I do trust my boss. Hell, I was invited to her husbands birthday two weeks ago. We are close and I do trust her, but it still feels off.

194enz0,Job Changed Commission Structure Dramatically,"So long story short I’m in sales/account management and had a six figure income.  The reason I say “had” is because we were recently bought out by a private equity firm and they have decided to essentially cut commission.  The details are irrelevant but my income will likely be at least cut in half under the new format.

I’m obviously having a very hard with this.  My job is already stressful and dysfunctional and the only reason most of us are there is because of the earning potential which has now been slashed.

I’ve been there five years and I honestly don’t have a clue what the job market is like right now because I’ve been more/less content and haven’t looked.

But now I’m considering just straight up walking out because this job is not worth the stress and everything else that comes with it if we’re not compensated appropriately.  

So I have two questions.  

1. Can any of you in similar fields let me know the job climate right now?  If it helps I do live in a large city that has a good economy.

I had everything lined up when I finished university with an undergrad in English and Media to join the Metropolitan Police on a detective graduate program, but I ended up hating it 6 months in, and it wasn't anything like I expected, so I quit. 

After that I worked in a bar for a year while I tried to improve my skillset. I've really enjoyed making video content since I was 14, and would consider it my life's work and dream job, but nothing has ever taken off with that, and I failed every interview I was given in this area.

I left my bar job to work in a school, where I work 1-to-1 with children who have special needs, and while it can be rewarding, the school I work at has some horrible issues with management, the school rules are almost militant, and the pay is absolutely dreadful. Living on £22k in London is leaving me with no savings every month. 

I really think there's something out there for me, but I can't help but feel unlucky with all the jobs I've tried out. I thought about going for a career in Sales to try and learn something new, and I know the money is good, but I'm just so tired with being disappointed with most jobs I've tried out these days.

It's an absolute goddam mess.

I've been at this role for nearly 3 years now. I reached my breaking point yesterday, after less than two weeks back from the two week winter break. I genuinely believe I cannot do this any more, and my mental health might take a dangerous toll from continuing to work here. Unfortunately, I can't just quit (as much as I fantasize about it). 

I make roughly 62k a this job. Unfortunately, due to my financial situation (serious student loan debt), I can't afford to make any less.  I also can't afford to take an extended period of time off. I also need to leave my job as soon as I possibly can. I really don't think I can tolerate it much longer. In the last year, I was runner up for two new positions but ultimately didn't get them. I don't think I can continue just praying that a job opening will come along and I'll finally get it. And I'm not sure if I'm at all interested in continuing to pursue communications work. 

I've been thinking about getting an apprenticeship as a tradesman. It's one of the few avenues I can think of where I'd be able to make close to what I'm already making while transitioning into a totally new career. But I worry that I wouldn't like that work very well.

194c7pt,I feel guilty for taking a job I didn’t want,"Alright…. Where do I start? 

I graduated from college in 2021. I was very fortunate to get a job right away. It was directly related to my degree and I had always wanted a role like this job. But I had a horrible manager. Within the span of 6 months 4 people quit in our department because of the manager. I thought I was miserable because of the manager but after self reflection I realized that the job wasn’t for me. I didn’t like the stress and day to day tasks of the job. I decided to stay with the company but transfer to another department. The second job I got was a lot easier, less stressful and less demanding. I stayed at the company for a total of 2.5 years. 
I always knew I didn’t want to stay in the state that I moved to after graduation. About 6 months ago I started looking for new jobs in different cities. After doing some research I landed on one city in particular that I wanted to move to. I had been interviewing for months and wasn’t getting any interest/offers. I knew I wanted to move anyway so I put my notice in and decided I was just going to figure it out later. A week after I put in my notice  I got a job offer. I was so excited and happy. The job was in the city I had been wanting to move to. But the job was the exact same job as my first out of college.I knew deep down that I shouldn’t have taken the job but I didn’t want to be unemployed in a new city. So I took the job anyway.

194bxmd,"Help! Do I quit, or wait to be sacked? Toxic new work environment","I (31F) started a new job at a start up on November 6th, as a Senior Marketing Manager. I had a few red flags before this job started but I was wanting to leave my job (big global agency) and not look back. First red flags are in the interview stage, or before accepting the interview, I was never given a written, formal job description, just had a chat with my now boss about the role. Also, they didn't want me to sign the contract until I started, which I thought was really unusual. In the second stage of the interview I had to do a marketing proposal, and they loved it. However, I didn't get a word in edgeways for the hour, they kept jumping from place to place saying what they liked about it. Worth mentioning that it's sisters that run the business. One of them did the first interview, both did the next.

I start the job on November the 6th, and get cracking. We talk more about what I'd done in previous roles etc. Day 2, they pull me aside and say theyre comcerned as I didnt have some of the skills that theyd requested from the recruiter. Some of the things they asked for me I had done a couple of roles ago, and I said I was happy to brush up on it all and am a fast learner. They also said they're happy to provide some training sounds great. In previous roles if there's anything missing they just train me up and that's that. This place doesn't seem that way.

The Friday of my first week I had to attend my grandma's funeral, and the following Friday I attended the internment of my grandma and grandads ashes, so overall a pretty terrible couple of weeks. But I'm still learning and buckling down, but I cant help but feel inadequate for the job and in general. I'd left my old job with my head held high in hight esteem from my colleagues with excellent references. Maybe I'm not learning as fast dealing with grief, however, in these first couple of weeks.

I called the recruiter panicked the following Monday - he assures me it will be fine and it will be ironed put, but I cant help but feel there's been some huge assumptions and miscommunication with this role.

Christmas comes and goes. Worth noting that a couple of emails needed to be scheduled over this period- I asked a question over Trello on whether artwork was needed, and got no response, so I didn't schedule the email. When my boss got back, she asked why it hadn't been done and I'd advised her that I'd messaged her and she hadn't responded, she advised I should have called her, but I didn't wanted to disturb her as she was off - I apologised and said it wouldn't happen again, a miscommunication.

As a person in a senior position I have come into the business with many strategies and ideas, many of which haven't really been considered. I was asked to do email marketing, which I was happy to do.   I am doing a more hands on approach, rather than the digital strategy and dealing with agencies approach I was used to. Worth noting during my interview they mentioned they used agencies for paid media, so I assumed that wouldn't change, but then as soon as I came in they were going to remove them as they have me. This was not what I expected - I have hands on experience with Paid Social, but not Paid Search, however I know my way through Google.Ads and am great at strategising for this channel. I have no physical JD to refer back to in this instance.

I haven't included everything, but the sisters bicker between themselves a lot (there is 4 of us in the marketing office, the director sisters, a social exec and me) and sometimes with their husbands, it's a horrible environment. They've made it clear from word go I wasn't what they were looking for, even though I have lots of top notch marketing manager experience agency and in house with some really big companies. They've started excluding me from meetings, taken the responsibility of scheduling  emails back from me (I had only been doing this for 3 weeks and barely given a chance. Bar that one error, no issues). They've now asked for my list of passwords to my laptop, Gmail, and Adobe. I feel like I've been set up to fail. No training for paid ads has been pushed forwards, but I have been learning in my spare time. I have implemented paid social for them. I am doing everything I can, and always trying to come up with new ideas.

I have been asked to fill out a mid probation form, and my review is this Monday. I've never been sacked from a place of work in my life, but I'm genuinely scared I will be. I don't know whether to quit beforehand, or go through with the review. It's been 2 months of absolute hell, and I've never been in this situation before.

Any advice would be hugely appreciated - my confidence is at its absolute lowest right now

194b8w9,promotion help?,"Career Progression Help

Hey everyone! 

I’ve been working for a small-ish company for almost 18/19 months now as a social media executive. As it is a small company, and social media previously hadn’t been a huge focus, I am the only team member that handles all of our social content including Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube and some other industry related platforms that we post on. I also manage all of our paid content too and am in charge of all of our social strategy. I create all the content, write the copy, do the analytics etc by myself and with no help from others. I also put together and re-brand company documents and presentations to fit in with our branding. At this stage, pretty much everything that the public, our customers and our clients see comes to me first to be visually altered to fit all of our other content. 

I really enjoy my job, but I’m starting to feel like I don’t see any room for progression when there’s no one above me for socials. Alongside socials, I have recently began to help with other tasks such as website changes, email newsletters, marketing materials design and printing (ie flyers, banners, business cards etc). 

I want to propose a new title (and a payrise alongside that) to my company directors, but I’m unsure what title I would even be asking for and how to go about doing this. 

I’m currently a Social Media Executive and I earn £24,000 per annum.  Would my next step be asking to be a social media manager? And what career steps come after that? I love the company and its perks, but I just feel like I do enough to warrant a step up. 

Any advice is hugely appreciated!

I’ve also grown our social media a lot since I started, going from 7000k on insta to 12,000 and booting our average engagement rate from 1% to 3% too. We now have over 5 million views on tiktok with our branded hashtag (albeit I can’t take full credit for that as we have had customers post their own videos with the tag of course with their own success that isn’t attributed to me)",Top_Impression2881,1,1.0,0,1705004106,2024-01-11 20:15:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/194b8w9/promotion_help/,1,2024
194avgh,Accept return offer or look for something new?,"This past summer I worked as an engineering intern at a well established, international company. I worked in a field I’m interested in and got good experience. They’ve made me a return offer for next summer and I’ll be given the opportunity to work on some new projects. So, if I do go back, I will be gaining new experiences. The company is wanting an answer by next week. 

I’m very torn on if I should go back. I was initially set on working somewhere else and exploring my options as an engineer but, this company has some interesting projects lined up for me. I do still have one more summer left as a student after this to work somewhere else. 

It’s probably worth mentioning that I don’t have any other offers at the moment, and I don’t even know if I could get another offer from somewhere else. The job board has been pretty slow but it’s supposed to pick up in February.

194aqh7,How to apply for my old job again?,"I left my role of 2+ years in the summer for a higher paying, better title job with another company. Unfortunately within weeks I realized the role was misrepresented and regretted leaving my old job. Main reasons I left that I stated in my exit interview include: no advancement/being in same role entire 2+ years despite taking on additional duties, others not pulling their weight, and I mentioned it was low pay but didn't really state it as a main reason for leaving. 

&#x200B;

I have kept in touch with my team and they informed me that there has been a restructure. The two main roles are specialist and assistant, and I left the assistant role because I was doing specialist duties without the title. They told me that now it is different where the assistant actually ""assists"" and does not do specialist duties. I was also told the person not pulling their weight was eventually found out and fired. This has me interested in returning to the role. Although I wanted a higher job title, I only wanted it because I was doing the duties. I did talk to my manager about this while employed but they really muddied the difference in the roles, now it seems more clear. 

&#x200B;

They have posted my old assistant role a few days ago. I have been in touch with my manager last month but am unsure how to approach the situation. I don't think I should apply, but instead ask my manager for a conversation and to ask about the job. I'm unsure how to ask without seeming desperate, or like I am returning with a tail in between my legs. One of the 4 team members is a boomerang who returned last year, so they seem to like boomerangs.

1949rn6,"How to lose a job in 10 days, is this really true?","Day 1: Show Up Late for Work (Yet Again)  
Rolling into the office late every now and then might get you an eye roll, but if you really want to make your boss notice, do it all the time. Show up late and instead of quickly (and silently) getting to work, make a scene so everyone knows just how late you are.  
Day 2: Take a 2-Hour Lunch While Your Team is Busy Working  
Is there a big project your whole team is working on? Good. Go take that extra-long lunch break. Meet up with a friend, take a little stroll around the neighborhood, and sit down to eat at a busy restaurant. And put your phone on silent—you don't want any work-related stresses interrupting.  
Day 3: Start Some Office Gossip  
Come up with an awesome rumor about co-workers who may or may not be dating. (Did you see Jen and Dustin leave work together three days in a row? They must be working after hours, if you catch my drift.) Don't worry if it's true. Go tell everyone, and encourage them to spread the word.  
Day 4: Spend All Day Laughing at Cat Videos  
A good way to let everyone know that you don't have enough work on your plate is to spend the entire day watching cat videos and sending personal emails to your friends. Take periodic breaks to tell everyone how bored you are and tell them to ""hurry up and get your work done, so you can have some fun with me.""  
Day 5: Complain (Loudly)  
From to having to be in the office at 8 AM sharp to next week's client meeting to the annoying sound the refrigerator makes, share your complaints about your job with anyone who'll listen. Ideally, pick one or two gripes, share them over and over, and avoid suggesting solutions at all costs. (That's what your boss gets paid for, right?)  
Day 6: Take a Sick Day on Friday (for the Third Time This Month)  
Everyone gets sick and needs a day or two off to recover. But if you really want to catch your boss' attention, make sure you keep calling in sick on Fridays (or Mondays!). For bonus points, post photos on Facebook and Twitter of your tequila-fueled three-day weekend.  
Day 7: Ask HR How Much You Get Paid for Unused Vacation Days  
Set up a meeting with HR and pepper them with questions that only a person who is leaving would need to ask, like how to roll over your 401(k) and the policy for your leftover vacation time. End the meeting with a wink and a snarky, ""You know, in case I need to know someday.""  
Day 8: Skip the Shower and Rock Sweatpants and Sandals  
Who wants to work for a superficial company that cares about how you dress, anyway? Head to the office in your favorite loungewear and laugh at how nerdy your co-workers look showing up in suits.  
Day 9: Go Above Your Boss' Head  
Write a note to the executive team about all the things your department could be doing better, wrapping up with how terrible you think your boss is and how you're really the one who could lead the team to success. (Who cares if you only have two years of professional experience?) Forward your note to your teammates with a friendly, ""Looks like I'm going to be in charge here pretty quick!""  
Day 10: Curse Out Your Boss  
Drop the S-word, the B-word, and the F-bomb in rapid succession to your boss, ideally in front of clients. Because, well, if days 1-9 didn't get you fired, cursing out your manager will 100% do the trick.",FTHomes,1,0.20000000298023224,1,1705000421,2024-01-11 19:13:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1949rn6/how_to_lose_a_job_in_10_days_is_this_really_true/,1,2024

So, I’ve been in interview/application hell for a little while now, just graduated in December, but I think two of my top candidate companies are going to be getting back to me within the next week and I’m preparing myself to have to choose one or the other.

In one corner we’ve got Big Tech Company. The  job is contract, starting at 6 months with a high *chance* to extend. It’s also tangential to what I went to school for.

In the other corner, the coffee company I’ve worked for throughout college. The job is for a full-time corporate position (store operation specialist). This job could make good use of the 7 years of experience I already have, but I wouldn’t’ve had to go to school to get it.

Both are WFH, offer similar pay (~$40,000/year), and both offer insurance benefits. 

The corporate coffee job has more travel opportunities, which could be a pro and a con. They’ll compensate me for travel expenses and give me extra PTO days if I work on a weekend.

Tech job is with a much larger and better-known company, and the job involves working with AI which could be good experience to have.

Idk about chances for internal promotion within the firm working for Big Tech, but I know there’s a position directly above mine with the corporate coffee job.

1947vv7,My manager asked me to quit my sales job,"About 6 months ago I started as an Account Executive for a local TV News station owned by one of the large national media groups.


This is my first B2B sales role and my coworkers have all been there anywhere from 8-30+ years.


My first two months was mainly training which was simply online training with two shadowing occasions.

After, I was told to join the chamber of commerce events and go into local businesses to generate leads, set meetings, ect..(full cycle)

I generate many appointments but found a majority of my meetings to become closes would take much longer than I expected to close.

It was 4 months in my manager gives me a lead from their ""call list"" which she said they round robin among the AEs, but I hadn't heard of it till now. 

I did the same process I always did and closed it. I have not received a lead since. Meanwhile all my other coworkers are closing so much new business which I don't understand as a majority of the time they are just talking in the office and I don't do that at all (mainly because they are all twice my age). I try to ask for help but they just say they were given a lot of accounts to manage and they don't close a ton of new business as they expect me to.

So my manager meets with me this week and says that they are lowering my base pay to the minimum wage (which of course I don't receive any commissions when I'm on the guarantee) next month and then the next month after switching me to 100% commission. Which she said she recommends that I quit before then if a miracle doesn't happen otherwise I'll get in ""the hole"" with my pay since I can't make back the draw pay with the business I have now. (1 lead I was given which is a one man show that decided he no longer wants to grow and 3 leads I generated full cycle but are not anywhere near what I need to make with commission.)

So, I'm obviously looking for a job, but I feel quite confused as I've always excelled in a job regardless of what I do, but for some reason here it seems time may have been my biggest enemy. Am I missing something here from what you see? Also, if I quit, I know it will only impact me negatively 1 because they keep all the business I've generated which 1 of the clients I did is certainly going to be huge just not right now. But also I signed a 6 months non compete when I started so not only am I quitting a source of income, but I don't have any severance and any way to work in a similar field in the market I'm in.

Is there a way I can get that non compete invalidated, or get severance of some sort? Is there some injustice you see or is this what it is and I just have to work with what I got?


Thank you for taking the time to read!!



TL:DR
I was hired to be an account executive at a local TV station owned by a large media company and found special treatment based on tenure/age and I am now asked by my manager to quit otherwise they will lower my guarantee (0 commission) to minimum wage and then a month later change to 100% commission to where I won't make the draw due to the business I've generated not sufficient as of now.

1947sye,Should I Learn Kdb+/Q Programming Language?,"
Hi Everyone,

I am currently a entry level mechanical engineer. I have an opportunity to learn the kdb+/Q programming language for a finance internship in my free time that would most likely eventually become a full time position with a potential income >100k. I did some research on this language and it looks like it is only used by large hedge funds and investment banks on Wall Street and it has a rather steep learning curve. I am also looking to transition my career into software engineering/coding. Is it worth learning this language over JavaScript/html/CSS? Or should I learn both in conjunction with each other? The timeline of this internship is about 1.5 years before I would offered a potential full time position.

This is my first job and I don't really know how to behave. Thanks for reading this.  


As I said in the title, I've been hired as a GNSS engineer. What I did for this first year is something that even a toddler could do: review how some software requirements are written and correct/flag them accordingly to the available documentation/some checklists. I also wrote some SW documentation starting from pseudocode. In general I have no idea of what I'm doing, since understanding the requirements supposes some technical knowledge of the system from my side, which I don't have since this is what I've been doing from day one. This stuff is starting to depress me, I thought about leaving the company, but I learned nothing, so I don't know who else would hire me.  


My section (subsytem) works closely with the algorithms one. In the past I've been asked from my supervisorif I wanted to work on algorithms, but I said that I would have stayed in my current section, since I didn't really know where we were headed. The last week of work have been awful, my only task had me reading around a thousand SW requirements that I don't really understand, and checking some control boxes about how they're written. I'm considering asking him if I could be moved to the algorithms team, I saw what they're working on and it feels extremely interesting, besides being an activity that would teach me some useful skills. I mean they even made me follow two coding courses for nothing, I just spend my days on MS Office.  


I don't know if it would look bad to ask this. I didn't see anyone else changing section and complaining about their work (more or less). I don't know if I'd give the impression of someone that's not serious and is just acting up cause he's bored, but I'd really like to do something different. What do you think?

I’m worried these clients viewed my leaving as a betrayal, and I don’t know how it’s going to be dealing with them again.  I was able to solve some issues for them but case management is one crisis after another, something I couldn’t sustain right out of college in my inexperience.

Moreover, my co-workers frequently delegate their tasks to me during those two hours, a situation that doesn't bother me as much as it probably should. Adding to the complexity, my manager recently instituted a no-phone policy, despite the considerable downtime we experience.

Given this scenario, I spend a significant amount of time on the computer. How can I leverage the time I spend on my computer to acquire skills for a better-paying job? What can I do during the unassigned time at my desk to become a more competitive candidate for higher-paying positions?

I’m a software developer in my 20s and have just over 5 years work experience at this company. 

After 5 years, the day to day of the job is fairly easy. I can do a week’s worth of work in 2 days but I obviously don’t tell management that lol.

It’s a challenging job if I’d want it to be (there’s a never ending list of work to be done and improvements to be made if I want to be THAT guy) but it’s also the type of job that I’m allowed to coast and manage work load. 

I’m also well respected and treated well (can practically walk in and walk out when I want as long as the work is done). 

The pay is slightly above market.

The problem is my team is trash lol and it’s getting worse. We lost 40% of our team over the last 2 years with no replacements and the people that are left are the kind of guys that just do the bare minimum where firing them would be difficult.

My work load and responsibilities have been increasing and it looks like this year will be a shitstorm.

I recently graduated out of college, and I would like more money right away but I believe prioritizing finding something that alligns with my interests/career goals might be better.

I know that being a physical therapy aide isn't a realistic long-term full-time career to make a living, but could it be a stepping stone to being a physical therapy assistant?

My research has shown that physical therapy assistants often make 60k a year. Is this true? Do you need to go to grad school/get a master's degree to be a physical therapist assistant?

Basically I'm asking three things:

1. Would being a physical therapist aide would give me the necessary skills/experience that would enable me to be a physical therapist assistant in the future?

2. Can you make a decent or good living by being a physical therapist assistant?

193yq28,My employer is forcing me to resign if they don't find a new position for me. Is this possible?,"I am 28F in the state of IL. 

I made a post on another sub about how to mitigate pain from a very physical job. I got bait and switched into the current role I'm in, and I've failed to live up to the physical demands and asked management for accommodations. 

Well I had a meeting with HR, the Dept manager, and my manager on Tuesday. I told them how many injuries I'd sustained in this position in just 3 months. I told them I want to keep working at this (massive, multi-billion dollar) company to the best of my ability.

They said I am a very hard worker and that despite my ""personal complaints"", I do keep up with my team members. So they gave me an ultimatum: either keep doing my job, or resign. HR said he'll give me 2 days to think about it.

I left early yesterday after quietly cleaning out my locker and clocking out. I got a call from HR a few hours and he said ""why did you walk off the job? You didn't give the dept manager a chance to find you a new spot in the company""

I politely told him that the only thing I was told that I either keep doing my job or resign. There was no mention of this in the meeting. The dept manager never said a word, just stared at me listlessly the entire meeting. 

Long story short, HR and I went back and forth as he added more details that were apparently only discussed with them after I was dismissed from the meeting. He said he ""didn't want to give me false hope on finding a new spot for me within 2 weeks, so I didn't mention it during the meeting""

So he ever so graciously said I'm welcome to come back to work on Thursday 1/11 under the condition that I will ""willfully resign"" in 2 weeks if the dept manager doesn't find me a new position in the company. 

What's your opinions on this situation? I'm at a loss, they're forcing me quit either way because they placed me in a position that I DID NOT APPLY FOR. DID NOT INTERVIEW FOR.

then he kept reminding me that it's not that we wants to be cheap on the salary it's just that he wants to give me a position based on my background - which ofc as well know is utter BS.  
and i've already given them a range in the past of my current salary, which i reminded him of and from his reaction i can tell that the guy has no idea that his colleague has this piece of information.  
i ended up telling him to give me a day to think about it and i'll get back to you by email.  
so my concern is with the 2nd option. i want to avoid the 2nd option. cz the mf is way WAAAY more knowledgeable than me and really knows how to talk - similar to your typical wall street suit-wearing mfs. and i know myself - i can't outplay him with wit and skills. the guy has extensive leverage over me. so i really want to avoid the 2nd option  
that said, i'm forced with the 1st option. can u guys give me ideas on how to approach the 1st option? should i inflate my salary? what if they ask for salary certificate (they've highlighted that they might request this at some point)? what if i give them my current salary and then go for a second round of negotiating of salary - for example, they give me an offer, i don't like it and then i request them to kindly reconsider. give me ideas pertaining to the first option please.

193vk34,I am stuck trying to decide between 2 job offers. These are my first offers after graduating as a Supply Chain and Finance Major. Can I get some advice on which job would be better for my career growth in the future?,"I recently got a job offer from two companies, Boeing and Amazon, and am here looking for advice before I make a decision. Here is the total comp and job title for both:

Boeing's total compensation is $65,000, with no bonus, and 5 days a week on-site (total 40 hrs), with a 3-hour commute per day as a Procurement Agent, who gets to travel about 25% of the time a year including a 401k match 5%.

Amazon's total compensation is $67,800 with a $5,000 sign-on bonus, and 4 days a week on-site (total 40hrs), with a 1-hour commute per day as an Area Manager, no travel, and in Operations not corporate with a 401k match 2%.

Overall, Amazon seems to be better in working days per week, commute distance, and pay, but my main concern is the opportunity for growth in my field as a Supply Chain major. I'm concerned that being an Amazon Area Manager is too saturated in the market due to being open to all majors. I will also not be paid for working overtime because I am salary-exempt. While Boeing pays less it is unlikely that I will work overtime and it will allow me to travel, but my commute every day will be awful.

If anyone has had these types of jobs before, can you advise which job would be better for my career starting out? Additionally, were the jobs similar to their descriptions? Thank you in advance.

Though my recent mistake has been a big setback in a number of ways. Regardless of the circumstances, it doesn't matter they are unjustifiable, reckless and irresponsible. It has cost me a lot - I will forever regret the choices Ive made.  
That said Id like to consider myself a very attractive candidate - 4 internships for tech sales in college, 2 years outside sales after college, and now promoted into an Account executive role. Beyond this I have a variety of hobbies and passions, volunteer, cook, bake, photography, love to learn and travel as well as being huge people person. Ive gotten a lot of good feedback from past employers and current colleagues.  
Though no one has ever mentioned my first DUI I feel the second has screwed me. Obviously its a red flag.... Id hire the candidate with no DUIs.

193uhj5,Need help in deciding which job to pick 2 offers,"Context: I interned with Company A this past summer as a Graduate MBA intern, and it was a phenomenal experience to say the least. Great enough for me to want to put all my eggs in one basket and seek full-time as a I graduated in August and then 4 final interviews later with the company, nothing. 

This is where Company B comes along, I interviewed with them this past December as I didn’t didn’t think company A was in my immediate future. Had wonderful conversation with the hiring manager and a month later I had a final interview last week fully expecting to get an offer this week. 

Fast forward to EOW and I get a call from Company A that a 6 month contract position is open and they’d like me to interview. I say why not because B hasn’t offered *yet*. I interview Tuesday and get a call a few hours later and say I got the position, and whole and behold Company B calls the same day. 

Now the problem is; do I bet on myself with Company A where benefits are from the contractor and I am paid hourly vs salary in the hope I get a full time position (it’s very hard to get in so trying to get foot in door even more) or do I go Company B route where it’s salaries full time and pays ~10k more and has better benefits as of now. It sounds like a decently easy choice for security but I’m looking in the 5-10 years down the road route money isn’t everything to me.

193u21a,current eng student struggling to make future plans,"my dream is to eventually do physics research, but for now i feel like i need to make enough money to live comfortably off of, partially influenced by my upbringing, so i decided to pursue engineering.

i’m on a 3-year graduation track right now (assuming i don’t transfer) for mechatronics engineering, graduating at the end of next year. i’m considering going into a master’s program given that tech, and especially Mech, seems to be in a huge employer’s market rn, but if anyone predicts a resurgence by next year, maybe i’ll consider going straight into industry?

my big overarching question, however, is how to get into a Physics PhD. from my understanding, theoretical physics is almost entirely a no-go at this point because of how competitive universities get about it, hiring only pure physics students, if not physics + math. so maybe doing an applied physics PhD is an easier gateway in? i don’t know much about pathways to professorship but i’d really rather be doing research (and i really enjoy teaching!!) instead of engineering industry my whole life",bartouche,1,1.0,0,1704950971,2024-01-11 05:29:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/193u21a/current_eng_student_struggling_to_make_future/,1,2024

193tpyt,No call no show,"So as the top says no call no show, I’m sure you would think it would be referring to a shift I didn’t inform my job I would be there, but not really quite right. So let me Clarify why I am here I work in the gaming/casino industry. If anyone knows anything about this line of work it’s a very strict, very top down line of work.  I’m going to be as detailed as I can so the full picture is understood. Anyways the casino I’m currently at (not gonna say due to policy’s) has very backwards logic, for example, brand new dealers learning to deal blackjack, cut Cheques/manage cheques, and learning the calls and basically the ropes of the business, get paid to learn, it’s not much but they get training pay, while the training is in house a dealer that’s been there and put the dues in and decides to learn another game. Has to pay 50 bucks for the class, out of our own pay check, and only if we pass the class we can get that money back. And instead of like a beginner and getting paid for learning another game we are not clocked in for it,so we are not being paid. So I’m on my 3rd 16hr day of work ex(11am-2am) I’m in training from 11-4 and work the rest basically, and out of all those hours I’m only getting paid for 8 of them. But the instructor, and anyone else that isn’t picking up an extra game is getting paid. But the instructor also works and runs the classes like we do, but they are paid very well for teaching. Anyways. So it snowed very bad last night on my way home (which about fell asleep trying to make it home) so soon as im off I go to bed well it snowed enough that my phone died while I was a sleep, so no alarm clock and my close coworker/friend said the instructor said I basically I’m a no call no show. and she things the rules (attendance policy)should apply to me. But I don’t get legally how, cuz I’m not scheduled, it’s a class to learn Another game. That I’m basically paying for out of pocket. And not only that, once I got to inform them. They were already gone for the day. I guess my thing is can I fight that? If they try to fire me when I’m not even on the clock?

193t612,Indecisiveness with career choices. Anyone else go through the same thing?,"Sorry if this is long. I really don’t know how to explain where my head is when it comes to picking a career path. I’m currently a high school senior in ontario canada, I’ve already applied to some universities, been accepted to two programs, and I have pretty good grades, I just don’t know what I really want to do with my life. Since I was a kid I wanted to be a veterinarian, so I applied to 2 programs (arts and science & science and agriculture with a major in animal sciences) at the same university that would get me into vet school no problem (i got into both these programs). But i also kind of like the idea of being a psychiatrist that specializes in child health, so i applied to a health science, life science gateway, and social science gateway (both life sci and soc sci are general first year, then i chose to ‘major’ in Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour (Mental Health Specialization) by second year). The thing is: I don’t really know if i’m committed enough to go through with med school, and i’m afraid of not getting into vet school and essentially wasting my time in university, plus both careers are extremely competitive. I want a career that will pay enough for me to live comfortably, so I also just focused on those “major” professions. Now i’m thinking that my plan B can be law since it a) doesn’t really require any specific undergrad b) is a stable and well paying job and c) i have some connections with lawyers that can help me with placement and what not. I would probably try and be a medical malpractice lawyer (hospitals get sued daily), patent lawyer, or family lawyer, since I could use my experience in my science-y undergrad choices in these careers. But law isn’t a passion of mine or anything, it’s just another option. Frankly I feel like i don’t have a passion in anything that can result in an actual career. At this point i just feel super unmotivated to go through university all together. Anyone else go through the same indecisiveness with their career? Anyone have some well paying (above 80k) career options for me that may just be lesser know?

193t1zd,How to avoid burn out,"I’ve been working at my company for over a year. I chose this job because I loved the company culture and the team I was initially working with. However we’ve gone through a complete overhaul of management since I started and pretty much all my favorite coworkers either quit or were let go. 

Apparently management turnover is something that’s common at my company but there are quite a few people who’ve been working here for several years, which is a good thing I guess. 

I’m fairly confident I’d be able to find a job relatively quickly elsewhere but I don’t really want to consider that option. I job hopped prior to this and I’d like to add some longevity to my resume, so ideally I’d stay here another 3-5 years. 

But I’m constantly stressed. I don’t get along with my new manager, and there’s an expectation to be working after hours and during PTO even though I’m a salaried 9-5 employee. I’ve already experienced complete burn out where I pretty much slept away the depression for a couple weeks. I don’t wanna have that happen again.

193slxz,How do I approach this?,"TLDR: My manager wants me to enroll in a company-sponsored leadership program (6 month duration), but I’m unsure whether or not to take it.

I’ve been at my current position for 2+ years. I started as a temporary associate (human capital management) with no prior knowledge. I was offered full-time within a month because they saw my ability to capture processes very easily with little supervison. Within a year from initial employment, I was promoted to a tier 2 level. Within a couple months from my tier 2 promotion, I was given a senior title and now mentor newly hired employees.

I’ve carried the senior title for about 5 months now. Just this week, my manager approached me about a company-sponsored leadership program. I wasn’t entirely intrigued by it because the program focuses on leadership skills, particularly building relationships with colleagues and managing people. I’ve had management positions in the past and I did not enjoy it (it led me to leave the position for a career change.) After an hour long meeting with my manager, it was clear to me that this is really a pathway to a leadership position. My strengths are really managing processes rather than people. I’ve expressed this to my manager and his counter-argument was that strengthen my weaknesses and would help my professional development. 

I responded by acknowledging that I do enjoy career development, but was looking for a more analytical position that deals with data and technology, not so much managing people. He then proceeds to tell me by taking this course and completing it, it puts me ahead of the internal competition when applying for a different position (it felt at this point he was doing anything to persuade me to enroll). I told him I wasn’t 100% committed at this time, but that I would take it back and give a definitive yes or no answer by Friday.

Do I stand my ground and focus on developing skills to earn a position in a department I prefer? or am I crazy/self-sabotaging myself by passing up this opportunity? I just don’t want to give the impression I’m looking for a leadership position by taking the course, but I also don’t want to simply reject the opportunity if I’m not seeing things clearly or overthinking things. I just don’t want to be pushed into a career pathway I’ll regret.

193s7o0,Gave up bonus for new job,"I love my coworkers and company at my current job but the work volume has been growing which affected me physically and mentally. I am also starting to lose motivation. I also found out that my coworker who has the same title as me gets paid $10k more than me. I know I am loved at my job but I started browsing around for something new. Coincidentally, in November my old coworker reached out to me with a fully remote position that can potentially pay more and I can learn new things in the field. I told her that I would like to come over but wait for my bonus that pays out in March which she said she is willing to wait and can tell her boss.(Wasnt sure if guaranteed). In December, I let the stress and emotions get to me and thought I can longer take this and texted my old coworker that I am willing to give up my bonus ($7.7K before taxes) and come over sooner in January since I dont know if I can last another three months and I would only be losing $5K of bonus after taxes which wasnt a big deal for me at that point. 

I interviewed and got the position, they offered me $85K. I currently am making $78K which wouldnt be too much of a jump so I negotiated it to $90K which I was happy about. The only downside is, there is no 401k match.

I gave my two weeks notice and for the past week, I’ve been wondering if I made the right choice. I am leaving a good company and leaders. Also, thinking more, I deserve that bonus that I worked hard for. Should I have stuck it out till the payout? Is it really a big jump if I lose the bonus? And if I stayed, I couldve gotten the bonus plus a potential 7% raise which would go from a base salary of $78k to $83k so technically it doesnt feel too far from $90k.

I just learned after I signed that I could have asked for a sign on bonus. I guess I just feel like I made a bad deal for myself.

193pc1q,Should I report my boss to HR?,"So I love my job and I think I'm a decently high performer. But lately my boss is making my work life hell. 

He is very disrespectful to people and is very creepy toward the women in the office (I am a man for the record). He called someone a ""fucking retard"" once behind their back. He said a woman we work with is ""hot as hell"" and he spends a lot of time with her around the office despite he is married. He gives younger women a disproportionate amount of attention. When reviewing the work of one of his direct reports, he said ""this looks like shit."" 

I have many other instances documented (with timestamps and witnesses). 

Other than that, I have some documented instances where he was a very low performing manager (but not something that is fireable).

His conduct is really starting to make me feel uncomfortable and it makes me not want to be around him or at work. 

I am worried that if I report him to HR, I will somehow have my career damaged. Like what if someone from HR tells him and then he starts giving me bad performance reviews? Or what if I get a reputation as a complainer/whiner? Or what if they decide to 'reprimand' but not FIRE him for his conduct and then he figures out it was me who told HR, and then starts trying to fire me or punish me somehow?

What should I do...? It seems like either way, tell or not tell, I lose.",careerdistress42069,5,0.8600000143051147,20,1704936574,2024-01-11 01:29:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/193pc1q/should_i_report_my_boss_to_hr/,1,2024

Basically, I was interviewing for a job and was told that my profile was going to be recommended to the COO who would be my boss so the next step was to wait for him to reach out to coordinate a meeting.  
On Tuesday (yes, this Tuesday of this week) COO contacted me and told me that the CEO wanted to interview me and shared a calendly with availability for this week and the next one. I originally booked for next Monday and excused myself by saying that I was currently out on holiday with a terrible internet connection so I would rather have the call when I was back in my office. COO asked me to please reschedule earlier because they were interviewing someone else and they would like to decide by Friday, so I booked a time slot for Wednesday (which was basically the next day).  
Fast forward today, I jumped into the call and the CEO never showed up. I sent an email to the COO saying that I understand that he must had something important going on and that I was more than happy to reschedule for later today or another day in the week but its now been +10 hours and I didn't get a response from him.  
What should be my next step? I know this sounds red flag but I really like the product the company offers, the scope of work, and the pay. I am considering a)sending an email directly to the CEO saying that if the position is still available I would love to have that interview or b)sending an email to the person who original recommended my profile (and was extremely friendly with me) explaining the situation and asking if the position is still open.",Gcande,1,0.33000001311302185,9,1704932965,2024-01-11 00:29:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/193o0z3/i_was_ghosted_by_the_company_in_the_last/,1,2024

Now, I'm thinking about pursuing a Master's in Industrial Engineering, particularly with an eye on Project Engineering in the short term. I believe this might be a solid move for my career.

Where I’m at it seems as if all upper management (directors, PMs, ETC) have some kind of engineering educational background. Any insights or experiences you can share on pursuing a Master's in Industrial Engineering. Programs? Or focus on a different degree?

193n828,Take a director role and postpone law career?,"I posted this somewhere else but would really like more opinions if I’m going to screw myself career wise. I am 33. 

I recently finished law school and I’m studying for the bar exam. 

I have worked 10 years at my current job as a manager and have an opportunity to take a director role at my company making 90k (currently making 65k). 

Pros of the director role would be it’s a very family friendly organization, flexible, allows for some work from home. I have 3 kids so this would be my primary reason for staying with this company. 

A legal role I know I eventually can make much more in. (Or think so anyway lol) I don’t have a job lined up yet and starting pay for most jobs that I’ve looked at with no experience is around 80-100k to start.

If I take the director role it would mean I plan to stay at least a few years in that role before transitioning to a legal career.  I technically could leave sooner but wouldn’t want to do that to the company if they are going to give me this job. 

I’m taking the bar regardless of my decision so down the road I can move to the legal career when I decide. 

Question is, am I crazy if I take the director role and postpone my legal career? Should I opt to stay in my manger role until I pass the bar and move into the legal field right away? The job I’m at is not in the legal field at all so when I leave I’ll be looking for a legal job with no experience. There are some transferable skills like contract negotiation, contract writing, etc. 

Would love to hear from anyone in a similar situation or from any attorneys.

193m6ab,Waffling on a job offer,"I have a PhD in Mechanical Engineering and about 5.5 years of experience developing engineering analysis software. My current job is in the field I specialized in, very flexible, with lots of autonomy and pretty low stress. I started job searching because my company has been on a downward trajectory losing more money each year the 3 years I've been there (it's a subsidiary of a huge multinational, so unlikely to go belly up, but who knows when more layoffs could come down). I'm also plateaued with no prospect at a promotion for several years.

I have a job offer that would be a 13% raise. I'm currently making six figures, the money would be helpful but not life changing. The new roll seems really interesting, there would be lots of opportunities for growth and developing a more diverse skill set.  It's a smaller fast growth company currently scaling from ~150 to ~300 employees.  The major downside is it would require a security clearance, working on a secure floor without outside internet access, in office 5 days a week. Currently I'm hybrid in office 3 days a week with a similar commute, ~45 min each way.  I have a 1 year old so less flexibility will be more burden on my wife to make it to doctors appointments, etc and inevitably seeing my daughter less.

I've been going back in forth on whether to take it. I asked my current company if they could counter offer. They took 2 days and told me today given the tight budgets, they can't offer me anything. It's left a very sour taste in my mouth that they can't even find something token to offer me.  My manager said he really wants me to stay and we can talk about redefining my roll and picking projects I'm more interested in, but this just seems like lip service.

I flew from overseas to the US for the interview, paid costs of accommodation and Ubers etc. 
I unfortunately didn’t get the role, however the recruiter did invite me to apply to other roles. I’ve followed up 4 times now regarding a mix of when to expect reimbursement and the other roles available with no acknowledgement or response from the recruiter. 
i am very concerned that I'm being ghosted and may not receive reimbursement of over $2000. What should I do next? Is it worth following up with the other interviewees to see if they are experiencing the same issues? Should I try and find an alternate channel?

193lx1o,Navigating work after being rejected for internal position,"I've been in my current role about 14 months now, when I took the position I knew it wasn't something I could see myself doing long term but used it as an opportunity to join a great company.  They require you to wait 12 months before you can move, so for those 12 months I did my best to grind and make an impact.  It wasn't easy, 3 months in there was a re org, shortly after team member left for a promotion internally and shortly after that another did the same.  All this was going on while I was the sole remote employee on a team that worked hybrid, 2-3 days in office.  This honestly only adds to my frustration because I'm supposed to be on a team, but feel very isolated. 

I was excited about this new role I applied for because 1) It in a new department I was actually passionate about 2) It would get me out of this position im in now that I can barely tolerate 3) I felt like I'd be able to use my skills and actually have a team around me, new position would've been in the city I live.  

When I didn't get the position I was let down, not really because I didn't get the position but because I knew I'd have to keep suffering through my current role.  I've heard stories and feedback from other employees of how difficult it can be to land a new role and that there seems to be a shortage of opportunities.  I really don't know how to proceed, and honestly part of me just wants t try and find a new job instead of waiting and hoping something appears again.  

I don't have the motivation to work during the day, and honestly don't care about the new responsibilities, dealing with another change, I have.  My sole focus is on getting out and to where I want to be for professional and mental benefits.  I know the frustration is normal, but i'm so torn on how to proceed.

Promotion - I have to chose my own title

Sorry this is a LONG post but I don't know where else to vent. 

I've been working as a Sales Executive for a Security Systems Installation company for the past 2.5years. 

The company employ around 40 staff including field engineers so the Sales Team was pretty small.

We have the Sales Director, Business Development Manager, myself and another Sales Executive. 

The other Sales Exec is due to retire this year and since I got promoted from Admin to Exec a year ago he's honestly on the wind down. He doesn't answer the phone, check our communal Sales emails inbox, follow up on quotes he's sent. Nothing. He is happy to sit there checking football scores or checking out deals on Cruise Holidays.

I've kept my head down and made a great name for myself for managing my workload, being a team player through the company and of course my Sales revenue. 

The company have recently bought out a local(ish) competitor so we have 2 offices with our being the HQ and the other a hub. Plus 10 more staff members.

My director has told me that he wants to reward my for my loyalty and work ethic but he'd like me to decide which direction (and what title) I'd like and he'll make it happen.

The issue is he's brought another member into the team with the title of Key Account Manager. 

This kind of overlaps with the Business Development Manager role and the BDM is very experience with our systems technically and has a long standing relationship with a lot of our Jey Clients.

I'm great at system designing from plans provided by architects, designers etc as well as the smaller domestic works that come in. My turnaround is rapid and I'm usually the point of contact for any Sales enquires or queries.

My question is if I say I want to be Lead Quotations Manager or Sales Opportunities Manager will I end up being a glorified typist for the BDM and KAM? We have 2 other Sales/Development Managers in the hub too.

My director has told me he'll get me someone who I can train on our design software and simpler work so I can concentrate on the big jobs. Thus also clashes with the BDM's perception of his role as he's the surveyor. 

There is no point in me arranging a meeting with them all to discuss this as it'll surely end in an argument.

So a little background about me. I’m 23F and I have my associates of arts degree (basically gen ed’s) and I have my certificate for a registered medical assistant. I live with my parents and the only bills I have are my phone and my car insurance. I paid off my car so i no longer have a car payment. Anyway, I’ve been in my current position for 2 and a half years. I used to love my job because management was great and I just overall enjoyed what I did. However, lately I’ve been really wanting to quit due to new management and they are now running the show without asking anyone’s input. They don’t even seem to care that their decisions are making our work harder instead of better. There’s a lot more too it but it’s hard to explain. 

So long story short I want to quit. However, I don’t know what I want to do. I know for sure I don’t want to be an RN, LPN, EMT, or work in the corporate world. I enjoy having a uniform.  I was thinking about going to school in august for clinical lab tech, but I’m not sure where I wanna go job wise. There’s no “step ladder” as a medical assistant so I can’t really move up anywhere at my office nor do i want to stay. I was thinking maybe going to part time and apply to be a monitor tech or a sterile processor or something like that where I wear a uniform. But I also love to travel and stay in hostels and go on adventures. So I was thinking of quitting my job and travel without having a job lined up. 

If you were in my situation, what would you do?  How bad is it to have a “gap” in your resume? 

It makes me really sad how hard I worked in highschool and how much money I thought I would make as an adult to now. I feel like my 16 year old self would be so disappointed I didn’t make more of myself already. My sister is 25 and getter her masters, and my 19 year old sister is in the marines.

Between sitting behind a computer screen 90% of the day, as well as the responsibility and the stress that arises out of it when things don't go as planned, I just read over my role description and hate everything about it. 

In a lot of ways, it feels as though I've been in a state of denial about it, knowing that I've just slaved away through 5 years of uni and another 2-3 in graduate jobs with shitty pay, just to start wanting out the moment I start making decent money. But after going through 3 jobs in 2 years, and currently hating my 4th... It's a hard stat to ignore. 

The problem is, I don't really know what I want to do after this. Being that I've moved around a lot and have done a bit of travel over the past 2 years, I don't really have much in savings, so I can't really afford any time off while I find something new. 

Those who have been through similar, how long did the overall process take, and what kind of sacrifices did you have to make in order to have a better life?",baconnkegs,3,1.0,1,1704923804,2024-01-10 21:56:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/193kezr/those_of_you_who_have_undertaken_a_major_career/,1,2024
193k8nk,How to get into product,"Hi! 

I am trying to get into product in some degree, I’d be very happy with a associate/jr level position. I want to be able to learn and grow from whatever level I am able to secure a job in. 

Here is a little bit of background on me: 

I have a degree in MIS, I know it’s not super important to have a degree but I it can be helpful for certain industries. 

I have experience at SAAS companies that either use software and hardware, or solely software. I have worked in customer success, software/product implementations, and currently I am an enterprise technical account manager.

In these roles I have had client facing meetings/presentations, conducted audits, worked on integrations, used code, etc. 
I know this is a very broad list, but I have worked on so many different things. All of my roles have really been positions that wear multiple hats as they have all been start ups. 

I am having a really hard time getting any interest on my applications for anything in product. My resume does include a bunch of specific info regarding what tech I have used. 

Does anybody have advice as to how to improve my chances to even just get an interview? 
I’ve had luck for project manager interviews but 0 in product. 

Do y’all know of any certifications that would actually be helpful? 

Thank you!",Variegated-B,2,1.0,3,1704923381,2024-01-10 21:49:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/193k8nk/how_to_get_into_product/,1,2024

193k0tk,How to gauge my worth when Walking into new position.,"I am 23, started at a construction company in NYC doing 15 mil , probably 20 mil next year as a sub. 

I was hired for project coordinator, then also was added that I run the saftey department. And now almost a year in they taught me to do estimating and now I’m also creating estimates. So three roles in one. Prior to me, they had a full time saftey guy and also another estimator ( 3 man estimating screw, one left and they had me fill the spot ). 

My one year review is coming, and I feel like they are going to attempt to give a $3-5k raise and call it a day. My hours before being an estimator was 7-3 and made $60k now I’m an estimator and my hours are 9-5 with no increase all year. How would you go about this?

193hs8o,"19yo, anyone have advice for me?","Hello I’m 19 and feeling kinda lost about what steps to take next in life. (I’m from the UK if it’s any relevance)

Lil’ background run, I struggle a lot with anxiety. I left secondary school to be homeschooled online which was much better for my mental health yet has limited me to GCSEs only in Art and English.
I started college, taking Lvl 1 Art & Design but I had to retake the year due to lack of work and attendance because of the anxiety. I tried for a third year doing Lvl 2 Media & Technology, which I was excited to take, yet quit within 2 months because my anxiety became too difficult to handle.

I know there’s no specific time to complete things in life, but it’s very hard not to feel as though I’m far behind in life than I should be for 19, especially considering everyone I know either has big plans, are employed, or soon starting well paying apprenticeships. 

I was thinking of applying to Media / Graphic Design type apprenticeships but I don’t have an ID. I was going to apply for a Provisional but I’ve recently discovered I’d need a Passport for that which I also don’t have. I don’t know where I’d get the money for these. I have £14 to my name and cannot currently borrow money from anyone. (their own personal reasons)

In the meantime, I considered volunteering because it’d be something to add to my CV, but I'm concerned it might not expedite my progress and I’d be getting no money so it feels like wasted effort. I preferably need something that I’ll earn money from to get the forms of identification I need. I don’t know how to borrow money loans from places as I don’t have a bank account either. 

I’ve tried applying for cleaning / dog walking / baby sitting jobs but they all require prior experience. I also have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome so I’m easy exhausted and don’t want a job that’s too strenuous on my body.

Any guidance, tips and suggestions would be immensely appreciated.

As you can tell by my post history, I have been looking for a different job for approximately 9 months. I have applied internally at my current role, internally with clients I have worked with before, and for different companies entirely. I have about four years of financial analysis and compliance experience, have an applied math degree and am currently in the process of obtaining a second degree in accounting, with anticipated graduation date of December of this year. 

I am beyond frustrated and getting to the point of genuine concern that there is something tied to me personally that is preventing me from being offered different role. I have applied for entry level positions, positions that are more in line with my experience, and even those that seem to exceed my current qualifications. I have applied using a variety of resumes, with some recruiters reaching out to me as well. I have had maybe two serious interview processes over the past nine months, one ending with an eventual denied offer, and the other one being ghosted entirely. 

I know current conditions are tough and I’m in a more niche industry, but I had  more optimism that I would have atleast SOMETHING by the end of 2023. 

Could anyone provide me with some advice on how to proceed into the new year, or maybe someone who has had a similar experience that could give me some different perspectives.

I'm fortunate enough to be in a position to have 2 job offers from different companies and I am having a very hard time deciding between them. I was hoping for some advice or insight that I may not be seeing. I'll be as descriptive as possible for transparency reasons.  


Offer 1: Large global private environmental engineering consulting firm. I would be an environmental engineer with the company, managing a large amount of global projects. The vast majority of my experience is relateable to this field.  
Pay: 120k + potential EOY bonus. Unsure about OT  
Benefits/retirement: Both are offered, however the plans are fairly standard and nothing sticks out as exceptional.  
A decent amount of travel is required with the position, which is actually a good thing for me as I've always wanted to travel a lot for work.  
The company does have an in-person office in my city, however the vast majority of the company operates remotely. While the option to work remotely is at times great. Im not a huge fan of working remotely, especially when starting a new role. Going into the office is an option, however I suspect that there won't be many people present there.  


Offer 2: Local/Public transportation company. I've been trying for 10+ years to be hired by this public/government company. I was surprised when they had a job posting for an environmental engineer 10 months ago. I interviewed with them and got offered the position. I actually took transportation engineering in school and this would be a great blend with my experience as an environmental consultant.  
Pay: 112k + no EOY bonus. Potential for OT  
Benefits/retirement: Amazing, considered to be one of the best programs in the country. Additionally, I get a unlimited travel pass (making my commuting costs $0)  
While not confirmed, this position will be in person 100% of the time most likely.  
Comparing job descriptions, I think I would enjoy the work at offer 2 more. Due solely on the fact that it seems more interesting to myself.

193gvgb,Career for my mother,"Background info: My (22M) mother (41 YO)  is need new of a career. She has a lot of debt.

She has worked at Dunkin Donuts nearly her entire life, and the only reasons she's been able to make ends meet is because of child support from my father and my brothers father. My brother turns 18 next year, so she won't have that. She's had no other job experience at all, and has about $100-$200 in her bank account at any given time. I help her out as much as I can, but it's non sustainable for me or her. I don't believe she will ever be able to retire or support herself. 

She has about $10,000 in credit card debt, $5,000 in student loans (for a computer science degree she did not finish) and around $2,000 owed on cell phones for my brother. We currently live in a 3 family home owned by my grandmother, who is controlling and abusive.

 I live in one apartment, my grandmother in another, my mom and brother in the last one. My mother and I both pay $800 a month in rent, I am completely independent in this home as I pay my way for EVERYTHING. (electric, heating, groceries, insurance, car, phone). 

I pay a chunk of her monthly expenses, nearly every month. Whether it be paying her rent, phone bill or money for oil. I don't mind helping her out of course, it's just not sustainable. The last 2 years I've been trying to convince her to start something she can advance in and make a career out of but she's been comfortable with supplemented income and felt no need to take steps in her life to prepare for not having it. 

That being said, what is something someone her age with as little experience as she has can get started in?

However, I just had an interview for a government job that would be career adjacent to what I was doing at my last job, but I won't hear back for at least another 3ish weeks probably...

My dilemma comes down to my last job was extremely stressful and I felt almost incompetent. While I felt pretty bad about losing the job it almost feels like a blessing in disguise. I worked in land development and was pretty much expected to handle all aspects of each project which really ended up overwhelming me. I started that job nearly 2 years ago and up until I got laid off I still felt as overwhelmed with the work as I did when I first started. Some part of me feels that this would just be the nature of working as a civil engineer in land development however I also think that the stress could be attributed to me not fitting in the best at this last job. After 2 years I don't think I ultimately got along the best with my co-workers/project managers at the company and communication was just a mess across the board. Not stressed or conflicting relationships with my co-workers but enough to negatively affect my training/learning and ability to perform my job to the best of my ability. With this in mind I hope that this new opportunity/offer at the new company will be a better fit and thus hopefully lead to me being successful in land development.

However, I just interviewed for a government job doing work that seems fairly land development ""adjacent"". It seems like it'd be a bit more focused/specialized work so I wouldn't be having a 100 different things I'd need to do/learn like with land development and so the work itself would probably not be as stressful as land development + it's a government job which as far as I've been made aware and from the interviewers the work would be less time demanding/offer a better work life balance than a private company. Plus the work just sounds interesting and I like the idea of specializing a bit more than I would continuing down a career in land development.

Background/possible ""stress levels"" aside here are the other differences;

**Private Company** \- land development/basically exactly what I was doing at my previous job - probably stressful

\- $70k salary with $1.5k sign on bonus (tried to negotiate higher which was initially granted but then revoked)

\- Employee owned/ESOP benefits (no 401k match, though there is a 401k plan)

\- Hybrid, M/F from home, T/W/T in office (commute is 25miles/30min-1hr depending on traffic)

\- more than likely will work more than 40hrs on avg (I will be paid my hourly rate for OT)

&#x200B;

**Government Job** \- land rehabilitation design work - seems to be less stressful

\- $63k salary (I will try to negotiate higher, from the interviewers it sounds like I could possibly get more money)

\- It's a union job (I'm unsure exactly what this would entail but from past research/what I've heard I'm assuming that this is ultimately a benefit)

\- Hybrid, M/T/F from home, TW in office (commute is 18miles/30min)

\- while OT would be required in special circumstances it'll be way less likely than in the private sector (I will be paid my hourly rate for OT)

\- Both jobs offer full benefits/insurance although I'm pretty sure the government benefits will be better and I'm assuming I'll get more PTO/sick time than at the private job

&#x200B;

So the situation is that after some back and for with the private company trying to negotiate for a higher salary I should be receiving a revised offer in the next couple days while for the government job I only just interviewed with them and won't be expecting a response back for at least 2 more weeks. Considering this I'm here looking for some advice, if I was sitting on both offers right now, and if the pay was the same I think I'd pick the government job, seems a no brainer IF the money was the same.  Especially considering not having to work as much if any OT and being able to work remote more. Although I don't have both offers, it's possible I won't even get offered the government job, but I'd really hate to start working for the private company to possibly end up quitting within a month for the government job if/when they make me an offer...

Thanks in advance for any input

I just got hired by a hospital as a telephone operator after contracting as a temp-hire for 6 months, and I envision leveraging education benefits from the union to train, get certified, and go to school to become a highly paid tech in a different department. 

I just wanted to ask anyone who might be familiar with working in a hospital about what might have worked for you to move up similarly or know someone who was successful doing that. 

Any advice is much appreciated. Thanks.

193f6e9,37f looking for a change to my career after being in Customer Service for decades.,"Hello, Reddit! A little about me is I’m almost 37 and I just got a severance from my job that I had for almost 9 years doing customer service for a major online retailer. They are downsizing so a lot of positions were cut and mine was one of them. 

My husband is 35 and he’s a network security engineer. He’s been in his field for over 10 years and is good at what he does (I assume, I don’t know anything about his actual job). 

We are looking to move to another country (away from the US) and his job is in demand in a lot of places. We have a fair amount of money saved to be able to help us with this move. 

My question is this, I have only ever worked in customer service and I absolutely hate it. I couldn’t afford to go to college so I’m feeling a bit stuck in the customer service world. Has anyone left customer service and started over in a different and more interesting career? If so, how did you do it, what did you change to, and what was the mental process like? I’d also love to know what the timeline was, like how long it took from start to finish, etc.

193dhws,Boss asking for a hard stop date after months of expected leave,"My boss has expected me to leave for MONTHS now (about 6months a this point). I work customer service (phones&emails) at a small company and barebones team. When one person is on vacation, the workload increases for everyone. 

I let a coworker know I was expecting to leave eventually. Unbeknownst to me, this news made its way to my boss. Shorty after that conversation with the coworker, my boss called me to discuss this news. (I really dug myself into a hole here).

I let him know I did not have an expected end date but would let him know as soon as I sorted out some details in my personal life. I told them I knew it would take a while to hire a new person so I could leave when the found a replacement.

My boss thanked me for the heads up and began searching for my replacement. It took them MONTHS and SEVERAL new hires to finally find a couple of new teammates that did not leave right away. They only recently finalized the last hire. 

He checked in every month to see if I had any updates or more solid plans to leave. I gave him vague answers and kept personal details to a minimum. He responded well and continued to compliment my performance and thank me for the very advanced notice. 

I have to say, he’s been extremely supportive during every conversation. He has never made me feel like my job was at risk. 

However, with the yearly kickoff coming up, budget discussions, and 2 new hires on the team, I feel like they could be itching for me to go. 

It is now January and he just reached out to me for a hard stop date. I want to end mid-Feb but I have not told him yet. 

I decided mid-Feb was best for me because I could attend the kickoff meeting 1/31 and then leave 2 wks after. 

At this point, would it be risky to tell him I want end date that’s 4-5 weeks out? 

Tl;dr I told my boss I was going to leave 6+ months ago with no hard date. He’s now asking me for an update on my expected end date.

193cjl1,Need advice if I should ask for raise,"Need everyone’s advice/guidance 

I started a job 4 months ago as a Executive assistant making 60k a year. When I started this job, they also hired another person for the same position that had already been with the company for 9 months. 

Not long ago I found out that she is making a significant amount more than me to do the exact same job. She’s making 72k. However, the previous position she held has no relevance to what she is doing now. She was simply moved because the position was opened and she had a good relationship with the hiring manager. What I’m stuck on though is I have MUCH more experience doing this type of work (10 years) compared to her only having 4 years. I also have a BA degree and she does not have any school past high school. At first I thought maybe she had some sort of performance evaluation to where she was move to that pay amount but a friend in HR told me the company only does annual performance raises and your hire date anniversary. She was only here 9 months when she was moved to this position so it definitely was not a performance raise. I also found out that I’m basically at the minimum for the market average based on my location and her pay is right at the average. I’m not all saying she doesn’t deserve that salary or that I expect them to lower hers, but I also don’t think it’s fair that’s she’s making a significant amount more than I am when I have more experience, a college degree and started this position at the same time she did. 

I know a lot of you are going to say, you can ask for raise whenever you want which I already know. My question is, do you think it’s fair and I have valid justification to do so?

193a4wx,How do I spin my “job hopping”?,"I’m in a bit of a tough situation. I was working in a different field for pivoting to a similar role but in a different field. I was in the social services as an investigator but now work for Financial institutions. I had longevity in roles in my old field 1.5 years, 2.5 years and 3 years. 

I “pivoted” to my current field and got a licensure that allows me to do a specific job role that is fairly common. While obtaining my license I worked for 8 months at a lower more admin based role when I got licensed and was offered a contract role. This was great as it gave me a ton of experience and I was relocating at the time so it was convenient to not commit to a permanent role. Worked the contract for 7 months (even took an extension) and was offered a permanent full time role at a different FI. 

Great right? Wrong, It has been a nightmare since I started. 7 months in everything has changed my schedule/hours/job title/department/supervisor and my department has never been full staffed this whole time. I’m doing the job of 1.5 people with no supervisor oversight.

I’ve had interviews but everyone seems hesitant to take me as I’ve “hopped” so much.

1939quo,How do I successfully change jobs without affecting my health?,"Without getting into specifics about my role and the company I work for, I'm at a point in my life where I feel like I need to move on from my current role and move away from the company I currently work for. My manager is definitely a contributing factor, as he is difficult to work for at times, but I am also at a point where I feel the company I work for is trying to act like a larger company than they already are, and I do not want to be a part of it much longer.

I have been at my company for 20+ years now and feel like I'm at a point where I will not grow or move forward there. Add to that the additional stresses that I feel are coming through the pipeline, with less people to do more work and 90% of our staff offshore now, I want to move on.

At the moment, I am 100% working from home. No travel necessary, which has been a blessing for me because of the range of health issues I have experienced the past 4-5 years not allowing me to travel more than 1-2 miles from my home - consider it physical disabilities without me being on actual disability. On top of this, I do make 6 figures a year, so this is something that definitely helps due to debt situations.

My biggest concern is how to address my health.

* I am currently on medication for some chronic conditions.
* I need health insurance no matter what, especially for one of those conditions, to keep on with the medication. Not taking it for even more than 2 weeks could cause serious issues that would lead me to hospitalization.
* The other medication is new to me and perhaps I could get off of it for a bit, since the issue could be resolved with some more healthier lifestyles.
* If I'm in between jobs, how do I deal with the medication issue to make sure I'm covered?
* As mentioned, I am fully work from home. My physical disabilities don't allow me to be in a car for more than a mile or even somewhere outside of my home for more than an hour or two. So, I would need a full work from home job.

Regarding the work I would like

* I've often thought of career change but not sure what to focus on. Some of the things that do interest me, are not work from home jobs. Should I be able to address my physical disabilities, then I could consider.
* I understand I likely won't find much at 6 figures right off the bat. I have a minimum amount I know I can accept and still live somewhat normally.
* The preference would be to work for a smaller company that doesn't feel like they are being run as a corporation.
* I have a strong IT background, though some of it is outdated, I can still pick up and learn a lot.
* I am currently in management but want out of this and prefer to just be a worker again without all the pressure.
* As mentioned before, I need health insurance to cover my medications, potential surgeries, etc. I'd like to get this immediately. Ideally an insurance that works with my doctors, doesn't require appointments to move the medication from one insurance to another (I have been treated for 10 years) and even allows for at home deliveries for medications.
* I do not miss a lot of time at work. Over the past few years, I'd say on average 5-7 sick days a year. Vacation time is basically non-existent to me since I can't travel, but when I do take it, I'm often trying to stay unplugged and make it a staycation. I probably don't need more than 3 weeks a year (if that)
* I'd prefer not to work weekends and holidays.

I'm sure there is more I did not cover but want to see what people think here or advice that can be offered. Thanks!",PorgLover1977,1,1.0,0,1704897547,2024-01-10 14:39:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1939quo/how_do_i_successfully_change_jobs_without/,1,2024
1939qm5,"I'm 33. After 2 masters, 7 total years of working in 3 different permanent jobs and i still feel like a total loser. Did anyone else go through this? How do you overcome yourself?","I've done 2 masters and worked for a total of 6 years, having 3 different permanent jobs and numerous internship/student projects. However, as of today, I am feeling completely depressed about my career life and I'm losing motivation in my current job or the hope that someday it might get better. The future looks so bleak as I am wondering if I'm ""unlucky"" or if I need to get my shits together..

For a little bit of context:

My parents forced me to take on a scholarship that sent me to Europe to study a foreign language and become a teacher. I never wanted to become a teacher but in the end, took the scholarship so that my other siblings would have the opportunity to further their studies. The program took 6 years to complete and I was bound by the contract for the next 5 years.

By the time I decided to leave the teaching industry, it's been 11 years.

I went into my first masters and had some great internship experience.

At this point, things were great. Whether it was my teaching profession or my studies or even during the internship, I excelled in everything and had great feedback from my tutors and bosses. I even got job offers while waiting for me to graduate!

 However, at the end of the masters, COVID came and the job offers that I got previously were all canceled aeronautics industry so go figure). So I decided to go for a second masters, did some internships again (still gaining good feedback and also landed a job after my internship but I refused the job offer as the product of the company did not correspond well with my values).

I spent 6 months after that job hunting and 6 months is such a long period that it took a tool on my confidence. 

I was able to get a job in my dream company (one of its newly acquired branch) with a great salary and the job sounds fun! However, things didn't go very well in the end as I was under a toxic manager who required me to do the tasks of 3 persons (2 which were out of my competency scope) and reported me to HR for not performing even though I had great feedback from my customers (my main task that I was asked to prioritize by the manager was customer relationship management). Long story short, I was burnt out even though I've tried looking for a solution with the manager, with HR, and with myself and I resigned. By this time, my confidence had completely plunged to quite a pit hole but luckily, I got another job offer by the time I ended my contract with the company. Hurray right?

No. 

I'm 3 months into this new job, and I realized that this company has an owner who is jeopardizing his company with his incompetency, lack of compassion for the employees, and malfunctioning logic. Everyone is unhappy with him and that generated lots of toxicity at work with all the negativity. He does not listen to suggestions and demands that we do things his way even though everyone is aware that it's not gonna work. I've witnessed 10 out of the total 100+ employees resigning (with my own manager job hunting too - told me he started when they were recruiting me btw), 10% of our major clients discontinuing their orders, many other dysfunctionality going on, and me, unable to do my job, and not being able to learn and acquire experience because I don't have the tools and environment to do so. All the while thinking:

\- Am I that much of a loser that only companies like these wants me?

\- Am I that incompetent that I am unable to make a change for the current company?

1937iw2,Should I take it easy or continue grinding ?,"Hi 

So I'm in a bit of a pickle. I have an important decision in front of me regarding my jobs and finances and I'm in dire need of a second opinion. 

FYI I'm from Poland, and I'm gonna outline my income and expenses in my currency (PLN), so don't pay much attention to the numbers , rather the percentages.

I currently work 2 jobs, about 200 hours a month, one as a security guard and the other one as a teacher. The security job takes up about 160 of those hours, and pays 3400 a month. It hardly has any real future career opportunities, but it's a easy job. The teaching job takes about 40hrs ( of active work, with prep it's more like 50 hrs) and pays about 2500. It also has a pretty good career path ( it's a private language school) and i genuinely find it fun and very rewarding

I just got an offer from the teaching job to take more groups, resulting in increasing my hours and my pay to about 4000. But that would mean that I would have to quit my job as a security guard. 

So my current income is about 6000 for about 200 hrs a month

Taking that teaching job would drop my income to 4000 for about 60-70 hours a month.


All of my monthly expenses come up to about 1900, that includes rent ( we kinda own our place, it's my gf grandma's place and we just pay her as if we were tenants), food, pets and all subscriptions. I don't own a car, no debt or anything.


Should I go with the teaching job or decline the extra groups and continue grinding with 2 jobs ? I'm honestly exhausted living like this, I've been doing the 2 job thingy for about 6 months, I kinda can manage it and once I got used to it, it's ok. But it leaves me with very little time for anything, especially my hobbies ( musician and painter). 

I'll also say that 4000 is a fine salary for my country, I'm a very simple guy, I don't need a ton of stuff, I don't go out that much, don't party, cook at home I'm pretty ok at saving money. I feel like with the 4000 I could easily save half of what I got left after paying all my expenses, and just chill with a lot of extra time, either working on my self or my hobbies. But on the other hand I could continue grinding and saving even more.

Please give me your perspective on this.",Outside_Toe_4144,1,1.0,2,1704890926,2024-01-10 12:48:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1937iw2/should_i_take_it_easy_or_continue_grinding/,1,2024

1935q7u,Would I enjoy Data Analysis / Data Science?,"I'm (28M) coming from accounting background - I worked a few years in various positions but I hated it all. The jobs felt meaningless to me, I felt like I didn't have impact on anything and I was basically a SAP/Excel monkey following processess, booking journals, making reconciliations and running monthly reports. I hated the idea that accounting was simply something that has to be done, but doesn't really bring much value beyond that. I also simply found the field to be extremely boring and repetitive.  
  
The only parts of the job that I enjoyed were situations where I could improve on some excel templates - introducing and making use of formulas, simple recorded macros and checks so that the work could be made more efficient. I liked thinking about how to make things simpler and efficient and how to translate it to excel.  
  
In college I enjoyed statistics, I also took some basic courses with data analysis in Python and liked the idea of playing around with data and presenting the results in the form of graphs, bubble charts etc. I'm also currently learning SQL and later plan to learn more about Tableau and Python.  
  
I also enjoy reading studies/research papers on topics that interest me and I guess I have an inquisitive mind. However I'm prone to making stupid/careless mistakes at work and sometimes I feel like I lack focus and organisation skills, but **maybe** it's because I just hated my accounting jobs and didn't really care about them that much.

I had just moved out of my parents house after 3 years of working part time, pulled together savings and managed to make it to a large metro.. only to wind up on my ass.
 I am a creative type at heart, a published writer and journalist. I speak several foreign languages, and yet none of this seems to really matter for anything even when I apply to more creative type jobs like technical writing.

My last job was in public service at the federal level, and I found the culture to be very much not a good fit, it could have just been my office but I wouldn't doubt it. I am happy and open to working for the federal gov again, but will be more careful in sticking up for myself and not getting steamrolled. My local government offers fundamentally no jobs, none that pay a decent wage that I can do even partially from home. None that do not require a driver's license. In my previous position I made $43k/yr, and prior to that I was working hourly at $14/h, living at home making roughly 22k/yr. The higher paying job had me staying up well into the night, working on clerical tasks or thinking about how to solve them.. my supervisor gave zero guidance, and gave me tasks that were outside of my physical realm of capability (asking the blind guy to transcribe a photo for example). I can't imagine the st ress of a ""normal"" 50-60k job that I keep seeing salaries for.. even if its something I am conceivably good at like communications, or journalism, or technical writing.

I feel both stuck in a physical sense, of being stuck at home.. but also, I have this intense desire to be productive and keep working. SOMETHING has to give, eventually. 200 applications, in a variety of fields from hospitality logistics to media something has to eventually give way. My parents are supportive, but I dont want to live with them forever.

1933xys,"Minimal knowledge in web development, worked in retail and now got an offer to work as a chemist in a cleaning products factory, what should I do?","I started learning web development in 2016 I think in a trade school, but it was so bad no one learned anything, we had to teach ourselves, so I tried to do that on and off and gained some basics over time, when I got the degree (in 2019) I immediately took a job in a retail store to pay off my debts and planned to keep studying in my free time, but unfortunately I was never consistent, I stayed in that job anyway until the end of 2023 when I decided to quit.  
  
Two weeks later I got an offer to work in a manufacturing company as a chemist, to mix and follow the inventory of the raw materials used, they said my experience doesn't matter, and they will be teaching me over time, so I took a tour in that factory but I didn't feel excited about it much, the salary isn't that interesting considering the work hours and the responsibilities and even tho my plan is to always be a businessman, I don't think I'll choose this industry. Plus I still feel like I could be more interested in a tech related job even retail again.  
  
I always try to do my best despite my passion for the position, I want to be good at everything I get to do, even if it isn't my speciality I'm open to learn and grow, for some reason I didn't want to apply any of that for this offer, I've been thinking about it much, and I'm still unsure if I'm being too picky, lazy, scared, I already feel like I'm old and I want to invest my next years in something else.  
  
I also never took a long holiday, I've taken only 1 week per year for the last two years and none when I started working, I'm torn between taking a month or two off while always applying for jobs or give this chemist job a go and stay that for a couple of years.

1931dmd,Option handcuffs - pre-vested,"I want to start by saying I do enjoy my job. The industry is exciting. I’m passionate about what I do. I started at the bottom of the totem pole and the company has scaled significantly in the three years I’ve been here. I’m now in upper middle management.

I’m at a “shit eating” level for lack of a better word. The company has grown SO much in such a short period of time; tripled its location count in two years (brick and mortar elective medical service provider). I say shit eating because in a traditional corporate structure, there would be two levels of management between my role and the “field staff”. Essentially I’m the general manager for 11 locations, the area manager for 2 areas, and the regional manager all in one. 

This leads to being a catch all for 90% of the actionable items. From the minutia of client grievances and new hire training, to helping conceptualize and implement constant org changes disseminated to 11 separate teams. Holding each accountable to business output and compliance. In short, I wear many many hats through the course of any workday. It’s exhausting. It’s incredibly hard work and a lot to stay on top of. It’s 10+ hour work days and ~120 days on the road per year.

That being said, I’m not complaining. It’s been genuinely exciting being a part of such rapid growth, and the personal and professional development have been substantial. I love my team. They are a pleasure to manage. I don’t take for granted having the air cover to build and foster the regions culture unfettered. 

I respect my superiors almost entirely, across the board. Although I don’t agree with every decision, I would take them 50 times over against any other upper management/director level / VP team I’ve worked with.

Now onto the meat and bones of it. Im 1/4 vested. Will be 1/2 vested in 2 months. It will be March 2026 before I’m fully vested. I do 10000% believe in the industry and the future of the company. I estimate once fully vested it will be in the ballpark of 150-250k in options. Potentially more should I be promoted again which is entirely playsible in that timeframe. Im paid in the 135k neighborhood including bonus and incentives. For context, I live in one of the highest COL areas in the country. It’s solid compensation, but where I live, it’s not the lap of luxury by any means.

All that said, herein lies the problem. My wife is pregnant with my first child. I can’t imagine working the hours I work and traveling 1/3 of the time. I want to be there for every milestone. For context I do get 12 weeks paid paternity.

The reality is, and this could go a million different ways (asking for less travel and getting it, being transferred to a different department etc etc) but worst case scenario they tell me it’s all or nothing “our foot is on the gas and that is not changing” you’re either able to perform the duties of the job or you aren’t.

If that happens, and I begin to shop around for a more suitable role, I feel like I’d be throwing away a nest egg/down payment on a home by way of those options. I acknowledge that I’m telling ouch before I’m hurt so to speak, but would I be out of my mind to forego the income from the options should the chips fall that way? I would lose everything if I do not hit the 2 year mark in my current position (March 2025). It goes without saying, it would be a sad day on a personal level as well, as if I had it my way, I’d be in it for the long haul with the company I’m currently at.",Inerestingdull,1,1.0,2,1704866819,2024-01-10 06:06:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1931dmd/option_handcuffs_prevested/,1,2024

192zv0h,39m tired of Hospitality,"I’ve been in Hospitality for 13 years, been in restaurants for nine years, I’m a manager for a small catering company (for the past year and a half) while actively trying to find a full-time job with zero luck.

I’ve worked in fine dining for the past 7 years and I’m honestly exhausted and tired of being in servitude relying on generous gratuities to survive. I haven’t worked in a restaurant since 2019 (due to COVID and my mother having been sick and dying from cancer) and feel like the industry is full of nepotism because I can’t seem to get an interview, let alone a response back from any of the places I have applied to. I used to be able to walk in to restaurants and drop off my resume and get a job no problem. Now it seems as if you have to know someone that already works at said place/s you’re applying to. From May 2023 until now, I’ve sent in nearly 200 resumes on indeed without any luck. Even for jobs that I am overqualified for.

My days are spent watching YouTube videos on affiliate marketing, copywriting, drop shipping, starting a YouTube channel, etc. but trying to figure out how to emulate and apply these as a beginner with no clientele. I don’t have any capital nor savings to begin to invest into working for myself, and the company I work for has only been getting weekend catering shifts because the business has died down and only get booked 1-2x’s/weekend

I’m looking for a career change, but not even sure which direction to look into. All I know is that I want to work for myself, am driven to find a way to work remotely and from home, but if I am to continue to be in servitude; I would want to provide people with something that I am passionate for such as fitness, spiritual awareness and I don’t know what else. I’m also teaching myself how to start a brand but again, no capital and in debt.

Slowly teaching myself financial literacy, and trying to stay ahead of the curve with opportunities trending yet I have no schooling credentials and feel brain foggy trying to navigate choices while building confidence to make the change.",apollotribe,1,1.0,3,1704861925,2024-01-10 04:45:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/192zv0h/39m_tired_of_hospitality/,1,2024

192zl8a,Publishing? Writing? Education?,"Hellooooo! I'm 23, live in the southern US, and currently work as a Grant Manager. I have worked as a Bookstore Clerk, Project Manager, Education Coordinator, and Substitute Teacher.  
I am currently making a a little over 50k, and make more than my parent ever has! I'm really proud of myself, but am thinking about my future and the logical next step after this position is over. I was out of a job for most of 2023, and was desperately searching for a new job. I love my current position, but now that I have the stability to leisurely look for my next step, I want to take it.

  
My main career goal is to be a history/anthropology professor and writer, so I want to look for something that is a little more in alignment with those two dreams while still allowing me to save. I want to go to grad school by the time I'm 25, and am currently saving for a downpayment for an apartment in my country of origin (I have US and one other citizenship). I am completely self-reliant financially, with no help from parents, so I do not have the option to take something that pays less than what I am currently making if I want to reach my savings goals.

  
Any suggestions? Companies to look into, or job titles you would recommend? I would love editorial work, possibly publishing of some kind. I'm a self-starter and love learning. I also have management experience in creative and professional settings. I also obviously LOVE history, love nature/the outdoors, and am equal parts artistic/analytical. For context, I was kind of looking into being an Interpretive Ranger at a National Park or an Academic Advisor at a Uni, but the salaries were the only thing stopping me. I'm probably not going to leave my job until I stay at least a year, so I am just casually looking right now and thinking about how to move forward. Open to remote, hybrid, or on-site.

192ygcg,"Left a job after a few months for a new opportunity, but feeling dissatisfied. Advice?","TL;DR I left job 1 after a few months for job 2. Now that I’m at job 2, my role and responsibilities have changed from the original job description, and I’m feeling dissatisfied. ☹️ What should I do? 

—

In my sector/area of specialization, it’s sometimes a challenge to get good, career-building experience that also pays well, isn’t a toxic workplace, etc. 

I transitioned to a new role at a small organization late last year (job 1) that I was apprehensive about at first because it was in an industry I’m less familiar with. However, I ended up enjoying it because of the workplace culture and frankly, I did a great job. The pay and benefits were good. The experience ended up being good, too — I did a great job in the time I was there, and the team seemed sad to see me go when I gave notice. I was sad to go, too, but was offered a role (job 2) that I felt I couldn’t pass up — it offered comparable experience, better pay, and was with an organization with a great reputation in an industry I am passionate about.

When I left, job 1 made it clear I did great work for them. They lightheartedly joked they’d rehire me in a heartbeat. I’m sure they were mostly being nice since I did good work for them, but overall I feel I left on good terms despite the circumstances and they were very understanding.

I left for a new, larger organization and role (job 2) that many of my colleagues, friends, and family hyped up before I joined — the job was in my industry and exactly what I was looking for prior to job 1. I was essentially recruited for the role right after I started with job 1, which was tough. I gave it a lot of thought and ultimately decided to transition because I have more experience in job 2’s industry, have a passion for the organization’s work, and the pay and some benefits were a bit better. 

I accepted job 2 under the impression I would be doing work that offers comparable experience to job 1, based on the job description provided when I accepted their offer. On paper and in conversations, it was very similar work. However, soon after starting, my boss changed a big part of my responsibilities. Honestly, if I had known there would be a big change to my role after I was hired, I never would have made the transition. I was originally really excited to be there and enjoying myself until they informed me of the change, and now it feels like transitioning to job 2 was a big step down from job 1 and I won’t be getting the kind of experience I was hoping for. On top of that, the workplace culture has been a mixed bag.

I just can’t shake the feeling I might have made a mistake. I talked to my boss about why this change was made, but got a vague answer. I don’t want to rock the boat too much because I just joined, but now I’m lacking trust, and overall I’ve been feeling misled. I’m having trouble focusing on my work because I am feeling disappointed and foolish for transitioning.

What should I do? Should I push my boss more about the change to my responsibilities? Should I cut my losses and just tough it out now that I’ve made the transition? I’m still really new to the role, but I honestly thought about reaching out to job 1 if I can’t get the kind of experience I was hoping for at job 2. I know they haven’t rehired for my old role yet (but will want to as soon as possible). Still, it’s more than a little embarrassing.",No-Radish-2760,1,1.0,0,1704857448,2024-01-10 03:30:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/192ygcg/left_a_job_after_a_few_months_for_a_new/,1,2024

I called back the recruiter and we spoke for some time, before he asked me about my experience with the Unity game engine. I told him I had experience using Unity several years prior to my last 3D artist job. He responded that I might not be the best fit for the role as the company for whom he was recruiting had requested someone with signifcant Unity experience. I've used it for around 4 years, last around 2018 or so.

After the call ended I looked over the job posting again. The description specified ""experience 3D modeling in Unity."" As the job posting was written by the staffing agency and not someone with a 3D background, I'd imagine they don't realize that Unity is not a 3D modeling tool, and models are all imported from other 3D software like Blender or 3ds Max. 

I have years of experience using 3ds Max, Blender and other 3D modeling software. 

Do you think is it worth contacting the recruiter again to explain the misunderstanding? I'd essentially be telling him that the software description in the job posting is incorrect, that Unity is not 3D modeling software and that modeling would be done externally. I'm not sure that would go over well if I did so. 

I feel like I ruined my chances by not clarifying during the call and by applying again I might be making the situation worse. Is it a bad idea to apply to a role again after being rejected by a recruiter who isn't familiar with the software used in the role?",ThrowRA_814,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1704855872,2024-01-10 03:04:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/192xxaq/software_misunderstanding_with_recruiter_should_i/,1,2024

So, I'm currently a Statistics major and I'm not really enjoying it. Yes, it's cool and stuff, and data science/AI is the shit right now, but I don't like it at all, probably because I never wanted to graduate in it until 2 weeks before choosing statistics as my major.  
  
I've always liked physics (yes, because I watched TBBT) and wanted to become a theoretical physicist. Then, I got kind of dellusional with academia. Bad pay, weird way of doing thins, ""publish or perish"", really extreme working hours. It's not really about science anymore, it's about making money for the department, you are a slave of your advisor. Knowing that, I decided that wanted to do something more ""useful"", that a company would say ""I'll hire you to do R&D"". I don't know, maybe quantum computing or materials. Either way, I would definitely need a PhD.  
  
At the sime time, I am really interested in cybersecurity (currently doing some CTFs), especially red team side of things, obviously xD and also interested in AI (I am more into research than actual business models).  
  
I don't know, I am just really lost, I need some advice. Ideally, I would choose PhD in Physics, then head to industry R&D.

The current manager, who's on the way out unknowingly, lacks industry knowledge and unable to guide his AEs and struggles with ramp up of new hires.

192wcrg,I've upset the most popular person at work and I don't know what to do next RE trying to navigate office politics,"The most popular person at my company is in my team. They are pretty much friendly with everyone. They are good at getting favours from people. They are very much in the boss' good books because of their social skills. I feel this person has a lot of social power. They have ambitions to climb the ladder. They've only joined recently. I have noticed this person sometimes tells me personal things I should not know about other colleagues though, and that makes me distrust them.

&#x200B;

In contrast, I am very introverted and not socially popular, but I am valued by managers for the work that I do. I think I have an established reputation as someone who's quiet and not known for kicking up a fuss from the many years I've been at the company. I have no interest in being in a leadership role. I am bad at saying no to people and have a hard time setting boundaries.

&#x200B;

I have done many favours for my teammate in the past, sometimes begrudgingly because of my personal failings. I tried to say no recently because I was busy, but I felt like I was being bulldozed into saying yes despite trying to dissuade them. I foolishly asked our manager for help and it's fucked things up. I can see why they were annoyed with me. I said in one minute that I could help, and then our manager is shutting them down the next, plus I guess I'm a rat now. I do also think part of it is that this person does not like being told no though. I've never had to deal with a conflict like this before.

&#x200B;

So far, I've apologised to my teammate by email as I did not think they would want to talk on the phone, but I don't know if I've shown enough contrition. Next, should I ask them if they would like to talk about it face-to-face? How should I handle that conversion if they want to talk?

&#x200B;

What would you do in my shoes to make it up with them? What would you have done to avoid the conflict? How much would you worry about the office politics?

192umbp,Project Management a realistic career move?,"I have a question mainly aimed at hiring managers and recruiters in the field of project management, but I'm open to anyone's opinion.

For background I spent the last 11 years as a frelancer. Initially web development, SEO, any kind of work you can do remotely. I eventually settled into collaborating with other freelancers and ended up mostly coordinating larger and larger projects between groups of contractors like web developers, marketers, sales and so on. Basically, managing projects.

Then I ended up starting a refugee shelter when the war in Ukraine started.

I had no experience working with refugees, I just happened to be in the region at the time. But that experience managing projects really turned out to be helpful in dealing with things like:

* Operating with limited knowledge in a constantly changing environment
* Conflict resolution and crisis management
* Setting strategic goals, developing plans to support these goals, and continually updating both as the situation rapidly evolves
* Training, leading and supporting an ad-hoc group of volunteers to achieve organizational goals
* Developing workplace and training policies to ensure everyone is working towards the same ends
* Tracking the progress of projects through reporting software
* Building relationships with local NGOs, international charitable organizations and representatives of UN agencies
* Compling reports for stakeholders

And all this with essentially zero budget. It was quite the year and a half experience.

Now to the point...as I see it the work I did both as a freelancer and a shelter manager matches up very closely with your average PM job description. But that's from my point of view. I could imagine how to a someone in a B2B company, running a refugee shelter and freelancing would seem compeltely unrelated and seeing that on an application is an instant rejection.

*If I want to try and move into a more formal PM role, am I being realistic about how much skill transfer I can reasonably expect to convey to someone reading my resume or interviewing me?*

 Also, if there are any other roles that would be a good fit that I haven't thought of, I'd appreciate any suggestions (if it matters, I'm only considering fully remote roles)",Suitable-Content,2,1.0,0,1704846622,2024-01-10 00:30:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/192umbp/project_management_a_realistic_career_move/,1,2024

192u7fb,[Story] Being eaten alive in the corporate world - Could you help me?,"Hi you all, 

I'm in my early 30's and have been working in the healthcare industry for 5 years now. I've joined as an intern that ""survived"" through a national recruitment program, where they selected 2 candidates. Since then, I've moved from intern to contractor, and from contractor to internal employee, and I've been given new responsabilities which I've delt with success. I've already had 3 managers, from a super toxic that didn't share any info or context about the projects, to a super nice one (in what refers to the human relations part) which left room from my own self development (some times a little bit too much, since I had to do not only mine but also her job). I'm now with a manager that resonates more with my first one, being super-cautious on the info that she's sharing with her team. 

I've always been able to deliver good results and to stand-out with the projects I manage. I've also no problem in working with people ""below"" and they tell me openly that they enjoy working with me since I give them meaningful tasks with company visibility. 

The problem: Since I've been giving more responsibilities, and since my projects have been making some ""headlines"" I'm getting progressively more attacked within the company.

Examples: 

1. Colleagues asking for the projects when they're already finished, and demanding that they are the ones responding to clients (even though I was the one doing the work); 
2. Managers not giving the full picture, which leaves me out-of-the picture regarding strategic decisions
3. People trying to outsmart me everytime, 
4. Colleagues questioning me about random specific details in meetings to put me on the spot and prove their own value in front of the rest of the team 

This all combined has been creating a sense that I'm no longer useful/good in my job and it results in working extra hours to fill in the insecurities left by the examples above and burning out myself. 

I'm sure that this is common in 99% of the corporate world nowadays, but I'm also aware that there are people that navigate this environment extremely well without compromising their own values. At my company, there are some employees that are respected and people don't even there putting them in the position where they're putting me. I would like to develop that going forward in my carrear. I've even thought linking with a company mentor outside my country so he/she can guide me on the best way to move forward. 

This is literally a cry for help. If you could give me some advice, something, it would be very appreciated. If you have some article or book suggestions that would also be great! 

Thank you in advance for all your help!

192th3k,Can I pivot away from my major?,"Hi everyone. I'm a computer science major getting a 4 year bachelor degree at my state's college in America. Its a good program, but as I've gotten further and further into the major, its become increasingly clear to me that I don't really want to do most of what my classes teaches me to dofor the rest of my life. I am currently halfway through my third year doing it, so I am just a year and a half away from graduating with this major.  
  
Not only do I not really like programming, I also feel like most programming doesn't utilize a lot of my strengths. I feel like its too late to swtich my college major because switching to any other course of study would probably require me to stay at least another year, which would obviously cost money.  
  
After talking to a lot of people and doing a lot of research, I've found areas that I think i would be better suited to. These include:Product management, which from what I can tell is not that crazy a pivot from computer science since a lot of PM jobs in tech are helped by having technical knowledge. I also find marketing as a field very interesting, and have talked to a lot of people who work in analytical and creative sides of the field that do work I think I could excel at. I am less sure how to pivot into this. I am especially unsure how to get involved on the creative end of marketing, which seems the most interesting to me.  
  
Overall, I think I like fields where I can engage in problem solving (which is the part of coding I like the most) without getting lost in a lot of very technical math or code. Staring at a screen for several hours debugging frequently gives me headaches. Also, I'd prefer a job that involves social interaction, since I'm good with people and like talking to them.  
  
I am seeking some general advice on what to do. I am a hard worker usually but right now feel directionless. Is it worth it to switch majors and spend more money at school but potentiall have a better spring board to a job I would be my best at? Is it best to just finish my major but maybe do other extracurricular things to pivot towards other kinds of jobs than software jobs? Should I tried to get hired for software and pivot once I already have that in my pocket due to the relative safety of a lot of programming jobs? Does what I minor in help? What are good things to do in my time outside of college to show employers that I would be good for internships and jobs in more business oriented and less technical jobs despite what I studied in school?

       Prior to that, I worked as a Finance Analyst and Compliance Manager with the United Nations (this was in Africa). I have an BSC. in Banking  and Finance and an MBA in Project Management. I have multiple Agile Certifications.
      I have a great job now that I think I love and I am making decent money wfh. 
      However, I really want to advance my career, I don’t think I am making the kind of impact that I wanted; I am not very fulfilled. I have thought often times of becoming more technical but not sure what IT field would be right for me. I am thinking of getting a PHD but not t sure if it is the right move either. I thought about Data Science, but many others too. 
I want to get promoted to a Manager and later make a Director at the banking industry. Could someone please recommend what field I should go for? 
I am smart and I can study and pass exceptionally at anything I put my mind to. 
I am open to your thoughts and thanks in advance.",Gurumom1985,1,1.0,0,1704843528,2024-01-09 23:38:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/192tf52/what_specialty_in_tech_would_be_the_best_fit_for/,1,2024

192t6u7,I feel burnt out in a new job after a 3 week break and I don’t know what to do.,"For some context, I have worked as an accountant and bookkeeper for the past 7 years and often put a lot of effort and passion into my work. In November last year, I felt exhausted and “over” my current role so I moved to an accounting software company working in post-sales support for people transitioning to the software. This role is completely different to what I was doing before, I’m essentially “training and selling” this software to accountants. At the moment, I’m still in training, so I’m learning a lot of scripts and presenting these to my supervisor. The last one I did prior to Christmas break I did not “pass” and essentially got stopped 1/4 way through to say it wasn’t very good and needed a lot of improvement.

I thought that after a 3 week break I would come back refreshed and motivated, but it’s 9:30am on the 3rd day back and I feel exhausted, drained and my confidence is at an all time low.

192ss4t,Found out a male coworker on the same level is making more than me.,"Our titles are basically the same—we’re both specialists but my responsibilities are mostly content-related and his are general to marketing. I’m at a loss of what to do, as my manager admitted that he makes “significantly more” than me, not by her choice as she just absorbed him from the marketing manager in a department restructure. 

I know the general responses to these are usually more qualifications, better productivity, etc., but I know for a fact it’s neither of these things—he has less experience than me and is visibly lazy. I write literally all the copy at our company, get work finished way ahead of deadlines, come up with new ideas, and implement new marketing strategies where I can. 

On the other hand, no one knows what he does. Basically Google Ads, but he apparently needs to be babysat when he does it. My manager has noticed that he just sits on social media at his desk. And when he works from home, he’s always green on Teams but takes hours to respond, so she thinks he just plays video games. He’s inattentive to everything at work to the point where his title in his email signature read “coordinator” for over a year—and we all thought he was because of this—until our department manager clarified that he was actually a specialist. 

My manager told me this basically in confidence and was clearly annoyed about it, but now that I know I’m disgusted. It seems sexist that he was given more money than me for absolutely no reason, but as our job descriptions clearly differ—even though our titles are almost the same—I don’t know that I can do anything. He apparently even makes more than the entire creative team, one of which has been there for 15 years. 

I’ve also been wanting to start writing ad copy for the experience, but that’s one of his tasks and now that my manager has asked me to audit his copy (because it’s riddled with brand errors), I don’t want to knowing this. 

Is there anything I can do except quit? I know leaving after ~2 years is the best way to get a raise anyway, but I’ve been applying to other jobs for a few months and there’s not much out there in my realm right now. Any advice is welcome.",painfor400alex,11,0.7599999904632568,40,1704841942,2024-01-09 23:12:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/192ss4t/found_out_a_male_coworker_on_the_same_level_is/,1,2024
192srfc,The private company I work for just got acquired by a publicly owned company. Anyone been through something similar?,"If so, what was your experience? 

Currently my company has an extremely solid work culture that’s centered around their main mission to help others. I’m nervous that public shareholders will twist this in favor of profit. Not that profit wasn’t a company goal previously, but it definitely didn’t have as much focus. We were less concerned about money rather than making the best products we could. Overall people were motivated because they weren’t just money puppets. I fear that going public will make us just that..

We also have some of the best benefits I’ve heard of and unfortunately the company we’re being acquired by does not have a good benefits reputation. 

Just nervous for the future because up until this point, this was my dream company to work for.

Also for context, I would say overall we’ve been doing well as a company & we aren’t being sold as a last ditch effort to turn things around.

192rkjb,IT career advice. Help!,"
I need advice. 
I’m 28, UK, M. I have a Bachelors degree in Computing & Business. 

I have 6 months PT Web Dev experience (6 month contract)

I have two years Customer Support at a SaaS company. (Current role)

I know the basics of front end development. And obviously have worked with Atlassian and have some experience with technical queries. 

I’ve hit a wall and feel like I’m stuck in this position now, what advice could you give me to proceed? I tried to get hired as a Developer, put a solid year into self learning FE dev ie JS HTML CSS BOOTSTRAP etc. I gave up on that after many failed job interviews. (Im talking two years of trying)

My heart just isn’t in software development anymore, I can’t bear the thought of retrying in that field.  It’s just too saturated. 

I was thinking of a Data role eg Analyst. To do this I could complete a Udemy course and also enrol myself in a PT masters in Data. That career path would be data analyst > data scientist 

Im just hesitant to commit to all the studying again and then find it overly saturated like dev was. At the same time I’m really at my last will with the CS role I’m currently in. I feel like I earn next to nothing (sub 30k). 

What advice could you give me? Any would help. Should I commit to data analyst positions and invest in the masters?

Is there another IT career path you could recommend? I see some people suggest systems admin - isn’t that a glorified support role? What is the salary difference/ what do I need to learn?

Is there anything else aside from Data or systems admin that you think I may be able to transition into? (NOT development) 

I basically just need advice on what to learn, timeframes, and salary expectations.

192qxgt,Medical Device Sales Challenges,"Hey Reddit. I (27F) have been in Med Device Sales since I graduated from college in 2020.

It makes me so sad because I do want to work hard, but I don’t even know where to start. I’ve tried bringing this up to my RM nad colleagues to get a feel for what the “norm” is/how busy are people? Like is everyone truly out making 5+ calls a day everyday? Or do people make a call here and there but mostly chill at home and shoot off some emails? It’s a hard thing to ask because I don’t want anyone to know that my days aren’t super productive.

What can I do in 3-4 months that will change the course of my life? Maybe sooner than that.

I have a few things to consider but my immediate options are Surgical Tech, IT, Skilled Trades, and LPN. Maybe there are more lucrative (or just as worthwhile) opportunities I haven’t considered.

If anyone knows of any other options that would allow me to go to school at least Part time and earn enough income to equal roughly $3200 monthly, I’m all ears.

192q89l,My mom is ‘sick’ & needs a new career path,"My mom is 56. This past year there has unfortunately & tragically been discovered a Cavernous Malformation in her brain. Recently, it has started to show side effects such as severe headaches, blurry vision, feeling weak, and having trouble with her memory (she told me mainly short term memory). And doctors say there is a likelihood she will have a seizure or seizures. She is trying to apply for disability. 

Because of these symptoms she has recently had to stop working her job. My mom has years & years of experience in sales & managing big accounts. Mainly in the floral industry. She is such a hard worker & very intelligent. There was a time she was making good money. She has supported my brothers & I until we all graduated high school, virtually on her own. 

She lives in the house we (my mom, 2 brothers, & I) grew up in Miami. She definitely can’t afford to maintain paying the house. She is the original owner of the house since it was built in 99’. And i think it would be extremely devastating if she had to sell/move. That’s her home, that’s our home. She has fought tooth & nail & overcome MANY difficulties over the years to keep that house & always landed back on her feet. But, times are getting harder. 

In the last couple years she’s been laid off of several jobs. And can’t find a steady & well paying job. She desperately needs insurance. I believe that is the main focus because the medical bills are going to be crazy. She is putting off important doctor appointments bc she needs insurance & a job.

192oynr,Not Sure What to Go Into Anymore?,"Okay, here is the gist of my situation without getting in too deep. I'm a Hospitality, Restaurant, and Tourism Management major with an emphasis in Event Planning and Lodging. The lodging part was just to complete my degree requirements, but I do like the event planning side of things and have SOME experience in it. I've realized after trying to look into jobs that my degree is practically useless, and entry-level positions pay practically nothing because you can go into them without a degree. I'm not going to go into how I even ended up in this degree, but know that it wasn't my first choice, and I was incredibly rushed by my dad to just make a decision. He played a very big role in getting me into this terrible position. 

So now I'll have to pay around $1800 a month starting either this month or next month, and if I go directly into my degree field in an entry-level position, I'll maybe make $15 an hour, which will be about $2000 a month. So I'd only be able to make minimum payments on my debts, and I'd have nothing for emergencies or savings. I really want to try to pay off as much of my debt as possible before my loan's deferment period ends, which will be about two years from now. Also, my student loan payments will be about $2000 a month, which I know sounds insanely high, but I'm planning on refinancing before the deferment period, and that should help. I'm just trying to prepare for the worst-case scenario. During that time, I need a job that will help me pay off my other debts, which is about $20,000 (this is inclusive of my car loan, so although $20,000 is a lot, about $12,000 of it is from just my car). 

So here is my question. What is a job I can get RIGHT NOW, with no experience or a degree (yet), that probably sucks but pays a lot because of it? One that will maybe help otherwise qualified applicants get the required certifications, if they do require them? I'm not saying that I want $100,000 annually right off the bat because I know that's super unrealistic, but I feel that maybe $50,000 annually, or around there, is a decent goal to strive for, especially if it's a field that is constantly hiring and, quite frankly, is really hard to be in? And while I'm in this job paying off debt, what is an associate's degree, certificate, or license that I can get that will assist in my employability and help me reach my goal of earning at least $60,000 annually? The only thing I will say is that I don't want to do food service, if I don't have to. 

So, TLDR: What is a job that I can go into right now with no experience or degree (yet) that may suck but pays great that I can do while I work on getting some sort of certificate, associate's, or license to get into something better over the next two years? And what kinds of certificates, licenses, or associate's degrees should I look into to earn while I'm paying off debt? My earning goal is at least $60,000. I'm open to anything but food service. I know this is a challenging question, but I'm desperate and hopeful that someone can recommend something that I haven't thought about.

192nd3g,My Boss got Fired and I am Taking his Responsiblities,"Background: 
I am 22
I have been working as a software quality engineer at a small but quickly growing DoD software contractor for 6 months.

I love my boss
My director loves me
My director does not like my boss

My boss (quality manager) just got fired today by the director of quality (over all 3 locations)

She told me they will not be replacing him and instead I and one other guy will be maintaining quality for this specific location (150 employees).

This means not only will I be doing the software testing I will also be doing hardware inspections and documentation as well as hosting the quality meetings that my boss was doing. 

I am somewhat wise for my age and learn information quickly but this seems like a big step for me.. I mean I am only 22 years old and it is daunting hold the 20+ year engineers accountable and executing corrective actions.

I suppose my question is it valid for me to ask for a significant raise? My boss was making double my salary at the time he got fired.

TLDR;

I inherited the responsibility’s of my bosses job without a title change or pay increase. Am I justified for asking for these things as I have only been working here for 6 months and 22 years old.",itssnickers7,150,0.9300000071525574,166,1704828970,2024-01-09 19:36:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/192nd3g/my_boss_got_fired_and_i_am_taking_his/,1,2024
192mikz,I can't tell if I am in massive burnout or have completely lost passion for the career I was in,"Been working as an engineer for \~10 years. I was honestly very happy with it up until about 5 years into my career. A series of events happened that lead to me getting fired erratically and without any warning whatsoever. I was at lunch and just get spammed with emails like ""you've been removed from github"" and ""your email has been deactivated"", just stuff like that. Came back and they had all my stuff in a box and said ""get out"" basically. The reason they stated was because they thought I was looking for other jobs.  
Then I started a new job at a company that I felt was... not good. Like... REALLY not good. I worked with a bunch of junior engineers, and despite them being pretty smart and capable, they were very aggressive and conceited (imo), and kind of in an unmerited way. For example, I recommended we use a specific tool which will decrease the number of bugs, and it does that by highlighting ""potential"" bugs. I'm putting this in layman's terms, but that's the general idea. One of them argued with me saying his code was perfect, so why did the tool say it was wrong? Frankly, the tool was right and he was wrong. There was so much I could improve, but it was always an uphill battle. I had a manager who felt the same.  
I spent so much time bashing my head against a wall with these people, then COVID hit and I just kinda... stopped giving a shit. I didn't bother with improving anything, did the absolute barest of the bare minimum. I got glowing reviews during this time, surprisingly. I was also really, really happy. They wanted us to go back to the office before COVID vaccines even released, which I was not into, so got a new remote job. The company I worked at before recently shut down, and I am not surprised  
This new job was quite nice but felt really... easy. I don't know what it was about it, it was like I could just log on, do all my work easily, without interruption, and without argument, then close my laptop and gladly go about my day. Everyone was great, the lead was incredibly competent, the management was direct and clear, it almost felt too good to be true. The only problem: the pay was mediocre and I live in a very HCOL city (Boston)  
So I got a new job that paid a ton, but there were red flags immediately. In the first month, I was given an assignment, started writing the code for it, only for my boss to yell at me. He told me about how I needed ""process"" and ""communication"", how I should be putting things in spreadsheets and writing slack messages and stuff like that. I got where he was coming from. I tepidly just listened to him and made a spreadsheet, like he said, and organized it my way. He got mad at the way I organized it, jumped on a call with me, and re-organized it in a different way while I watched. I asked if this was some standard, and he said ""this is the only way it can be done""  
I finished all the tasks but man... I felt burned out. The whole process was incredibly tiring and was mostly just negativity. My manager tells me what a shit job I did. I am confused, I say ""but didn't we fix all the bugs on time? 🤨"" and he basically says ""yes but I don't like the way you approached it"". He kept bringing up process, communication, etc. I felt like I disagreed with his general approach, why not just fix the problems instead of talking about fixing them? What do I need to communicate? He started getting really mean during this time, and I mean unprofessional mean. He said he thinks I lied on my resume, that I never worked in engineering before, just things that made me feel like absolute shit all the time. He was not using these as figures of speech, he was serious. He commented on how no one liked me, I don't get along with the team, and I'm lucky he's even giving me a chance here. It was so bad, that when my lease ended, I became terrified of opening a new lease cause I felt like I could be fired on a whim at any moment. I moved in with my parents  
I still work here, but the day to day tasks are so contrary to how I work. It's writing boring, uninteresting documents and have slack conversations with people (who my boss explicitly said don't like me). I occasionally get tickets which are mostly following an instruction guide. I. Am. So. Bored. I feel like I'm having a crisis: if this is what being a high-level engineer is ""supposed"" to be, I don't want to spend the next 20 years of my life doing it. By the time I retire, I'll be bitter and resentful like I already am.  
At this point, it's been so long that I'm not sure if I'm burned out, disillusioned, or need a new career path. I heard this is kinda common with ADHD. What should I do? I don't want to manage people, I don't want to write boring business docs, I want to make cool shit every day",Dreadsin,7,1.0,0,1704826953,2024-01-09 19:02:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/192mikz/i_cant_tell_if_i_am_in_massive_burnout_or_have/,1,2024

I just had a good review with my boss and got a bonus. I know I work hard. But I’m paranoid. 

I was hired to work on our copy but have helped with tons of other stuff, graphic design included. My boss is hard to please and recently interviewed an art director they want to hire. I’m crippled with fear that this new person is going to render me useless. They keep saying I can learn from her but I’m still scared that her coming in means I’ll look bad. For context, I was previously a fashion designer but I recently made a pivot into marketing. Last year I had an emotional breakdown at work at a previous job and I’ve been struggling with my mental health. 

I’ve been talking to my therapist and trying to keep myself calm so that this doesn’t become a self fulfilling prophesy but I can’t get over the idea that this person will come in and think I’m not qualified for this new direction in my career, and that I’ll be pushed out. Additionally, there are projects I told my boss I wanted to work on that they are already talking about the new hire taking on. What do I do?

I know CS is a pretty broad field and (at least from what I’ve seen) you can live a comfortable life. Some background about myself: I graduated last summer with a BA in Health Science/Public Health. I job searched for months and had absolutely no luck in my field, perhaps I wasn’t searching hard enough or didn’t have the right connections. Anyways, 3 months ago I decided that maybe the public health route isn’t for me since I had no luck with job searching, so I set myself up to apply for medical school as a non-traditional applicant (meaning I would take the pre-reqs and MCAT). Now I am realizing medicine isn’t for me. I don’t think being a primary care physician or pediatrician is worth my mental health, just for some job security and $250,000. That’s pretty much my background. I have a minor in Biology which I’m sure isn’t gonna help me in CS at all. Would you guys recommend making the switch over to the CS field? I would love to hear people’s experiences in making a career change to CS and what route they found to be successful for them!

192l2dv,Would it be bad to reach back out to recruiter 2 months after rejection? They said they wanted to get back to me 4-6 months after.,"I got through the final stage interview for a larger engineering company I really want to work at. After an onsite interview for most of the day, it took them a few weeks to get back to me. Of the 4 people on the panel that interviewed me (one on one interviews), 2 wanted to hire me and two were against it at the moment, saying they wanted me to have a little more experience. Eventually, they agreed to reject me for now and get back to me after 4–6 months since it seemed I have been getting great experience at my current role, and overall they felt I might need mentorship somewhere down the line if I joined at that time, a resource which they didn’t have for that engineering team. The day after they told me this, all my programs at work shut down, and I have been unable to secure any work at my current role since then (I promise I’ve been asking for something to do). It has been 2 months since this, no tasks or experience gaining minus what I do in my own time. Would it be a good idea to contact the recruiter that was working with me through the interview process to explain the situation and ask if there is any chance I can explore other roles available?

- the company has nice work-life balance and is definitely smaller (around 60 employees in my city and more in city on the other side of country). Right now, I dont see any cons.

- I have 3 month experience being a junior db admin at the second company and so far I dont enjoy it.

192i7pb,Feel I’m at a liminal juncture and don’t want to squander opportunities..,"By stroke of chance, I ended up in a position networked closely to all the most senior leaders and their biggest organizational decisions. I also know most of the general counsel as well as the CEO through my personal life and dad (all just incredibly lucky circumstance). It’s not lost on me the opportunity and that this position is a “career-maker” in many ways. 

What I’m finding challenging is that the product/process I own is in shambles and has a reputation as such. I’m finding it difficult to row the ship while also being expected to rebuilt it at sea. Most of my interactions with end-users and stakeholders are negative,but also has the counter-benefit of any small thing done is seen as a remarkable achievement. So I’m simultaneously lauded as infallible, while also representing an “organizational turd”. In a weird way, the recognition I’m receiving for the lackluster polish I’m putting on this turd adds to an overwhelming sense of burnout. The pressure of being in the eye of my dad’s coworkers also is fanning the flames. 

Im finding it harder and harder to go into work and take on the challenge. I feel like the ship is going to sink eventually and am terrified to be around when it does (although it is probably the best thing that could happen, though my confidence in being the guy to pick up the pieces is feeble). I’m about to turn thirty and have been thinking about longterm travel for a while (before even getting into this position). I have minimal commitments (no girlfriend, family, or house) and also recognize that I’m the youngest il ever be. My job feels draining and sucks whatever energy I have after the 9-5 to cultivate relationships etc. I’m exploring a middle ground of doing longterm travel and working remote but it might not ultimately be a possibility. 

Can anyone help with some honest perspective on how big either of these opportunities are and frame them in terms of a life well-lived? What is wise to prioritize in this position of life? Whether to double down on a “career making” opportunity or to take some time to live my life and focus on cultivating a better personal life? What is sacrificed in each and gained in either path? What losses have a higher risk of not being able to recoup those losses in taking that path?

192guwg,Advice on how to transition to a quantitative research role?,"Hi Everyone,

I hope you are well!

I am a 26 year old male and I am very interested in becoming a quantitative researcher in the UK. As for my background:

1. Completed a BSc chem degree from warwick in 2019 with a 2.1
2. Completed a Postgraduate certificate in Statistics with a Distinction from sheffield uni
3. Working as a Graduate software engineer since September 2021, specialising frontend development of data dashboards. My team focuses on running A/B tests for our company as well as developing automation tools to support it.
4. Studying a part-time, distance learning MSc statistics qualification from sheffield uni whilst balancing my full-time software job. It's likely I will get a merit qualification (Due to finish in 2025). My dissertation is focused on applying neural networks to machine translation (translating between human languages) using PyTorch.

My education has given me some good R and python skills, and I am hoping to transition to a slightly different role in my team, where I can improve the statistical methodologies and applying some bayesian statistics, as well as writing some python code to get some commercial experience. My question is will I have a good shot applying for graduate quantitative researcher roles after my MSc has finished? Right now, I cannot relocate as I am helping my family financially, but it should be resolved in time for when my Master studies has finished.

If I don't have a good shot, what can I do to improve my chances? I can't study anymore qualifications post-MSc due to cost related reasons but I am happy to do some projects in my own time if that would help!

I am a teacher and doubt I'll be leaving anytime soon. For now, my school, administration and students are fine and the schedule I have gives me the time I need to be a solo mama to my 7 year old. However, I know that I will eventually no longer want to spend time wrangling teens/pre-teens day in and day out ( I teach Middle School Spanish). I want to start prepping now so that when I'm ready to make a move I can do so.  
I'd like to use my summers to start any certificates or additional education I may need to transition later. But I have no idea what I want to do next. Literally, none.  
I currently have a TPT side hustle which funds my savings but I don't think I'd want to do that full time and I need to make sure I have access to employer insurance. I am very interested DEI work, but don't know where that can take me.  
I will likely end up working well in to my 60's (due to some foolish moves in my 20's and an abusive marriage that has removed all desire for a partner moving forward).

192f17o,"I know this sounds horrible, but does anybody else set unrealistic expectations for themselves that make them kind of want to die?","Like I said, I know this is kind of heavy, and I *am* talking to a therapist about this too, but I've had a pretty successful career so far - I'm 33 and have been working for the same company for 10 years. I've been promoted four times and taken 3 laterals with pay bumps. Many people reach out to me on my career path for mentorship and I love helping people. I think I'm generally a good person. However, nothing is enough for me. I never feel like I'm having a big enough impact, and often times when I go home I wish I'd get run over by a car or get sick or die in some unfortunate, unexpected way so that people would mourn and think, ""it's so tragic, he could have done so many great things"" instead of me living long enough for them to be disappointed that I never really did anything. Each year I feel like my achievements are less and less impressive the older I get. This makes is so my accomplishments mean nothing to me, despite praise, and my mistakes (or perceived mistakes) carry WAY too much mental weight. 

I know part of this is a bigger issue I need to keep working through psychologically, but I'm wondering if 1) anyone can relate, and 2) does anybody have any advice for trying to coach yourself to actually recognize your successes, roll with your mistakes, and not hold yourself to impossible standards?

192ez5m,Not Well Liked,"At my old job for a small company, I was always a bit of an outcast. I got the feeling that some of the higher ups did not like me, yet I was tolerated because I was an excellent employee. But on a personal level I just didn't seem to be well-liked. This was expressed mainly in little things, for example, other employees birthday's etcetera, were treated much differently. I chalked it up to 1) being a man, and so my feelings were not held to the same standards of consideration as my female counterparts and 2) the actions of aforementioned higher ups. I started a new job in February at a much larger company and already I am seeing evidence of the same, for example, every employee in my department receives a birthday card, and I did not - again the individual(s) responsible for the purchasing and distribution of this card doesn't seem to like me very much. And at Christmas, the entire team was invited to the bar after work and yet the invitation was not extended to me. Again, the individual(s) who planned it are the same ones who buy and distribute birthday cards. I tried to explain it away as 1) I'm a new employee, and again, a man, 2) perhaps the communication was just poor and I was inadvertently overlooked. Yet the more I think of it, the more of a pattern seems to be emerging. I get the feeling that I'm just not well-liked by certain people, and in both my last job and this one, the ones who are tasked with these matters in particular do not like me. I just think that it's shitty that no one else says anything to them like, why didn't he get a card or not get invited to the bar?

192eron,Disillusioned by my current path. What alternatives could I look at? I feel like a failure.,"Good Morning all. I’m writing this post as I’m honestly burnt out in my field. I have completed both a BSc in Psychology and a MSc in clinical psychology. I've also worked in mental health for around 4 years. I've been currently working as an Assistant Psychologist for a year, which is highly coveted in the field. it’s hard to explain but it’s the go-to job to go down the clinical psychology pathway.

However, I'm becoming quickly disillusioned with the path into clinical psychology and more so by the pay once you're in that position.

 I'm posting here for ideas of alternative careers where I can use skills I’ve acquired through my
experience in the field of mental health. Ideally I want to be paid more than my current band 4 position so aiming for somewhere between 25k -30k with a clear example of job progression as the NHS is lacklustre at this.  Ive built up a lot of transferrable skills such as research, team working, data analysis, lone working, and so on. 

So if you have any suggestions for a possible career change where I can use my degree/ knowledge and acquired skills. So if you have any suggestions for a possible change in career that would be massively appreciated. 
Also- if you’re in the field, this isn’t meant to discourage you. I just don’t think the field aligns with the goals I’ve set out for my career and 
continued development. 🙌

192debr,The Power of Performance Optimization in Your Career Journey,"I hope you're all doing well! I wanted to share some thoughts on a topic that has made a significant impact on my career and personal growth – performance optimization. Whether you're aiming for that promotion at work, looking to stand out in your field, or just striving for personal excellence, optimizing your performance can be a game-changer.  
  
Why does performance optimization matter?  
  
Stand out in the crowd: In today's competitive job market, it's not just about meeting expectations; it's about exceeding them. When you consistently optimize your performance, you stand out as a high-performing individual who adds exceptional value to the team.  
  
Increased productivity: Optimization isn't just about doing more; it's about doing things smarter. By fine-tuning your processes and workflows, you can achieve more in less time, demonstrating your efficiency and effectiveness to both colleagues and superiors.  
  
Build a stellar reputation: Word of mouth travels fast, especially in professional circles. When you consistently deliver outstanding results, your reputation as a reliable and competent professional will precede you, opening up doors to new opportunities.

How can you optimize your performance?  
  
Set clear goals: Define your short-term and long-term goals. This provides a roadmap for your efforts and helps you stay focused on what truly matters.  
  
Continuous learning: Stay updated on industry trends, acquire new skills, and strive for self-improvement. The more knowledge and skills you possess, the more valuable you become to your employer.  
  
Efficient time management: Identify and eliminate time-wasting activities. Use tools and techniques to prioritize tasks and manage your time effectively.  
  
Seek feedback: Constructive criticism is a powerful tool for improvement. Don't shy away from feedback; embrace it, learn from it, and use it to refine your performance.  
  
Networking: Build meaningful connections both within and outside your organization. Networking opens up opportunities, provides insights, and can be a source of mentorship.  
  
The ripple effect of optimized performance:  
  
Career advancement: When your performance consistently surpasses expectations, you become a prime candidate for promotions and career advancements.  
  
Job security: In times of restructuring or downsizing, high-performing individuals are often the last to be considered for layoffs. Your optimized performance can act as a shield against uncertainties in the job market.  
  
Leveraging opportunities beyond your current role: The skills and habits you develop through performance optimization not only benefit your current role but also position you as a strong candidate for new opportunities within or outside your current organization.  
  
Remember, optimization is a continuous process. It's not about perfection but about progress. Embrace the journey of self-improvement, and you'll find yourself unlocking doors to exciting opportunities you might not have imagined before.  
  
What are your thoughts on performance optimization in the workplace?

Or if I leave it off, will they question why I was unemployed for 6 months?

1926lnx,Not sure about this organization," I recently applied for a job as a youth care specialist and I am nervous about accepting the position. I am coming from a completely different line of work so I am not too sure what to expect.    
I completed two interviews, both of which went well. One over the phone and one in person. The staff I've met seem very friendly.  
I am interested in becoming a behavioral technician and this job sounds like a good way to get some entry level experience but there are some red flags I'm concerned about.  


1. The position is at a mental health facility and it has horrible reviews on Google and on Indeed. I brought this up to the person interviewing me and while she did acknowledge the poor reviews, she insisted that they are mostly from disgruntled former employees and/or former residents and that their current staff is pretty great.

  
2. During the interview I was told I would typically work 4 days a week with two 8 hour shifts and two 12 hour shifts. The pay is dependent on the shift I work, varying by as much as $2 per hour. The person I was interviewing with offered me the job but was vague when I requested more information about pay.

  
3. Mandatory overtime. They told me that not only can I basically work as many hours as I want but there is a ""mandation"" policy where the employee with the least amount of hours on shift will be mandated to work overtime when needed to cover someone else's shift who did not show up.  


Can anyone who has experience in this line of work offer me any advice?

19267s1,I'm stuck on leaving my current job or staying,"I currently work for a state agency. I receive decent benefits. I have union protections. However I HATE working for the state. I am severely underpaid, my opportunities for promotion are limited based off HR's mistake that they claim they can't fix. I do nothing all day at work and I feel unmotivated to want to do better. I hate my job hours. So I put in applications for other departments and agencies. 

Well I didn't know this, it's common practice for managers within agencies to let your current boss know you applied. My boss doesn't want to lose me can offer the same position and slightly better hours. But the workload would not change. One of the main reasons I'm looking to leave.

I finally graduate from College with my Bachelors in Art in the Spring of 2024. I never needed a degree before and was a licensed Realtor in San Antonio until COVID hit. Since 2021 I’ve been teaching visual arts and enjoy teaching students about Street Art & Graffiti & how to integrate technology into their art (Laser cutters, drawing programs, AI). I have also been asked to teach as a full time visual arts teacher for an Academy (K-8)this next school year but haven’t gotten any official paperwork stating that it’s a done deal. I just feel so lost in what my next move should be. Should I focus on my own fine art? Should I focus on Public art proposals? Should I look for Teaching Artist positions in other parts of the country? Should I apply for Artist In Residency programs for families? I still don’t have my teaching cert and will be going through District of Innovation to be a full time teacher as I get my alt cert.

1925wuh,Personal LOA (non-medical) of 2-4 months for unusual reason - how to best broach topic?,"I'm a software developer with around an 8 year tenure at my corporate company (all of my experience is at this one company). For a good amount of time, I've been preparing to apply for Italian citizenship via ancestry, and I'm just about ready to carry out the process in Italy, which in my case will likely have a duration of 2-4 months. I'll be leaving to start this around late February of this year.

How on earth do I best broach this topic? Should I withhold information, or present the truth entirely as it is, knowing that merely the idea of obtaining a dual citizenship should scare an American company away? (Suffice to say, my job can only be done within the US)  Should I perhaps even just say it's for extended traveling, and not specify the exact reason?

My company offers a potential maximum duration on the personal LOA of 4 months, so it at least fits within that timeframe. That said, I just can't imagine this going over well with my manager, who has been investing in me for some time now. Even still, I'm prepared to walk if they say no, and I have the financial means to do so. I'd certainly prioritize applying for jobs during my stay in Italy while I carry out the citizenship process, in that case.

All in all, I don't mind this job. I like the management. It's a good company. But as I said, I am prepared to walk, as this citizenship process is something I've wanted to do for some time. Still, I would rather not burn any bridges by presenting all of this crassly.",livsjollyranchers,1,1.0,1,1704774199,2024-01-09 04:23:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1925wuh/personal_loa_nonmedical_of_24_months_for_unusual/,1,2024

1924sz7,What should I do about my job?,"Give you a warning that ill be jumping around with this so apologies in advance. Let me start off by saying I worked in retail for years. Was a manager, got real tired of that work culture so decided to leave. Got another job, didn't care for it and ended up at another job as a courier but it's a bit more than that but I'll get to that. 
 
When I started in 2022 it was halfway through the year and started out making $18. At the beginning of 2023 i got a 30 cent raise. Now when I first came in they said I would do courier stuff and also help around the office which is like cleaning bathrooms, making sure company vehicles are clean, doing yard work. No actual job title. Work 8am to 4pm plus overtime if needed. It's definitely a laid back job for the most part. That is until the guy who owns the company is in town for 6 months of the year. When he is there, its extra work that i was not told in advance that i would be doing like cleaning his windows in his house, cleaning his cars, ect. Basically his servants. Had 2 major jobs which one was were we had to seal the back and front lot when not out doing runs. Pretty decent front lot and big back lot. Never did it before and took weeks to do. Even came in on a Sunday (weekends off) to get a part of it done.  The other job was cutting down this long area of bushes filled with poison ivy. Took days and had to wear a hazmat type suit. We also work overtime everyday if needed. In August they asked me if I would be willing to start doing a job starting at 3pm to whenever delivering stuff across some possible sketchy areas. I said no and still ended up having to do it, working till 5 or 6 or even 7 a few days a week. It's not as bad as it was but essentially me and my friend kept that job going till they got more people in to do it. We hated it but was told that it would be worth it next year come pay raise season. 

Welp pay season has come, with all the stuff we put up with last year, and the new jobs we started back in September, I got a 40 cent raise. I'm pretty pissed off about it and am thinking of leaving. I really do like my job, but if I'm doing more and more stuff every year when the big boss comes in to town I honestly don't know if it's worth sticking around for a 40 cent raise. Not only that but we are making quite a bit of money with those new orders we starting doing in September. I wanted a $1.50 raise and I'm not sure if that is unreasonable or not? So can someone help me understand what would be a good raise?

I’ve wanted to do so many healthcare careers since I’ve been in school and out but have been an entrepreneur so far and have not worked any other job at all

I ultimately got my masters at 22 y/o to become a medical writer/get into clinical research

However, I’m considering a more physical/hands on job

I’m wondering with the degrees I have if it would be better to continue my current plan or if MRI/ultrasound/nursing is worth 2 more years of schooling?

I will add I do have student loan debt as it is, maybe $60K plus…

I’m in Az, and I’ve researched MRI Techs made about $84K in 2022 which is good.

I’m also considering nursing in which they made about $86K in 2022.

Any insight on what you would do?

I ultimately want my business to work out in the long term but I need to have job security in the meantime.

Medical writers made about $89K

Ello, I'm 20 yrs old and currently studying cybersecurity/IT in school. I currently work as a CNA and after last week working I really wish to move on with my current job. I have never felt so burned out, so alone, so intimidated, so fearful in all the work I've ever worked at. I find myself every week dreading work that involves helping people, and I always enjoyed helping people.The heavy work, intimidation from coworkers on asking for help, me stressing days before work and during, all of that for 2-3 years has brought me much stress, so much so that I think it has decreased my mental health to not put any effort in school, or my goals and aspirations. I haven't been happy for so long. And I kept myself that way because its manageable with my schedule for school, and it pays well. But I dont know if I can handle it much longer. I recently switched to IT from Nursing as I realized its not how I want to live my life anymore. But in IT the entry level department (ex. helpdesk) is really saturated and loads of places prefer certifications and degrees, and Im currently learning for the ITF and A+ from a program from school (that Im not taking as seriously bc again, crippling mental health).I never want to work in the healthcare field again.

I’d like to not give this individual an increase to help offset this for others for sake of fairness. How can I do this and communicate it to them and come out on the other side as best as possible?

1923rpb,Early fork in the road.. Intuitive CTA or Stryker ASR?,"Hey Everyone,

Just want to start out by saying I’m very grateful for both opportunities! I realize these are both great organizations but any guidance would be helpful as I feel like this decision can change my career trajectory.  For some background info this is my first sales role, 30m and will be getting married this summer. 

I’ve been an ASR with Stryker for 8 months. I throughly enjoy the day to day  (challenges included). The base is about 55k. Gas is not expensed and im driving upward 80 miles a day. The full line rep position will become available in the next year and is 100% commission (uncapped). So if I continue to ‘pay my dues’ that upside is through the roof. There’s also opportunities to pivot within Stryker down the road.

I was approached by a hiring manager at Intuitive for a CTA position. The base is 65k, there’s a fixed gas stipend ($400/month) and OTE is 109k. The role is 24 full months before you can interview for a promotion. After those two year the ceiling of the next role around 130k

I guess my concerns come down to a couple things. 1. Leaving a great company and something that I’m enjoying so soon 2. Risking higher earning potential down the road for higher base pay and OTE short term. 3. Learning a new job and everything that comes with it 4. Long term career opportunities 

Again, first world problem to have, and there doesn’t seem to be a wrong answer but any advice would be greatly appreciated. When I try to look ahead 5-10 years from now It feels like this will be a pivotal decision.

I'm 26 (M). When I was younger all the way up till 24 I quit every job, showed minimal effort, and did not care about being professional and had an attitude when given constructive feedback.

As my age progressed and I started feeling a huge shift in my life. I abandoned this type of behavior and really focused on being a better worker with a strong work ethic.....however

I still seem to never either be a good fit for the job. Or I just am not a good fit in the environment with the people. Most work places want you to act ""like a family"" but really I'm just here to do my job and go home. Doesn't mean I'm a dick I'm just uninterested in mixing in gossip or w.e. I won't blame everything on these jobs as I made a commitment to show up and do what is expected of me. But I make efforts to show up on time, ask questions, make sure I take notes, ask for feedback on what I need improvement on. Keep to myself and be nice to others. And so on and so on.

I've been practicing and working on my weaknesses such as attention to detail, showing up on time, making sure my work gets done in a timely manner. And I came a long way.

But I still just can't seem to GET IT my main background is in customer service representative roles. And I'm GREAT with that. But maybe I should find something that suits me better for someone of my skill sets.

When I graduate, I’ll have a 4 year degree, 1 years of working food service and 4 years retail / sales as a supervisor, $20K in the bank with no debt, and a new car that I fully paid off. I’m very grateful for this, but career wise I feel very behind.

1921eiy,I wonder if this change will divert completely away from the career I'm pursuing,"Career: Theatre, Film, and TV
(Set and Costume assisting/designing)
Location: UK
Age: 21

Hello guys!

I am someone who studied in theatre but alongside worked in theatre and television for about 2/3 years! I have enjoyed the process, despite the long hours and enjoy the collaboration process when creating things for whatever production is on. 

The thing is, it seems like the production is never on and open to everyone as for s while it seems like I've been waiting for something to come up - many calls, cold emails, and texts later, it seems nothing is happening- until December 2023! I enjoyed it, but like all the others, it's only for s few days and back in limbo again. I want something more regular!

Since the end of March, I've been learning Spanish by myself and have been so interested in communication, and connecting with others (typical of someone who loved collaboration, arts and culture!) and was in an scenographic international festival - being able to travel to a different country and connect with do many people was something I loved so much! It was the highlight of my year and felt super privileged! I come from a working class background so never in my dreams of even having the chance to go abroad was ever in my equation!

I saw that countries from the British Society are looking for English Assistants in language, and I thought of applying, but I get concerned, does this throw everything I have been pursuing for away? But at the same time, how can I throw something away if nothing is in my hands right now? I have been working on even a driving licence as my theory is soon - I hope it doesn't push everything away.

I have been wanting to work internationally in the creative industry, but it seems very hard to do that. I thought even being an English tutoring assistant would open me up to a different area and would be sure to have theatre (o teatro), film and TV! As long as I integrate. I'm also still young and have my whole life ahead of me.

The summarise, is it still worth applying, or is this perhaps a moment of completely taking a left in my career?",ChumChums2400,1,1.0,0,1704761344,2024-01-09 00:49:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1921eiy/i_wonder_if_this_change_will_divert_completely/,1,2024
1920yi6,next move / exit strategy,"I'm currently in a job I've been in for 5ish years, in my 40s, big corporate / finance firm in NYC. I'm not on a good path at all at the moment for various reasons, but mainly just burnt out, and pretty much just ready to FIRE / move to a new industry, location, etc.

The thing is, since I am flexible on timing, not especially in a rush, I'm reluctant to just resign and wonder about a better exit strategy. I've been laid off a few times earlier in my career, so if I could do that it would be good (for the severance), but I wonder if they'd be reluctant since I'm over 40 now? The place I work is pretty lenient with low performers, I'm reluctant to ""quiet quit"", and I'm currently being micromanaged by a skip level so it's difficult to just not do much without frequent pestering.

I'm thinking of taking FMLA (I have a few nagging conditions), or asking for a sabbatical/unpaid leave, to buy some extra time on the health plan, or possibly get on the radar of people to lay off at an opportune time?

I also wonder about resigning with very little notice, seeing if they'll try to make some counteroffer to stay around / do some handover, and try to negotiate that into some appealing exit?

I also wonder about being somewhat transparent about this and seeing if I could get a ""buyout"" kind of deal, if I let on that I'm looking for an exit but won't resign and would otherwise quiet quit / chew up a lot of salary and management time on a PIP / risk of a lawsuit if fired for cause, so just meet in the middle, I get severance, make it fast and easy for them and sign an exit agreement?

For what it's worth, I've done my fair share of late nights and overperformed in earlier years, and this is a multibillion dollar corporation, so I don't feel that bad for thinking of milking this situation.",kovanroad,1,1.0,0,1704760112,2024-01-09 00:28:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1920yi6/next_move_exit_strategy/,1,2024

191zjns,Guidance Needed,"Trying to navigate a change in career. I’m 31 and currently work in SaaS as technical support. I’m very thankful for my job but financially, I need and expect more from myself as I’m barely making it by. I do have a degree, but in an unrelated field. Currently weighing out my options, tech sales being one of those. The other options as of now being Cybersecurity/cloud, project management, pursue masters/school using my Biology degree or something else in tech. 

My company has an open BDR role and I’m wondering if this might be a position worth considering. I’ll preface by saying I have no prior sales experience. My main concern is the volatility of sales. I know that sales can be life changing financially but i’m worried that I may end up in the same position a year or two from now trying to figure my career path out due to said volatility/stress. Relatively speaking, I’m still young but am trying not to waste more time than what I already have. I understand that any of the career paths mentioned will be a grind and will be a multi year effort potentially requiring low pay for at least another year. Just trying to assure that I make the best possible decisions and have a somewhat stable career in the future. 

I know this may get asked often but would you recommend taking on tech sales given my position? I’ve encountered many posts on this subreddit that make me question entering this field. Mainly others saying that tech sales is not what It once was due to the market etc. Seems like most are 50/50 on the field in general but I know this very well may be company dependent.

191z55m,Need some advice on career choice,"Hello everybody,  
  
So Im M18, Graduated hs last year, currently taking a gap year. My grades were high 80s and academically, I am mainly engrossed with computer science. However, outside of school I have many other interests. First of all, I have been playing Soccer or Football my entire life and play competitively (Currently on a team) and do have a path to become professional, if I put the work in. Also I am very involved in business. I have ran ecommerce stores, to home service companies and worked many sales positions. I also understand how short life is so I make sure i prepare myself for death, so religion is about an hour or 2 of my day, Im Muslim so that would include revising Quran, praying and learning. Also the reason I like cs is because its very enjoyable for me to code and it is also something I could translate into a business as well, a more less intensive academic choice thats equally translatable to business is trades. However, with how cheap school is going to be for me, it would be silly to waste the opportunity for an undergrad degree.  
  
So this amounts to about 4 major interests. My faith, Computer Science, Soccer, And Business.  
  
To master the latter 3 requires great commitment and dedicated time. I only want to work on something that I plan to master, no mediocre level just for the heck of it.  
  
Through my few years of experiencing these different fields, I understand that my brain simply cannot focus on 3 + 1 major things and improve all equally. Im not a program lol. However, at the end of my life, I would like to have achieved a great deal in each field and I know I will, God Willing.  
  
I personally know I could only persue 2 major things at a time, plus religion for most effective results.  
  
So my question is, now that my gap year is coming to an end and my parents require me to go to university next year for cs, what 2 fields should I involve myself in?  
  
Personally, I think, I should persue Soccer and Business. Mainly because soccer is time sensitive so I have too, also business, because I will be able to make some proper money within a year (It does not require 5+years to make good money in business btw). The money would give me a peace of mind through school which I would go study later on and I would be able to enjoy the material vs panic my grades to pass.  
  
Another option is to do all 3 and study part time but I do not want my head in 3 places even if it is light workload.  
  
If you read this far, I do really appreciate this, I have been curious my whole life and the problem of too many choices only became a reality for me in the past 2 years. I really appreciate any advice.

But, I am worried that company is not as stable and I could be looking at short term gain and am of the view ""the grass isn't always greener"".

This industry that I am in has a lot of people retiring out of it, so the job security is there. Although my worry is that they need to fill up the industry, so I feel bad to leave right after my contract time. I appreciate the time and effort that my boss and coworkers give to me, but I feel bad because I can't help but think it is a waste of their time since I want to leave. They have no idea of my thoughts, but I try to be neutral about my job by not being too excited but at least cordial.  
I am fortunate to not have a lot of debt, just an auto loan, but I am worried to leave considering the job market right now. I also wanted to pursue my own business on the side while having a job that I enjoy full time just to get the bills paid. I feel like this job drains me of my energy where I feel like I have no energy to work on the other things outside of work.  
I also have to commute 3 days out of the week more than (totaling 180 miles) a week. I just want an out honestly, but I know I have to survive a bit of time because I want to have some savings if I do proceed to maneuver elsewhere.

At my first firm I started as an intern, then after 5 months joined FT for 2.5 years in a junior position. At my current firm, I was in another junior position for 2.5 years, then have been licensed for the last 1.5+ years (title change upon receiving licensure). I directly discussed how long I've been licensed with the interviewer, and listed the role and function for each project I mentioned in my resume accurately. The dates of employment are correct.

My LinkedIn gives the positions and dates of title change, where I am connected to the interviewer and the recruiter who originally contacted me; it's been about 2 months since starting this process.

Should I reach out to correct this on my resume, or just go through the background check as is? Or redact the acceptance of the offer?

191wxsr,Offered Graduate Position not sure if I should accept or not,"Hi all,  


I  24(M)am originally from Greece and I have been in the UK for the past 6 months working in an F1 team as a student placement:  


I recently requested to renew my contract and get a junior position with them. Because my deparment is hiring 4 new student placments and 3 graduates and from what another senior member told me the graduate applicants were pretty average, the head of my department decided to offer me a graduate position instead.   


This would mean 35k GBP + 10k-15k bonues in salary and a 2 years fixed contract. The salary seems to be definetly good I am not going to lie.

For him it definetly a win-win;he is happy with my peformance, I have a proven track record in the company and very good qualifications. For me on the other hand I feel like it would be a compromise.  


I say it's a compromise because as of now:  


1. I have 3 years of full-time working experience + this year of student placement(total of 4 years when I renew my contract)
2. I have graduated as an Electrical Engineer from the top university of the country as top of my class(while also working full time for 3/5 years, yes I had to stay awake till 4AM to study then wake up at 7AM to go to work)

Again, this offer is great and I am considering it but I am also coscious of the fact that I might be compromising by accepting it as I feel overqualifed for it and also my hands would be tied in a 2 years contract with 6 months period of notice...  


Another reason I am skeptical when it comes to accepting is that during this conversation and the subsequent offer my credentials, my achievements, my abilities and my knowledge were dismissed as inconsequential in a rather uncalled for manner which made me realize I might not be valued at all.   


I have to give an answer tomorrow afternoon, I would really value your feedback and help in deciding what to do. Unfortunately I don't have any friend or family who can advice me in this situation.  


Thank you,

Well, now I’m at a bar and I’m working with two waitresses who have a history of getting bad reviews and they constantly try to make me second guess myself, etc. They’ve had drama with pretty much everyone. Anyway, one of them is attractive, and in the month or so we’ve spoken she’s caught me looking at her once or twice and confronted me about it so I stopped cold. Have made sure not to look at her again. The thing is, it’s still very awkward between us and I feel like I constantly have to walk on egg shells around her. she still makes a lot of complaints, always checks if I say “You’re welcome” or “Please” and then will correct me if I don’t- the thing is, it’s to almost everything. She also tells me basic things that I learned ages ago…and now she’s saying she doesn’t want to work at the establishment anymore and that the pay is garbage…this was an hour after she had got in a circle with me and a few others after I gave some chocolate out and she said “let’s all get along this year. Good vibes only”. 30 minutes later she gets in a fight with the bartender about how bad the pay has been lately and then he says “Then quit”. Then she starts saying that she has had to go to the hospital for stress for because of all of us. She walked out, then the next day said it was her last day to him and walked out 2 hours early, but it seems like she was baiting him. 

Idk, it’s really giving me flashbacks to the woman who accused me of stuff in college and I am constantly thinking, “What if she makes a false accusation against me and no one believes me?”…it’s not good.

191wasa,Job seeking Rant,"
I need to rant. I’ve been unemployed and actively job searching for the last 5 months and haven’t had a single offer. I’ve had interviews, even second and third interviews, and then nothing. I know the holidays slows everything down but even still. 

On top of that, I’m getting desperate and have started expanding my search. I’ve applied for receptionist positions, call centers, even serving gigs (my worst nightmare) and have not gotten a single call. 

And can we talk about how many degree requiring jobs are paying less than $20/hr???

I feel like life is a scam. I’m working part time and picking up any extra little gig I can. But this just feels like apocalyptic. Even if I got a call for one of those jobs paying $13-$18/hr I wouldn’t be able to pay all my bills (single parent). I mean how does that make sense? That’s saying that we don’t actually deserve to be able to afford to live. Like “sure here’s a job…wait you want a livable wage? Ok calm down you’re not that valuable. How about you pull up your bootstraps and get a second job. Don’t be greedy now.”

This job will look great on my resume. I want to be in both marketing and events industry and this would help me open up more opportunities. I spoke with my mentor and he said that it might be a bad idea to get into a contracted hourly position because what if they don’t hire me after a year- I would just be out of job.

191vlbg,Can’t Afford My Job,"Context: I graduated with a bachelor’s of arts this past spring. I attended a public Ivy that cost me a lot of money. My parents took out loans for all of my siblings, and I took the responsibility for all of my own. I did not get any scholarships (despite applying). 

My degree is art focused. I’ve managed to get a job that I really enjoy with a company I’ve worked at for about 1.5 years. However, when I interviewed, I was told I would achieve an hourly of about $19.5 after two months. It’s been 3, and I was just told I’d be bumped to $17.5. This has not begun yet. I am currently making $15.

I did not receive that promise in writing. I did not speak up for myself during my review. I genuinely cannot afford what I am being paid, as my student loans are crippling me. On top of that, I have a sum of medical debt and weak credit history. I cannot refinance, even with a cosigner. 

As I said before, I really like this job. I am being paid a salary based on 40 hours a week. However, I have to drive large distances frequently but do not receive mileage compensation. I often work more than 40 hours. I feel I am working my hardest I can, but still failing to get by.

This is a new role for the company. They have a various reasons as to why they aren’t paying me more, but I believe it is because they think I will accept it - as I have.

I don’t know how to approach this situation. On one hand, I am young and new to the industry. I see where they are coming from. It leads me to fear that I have no options otherwise.

On the otherhand, I have been working various jobs part and full time since I was 14. I made more money as a retail manager, but not much more, and I hated that job. I know they can afford to pay me more, but I am at a loss as to how to appropriately attend to this issue. Any advice is appreciated, but please be kind. I am a bit emotional at the moment trying to figure out how to make it.",ApartSwim6439,1,0.5,4,1704746918,2024-01-08 20:48:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/191vlbg/cant_afford_my_job/,1,2024

The issue: 

My title is Shop Manager for a local electrical contractor. My duties vary wildly from site work, unofficial electrical work/assistant to journeyman electricians when no apprentices are available, to inventory and fleet maintenance. Being a small shop there is no position for me to advance to at the moment so I am looking to move on.

My title and job history both on paper look very…unappealing to employers I believe. Shop manager, warehouse manager, commercial auto part manager etc. These positions all look unskilled on paper and aren’t worth much in the current job market. Every job opening I look for which i am “qualified” pay substantially less and offer less benefits that I currently enjoy.

How can I spruce up my resume or make myself more appealing to prospective employers without a significant time or money sink into further education? Or, what would be a decent career path to pursue to bring myself out of the lower management quagmire? 

I am not opposed to further education by any means. In fact I am currently looking into classes to better myself.

191u9bn,(21M) I Want to Get Out of My Current Job,"I’m an accounting student who’s just on the cusp of beginning the new semester on an excellent foot. I’m looking forward to a lot - except the current job I’m working.

I’m a tax preparer working for a tax service (not a CPA firm) on the eve of tax season taking off full-swing, and holy crap I didn’t realize how bad this would suck. The company is predatory, and I basically have to screw people over to make a decent buck. That, and the clientele… listen, I worked retail for years. This was supposed to be my halfway point between retail and white collar. Seeing as how I HAVE to work to get by, I thought this would be a good next step for making my hope of working as a white collar professional happen. Yeah, I realize it’s not glamorous or respectable, really, but I really thought that this would at least help me in the way of building up a good resume. Besides - it’s just seasonal work, and they’re flexible with my school schedule - so what was the harm? 

The harm is that these places are located in the seediest possible locations, and - like I was saying - I worked years of retail, so I thought I was immune to deranged customers. I’m only two months in, and I’m already fed up. I can’t deal with this. I can’t stomach the way this company basically robs its clientele. In some cases, it’s truly heartbreaking, because the people coming in here are already on shaky footing financially, and they put all their hopes on a generous refund - only to find that they won’t be getting it, and in fact with the monstrously exorbitant fees, they walk out of here poorer than they were before. 

I could sit here complaining all day, but the point is this: I’ve decided I want out. Maybe not immediately, but it needs to happen. My question is - what do you suggest I do? What kind of job do I shoot for? I’m open to hearing any piece of advice, I just can’t quit and walk out of here without something else lined up",Relative-Spinach-636,1,1.0,0,1704743774,2024-01-08 19:56:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/191u9bn/21m_i_want_to_get_out_of_my_current_job/,1,2024

191t9a1,Bridge burned?,"TLDR: if I accept a job offer, but then later retract because my employer countered, can I reach back out for another future opportunity? 

I recently interviewed and was offered a position which I accepted. A week into my two week notice, my current employer countered offering me higher pay and a growth opportunity to stay which was the reason I was looking in the first place was for a growth opportunity.

I ultimately decided to stay with my current employer because I have the benefit of WFH which is essentially unheard of in this industry. The person who would’ve been my manager with the new company was disappointed but said she understood, assured me that no bridges were burned. When I asked if I in the future I was looking for a change, if I could give her a call and she said of course.

Well, hi, I now want to leave my current employer. They’ve always treated me fairly well but the last year has been rough. Most recently, I was given a significantly less Christmas bonus than my counter part which I realize isn’t a guarantee or whatnot, but when asked about it I was told that it because I was on maternity leave this year. For context, when I returned from maternity leave, none of my workload was completed and I spent six months getting caught back up. 

Do you think I really could call back that other manager and let her know I’d want to come and work with her if she had a good opportunity? Or, was she just being nice in saying that? I know they are still hiring for the position I had accepted, but obviously don’t feel I could just call and saying “just kidding, take me back!”",RonniRasta,1,1.0,2,1704741345,2024-01-08 19:15:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/191t9a1/bridge_burned/,1,2024
191szrf,WFH when rest of team returns to office,"I started my current job the same week my employer sent everyone to work remotely due to covid. My manager actually had to call me the Friday prior to tell me they were shipping my laptop. 

When the office first opened back up early summer 2021, I was one of the only people to go in at all and it didn't appear that things would change any time soon.  My husband and I decided to move back to near family after a coworker of mine who relocated out of state was promoted to a management position in the fall of 2021. 

Now they are asking anyone who is local to return to the office at least 3 days a week (tracking attendance using badges). This goes into effect in a little over a month. Half my team is local and half are out of state. 

I just returned from a 4.5 month maternity leave right before Thanksgiving. The projects assigned to me are low priority and technically I need to wait for the project manager to kick them off but still waiting. I've asked for other work as I think even what was assigned will leave me with bandwidth and am told there are requests but they're not sure what they want to support yet. 

I've always gotten very favorable reviews in my time at the company and don't think my manager is just blowing hot air. I do wonder though how sustainable this job really is as more people are in the office. I've already started looking around and have some interviews set up but I was hoping to have the ability to be selective with my current job to fall back on.

191smkf,How soon is too soon to leave a new job?,"I just recently moved cities, and started a new job. I love my new city, but I almost immediately recognized that this job is simply not a good fit for me.

I have been in my field for 6.5 years, and was at the same company for most of my work experience.  My last company was extremely collaborative and energetic, and I was in a very design-focused position.

I have been at this new company for about 3 months. I am doing well at this job but, honestly, I’m a little over-qualified, and It was immediately pretty clear that they not only misrepresented the position, but the company’s structure as a whole. I feel like that was easy to do, as my interviews were remote. There is no collaboration here, as one talks to each other all day, AT ALL, and design opportunities are apparently not given to staff. Their hybrid work policy was also revoked almost immediately after I joined, and that was a huge factor in my decision between two offers.

However, I AM getting a much, much better work/life balance at this firm than I was before. No more 60-hour weeks with unpaid overtime.  That I LOVE.

I am starting to think that I want to leave. I don’t want to seem like a “job hopper”, which is what I’ve been told I’ll be if I leave, but it was outlined very clearly that I have a 3 month “probationary period” at the start of employment here, in which they can decide that I’m not a good fit… why would it be considered “job hopping” if I left willingly after 3 months?

Another company that I was looking at during my Initial search, but had no openings at the time, is now hiring at my level… I am debating sending them my portfolio, just to see.

Basically, if I leave this soon, how bad would it look on my resume? 😅 How long should I stay to avoid looking like a job-hopper?

191s7m3,Turning 40. 3 interests/paths,"\*\* just finished writing all this. Don't read if you don't want to read my current life story. I think I mainly wanted to vent it, it helps just to have my thoughts in writing.  Looking back on this, other than lovely redit people, who can I turn for help in this. I feel like I need to do something for my mental health.\*\*

&#x200B;

Turning 40 so I think that is also weighing on me. I don't think of 40 as being old but it is still a milestone.

I don't really have any regrets as of now but I seem to be surrounded by more and more well educated people and I feel a little jealous. A little.. I know I have had a fun life so far and I always cringed when I thought about having to decide on one career.

I am college educated. Did my 4 years. Graduated in General Studies. 

I'm fortunate that I have a good living situation. Married and no kids. I live in a good place thanks to family( i still pay bills/taxes/fees and stress a bit over $$$- but I am fortunate).

So the 3 areas that I could go down

Digital Marketing/Coding/Drafting

**Digital Marketing**(digital ads)- This one I have the most experience in. I took a few college classes, a few online classes, certificates. I had a very fun internship. Got a taste of working remote/hybrid. I also did a major job hunt where I went through many many interviews with a sense of optimism for so long. I got far in these interviews as well. Nothing. I also worked full time(Starbucks) and went through major life changes during all this(Covid/Dad died/mom sick). 

Once my mom got better and I felt like my personal life got easier I quit my full time job and told myself I will have fun for a few weeks and then start applying again. Double down on it.  During my fun time (and it was so much fun) I ran into an old boss and he offered me a website job. A low stress M-f 9-5 job. SO freaking happy in the beginning. Decided to use it to my advantage and join an online coding class with $$$ from mom(i always pay her back). 

**Coding**\- I have been interested in coding before my digital marketing adventure. I was hoping to use digital marketing to break into tech and somehow get more into coding. Everything before signing up for my online classes has been self taught and free. What I paid  for were classes, internships, support and  a lot of people have found jobs after this course. And yes I think its worth it for the amount of support. But I'm stalling badly. And when I hear about people talk about the tech industry I get depressed. People getting let go. AI taking over. Women having issues in tech. It just isn't looking so positive.  And I have so much more to learn.. and the competition.. I also don't live in a heavy tech area

**CAD**(drafting)- Benefit of this one. I think I would like the work. My husband is a civil engineer and this is the only option he seems to be really encouraging me to go into. Not that he's not supportive of my other endeavors. It would also be something I could go take a few courses in in an in person class. Something that i haven't gone to in a bit. And if he decides to work for himself, he has me as a drafter. I could get a certificate with in a year from an accredited college. Both of my parents were engineers and I still have dads old drafting table(more sentimental than useful)

Current job- I love the schedule but it's not social or challenging at all! Loved it at first but now no stimulation. That's what is getting me. I'm bored, frustrated, over thinking. Its an antique business. I post things to the website. I have no interest in being a sales person and I don't think they are interested in me becoming one. Boss knows I'm interested in tech and supportive of me moving on when the time comes.

Oh my brain... I'm having really bad anxiety. Some about this. Some about $$$, family(worried about mom), surrounded by a lot of death last year so death and age are on my brain. And my poor, supportive husband has seen me break down a few times recently. I've been a little bitchy with all this on my mind. But he has been kind to me.

I want to take time off of work to figure all of this out. I'm fortunate but not that fortunate. I have savings. I may still take some time off again but I need to figure out a plan before I take off.

My background: Graduated in General Studies in 2008. I've been a barista for most of my life. Worked for marriott for 9 years. No kids and plan on keeping it that way. Married to Civil engineer(both of my parents were engineers). Never wanted to be just one thing. I like variety. I'm social. No real deep mental health issues other than some anxiety I feel everyone goes through. But I'm really stuck right now.         Talking to my doctor about Adderall(i have tried it recently). He sounds like he is for it but we are going to talk more on it.  After looking into it and asking around it seems to have helped the majority of ppl in my life, but a few have been addicted and quit, so I can see both sides.",LongjumpingSkirt3089,1,1.0,1,1704738839,2024-01-08 18:33:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/191s7m3/turning_40_3_interestspaths/,1,2024

191rbrn,Would like to just talk out my future career path and get some advice,"I am 25 from Europe, did a BS in CS, worked for 6 months, increasingly loathed my work, in particular working with a computer and mostly WFH, until I started hating it especially at a point where I began having a worse relationship with my coworkers. Mind you, I've worked other jobs before, such as in electronics retail, but even with bad relationships there I would still actually love the job. Yes, I loved electronics retail and pretty much hate software engineering.

When I lost my job in electronics retail (due to bankruptcy) I thought that it would be cool to work with state-of-the-art audio products. This really resonated with my personality and felt like a huge potential. However I never got any guidance on how to get to that point, what to study, and I am entirely to blame for that as I took zero initiative. 

Now, however, I looked into studying physics for a long time. But I eventually decided against it, considering it a huge money sink for something that's only like decently close to my personal interest, and it seemed mad to run away from excellent money in software engineering to do something that I may not even like.

I'm at this really weird point now, and I'm not asking for sympathy; I made good money as software engineer and I feel I could reasonably easily get back into that work to make money for a short amount of time if I ever have a money crisis. But with my current savings, I feel like starting over from absolute scratch and find an occupation that drives me.

What I would call 100% interests of mine are the following:

* **football (soccer);** absolutely everything surrounding it; I would possibly have been a footballer if not for some serious health issues (cliche as that sounds, and you wouldn't hear this from me in real life, but let me possibly exaggerate a bit online)
* **music;** I play drums but as a beginner, I'd say I'm like 2-5 years of practice away from being able to do gigs, and I also did music production in mostly electronic music like EDM, lofi-house and rap beats
* **politics & philosophy;** I'm not reading a lot of books each year, but when I do, it's usually with a political and/or philosophic focus. I am pretty into ideology and my favorite memory of university (for my CS BS, remember!) was writing a paper on socialism, Ho Chi Minh, Stalin and Mao, for an elective. History, English and Spanish were my favorite non-sports classes in high school and middle school

Something like 75% interests are:

* **languages;** I started learning a lot of languages at varying levels from high school on wards, my BS had a minor in English alongside CS, as part of my work as software engineer I moved to a new country and learned the language at a conversational level after less than 6 months (Italian)
* **movies/series/videos;** this includes also video editing although I never tried making a movie myself. I got into high quality movies and series from young age, and clipped ""montages"" of video game content when I was in middle school, the artistic aspect was very cool to me
* **other sports and exercise;** again, if it weren't for my health issues I could have been more into other sports and exercise, but I still love going for runs, working out, playing tennis and such
* **writing;** this could possibly be more than 75%. I am very into writing long texts, I wrote quasi-philosophic texts during my BS, was especially inspired after our mandatory ""intro philosophy"" course. I tried writing a few pages for a (science) fiction book, various ideas, but ultimately didn't pursue that further. Not for lack of interest, but lack of time and effort in combination with CS studies and everything else in life.

I used to be *very* into video games, and played a lot of CS:GO in particular, but I have phased that out completely in my life and it has helped me tremendously. I mention this because video game development and just being surrounded by video games in general was a huge reason for why I managed to get through my CS degree. However, I would *not* like to do *anything* with video games. I don't think I am particularly amazing at creating them, not the world's best at (competitively) playing them, but I would like to play them casually every now and then, but without risk of addiction.

Currently, I have an offer for a master program in CS lined up. But the closer I get to it, the more I push it away. I already delayed it for 6 months, and I am strongly considering doing so again. I believe I genuinely don't give a fuck about CS, and it's all about money, and that I won't be any more happy with any job I could currently get as a software engineer as opposed to what I could get after a master, hell, even PhD.

It is so fucking hard to navigate post-graduation, my bias towards continuing in science is really strong because it is socioeconomically rewarding, but my version of hell would be to be a software engineer for the next 10 years of my life. I need to spend my time here on Earth much more productively than that.

Do you have any advice for what I can pursue? Ultimately this feels like yet another shot in the dark, but maybe someone can relate to me somewhat.",spitefulspine,2,1.0,2,1704736705,2024-01-08 17:58:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/191rbrn/would_like_to_just_talk_out_my_future_career_path/,1,2024

So i figured maybe I would prefer applied science, which is why I went into compiter engineering, which I am currently doing. 
After one semester, I realize that I don't belong in this domain because I find it way too hard for me. I have 0 clue what to do in my life. Everyone is always telling me that I should study into something that I like, but I find it difficult to name my interests. I can't seem for the life of me to find my interests, which is why I dont know in what to study for university.

I was hired and took a new role under the guise that we would be in the office 2 days a week and that it was a very flexible environment. In fact, I was fully remote for the first few months before I relocated to the place that the job is located. Yes, they paid for this move. I understand that I might be being a bit dramatic, but they're now requiring 3 full days in the office and I'm not happy about it. A big part of the reason I took this job was because of the flexibility and frankly, I don't enjoy being in the office. It's a dreary environment, I don't work well, and upper management is constantly keeping us for ""5 minute"" meetings that go well past EOD.

191o9uj,Possible next step advice. What jobs/careers would suit me?,"Hi all. Just looking a bit of career advice as I am currently a bit lost and not entirely sure what direction to go in next. Hoping that someone may be able to point me in the direction of something I haven't thought of before.

I'm a 30 year old man, with an undergraduate in Biology and a Masters Degree in Evolutionary Biology. I had previously thought I may have gone down the Academia route (PhD, Postdoc,etc) but in the end didn't think I was cut out for it. In the first few years after finishing my MSc, I worked as a research assistant/technician on various projects, firstly in a Genetics laboratory and then in a Institute of Agricultural Sciences. Here I worked on various projects looking at Carbon capture, Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and environmental pollution. These jobs involved a mixture of lab work and fieldwork experiments. 

Since 2021, I have been working for a government organisation in the Environmental Conservation Sector. Although I am passionate about Conservation in general, the job was really bringing me down in terms of the red tape holding us back and just constantly hearing about the state of the environment haha. I ended up being a bit of a paper pusher in a job which wasn't very stimulating. I am lucky in that I am able to take a career break from this and am now open to work in a number of fields. The problem is I have no real idea what I want to do and am not sure how my skills (or lack thereof) transfer into other fields. I did really enjoy working in research environments and love doing hands on work, in a field or laboratory, but as my career so far has been quite varied I'm not sure I will be able to break back into this field.

Skill wise I am technically competent and good with machinery, lab equipment etc, am good with my hands and at troubleshooting and fixing things. I also have lots of laboratory specific skills but I guess these don't transfer to well to other fields. Computer wise I am no expert but am am competent and know limited coding having used R and python during my studies and while as a research assistant. As I have said I love working on my feet and interacting with people. I am not one for working from home or at a computer all day although happy with both when it requires it. (just not 5 days a week). Love working outside as well.

I'm not mad keen for a really well paying job or anything. Overall I would say I just want a job which challenges me, keeps me busy and means I can live relatively comfortably. I admit this isn't a very specific post but would be grateful if anyone could give any advice. 

Some potential thoughts I've had

\-teaching or tutoring

\- something in the medical profession? Like a technician or something

\-possibly work for a conservation NGO- although hard to get into.

Grateful for any advice and apologies for the rambling post.",variousbeansizes,1,1.0,0,1704729157,2024-01-08 15:52:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/191o9uj/possible_next_step_advice_what_jobscareers_would/,1,2024

191nru6,What would you advice me in this situation ?,"Hello,

I am seeking advice regarding my future education and career path. I am 20 years old and currently a freshman studying software engineering at university. We are in the middle of our exam session, and while I have passed most of my exams, I am struggling with one particular interim assessment. This is my third attempt, and my professor has indicated that I cannot proceed to the final exam unless I pass this interim assessment. Failing to pass will result in academic debt and the need to pay for my education.

The advice I need for you, is which decision would be the ""best"" in your opinion:
I could try once more to pass this interim assessment. Success would allow me to continue with my current program without financial penalty.
Another option is to take an ""academic vacation"" and work in IT company as a support until the summer. Next year, I could potentially enroll in a college to study software engineering instead of returning to the university.
Alternatively, I could take an academic vacation and, starting next autumn, enroll in an extended software engineering program. This would involve part-time work in an IT company while studying, but it would extend the time to earn my bachelor's degree to six years.

I am unsure which path to choose and would appreciate advice.",Goblinas123,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1704727838,2024-01-08 15:30:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/191nru6/what_would_you_advice_me_in_this_situation/,1,2024

191llby,New career with a Computer Science degree and interest in how things work,"Hey,

So I work as a programmer, but it really doesn't suit me: I hate fixing bugs, I can't concentrate for a long time (I have ADHD), it's too slow, and I don't enjoy thinking too much (I am not into puzzles). I liked the university projects, though; they were small and well-specified. You only had to write them once and not maintain them later, but the reality is that the real world is never like that.  
What I like is:  
\- Learning how machines work  
\- Speaking with others  
\- Moving around in the city  
\- Helping others  
\- Learn something new.  
I made some upgrades in my home this past year:  
\- I really enjoyed installing the new wires, connectors, switches, and lamps.  
\- I fixed my convector. As I did, I learned how it works (don't worry, I had an expert check the result).  
For a year, I've been working as a mobile technician for two days a week:  
\- I really enjoy being able to do something with my hands; it calms my hyperactivity.  
\- While working, I have good company. I really like my coworkers. I dislike programming alone at home (but I felt alone in the office too since I had to concentrate on the computer).  
\- I learned how mobile phones work, which was really fun.  
\- These two days pass quickly. I don't dwell on feeling miserable the whole day, thinking this and that are terrible.  
However:  
\- I am really clumsy, so fixing smaller parts is not my thing. Also, I am impatient.  
\- The payment is very, very low. It's so disappointing. I don't believe anymore that you should take payment out of the equation. I want to earn good money.  
\- I am not really learning anything new, so I believe I couldn't do it as a 5-day job.  
What do you think? Where can I find ideas for concrete jobs? All I find on YouTube is meta advice on what to do when you feel lost.

I worked for 2 years at job 1, 7 years at job 2, then changed markets and had 1 job last 2 years then they let me go, sort of a layoff as no performance issues were given. Then had a contract job that was a bad fit and got let go after about 5 months, then worked for 8 years for a company that let me go recently. The reason is somewhat nebulous. From my side, I was being verbally abused by the owner and I couldn't take it anymore and started saying no. From their side, they blamed me for something not related to work ethic, which they said was great, but a personality fit. Again, after 8 years. 

I'm in the job market and just filled out an application which straight out asked if I was let go from previous jobs. I listed yes and lay off as a reason. Should I have said no? 

I worry about background checks.

Am I the only one with such an unfortunate track record or is this common? I feel like such a loser honestly. I worked my butt off each time and somehow got let go.

I've (21) recently started working for a really good solid company on a permanent contract, it's ideal. I didn't go to uni, I just started working, so I feel like I'm at a stage in my career that peers my own age just can't relate to or offer solid advice on.

I had a hard time of job searching for five months mast year cause moved with the hope of continuing my career in unscripted TV as a freelancer (I'd been doing it for over a year at that point) right when the strikes in America started and the industry crashed. Lost most of my savings, trying to build them back up again and gain a sense of long term security.

I've never had this sort of job security before, not even as a kid cause both of my parents were freelance. It's always been work for 3-6 months then unemployment then work again then unemployment, really brutal cycle, you have to LOVE your job to put up with it. 

I'm enjoying this security so much, I feel like I've had two years of non stop chaos and being shoved in the deep end in terms of maturity and capability, so being able to slow down and finally focus on myself whilst I'm working is so novel and cool ! I've been here for about 3 months. I'm working with a really lovely team, with other people doing the same job as me so I'm not by myself in this for the first time in my whole career.
My salary is about 26k, which for someone at 21 feels brilliant. 

However, the other day I got an offer from an agent (they're legit) for a job as an EA. They spun it quite well, apparently the exec is a nice guy who's understanding, and passionate about his work. I have an opportunity to ask a LOT of questions later, which I'll be taking for sure.

I wasn't interested initially because I'm happy where I am, so I set a figure waaaaay higher than my current salary as a condition of interviewing. I said 42k and we'll talk (in nicer words) because I know that's the average EA salary in the UK... They said okay.... And now we're going to talk...

I feel like I've stuck myself in a real ""money or happiness"" situation, worried I'm going to be potentially turning down the opportunity of a lifetime here... Does anyone have any advice?

I’m good at problem solving, working with numbers, foreign languages, and memorization just to name a few skills.

191izj1,Honestly I could do with some guidance on what to do - Obtained a geology masters in 2018 but I'm in mostly retail and I feel lost,"Hey

There's a few topics I want to cover. Medication, mental health (burn out), neurodivergence, anxiety, depression, brain fog, job failures and feeling absolutely inadequate and not good enough.

I graduated in 2018 with a 2:1 in geological oceanography. Honestly I struggled with my mental health throughout this (it was a 4 year course). I had a working diagnosis for Asperger's in 2016. I really burnt out doing my degree and by the end it just felt like a complete pyyric victory in itself. 

I feel like a failure right now honestly. Things haven't worked out. I've struggled to stay in employment. I've made career mistake after career mistake. The first mistake I made was in a software engineering graduate scheme which wasn't for me I ended up handing my notice in during COVID before I failed my probation. At this point I wasn't aware of what I'm dealing with and I do have severe ADHD honestly but I don't like being on the medication. Another failure was as a reporting engineer for a company called lankelma. This was a company based on the geotechnical engineering sector. I was Quality controlling data coming in, interacting with customers over email, sending out reports and also started writing some code within excel I can't remember the language. I used gINT to produce the graphs. I had to identify the geological sub strata. In this field they use CPT. So technically they don't have the geological information but they infer it based on the pressure on the cone tip and sleeve and whether it's a gravel or a sand etc and if it's of a dilative or contracting nature. I went out on site once actually and it was interesting as it allowed me to identify many of the sources of hollows in the strata. In this particular case there was a tallow works located here but they also use to fire bricks. So as a result of this the material wasn't actually the original but it was infilled therefore it had different geotechnical properties. I ended up failing the probation and getting handed my notice. Even though I was in trying my very hardest I was really struggling with my mental health at the time and I was quite isolated living somewhere with no friends and I was struggling. I was consistently burning out. At first I used my evenings to recharge then my weekends then I couldn't recharge at all and I was dealing with frequent anxiety attacks at the time due to health anxiety.

The third failure was due to the fact I couldn't be on ADHD medication anymore as it was causing havoc to my health 😢😢

I fully qualified to work as an offshore worker. I'm particular I qualified to work as a mudlogger or an offshore geologist essentially. I guess not technically lol. Anyone I went to Ankara to to the training and I passed it and I did the BOSIET etc and MIST training. I didn't properly even start this role. I didn't like the experience of being treated differently. I didn't like how I was seen as a high risk candidate for having ASD and ADHD. I know I'm this offshore environment any small issues can be simplified. I understand that. 

I have always struggled to be in employment due to burnout and not advocating for myself I'm employment. However equally I go into something before I am ready and prior to working on my mental health. My employer has no idea about this, I know typically you don't mention this to your employer in the interview. Most jobs I've been in have only been for about 4 to 6 months. I know this doesn't look good on my CV. I totally understand that. 

Recently I've been building back up my sense of reliability and trying to get back into employment. I volunteer and work at a charity shop. I open the shop and run it and accept donations. I had an interview at betfred a betting shop for assistant manager trainee role. I keep on thinking I'm selling myself short with this and I'm settling for something honestly. Also there's the gray morality area of working in a betting shop. 

I might have the opportunity to get a 6 month contract as a laboratory technician role which could be really good for me. I am honestly not the best at interacting with people and this has definitely effected me in work. 

Not only that I am dealing with so much health anxiety, brain fog (and everything I listed above) where sometimes I get the sense I am dealing with a sense of a slight cognitive impairment. It makes me think am I really actually capable of what I studied at university and what I did in my previous roles.

Also I know I need to not let others influence me in terms of getting into roles. Even friends from university who are in a similar role. I consistently don't feel good enough for not being in such a role. I need to come to such a conclusion myself.

My questions are.

1) am I selling myself short and should I really be pushing myself
2) is it a good idea to try anti anxiety medication as I do feel it gets in the way of work sometimes
3) in regards to burn out and mental health and neurodivergency how can I navigate this. I know only about 20 percent of those who are neurodivergent are in employment. How can I actually be part of that 20 percent? 
4) how to get around these failures and how do I stop it getting to me and stop it impacting my confidence and also how do I explain this to new prospective employers. Who may look at my job history which hasn't shown any particular commitment to any role.
5) how can I advocate for myself more as I know there's laws in place if you're autistic and also if you have ADHD which means employers have to put reasonable adjustments in place.",Weak-Pea-3703,1,1.0,1,1704712703,2024-01-08 11:18:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/191izj1/honestly_i_could_do_with_some_guidance_on_what_to/,1,2024
191is2p,Did I choose the wrong college?,"School pretty much consumed my identity throughout my childhood. I was at the top of my classes my whole life, led a bunch of clubs and got into some top-ranked universities (HYPSM-tier).

I threw that away and ended up going to a nearby (considered “T100” in the US) college for a combined medical program. Because of the program I have a seat waiting for me and can skip the MCAT and the application process, assuming I still get good grades and stuff. 

At the time, I figured that I shouldn’t break the bank to go to a prestigious school. It would’ve cost $85,000/year since I don’t qualify for aid. My parents were against me attending but not really because of the cost. I also could’ve attended some state schools for free, but my family was warning me about how impossible pre-med was without the guaranteed seat, which scared me. 

But my current school is still pretty expensive, about $50,000/year. My parents (borderline 7-figure income) are covering without strain but I feel guilty and like a dumbass for putting them through this. I have a 4.0 GPA and I’m doing well on MCAT practice tests, so it almost feels like I didn’t need to be here. 

I genuinely have hated my college since the day I first visited. The medical school is fine but not prestigious by any means — will this hurt my career options going forward?

I should’ve just taken a full-ride scholarship at a state school and done well there, or if my family was paying then I should’ve just taken the expensive Ivy League school. At least the pedigree would’ve helped? Now I feel like I’m pigeon-holed to this one medical school and I genuinely hate my life in college.",throwaway9373847,1,1.0,5,1704711947,2024-01-08 11:05:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/191is2p/did_i_choose_the_wrong_college/,1,2024
191iqkf,"Disciplinary hearing, possibly getting fired","Disciplinary at work, possibly getting fired

Hi everyone,

I work at a small-medium sized business as a marketing agent in the north of England. I’ve worked there for 7 years in July. At the Christmas party on December 20th, I got far too drunk and blacked out, and ended up in an argument with a woman I work with. I have had no previous issues at the job. 

When I got in to work the next day, I was suspended on full pay as the woman I got in to an argument with, has made accusations of Sexual Harassment and violent conduct. The harassment claim comes from apparent comments I’ve made prior to this, which are simply not true and haven’t been mentioned prior to this case.

I have given my side of what happened that night, the CCTV shows the argument and statements have been taken from those who witnessed it. There was no actual physical violence, only shouting. 

I received the statement of her side of events after my statement of the night was given, and have been invited to now having my disciplinary hearing on Wednesday afternoon, with Sexual Harassment, Violent Conduct, and bringing the company into disrepute. 

I plan on writing a response to the allegations, but holding my hands up to the argument and of course apologising again, however, what are my options here? I can’t prove that the sexual harassment claim is false, and the argument was on camera, where the club managers statement contradicts the other parties statement saying he felt there was nothing physical, but the other party is saying they feel scared around me despite her starting the argument physically. 

Am I likely to be fired over this by not being able to prove the harassment claim is false? I’m not in a union. 

Thank you all so much in advance.",Still-Marketing2922,1,1.0,1,1704711794,2024-01-08 11:03:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/191iqkf/disciplinary_hearing_possibly_getting_fired/,1,2024

191gpdj,Better to get promoted young or wait until you are older?,"So I’m in a senior position and I’m in my 30s, however I was promoted in my late 20s. A lot of colleagues at my level are in their late 40s and 50s and up (until retirement). There are senior exec roles above me, which are limited in numbers, and I have no desire to seek further promotion nor do o necessarily want a higher salary.

I value life over work, as in, I work to live not live to work. I dont want to kick goals for the sake of attention, im happy to just do my best - a fair days work for a fair days pay.

I know there is no hard and fast rule but it got me wondering. I have another 25-30 years at this level and responsibility and frankly I often wonder if I moved up through the ranks too soon, and “is this the rest of my career”. 

I don’t want to consider changing careers or anything like that, but it feels daunting to think I have 25-30 years of high responsibility and leadership. I’m sort of tired of I’m being honest.

191gkci,Most practical scientific/financial certification exams without requirements,"I'd appreciate some input on my situation. I am currently working as a research software engineer for a few years post graduating undergrad. It's not the worst situation: the pay is decent albeit in a HCOL area and it's low stress with great WLB. However I've come to realize it's not the best for me long term: the skills I'm developing are specific to my company, to move up you need an advanced degree (which I don't have and don't have much of a chance of getting at a top school due to no academic references/research experience; long story), and I don't see much of a chance to moving into an area which I'd actually enjoy doing within the company nor getting publications/patents. After some soul searching I've come to realize that I need to find something I could really excel in with my limited time on Earth and if so I need to start planning now.

Here's what I'm thinking. No need to quit my current gig, it allows me to keep saving and IMO it's a better option than jumping ship for a subpar school/startup/low paying entry level job right now. One thing I'm trying is part time research roles, which will help but I'd be competing with better qualified students so I'm not waiting with bated breath. I'm also tinkering with open source and data science competitions, but I've already had some minor successes here and it hasn't improved response rates to my applications. Also writing, but again doubt this will get me ""noticed."" Also I'm not great with people so I'd like to focus on hard skills vs getting in thru networking.

One thing I'm considering is certifications. I've always been good at tests and it would be great to have something that would separate me from the crowd or get a taste of a field without making a leap. There a few categories of these:

* IT certifications, like those thru AWS or GCP. Passing these would demonstrate you're familiar with a company's product offering, which might be useful to prove technical proficiency for freelancing but AFAIC these certifications aren't super valuable career-wise (they prove what you know, now what you can do).
* Coursera or similar. This might fill gaps in my knowledge or give me portfolio projects, but doesn't seem useful as a stepping stone.
* Considering local community college courses for lab-based subjects. This is cheap and might have the added benefit of credit transfers if I do end up going back for a masters, but I know quality is low and might look weird if I already have my bachelors.
* Regulated licenses like those for real estate agents, FINRA... I don't actually plan on working as an agent/broker-dealer etc but it might give me industry knowledge I can utilize in projects?
* Professional society certifications. I know I could sit for the first few actuarial exams without professional experience, but it seems like the qualifying exams for charter organizations all require work experience before you can have the chance to pass a test, eg CFP/CAIA. Curious to hear if there are any exceptions. ASPRS and GISci both have certs that can be ""pre-professional"" in nature where you just need to pass an exam and possibly have a portfolio review, similar to ICAPGen.

Basically I'm looking for decent-paying, quantitative/analyst-type roles I can land without needing to go back to school, something where I'm not capped like I am with my current position. Ideal path would be study for an exam (which would give me a path/focus) > pass > pick up part time work > horizontal career move where previous technical experience is an asset. Open to any field; I'm not great at anything but I want to focus on picking up skills while I'm still young to set me up for a career with more upside potential. And ideally something that's not SRE/DevOps/QA/data engineer or some other support role.

191ft24,Career Advice For College Graduate?,"Hi, I'm a 24-year-old recent Comp Sci: Game Design graduate. I'm lost when it comes to my career. I haven't had any luck applying to jobs in game design / world design. An unfortunate event happened that unfairly delayed my expected graduation time by a year and a half.  
My early twenties have flown by so quickly, and the only real work experience I have is 7 months of corporate retail crap. I'm going to start working 30 hrs. / week as a Calculus tutor, but I'll only be making $18/hr. I just want a job or internship that looks good on my resume. Sometimes I wish I could've gone a different route.  
I'd say my creative portfolio is pretty good, but I'm still not satisfied with it. I could continue making creative works, but there's a good chance that I'll still be broke and insecure. Whenever I want to pursue a different career path, I fear that all of those years of hard work will go to waste, and I might end up even more insecure and guilty.  
Maybe this is a bit irrelevant, but it doesn't help that many of the girls I've met have dumped me over my situation. I'm about to go on a date with a pretty smart girl with similar interests. Should I just call it off? I'm afraid that she'll ditch me as soon as she finds out about my situation. But I'm sick of blowing opportunities due to insecurity.

191foli,Help.,"Currently writing this in front of my desk. As you can see, instead of focusing on my task, I went around reddit to ask for advice and to release my stress, hopefully. 

Background:
28(F)- working as project officer taking care of the faculty’s newly-launched business unit in 2021 and proudly say that we..I bagged Keysight Tech and UOB bank as one of our return customer for our service.  

The thing is, the business unit consists of yours truly, me. I pick up calls, email, print, business pitch, proposal writing, quotation, invoice, eprocurement and bajillion other things. Not included the faculty’s and university’s other admin tasks that I have to involve.

I started working right after I graduated in 2019 until now in the same place, just reshuffle tasks. Recently, I just felt like more work are being dump on me with no extra hands to help, while the business is continuing to gain traction. 

I informed the management that in order for the business to gain extra revenue, and to make sure our service’s quality stays, they have to spend some money on getting at least 1 extra admin for me, and yet when I got it, they put her under another office that “actually really need it”.. not the newly business unit. I can do everything on my own. They say that. 

And now i’m back at square one after waiting for 2 years for someone to help me. Last week, i was informed by another officer that one of the management tattled to her that I didn’t do any work since he couldn’t see what i’ve done for the business unit, eventhough clearly right after i start taking care of the unit, our gross and net income increase, which is a feat considering i’m alone.

June until now, i started to notice my work quality and productivity has gone down, and instead of looking at my previous achievement and considering, again, i’m alone doing several people’s work, my bosses tattled to another boss that i’m slow. Yep. 

The only pros that make me stay are the fact that the office is walking distance to my home, it’s a work that i’m familiar with and the admin staff are awesome bunch of people. 

The thing is, i’m part of the management but in the lower spectrum if you may say so, and i don’t go out to lunch with other management members, instead i go with the admins whose position are lower, and i’m happy with them. Other management members that I thought were my friends, ended up gossiping about me, critiquing my work, my outfit, my personality etc.

Mind you, i worked from 2019 and i never received the employee of the year award, not even the one where you received certificated, instead of cash gift. Another officer that worked here less than a year receive the cash award. They promised to promote me yet i still stay as project officer until now. 

I just feel underappreciated and currently i’m actively looking for job.  i will not quit, unless i  find another work that offer the same salary, i’m realistic, eventhough at the price of my sanity, but my heart is not at my work anymore.",jungkook-einsteinium,1,1.0,0,1704699376,2024-01-08 07:36:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/191foli/help/,1,2024
191fgos,Maximum of salary range?,"I started my first job on jan the 2nd 2023.
The job position had a range of 600-750 JOD monthly.
I was offered the minimum possible, which is 600JD and accepted it because I had no real experience.

600JD is considered a good salary where I'm living, a fresh can expect 400JD. 

Now I want to ask for a raise even more than the maximum of what was advertised, lets say 800JD. Which means a 33.3% increase. Or should I ask for the 750JD 25% increase? 

I know that I'm a valuable asset and not being valued or compensated fairly for my work, I have good relationship with my boss and the executive director. 

Is it a good idea to proceed with this?

My points would be:

1) When my coworker resigned, I inherited a good chunk of his responsibilities -he wasn't replaced-

2) I only took 5 days off the previous year (I work 4 days week, lol)

I am 37. I have never made over 50k in my life for the year. I enjoy my job, but it’s obvious that it doesn’t pay enough unless I become a workaholic - which I have done. There were months I worked 7:30am-9pm without breaks and without eating. I made really good months on commission last year (some months were 7-8k with main job and side hustles combined), but even at that, I only made it to 47k pretax. 

Don’t come at me, but I took a huge pay CUT to move 7 hours away in the hopes of making more commission and getting better side gigs, or a job that just flat out pays way more. Even with the current pay, I couldn’t make it in my hometown, and I was applying for jobs in my city and wasn’t getting anything, even if I was qualified and really thought I would get it. The side hustles like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash markets are saturated here, more so than in a big city. I couldn’t even sign up for DoorDash because of that. It literally stated that I am on a waiting list. It’s been a few years now of waiting. 

I am tired of being miserable and working paycheck to paycheck. To clarify, I’m not completely miserable, but I get burned out and I don’t have energy for much once I get home - I work outside in the heat, running around all day. 

I have an issue with fainting as well, though it hasn’t happened in a while. I have considered WFH jobs, but I don’t even know where to start with that?

I would LOVE to work full time, or mostly full time (even part time would be cool) as a painter. 

Here are my skillsets:

- Trained painter (I graduated with my BFA) - Considering to get my Master’s so I can teach college/university
- Photographer (my full time job is this, and I have owned my own business pre-COVID, but divorce and COVID forced me to get a full time day job. I am very good at it.)
- Yoga 200 RYT (haven’t utilized this registration yet)
- Massage therapy (I am very limited physically with this, and at my peak, i could only do 2-3 massages per day. I am getting arthritis now, so it doesn’t really make sense to pursue this, but I keep it active just in case.)
- I write really well
- I am good at helping people, but I am not a licensed therapist (though I have been told many times to pursue that, because of how I have helped people.)
- I am very good at speaking and have an associate’s in Speech
- I have done server work, but combined with my main job, I CANNOT do that. It’s way too taxing on my body to walk 5+ miles per day and then serve on top of that. I was literally falling down at work the last two times I tried to work after my full time job. I had to go home early and I was really embarrassed to just not even physically be able to help anymore. 

I REALLY need to increase my income and I am trying to ease my mind about it since I am moving to a metroplex. I have some debts I want to pay off as quickly as I can without overworking myself and crashing and burning. 

Obviously, the dream is to work in the arts, hopefully as a painter/podcaster, but in the meanwhile, I need to put bread on the table. Thankfully, it’s just ME, but I need to increase my income. 2k/mo isn’t going to cut it. (I am hoping to make at least 3k-4k at my full time job with commission, but it’s not guaranteed.)

My thinking is that maybe I can apply to grad school and get a stipend with tuition covered (I graduated summa cum laude with my BFA at 4.0GPA,) and maybe teach yoga on the side, or become a group fitness instructor/trainer - is that sustainable? Again, I don’t want to work myself to the bone, but I want to be comfortable and not worry about bills. 

I am also very concerned because my full time job just changed things to where if we have a bad weather day, we either have to elect to work on a Saturday to make it up, IF we even can because of weather, tell them that we don’t want to be paid for that day (and what if it’s a whole week of bad weather???) OR, we have to take a vacation day. I’ll be living far from family, so obviously, I do not want to use my vacation days, AND I DO want to be paid. 

I am cutting my expenses down as much as possible, but at bare minimum, I really need to bring in about 4-5k to feel comfortable. 6k or more would be AMAZING. Lately, I have been surviving by selling my own belongings on EBay and marketplace since I haven’t been making commission, but I will eventually run out of things to sell. 

I guess… I am looking for reassurance that I can make it easily and that it’s possible to have a flexible schedule on my own? I’m HEAVILY debating eventually quitting this job and focusing on my own business while teaching yoga on the side, but I don’t have much of a savings. Again, I will be in a metroplex, and I am pretty tired of working outside. 

Even working in the art world again would be great (I used to work in an Art Museum), but I cannot handle a desk job. It physically hurts me and I need to be active. 

Thoughts? Suggestions? I am feeling a little lost and I do not want to feel stuck in this job forever. I am going on year 4, I think. It’s fun, but 2k/mo doesn’t pay the bills.",GR33N4L1F3,1,1.0,0,1704691986,2024-01-08 05:33:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/191dnu6/increasing_income_while_maintaining_sanity/,1,2024

191db2g,Take the leap?,"Hi! 
I currently work for a really cool ~technically startup~ brand, people love it and we have a ton of fun. 

I am a creative who thrives on comedy within marketing and taking interesting routes. I’m currently in a “social media” role (although to be fair that’s basically what marketing is now) and I want to be involved in actual large scale efforts. 

I’m comfortable where I am but I know there is 0 opportunities for growth as the leadership team within creative is not budging and not often open to ideas. 

I recently came into contact with another start up brand who recognizes my creative abilities and has given me full freedom to write/cast/produce their rebrand. Being fully trusted and embraced is incredible. 

They want me to come on full time with them for double my current salary and a massive title. Right now I am working on contract (I do many of these but have never felt so good about one before) The only thing is I am scared of the unknowns… will they fail? Am I making the wrong decision? My current company gets me a ton of clout so I’m scared to risk losing that and my side gigs.

191al9y,Leaving a USA job to travel internationally without a back up plan: what's the worst case scenario?,"I want to leave my current job for a variety of reasons but mostly because I find the work tedious and I don't see advancement opportunity. I'd love to use a month of travel as an excuse to leave and find a job more suited to my desires after I return, but I'm troubled by a feeling that doing so would be irresponsible and hurt my future prospects. 

If I keep my present expenses constant while traveling I have enough saved up so I could live for over a year without a job. Since my lease ends in late April, that's when I would leave my job. I'll apply for jobs before I quit my current job, but I still want to travel (to France for 1 month) even if I don't have another job lined up by the time April rolls around.

For reference, I work as a lab technician in the lithium and rare earth industry. I'm a single 24M with no children and after my lease ends I will have no major bills aside from student loans, car insurance, and retirement account contribution. 

If I leave my job without another job lined up and decide to travel to France for a month, what could you see as being the worst possible scenario if I don't have a job upon my return?

1917313,Starting new and entering Web Development,"Hello!  
  
Earlier this week, I made a post reflecting on my future. I remembered how much I enjoyed web design while working as a Graphic Designer and while in school. It was a field where I felt most comfortable and engaged, though it's been 12 years since I last coded anything.  
  
I'm considering enrolling in the BrainStation Web Development course to refresh my knowledge and skills, and to delve deeper into web development. I also plan to learn additional languages (React.js, Python, MySQL) to better prepare for launching a career in this field.  
  
Some friends have suggested I take the UX Design course instead, but I'm uncertain. I'm not sure if UX Design would suit me or if I'd enjoy it. They advised self-learning Web Development elsewhere.  
  
I recognize that UX/UI Design could be a potential area of expansion later in my career. This has left me a bit confused and hesitant about which path to choose right now. I'm leaning towards the Web Development course because I don't remember much about HTML5/CSS3, and I assume there have been significant developments since I learned it. I want to become more proficient in this fundamental area.  
  
How should I approach this new journey and start a career in web development? What should I consider learning and preparing for? Which course should I take? Are there things I can learn on my own without taking a course?

1913tri,Left my job due to a coworker,"Hi all just wanted some advice

I quit my job as a manager in a retail store after almost 15 years of working there. I loved every part of it, and enjoyed coming to work. I have a decent working relationship with everyone there, and I was one of the highest engaged managers (as per the employee surveys)..

A new manager recently got moved into the store and has been there for almost a year now. Since he has joined the store, the environment turned toxic, and he presents himself as ""the top manager"" and has an extreme power trip towards the associates and other managers. He would call people out and speak to them rudely; throw people under the bus; manipulate and lie about what one person says and turns around to say something else. 

He worked his evening shifts while drinking (where our upper manager isnt working at that time), and at times the employees would complain that he is intoxicated and cannot even walk properly. He doesnt do the minimal job (even locking up the store after the shift is done). There's been times where some employees have complained about his disgusting comments about some of the females working there, and his aggressive attitude when he doesn't get his way.

The problem is that ANY issue brought up to HR and upper contacts has been getting swept under the carpet. One of the managers who tried to complain about him got laid off too. My opinion is that he may have connections to higher up which is keeping him safe there.

I've quit and found something better now (and I think it was a blessing for me that this happened so I get out of my comfort zone) but I feel bad about leaving everyone behind while they're all stuck there. I was able to defend and stand my ground for myself and the other employees when they were in the right but now I'm not there and everyone left is afraid of doing anything due to retaliation.

1913bpr,Maximum of salary range?,"I started my first job on jan the 2nd 2023.
The job position had a range of 600-750.
I was offered the minimum possible, which is 600 and accepted it because I had no real experience.

600 is considered a good salary where I'm living, a fresh can only dream of 400. 

Now I want to ask for a raise even more than the maximum of what was advertised, lets say 800. Which means a 33.3% increase. Or should I ask for the 750 25% increase? 

I know that I'm a valuable asset and not being valued or compensated fairly for my work, I have good relationship with my boss and the executive director. 

Is it a good idea to proceed with this?

My points would be:

1) When my coworker resigned, I inherited a good chunk of his responsibilities -he wasn't replaced-

2) I only took 5 days off the previous year (I work 4 days week, lol)

3) Saved the company ~2000 usd by migrating to another tool.

1912825,How to set boundaries at work? Is this normal?,"
I work creative in house for a start up (second start up I’ve worked at) and I’ve been really struggling with timing my tasks and setting boundaries.

I’ve been working there since December, and have created a lot of assets for them in an incredibly short amount of time. To achieve this, I’ve already worked through Christmas break as well as before and after work hours, and I fear I’ve shot myself in the foot by giving such high expectations at first.

To give a bit of context, I suffer a lot with anxiety and fawning as a trauma response (something I am beginning to work through now). This results in a lot of people pleasing and I end up working myself into getting regular panic attacks on Sunday afternoons. This, funny enough, happened at my time at the previous start up as well but to a lesser extent.

What steps could I take to begin to set professional boundaries? To trust my instincts on how long something might take to create, and not feel as though I am being a nuisance or being slow? 

And to any creatives, what happens when you are going through a lot of research and iterations while creating something and that in itself takes time? How do you quantify when you will be satisfied with what you’ve done? 

And last of all, is this normal or a huge red flag that I’m wasting my life doing something that hurts me?

19123sb,"Was transitioning to new position, but now I’m doing both and failing at both. What should I do now?","Transition to new position and falling behind.

I’ve been with the same company for 12 yrs now. The last 2 years I’ve been struggling badly to keep up. The last year was a constant struggle to stay afloat. Working through my burn out probably damaged me more than I realized.

In any event, my discussion with upper management was to move to a new position that might provide me with more balance and control than my last position. However, since no one is available to take over my current role the discussion was for me to finish my current projects through June and slowly transition into my new role, starting with training for it this month. 

A few weeks ago our company landed the biggest project we’ve ever had. My boss thought it was a good idea I should be involved immediately under my new position/role. So I’ve been tasked with a massive project to start under this new position. I gravely underestimated the size and scope of the new project and my new role in it, and quite simple cannot manage to get it done, on top of the projects I’m currently managing in my old role. I have now completely missed my first deadline in the new position.

Before agreeing to the new position I said I wanted to be setup for success especially since my last couple of years I’ve been basically just trying to stay afloat and dig myself out of my hole. I said it would be nearly impossible to do both roles at the same time. Nevertheless, I’m doing both at the same time and now I’m failing at both. 

A lot of this is my fault because obviously I’m having a terrible time managing both and now missing deadlines for both. I’ve agree to try me new role as I was asked and agreed to the deadline. I missed the deadline. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s to the point where should I just leave the company. I’m failing both areas now. Should I tell my boss I can’t take the new role. 

My judgement is also clouded because I’m just so overwhelmed and the failure is eating me alive. This has consumed me for days and I just don’t know what to do.

Does anyone have advice on how I should approach this?",Dizzy_Performance_76,2,1.0,3,1704660525,2024-01-07 20:48:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19123sb/was_transitioning_to_new_position_but_now_im/,1,2024

1911n6j,How problematic does my work history look in terms of job hopping?,"Hey all,

I'm in my early 30s and I've had a slew of different jobs post-graduating college after doing a career change from Marketing Operations > Web Development a few years after starting my career. I'm currently about 10 months into my current position as a Senior Front End developer, but I'm finding the role and team I've joined to be pretty underwhelming and more junior than I was expecting when I initially joined along with the pay being about 30-40k less than comparable companies.

I've recently found a job listing for a different company that would be lateral in terms of job title but would come with more growth opportunities as it'd be the 3rd member of the team and allow me to help form the foundation of the team for the future. Additionally, the job is paying 45k more than what I currently make. I have no guarantee that I'll even get an interview given the current economic climate, but that aside, my biggest hesitation with applying is with my prior job history in that hiring managers/recruiters might label me a job hopper and want to know what this subreddit thought about it. For the sake of keeping somewhat anonymous, I'll keep the company/job names relatively generic.

My job history:

&#x200B;

* **Company A - Fortune 500**
   * **Junior Marketing Operations Analyst - December 2015 - December 2016**
   * **Senior Marketing Operations Analyst - January 2017 - October 2018**
   * **Front End Web Developer - October 2018 - September 2019 -** This role was within a different department and was kind of a mix of my previous job but with a heavier emphasis on Web Dev which allowed me to get my foot in the door with actual web development. I quickly discovered that it was kind of a dead-end position after I eventually realized I was still working within our marketing team and not alongside other Front End Developers/Engineers
* **Company B - Series B Startup**
   * **Front End Engineer - September 2019 - February 2021 -** Joined a smaller startup and was working alongside 2 other engineers on our company's website. Enjoyed working here but ultimately decided to leave as my other 2 coworkers left the company during COVID and a hiring freeze meant that I didn't have anyone to mentor me which I desperately needed. I obtained a ton of experience through which gave me the confidence to apply for senior positions
* **Company A - Same company as my original jobs**
   * **Senior Front End Developer - February 2021 - October 2021** \- My former team at Company A ended up getting re-organized into the Product and Engineering department instead of Marketing Operations and a position opened up which an old teammate referred me for and I ended up returning for a short stint. This teammate ended up leaving to start a new team at a separate company and ended up poaching me (selfishly on my part) for an almost 50% pay bump)
* **Company C - Mid-Stage Startup**
   * **Front End Engineer II - November 2021 - March - 2023** \- Awesome team and awesome work, but the company was massively affected by COVID and went through several rounds of layoffs during my time there. I fortunately wasn't impacted by any of them, but my mental health was taking a toll as it was almost like clockwork that a layoff would happen every quarter and I needed to find something with more stability.
* **Company D - Mid-Stage Startup**
   * **Senior Front End Engineer - April 2023 - Current** \- Current position that I feel like I was somewhat misled about when I joined. Despite having other ""Senior"" members, their skillsets themselves were severely lacking when compared to prior teams I worked on, and despite the company not going through any layoffs, company performance and my overall satisfaction with the job/team itself have been very underwhelming.

Obviously, between this current position and my prior 8-month stint at Company A, I have some reservations about how people will perceive me as a flight risk for job hopping. I've always gotten excellent reviews in all of my positions so I can definitely ""walk the walk"", but I know people have biases when they see history like mine.

1911ca0,Career change with only management experience,"*Please excuse any formatting issues. I'm posting from my phone*

I'm 26 looking to make a career change and need advice on how to best move forward.

My experience: I've been in the food industry for about a decade, half of which as an Assistant General Manager in casual and fast food. I've helped open/reopen 3 restaurants and I've led teams(15-30 people) in learning new menus and still-working-out-the-kinks-new POS systems. I’ve handled training, banking, sales push, scheduling, security risk assessment, hiring and firing, marketing, and sales projection. Most of which due to being the acting GM for 3 months until another was found at one of the newly opened stores (I was offered the position but couldn't make the hours work at the time). I did flunk out of my first semester of college due to something that I'm just now finishing recovering from, but if it helps I was going for Business Admin.

What I'm looking for: Something at least partially WFH since I'm wanting to continue my education and I have a tendency to get things done as quickly as possible. I don't explicitly want to be in management but for most things I tend to be a defacto leader and I'm comfortable leading anyways. I'm good at keeping my head cool in a crisis since, imo, there's plenty of time to freak out after the fact lol. I'm not super worried about longevity in particular as long as I can learn other skills on the job and it won't be obsolete in the next 5 years.

Options I'm looking at: I'm currently eyeballing Coursera for their Google Data Analytics and IT Support certifications. I was originally going to do their Project Management course and I got a third of the way through the YouTube videos before I realized it would have to supplement knowledge in another field. I also realized while watching that the systems they talk about I have been using for years to run restruants, mainly Agile for daily routines and LSS for reaching goals. I've also done the free trial for Data Analytics and Thinking in Code on Brilliant and so far I prefer the coding because I love problem solving but I don't know how I will feel about it longer term.

Everything I hear about FINRA is great in terms of career progression and culture- but I also learned that its contract to hire.

190zobk,Continue what I'm doing or go back to school?,"I graduated in 2016 with a B.S. in Business Management. From there, I've only been working administrative assistant jobs.

Currently the workplace I'm at is in a more casual environment and it's nonprofit, but the open office still bothers me a little bit (it's not too bad though). What concerns me is I can't stay at this job forever since it's part time. Even worse, I can't imagine climbing the ladder long-term up to office manager or executive assistant. These roles go against my personality and I know I wouldn't be suited to them. I don't like working with tight supervision from higher-ups and working admin is also just really hard to get by for a living in HCOL area.

  
The thing is, I'm not passionate about anything, so it's not like going back to school will make me suddenly love a new field. The advantage would mainly be the income and possibly having more remote/hybrid options in a non-corporate setting?

190zn8z,I am 18 and I am still not in Uni/College. I am lost and stuck with my career choice.,"To begin with, I had been obsessed with sport till I turned 17. My cherished dream was to become a pro track runner. I was not extremely talented, but I was a decent performer + passionate and hard working. I started running track at 12. At 15 I switched to homescooling to have two training sessions a day. I regarded education as unnessesary, I was reluctant to study. At 16 I suffered a severe hamstring injury. It took me a half of a year to recover. I tried to make a rebound, but that horrid injury hampered my ability to run fast and I never made it back even to my pre-injury level. I gave up and lapsed into depression. I would just lie on the floor and stare at the ceiling all day long. I even thought of comitting a suicide, but I did not dare. It was extremely bad until the moment my dad suggested me to draw something just for fun. As a child, I was not keen on any kind of art, but everyone kept telling me that I was talanted at drawing and to take it more seriously, thus putting emotional pressure on me. Surprisingly, this time I really enjoyed making highly detailed artworks, I would spend hours and hours drawing. One day my mom advised me to learn how to play an instrument, so i took up guitar and I turned out to be a skillfull player. With newly-found hobbies I was not feeling down any more, but I still had no stomach for studying and making career choice. At the end of my last scool year I took only my mother tongue and basic math exams, cause they were obligatory plus English. I did well, even though I was not prepared. I was good academically(when I attended real scool), it has always seemed natural for me. However, I can enroll in no uni with just three exams passed. My parents allowed me to take a gap year to decide upon my future career and exams I would take the next year. My knee-jerk reaction was to choose biotech engineering as my future major, as I have always wanted to invent something to enable people to live long and healthy lives( if not to defeat death completely). For thet purpose I started preparing for a higher-level math exam but that turned ount to be quite challenging. I have forgotten lots of formulas, and fail to grasp some abstract concepts. Also I have to take biology and chemistry, but I realise that I can not make it on time till the summer. My parent said :"" it is totally OK to enter the Uni at 20, but if only you study hard these two years and not procrastinate at home"". Nevertheless, I am on the verge of giving up. I don\`t wanna be an old outsider at Uni, and I wanna have plenty of leisure time for my hobbies, rather than studying all day long. My parents suggested me other career opportunities like a designer, a writer( yes, I completely forgot to say that I am creative writer and poet), and a linguist( I have a knack for foreign languges, I am considered fluent in English, also I study German and I am really fast in uptake) but I refused to take these options into consideration. I just feel that all these things are useless. I have always dreamt of inventing something great for the humanity, not just making a living. My feelings are so controversial.

I am a 27M and am struggling to find my career. Just a little bit about me - I’m a more shy and reserved introvert. I don’t have the best social skills but I can get by when I need to. I’m in a long term relationship with my partner and both live in the NYC metropolitan area. I’m more of a creative person who enjoys film photography and occasionally watercolor painting.

Before recruiting, I worked in retail for too many years to count. I feel like such a failure because I haven’t found one thing that sticks. With each job after awhile, I get so burnt out and seek a new position. I’m not someone who cares anything about climbing the corporate ladder, as I don’t think I have the necessary people skills / networking to make it happen. I also can’t see myself being chained to a desk for the next 40 years. I would love a job with stability to afford the things I love to do. Work will always come secondary to a life well lived in my opinion. 

I currently hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism, emphasis on PR but have highly considered going back to school for radiography - stability, job security, etc. The only problem is I can’t afford it. I barely make enough now to make ends meet, not to mention the amount of debt I’m already in. I’ve also explored other industries including HR, real estate leasing, and even working in a high-end restaurant. 

I honestly feel so stuck in life financially and have nowhere else to go. Again, I’ve never found a career that sticks. I guess my question is - how did you find your career and know it was the right one for you? 

I’m afraid I’ll become invested financially into education that I’ll become burnt out again in a couple of years. I get so overwhelmed making any decisions that I make no decisions at all. This has led to severe depression and a loss of purpose and self worth. 

Any career advice or decision making would be greatly appreciated. I just want to feel a sense of purpose.",Sure-Negotiation-206,1,1.0,0,1704651218,2024-01-07 18:13:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/190yd6o/how_do_i_find_my_purpose/,1,2024
190wybv,Lost all passion for my career after losing my dream job,"I went to school for finance and was miserable for 5 years. Worked my ass off and switched to UX design in 2018. After 2 years of being underpaid and never being promoted I finally landed a job at my dream tech company. It was the first time in my life I felt like I actually loved my job - I didn’t know this was a feeling that could exist. In 2023, I got laid off from the dream job. With the bad economy, I felt like I needed to take ANY job. I got another design job at a well known company but I am absolutely miserable. The hours are crazy, the pay is under market, crazy office politics that idgaf about and the benefits are terrible.

Reflecting back on it, the 4 months I was unemployed after getting laid off was the happiest I have ever been. I am at the point where I am wondering if I should continue job hunting or just quit and take a career break.

I’ve been toying with the idea of walking away from tech completely and working a non-corporate job. I looked into getting my bartending license or personal training certification. Something that isn’t a typical 9-5 and is away from a computer screen.

I’m at a crossroads and want advice from anyone who has been through a similar experience. Please no comments about how I should be lucky to have a job, etc. I understand the grass is greener where you water it.

190wpz3,What do I do in life? Lost at 27,"Been taking jobs on and off for the past 5-6 years, sometimes quitting in 3 months. Completed a masters and an undergrad in management and finance respectively. Feel like I have no skills tbh. Was in a strategy consulting job for 14 months and before that I was in business intelligence for a retail firm. However now I am completely lost. All my friends have gone abroad and have escaped the country. I feel that the only way of moving forward is to get another masters abroad and escape my country as well as the work life balance here is terrible plus the salaries are way too low. 

I have been at my parents place for the past 3 months due to the fact that I had developed a panic disorder. I am on medication right now for my mental issues. I have been taking random courses related to python and sql on datacamp. I don’t feel like getting a job as I don’t know how long I’ll live. Everyday I keep thinking about death. I have no friends / girlfriend who I can meet everyday. Nothing to look forward to. I play tennis in the evening and go to the gym, both habits which are saving me from sinking into deep depression. I have a few things in my mind that I would like to work on like creating a blog, learning new skills but I sit in front of the computer, don’t know how to start or what to start and give up on everything. I feel that 27 is too late to do anything in life. I keep reading about people or hearing about friends who lost their friends due to heart attacks etc in 30s.

190v7hu,How to handle this situation with my boss,"TLDR: boss blew off my 1 year review and is trying to shield me from exploring my interests/expanding my skill set. Boss is currently waiting to be backfilled before they go to a new role. Should I confront them or just cut my losses because I won’t be reporting to them anymore here shortly?

Thanks for any advice/feedback on how I should approach this situation. 

I’ve had the same boss for 2 years, and am one of her 2 original team members. Now she has 11 team members. We have had a really great relationship and I’ve felt that she has always acted in my best interest. She’s also been a phenomenal leader, and reporting to her has been a highlight in my career so far (until recently).

For the last 6 months, she’s been leading this pretty time intensive cross-department project that has honestly been pretty stressful and chaotic. She told us a few weeks ago that she is accepting a full time role to scale this project across the company (a huge promotion) and we are currently waiting in limbo until they hire a new manager for us. She’s been under a lot of stress juggling both roles. 

Recently I expressed interest in expanding my skill sets by working on a part time project with another department. When I spoke 1:1 with her about this opportunity I genuinely got the vibe that she was almost dissuading me from that role/my interests. I’ve never had that feeling in the 2 years of receiving her advice. I explained my suspicions to the manager I’m proposing to do this part time project with and they confirmed that their discussions with her have felt similar and that “she is being very protective of you and working out the logistics of this project with her has been very difficult”.

Fast forward two days later to my annual review. I had a very solid year this year and was really looking forward to this review and a justified raise. She basically handed me my review, read verbatim from the first two paragraphs, then told me to read the rest while she left the room for 15 minutes to discuss this new project with leadership. Came back in, and then asked me my thoughts. Within 1 min of my discussion she started checking her phone and dealing with something on there. After about another 2 min of this she started ranting about office politics for the remaining 15 minutes and briefly mentioned that my comp review “is in the works” before continuing the rant until she had to leave for another meeting. I tried bringing it back to the review but she just kept going. My review was officially completed and is on file with HR, but I feel that there was no serious career development discussions, no genuine elaboration on what things I should focus on improving this year, and honestly just disrespected because I sold my soul for the company working 80-100 hour weeks for 8 months on a temp assignment this year that has resulted in an extra $15MM in revenue for the company. 

NGL I have been pretty pissed about this but wanted to take the weekend to process emotions and think about how to handle this. 

In my next 1:1 should I just try to focus on what was left out of my review discussion and not bring up how I made me feel, or should I also give her feedback on how disrespected I feel lately?",milty4122,3,0.800000011920929,5,1704643075,2024-01-07 15:57:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/190v7hu/how_to_handle_this_situation_with_my_boss/,1,2024

190v0o6,I [M25] lost confidence and questioning about current life direction,"Hello everyone,
I’m a student with 1.5 years left before finishing medicine in France (the 6 years school degree, I don’t want to pursue further as an intern).

For context, in 2022, students reported verbal violence and humiliating behaviour from some professors. With everything adding up, I wasn’t the only one who took the decision to leave the program at that moment. Reasons of leaving were only rushed by this messed up environment factor, because for most of us, the true motivation to quit is linked to work conditions, quality of life, state of hospitals in our country, personal epiphany, and so on. 

However, I am one of a few of them deciding to get back on the ship last September. My purpose is simple… finish this curriculum, then leave for good (sunk cost fallacies hits hard). 

Despite this goal, I’m feeling completely lost since low self esteem and confidence issues from these 5 years of studies. 

Been trying to put some order in mind to use this diploma and not throwing it away/quit during a burn out rage : scientific writing, marketing or communication? (I was told being good at writing things and presenting stuff) 

Or getting another complementary  degree in CS to work in healthcare data or related medical/pharmaceutical tech fields? (I spend most of my free time learning to code, on my desk at dorm, I like to resolve problems in general) 

Ideally, after many internships and student jobs, I’d prefer a career in which there are possibilities of working at home/from desk at least, moving around the world (in the sense freedom to choose where to work from). I’m not big on salary, just something decent (freedom of mind and inner peace are more important).

I’m open to every advice/suggestion you’d like to give about it, about jobs, and so on.

*TDLR: Student, I don’t want to pursue medicine. Will leave after graduating. State of hospitals in France is complicated, life quality, too much mental health triggers and not compatible with much free time. Looking for a new direction in life. Interested in CS/tech/scientific writing. Advices on careers, how to think clearly about this… are welcome.*",Lucky-General-549,1,1.0,0,1704642529,2024-01-07 15:48:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/190v0o6/i_m25_lost_confidence_and_questioning_about/,1,2024
190udlt,I want to quit my job without a new one.,"I, 25, have been working at my first and current company for 4 years now. I used to enjoy my job but I think the last time I felt happy was like 2 years ago. I have feelings like I'm not good enough for my job, I am no longer learning, no longer motivated, and I just don't care anymore. I only finish my tasks now out of fear that I'd be embarrassed in front of my team or that I'd be let go if I don't. But I know for sure that I have been underperforming for the past year and that my supervisor sees that.  
  
I've been trying to search for a new job but didn't have any luck so far. I know that it is not practical to quit without a new job but the thought that I have to go back to work the next day makes me so anxious, sometimes reaching the point of thinking about suicide as an escape. Besides not loving my current job, I also don't know what it is that I actually want to do in my life and that frustrates me even more. This burnout made me go see a professional and I was diagnosed with depression and social phobia.  
  
I tried opening this up to my parents, without mentioning my diagnosis, but I only got the same old advice to not quit without a new job. They even put more pressure by saying that I should consider applying abroad. If I quit my job now, my savings aren't enough and my parents wouldn't be able to support me financially and that scares me.

I'm pretty much just over the insane hours of M&A work and I'm really thinking the best path forward for me is in the FP&A space. Unfortunately I haven't had a lot of luck breaking into the space as, understandably, most companies are looking for someone with a few years of actual FP&A experience for someone at my level, as opposed to the lighter level of analysis we do in M&A.  


Has anyone here made the transition to FP&A from M&A consulting? If so how did you do it? Also looking for any advice on things I can do. Currently considering taking the GMAT and getting my MBA but just hesitant because of actual cost and the opportunity cost of not being able to work.

190swxf,What can I do when companies keep letting me go after I sign up for health insurance?,"Many many years ago,  I worked for a small company where a team and I created a product that sold for millions per year.

I was younger then, a bit naive, shackled by student loan debt, surviving that by living in dangerous, dilapidated housing, because my spouse and I desperately wanted to be able to afford to start a family, and knew it was impossible with the burden of student loan debt and our income at the time.  My old employers knew that as well, and took advantage of our desperate financial situation and naivety.  I settled for a ridiculously low salary when I took the job, but they promised large year-end bonuses were normal when the things we'd build for them made good money for them.  Team members I met noted this was true as I was introduced to each during my interviews, and so I agreed to the low salary.  Reasonably hopeful that the difference would be made up, and made up as a result of how well I and my team performed.  It seemed like a fair deal.

So, I got to work, and my spouse and I pinched every penny, ate ramen noodles, peanut butter sandwiches, and dreamed of when we'd be unshackled from our education debts.  Dreamed of the boost the year end bonus would give us towards that goal.  I worked so many hours, worked harder than I ever did in my life.  I was smart, clever, creative, and dedicated.  Not just to our dream and hopes, but to my employer.  60 hours a week was the norm, then 80.  My bosses seemed impressed, we had deadlines, deals in the works, and things were looking good.  120 hours a week was about my limit, my body seemed to break down at that level of stress, that little down time.  And to be clear, all those hours, those days and nights and weekend, didn't earn me more, I was salaried, but I was proving myself, trying to help the company achieve goals, big, big deals, AND as a result get that bonus my spouse and I desperately needed to level up our lives, pay down our student loans, and really start living that good ole American dream.  Start a family, move into safe housing, etc.

What my team and I built was ground-breaking, leading edge, and a success.  Yet, the bonus never came.  Instead our owners sold the company, and even though they were already multi-millionaires (which was a lot back then), they used it to buy second homes across the country and large investment properties.  The company that acquired ours did what most companies do, and offshored our jobs, then let us go.  I stayed in touch with co-workers as we were all quite desperate then, and we knew we had the skills, just not the equity to bankroll a new business, but we hoped we could find a way to work together again.  One older co-worker who was a great contributor to the success was particularly frustrated and distraught.  His contributions to the success were very, very significant, and he felt betrayed, but also even more vulnerable than me.  And he was.  At his age in our industry, he was simply not going to bounce back.  He died in poverty.  And I began then to not be so naive, but despite wising up to the ways of business, I was still broke, still in debt, but I told my spouse, ""We'll get through this, we'll be even stronger, I'll work even harder and smarter and more, and we'll make whatever sacrifices necessary, pinch every single penny, we'll get out of debt, we can do this, we can have a family, have a safe home.  We can do it!""

The company that bought what we created, which offshored our jobs, called me back.  Now I know, many of you might say ""Hell no, don't go back!  Not after that!""  But remember, we had damned near a decade of student loan debt weighing us down, and we were already at rock bottom.  There was nothing left to squeeze from our budget, nothing left to give, and we were getting further and further away from our dreams and hopes as a result.  I'd tried for months to find work, and it was like a lifeline being tossed to us.  So, I said yes.  They needed me for something, and I needed the income.  When I returned I got the details on what they needed.  A large customer wanted something I'd created revised, and a new feature added.  If that demand could be met, the new company would get nearly a $1,000,000 sale.  I was so excited.  They really talked me up, it would be so so so good for the company, for ""us"", and my new salary was enough that all of my projections showed me and my spouse, this was it, we were finally able to change our station in life, we'd be able to pay down our debt, buy a home, start a family, and all that wonderful stuff.  I worked so hard, more than ever before, and I did it.  And the deal went through.  And of that $1,000,000, I got... well nothing really.  It was on a product I'd built with my team, a feature I'd added soley to save the deal, but well, I was just a naive employee, I had no equity, no commission, and concepts of profit sharing and year end bonuses just didn't exist with the new large corporation.  Terms like ""the greater good"" were thrown around, ""we're a company"", and ""long-term goals"".  Oh well.  One thing that was echoed seemingly clearly was that I'd done well and my job was seemingly stable.  So, my spouse and I planned the next phase of our lives.

The company really liked that I worked so much.  Produced so much.  It was really taking a toll on me, more than I realized.  My health was deteriorated, I was exhausted all the time, and I began to physically hurt in ways that made no sense.  I fought through it, and continued to do well by the company.  There were times though when it would hit so hard that I could barely walk.  Something was wrong.  I called in sick once, and my boss came to my house to confirm.  ""Yes, I'm very sick, but I think I will be ok to work by tomorrow.""  And so I tried harder to balance my life and work, and prioritized work even more, collapsing in exhaustion each day, but making sure that the company got what they wanted from me, and prospered well, VERY well from it.  By the end of that year, it was becoming nearly impossible to go on.  So when open enrollment for insurance started, I signed up for what looked like the right plan, that we could afford, which I hoped would cover whatever needed to be fixed in me.  And then early the next year, I dragged myself to a doctor, and my life, OUR lives, took a hard pivot.

I also grew even wiser.  I learned then the difference between healthcare and health insurance.  Health care is a necessity of life.  Health insurance is for creating some of the wealthiest executives in the world, and they don't get that way by actually providing or even helping with health care.  While the insurance company pre-approved a surgery I needed, AFTER it was done, they refused to pay a dime.  We fought and pleaded for months, but it was so hard to even get through their bureaucracy, their hierarchy, and jargon and all, and even when we thought we'd reached someone who would solve the problem, they'd still not budge.  And, on the health care side of things, all the stalling and reasoning, made no difference to the health care providers.  They wanted to get paid.  They were turning over bills to collection agencies, which were making all sorts of threats, and quite credible one, which were going to destroy our credit and ruin us financially forever, shutting down any hope of ever having a home or car or anything.  So, just as we were breaking the shackled of student loan debt, we took the only option we had, signed up for payment plans, and were re-shackled by medical debt for another 10 years.

Then my employer complained of their skyrocketing health insurance company plan.  And, shortly after I was let go.  They'd made millions from what I and my team had built, by then $25,000,000.  The top executives bought mansions, a mini-yacht, and sent their children to Ivy League schools.  And me, well I was quite literally broken, and financially broken again.

And again, I told my spouse, ""We got this!  I can handle it.  We are strong together, we're smart, just look, look at how much money the things I built made for ALL of those people.  I can do it again, for us too, one day.  We just need to find something, anything, and keep this dream alive.  I'll work smarter, be more strategic, we'll save and crunch, I can keep this balanced and I'm fine, it's not so bad.""  It was bad, I wasn't fine, but I was able to balance my health and work.  And I grew wiser, and wiser.  It was very clear by then how the real world worked, how business worked, and how health care and health insurance worked.

This story is growing quite long, but I really think it's important to share. I think the history, the details, are very important, but let's fast forward to the point.

Time and time, and time again now. I've experienced a pattern, and have even been enlightened to the truth of it, so I know for a fact it isn't coincidence.  That is, when I sign up for health insurance now, it doesn't matter how much wealth I've created for the companies I've worked for, within a matter of weeks or months at best, I get fired, let go, typically the story is for ""budgetary reasons"" and they always cover their legal bases, ""non-discriminatory waivers"" are issued and must be signed leading up to it, all of that other corporate stuff, rationalizations.

Now, I'm old.  My health condition is virtually impossible to hide, yet I'm still very productive.  The last product my team and less than a handful of co-workers built, sold for tens of millions and generates continuous income for executives and investors, and again, many have retired on the result of our creations.  I need to see a doctor again.  I need help.  I struggle hard to hide my condition to keep life and work balanced, and I see the end of my career on the horizon approaching fast.  In fairyland world, one would think, ""disability insurance is an option"" and if not that ""social security disability"", but in the real world, if you've truly investigated these options in depth, you know.  You know that disability insurance is mostly effective for rapid events, like sudden onset of cancer or a heart attack or car accident.  For chronic and progressing illnesses, you'll be fired long before something like that would help you.  And you also know after you look into Social Security disability, that becomes an option only when death is right around the corner, all the boxes need to check out, and even with good lawyers, there is no assurance that it'll ever come to your rescue.  Anyhow, the pattern has started again.  I signed up for health insurance.  I need actual health care, to help me at least get more than 4 hours of sleep a day, so I can continue to make things that make executives and investors millions.  To prove my worth to them, but most importantly to keep our family fed, and a roof over our head.  Yet, the pattern has started, for the countless time.  A pattern that I am so very familiar with, which has cost us so much, which set us back over, and over, and over, and over again.  I make things that make millions for managers and executives and the company as a whole, sign up for health insurance, and then get let go.  We have to bleed down our savings, fashion new bootstraps, settle for whatever work we can find, and rebuild, again, and again, and again.   I'm too old, too tired now.  I don't want to keep going like this.  And, I don't want to see our children fight the same tireless fight.

I care about my family.  I care about YOU, and your family.  Something has to change.  But right now with that writing on the wall, and the poverty that will come after, I have to solve this problem yet again.

What can I do when companies keep letting me go after I sign up for health insurance?

What can we all do to get a fair share of the wealth we produce?  What can we all do to get health care, not just health insurance?  What can we all do to recognize this world doesn't need billionaires at the expense of prosperity, opportunity, and hope for all of us who created them?

One final note.  To protect myself, this is of course is a throw away account, but I've another.  And in another post to reddit, on the moment I signed up for health insurance, I posted an unalterable encrypted dated message with more details and perfect prediction of what is about to happen to me yet again.  It's all happening, and will happen exactly, precisely as predicted.  If it wasn't so sad, I'd say it's funny how perfectly predictable they are.",throwaway-asdfljkl23,1,1.0,6,1704636535,2024-01-07 14:08:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/190swxf/what_can_i_do_when_companies_keep_letting_me_go/,1,2024

190rrad,How does career progression work?,"1. After my first year (first career job) as an analyst my company gave me a 20% raise and a promotion. After going through multiple performance reviews they believe me to be a rockstar employee and I was told I am capable of reaching a director level position at anything that I choose to do. I have a very strong work ethic and am good at what I do and I think that shows. Should I expect to see substantial raises/promotions yoy as I continue to master my technical skills and organizational knowledge? I don’t expect to receive a 20% raise yoy, however I would hope to receive more then just the yearly inflationary raise.

2. As I feel I’m progressing in my career very quickly, does that progression transfer if I were to leave and go to a different company? i.e. let’s say hypothetically I have 5 years of experience in my position, but have progressed at my firm to a position that would typically require 8-10 years of experience. Just because I had that title at my firm does that qualify me for that same position requiring 8-10 years of experience at another firm?

190qpch,What should I change my title to ?,"Hey all,

I have the chance to change my title soon and I want to be strategic about it. Also I can suggest a few education programs, but I don’t want to limit myself too much. I have a few ideas, none of them I am a 100% confident with. Maybe one of you has an idea.

Background: I’m currently a Junior Social Media Manager at an IT Company. I’ve worked there close to 2 years now and have from day one done more than a Junior would. The marketing team is small, I’m the only one that oversees all things Socials, including the entire conception and strategy and implementation of organic and paid content. I conceptualized and implemented a cooperation with an external influencer and with regular workshops I try to „coach“ corporate influencers internally. Next to that a lot of other tasks fall on my lap. I organize our representation during conferences, exhibitions & similar events. I have developed concepts for videos, podcasts and how we can implement pictures on our websites. I create content like checklists and guides. Then there’s a lot of „smaller“ ad hoc tasks that I take over every now and then. 

In short: I wouldn’t see me as a social media manager only. It is however my main focus in the job. If you were in my position, what would you choose? Ideally it would be one that doesn’t limit me too much. I might not want to do social media forever.

Secondly: Based on that background - what skill would you suggest I could learn in an education program that furthers my career and keeps my options open for the future?

During my teenage years, I virtually met many aerospace engineers, people working and studying in various universities. I had attend conferences and stuff. I used to be a very confident person organising and participating in debates, quizzes etc. I once presented a presentation infront of my high school classmate, teachers and guest in National Space Day all by myself.

She's a very rich and successful lady, and a very understanding person. She thinks my low maths skill will impact my academics if go for aerospace engineering. She also says that I will gain back my confidence if I don't overreact about losing my childhood dream career. Career doesn't bring happiness I'm just misunderstanding it.

I work with many students with Autism, Selective Mutism & Hearing/Visual Impairment. I absolutely love this job, but the pay is extremely low - £18,000 a year.

190piup,Career Break and Starting Family,"Hi Reddit community,

I'm a 25-year-old woman contemplating a career break at a pivotal point in my life. Currently a senior project manager in a multinational fortune 500 company, I've rapidly climbed the corporate ladder over the past three years after completing grad school in information systems. While I value my career, the stress of a full-time job, especially in a senior role, has led me to consider taking a break and  explore entrepreneurship.

Growing up in a family of business-minded individuals, I'm drawn to the idea of starting my own venture—possibly in catering and freelancing as a consultant. However, the uncertainty of entrepreneurship and the fear of potential setbacks make me hesitant. With the organisation I am in now, I've been fortunate to gain tremendous support from senior management; I worry about the challenges of reentering the corporate world if my entrepreneurial endeavor doesn't pan out.

Additionally, my partner (35 years old) and I are planning to start our family. As someone who values being present for my loved ones, I question whether now is the right time for such a significant career shift.

Financially, I am well-supported by savings and investments from my previous job. Also extremely grateful to my partner who has also shared he’s comfortable to support both of us financially too, should things go south for me…

To fellow ladies/gents who have taken a career break, would love to hear about your story. How did you navigate this transition? What was your biggest learnings? What considerations, research, or suggestions would you offer as I weigh my options?

Hello redditors,

I am a 24 y/o girl with a bachelor’s of International Business & Finance.

I have to state that I have little to no idea about career paths, I just did my bachelor’s without thinking too far.

I worked as a recruitment consultant in a higher education institute for some time, and realized sales is not my thing, so I started looking for other jobs.

I could land a ‘admin assistant’ position in a small scale restaurant, work scope includes making P&L, handling social media etc.

My question is, Is R&B a good industry for HR, Admin roles?

And is it okay to start with a small scale restaurant? Will I be able to build a strong career? 
(I am asking this because I genuinely have no idea. We, as students, have always been taught to get good corporate jobs in multinational companies. I have started to realize that is not how real life works, but I need some assurance I guess)

And is it really hard to change the industries once you get in to one?? Like almost impossible?

If I like it in Germany I would settle there. If I don't like it there I would come back to India, and since I would have a Masters and work experience from Germany, I could easily find a high paying job in India, and get settled here. 

Are there any flaws in my thought? SO, Should I go to Germany for my Masters or get a Job in IT in India?

I will be taking an education loan if I go to Germany, for blocked account, but not use it cuz I would finance my expenses with a part-time job. my parents could pay for it but i dont want to take it from them, (im not the only child), i dont want to put any burden on them.

I did it accordingly and within a month, I realised Geology being a vast career field I don't like it at all and my rude peers making it difficult to sustain here. During my teenage years, I virtually met many aerospace engineers, people working and studying in various universities. I had attend conferences and stuff. I used to be a very confident person organising and participating in debates, quizzes etc. I once presented a presentation infront of my high school classmate, teachers and guest in National Space Day all by myself. But now, I ran away from everything, have low confidence, depressed all the time, not wanting to meet my old friends. My mom unfortunately laughs at me sometimes saying that doesn't matter how much I cry, beg or become mentally ill, she will never pay for my tuition fees if I go for engineering. She's a very rich and successful lady, and a very understanding person. She thinks my low maths skill will impact my academics if go for aerospace engineering. She also says that I will gain back my confidence if I don't overreact about losing my childhood dream career. Career doesn't bring happiness I'm just misunderstanding it.

190jxtu,"Planned on leaving, but boss offered me more money to stay. How do I turn this down without feeling guilty?","For background, I currently work for a digital ad agency as a campaign specialist. However, I find agency life incredibly stressful and my boss is a nightmare. A crazy sales environment along with the high pressure position have been detrimental to my mental health and it doesn't help that I'm also working towards my masters degree.

I recently received an offer to be a marketing specialist for a local company.  The position is straight forward and seems a lot more laid back. No sales. Bo presentations, and i can be a lot more creative. Plus they offered me 10k more than what I currently make! Great, right? 

But when I went to turn in my two week notice, my boss actually broke down crying and begged me not to leave. We are already short staffed and I handle some pretty large accounts.

She told me big changes were coming in 2024 and asked if I could reconsider. I folded and told her I'd think about it (I hate to upset people). Anyway, at the end of the day, she ended up offering me 16k more than my base salary in addition quarterly sales bonuses.

The thing is, I have been thinking about it more and more and still think I want to take the other job. My current position is a nightmare and I dread going to work everyday and having to deal with such high pressure situations. I want to have a more relaxed position while I finish my masters and focus on bettering my mental health this year.

So I guess my question is, how do I tell my boss I'm turning down her offer and continuing with my resignation without feeling guilty? I feel terrible because it will put the company in a bad position and my boss clearly jumped through hoops to get me so much additional money.

I just don't think the extra salary is worth all of the anxiety and bullcrap I deal with on a daily basis. 

Or should I suck it up and deal with the stress for the extra money and be thankful for the opportunity?

Any advice would be appreciated.",TheSaucySkrimps,12,0.9300000071525574,37,1704602776,2024-01-07 04:46:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/190jxtu/planned_on_leaving_but_boss_offered_me_more_money/,1,2024
190jx6v,Asking for a raise/promotion after just getting one? (unusual situation),"I currently work at a market research firm. To make things simple, I'm in the researcher track, and effective there are four ranks (let's call the researcher 1-4, with 4 being the top rank for this role). After rank 4, there are other tracks I could go down.  
  
My job has a K12 team and a higher ed (HE) team. They were merged until a few months ago, when I was moved to the K-12 team after the split. Anyways, I have been at the company for about 1.5 years, and got a promotion from researcher 3 (which I started at) to researcher 3 during our last eval cycle (taking place in july, with changes taking place in september. I also got a 3k raise with that promotion. The current cycle dence in december, and decisions have been made and should be relayed to us sometime next week, with those promotions/raises becoming official in march.  
  
I got a message and then a video call with my boss where she told me that a researcher 4 on the higher ed team (who has been there maybe 3.5 years or so, and who is one of two researcher 4s on that team) would be leaving in 2 weeks (unexpectedly, probably found another higher paying job - this job doesn't pay great for what it is). The boss asked me if I wanted to transfer to HE, as they need an upper level researcher on that team. Additionally, the K12 team does a lot of dashboards, and I am one of the people who knows how to do them (rather than PPT reports), and the guy leaving is the only one who did dashboards on that team (the other researcher 4 does other project types, but not dashboards). One of the lower level researchers would be switched to K12 (which they prefer), and I'd be switched to HE in order to take on their dashboard projects (which had been less common there, which is why not many people do them, but are going to be come more common). That team has a couple of new people, so I'd probably be in charge of training one of them on dashboards as well so that they can take on the increasing demand.  
  
Anyways, as the eval cycles just ended, and the guy told them he's leaving just now, I am guessing that my promotion/merit increases will be nothing, as I just got a promotion and raise in september. I was not expecting anything this time, and was fine with that. However, if they are asking me to step into the role of a researcher 4, and potentially take on more work/leadership on the team, I kind of feel like I should get something. That said, the budget is probably allocated already, and I feel that they won't likely be inclined to give me much now.  
  
At this point, I don't know if I should ask for something (the promotion, which I probably won't get at this point, or a little extra money), express that I'd like this now, but realize that I'll have to wait and give an indication that I want those things in 6 months, or just say nothing and see what they do in 6 months (the next time they would potentially give me a promotion/raise). My feeling is that if I take the role and end up doing all of the work he was doing and do a good job, it's quite likely that they would give me the promotion/raise in 6 months as I would have been doing the work of that role (and hopefully doing it well), but there's no guarantee of that.  
  
Do you think I should be assertive about setting that expectation, or would it be better to show my value through doing the work, play nice, and then make that request in 6 months during the next evals (when these things are decided/negotiated), when I have done more to prove I deserve it. In any case, I expect the promotion sooner rather than later (I was thinking 1-1.5 years without this move happening), but wasn't sure how aggressive it would make sense to be given that I JUST got a raise/promotion, and given that the budget is probably spent and probably was not set up with anything like this in mind a month ago.

190hdji,I need your help.,"Hi everyone, thank you in advance for reading this post and offering sound advice. This is a bit lengthy so please bear with me. 

 I have been at my company for almost a decade. Why you might asked? overall company culture (very healthy), fear of the unknown, and self confidence. In retrospect, I should have jumped years ago and doubled my pay. However, I was reared to work hard and the rest will follow. After working for a decade at a corporation, I am now a lot smarter about workplace politics and what it takes to move up.

Most of my career has been as an HR manager. It’s retail management and very fast pace. You learn a lot, you learn fast. A couple years ago, I got promoted in a different field. I am still managing people but no longer in HR. I’ve been missing HR and I want to go back, but in a different industry. 

It’s very important to state that I’m doing well at my current job, my team is wonderful, I’ve received awards and accolades. However, I want to leave the industry I’m in.

I spent 9 months networking to move back in HR internally to no avail. Then the last 3 months I’ve shifted my attention externally. 

There is so much I’ve accomplished. I know that I would succeed at another company. However, I feel recruiters may be confused by my application because of the career shift. 

I’ve been applying to other HR positions externally and nothing’s come of it so far. I think my current job title is one of the reasons why I’m not given a chance. 

I’ve had two interviews that I was turned down for at the final stage. Very demoralizing because for one, I went through 7 interviews, was given an office tour, introduced to people in the office just to be told no for the position. For the other one, not sure what happened either. I was under the impression that everything was going so well.  Keep in mind I only got my foot in the door through networking for those two. 


Here’s what I’ve started doing so far, going to networking events (1 so far) downloaded Grammarly and an ATS system for my resume and cover letter. I re-certified for HR and looking into getting another higher level HR certification to prove to other companies I am capable. My company couldn’t care less about an HR certifications because they have such a solid HR pyramid. Are there other companies who place less emphasis on HR certifications? 

My current job is very demanding of my time and I want to leave as soon as possible and go back in HR. By not taking risks I’ve cheated myself out pay bumps and experiencing another environment. 

I want out, I know I can excel wherever I go. I feel trapped. Any advice on how I can achieve a more effective job search?  How can I explain that I’m applying for an HR role when the last couple years have been in a different field on my resume?

190gidk,I was “paid” to leave by my company and took the prompt exit package. How do I address this during my upcoming interviews?,"I was recently presented with a PIP (performance improvement plan) or a PEP (prompt exit package) due to my “performance challenges”. I put this in air quotes because I was a top performer and it was due to company politics and a bad manager fit that I felt like I was pushed out with little to no notice. It all feels bizarre and like I woke up from a bad dream, but it just goes to show you how a manager (good or bad) can shape your career.

A PIP was a 30 day trial period where I must meet certain expectations; if I meet them, I get to stay onboard and if I don’t I would have to leave. A PEP is where I would have to leave within the week I was issued this with a  two month severance package. 

Upon talking to various mentors at the company, they said they rarely see anyone survive a PIP because management already want you out so they’ll make it nearly impossible for you to meet the standards. Plus,  a PIP stays on your record forever whereas a PEP doesn’t (it just says you resigned and took the exit package). So I felt like I didn’t have much of a choice but to take the PEP.

I am currently interviewing at other companies and they noticed on my resume that I left my previous company. 

Question: What is the best way to respond to this question without having to dig up the dirt/details of what actually happened? 

If I re-apply to the same company, and the internal hiring manager can see that I took the PEP, what is the best way to address what happened? (P.S. I actually loved the company, just wasn’t the right manager fit)

So I recently completed a final round interview for a company/job I really want. I thought it went well and it felt more like a conversation than an interview. A lot of positive signs. I interviewed a few days before Christmas and have not heard back yet. I understand with the holidays and everything it will take longer. This was the email from the recruiter for the final round interview:

You’re all set to meet with (hiring manager’s manager) and (current team member) tomorrow morning. “ “ is the Director over this team and “ “ is another Consultant who does similar work to this role – he would be a good resource to ask any peer-related questions. They will both be on-camera with you. 

I’ll follow up with you for feedback/next steps!

190frx9,Am I being fairly compensated?,"I've worked at a small accounting firm for over 2.5 years as an assistant. I had no prior experience when I started and was first given simple duties such as document management. I started off at $13.10 an hour. 

As I progressed in my job I took on further responsibilities such as bank reconciliations, sales tax, data entry, some admin work (project management), and other misc tasks. I've been responsible for pulling bank statements and other items for 80-90 clients, preparing and filing sales tax for 15-20, doing reconciliations for at least 15 (or more depending on the month), and am fully responsible for one clients accounts (minus reviews). I'm usually handed other misc projects, and do most of the data entry for 1099s (around 100 clients) and some data entry for returns during tax season. 

A few months ago though my boss said I will be advancing in my position and will take on a junior accountant role. I'm transitioning all of my admin and document management work over to a new hire, and apparently will be taking on more bank recs, sales tax, and tax returns. Im also responsible for training another person who was just hired for a staff accountant role but has never worked in accounting. 

At this time my boss said I would be receiving a raise too. I'm currently making $20 an hour. About a month ago I brought this up with another boss of mine and she said she hadn't heard anything about that but would mention it in a meeting. Still nothing. I will bring it up again. 

The main issue I have is I found out another person who worked for us, (who did have some prior bookkeeping experience though) had the same role as me but maybe 10% of my workload and made $23 an hour. (She also worked only 15 ish hours a week though to be fair) I remember hearing her work was always poor quality and didn't get it done on time.

Another thing is I'm in school, but not for accounting. My bosses have been fine with me adjusting my schedule for classes, and reducing my hours to 35 per week. I told them I could only work that much during tax season which they were okay with, but now they're saying I need to work on Saturdays when I they need us and/or I have availability. 

I kind of feel taken advantage of, but also don't know how fair my pay is.I wouldn't be surprised if the new hire with less experience than me is making more than me though",stephchiii,1,1.0,4,1704590060,2024-01-07 01:14:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/190frx9/am_i_being_fairly_compensated/,1,2024

190dovk,Need advice on interviewing for new jobs after signing an NDA at my last job,"Hi - quick summary of my situation - and thanks in advance for any wisdom you all can provide!

In my last job, I had a fairly high up position at a large organization. During the pandemic, I was pressured by my direct supervisor to do something illegal in order to make it look as if we were meeting specific goals.... I attempted to propose alternative solutions, but when that didn't work, I obviously refused to follow the directive (and carefully documented the whole process). Despite going through HR, I experienced some pretty horrific retaliation, and ended up needing to get a lawyer... Fortunately,  I documented things well enough to negotiate a good severance, but I had to sign an NDA. 

So... After a couple of years of recovery and doing something else, I'm trying to get back into a similar field. My question is... how can I successfully address this situation in interviews? 

The questions that will be the toughest to answer will probably be ""why did you leave your last job?"" and something like ""have you ever encountered a situation that challenged your integrity?"" etc. 

 I think I could \*possibly\* generally talk about the situation without going into specifics, or saying which employer I'm referring to, but I feel like (unfortunately) it will just look like a red flag to interviewers - right?

 I'm assuming the best option is not to address it at all, and just prepare answers that focus on other employment experiences, but if anyone has thoughts I would really appreciate it. 

Thank you -

190csz7,Learning nothing from an internship,"Learning nothing from an internship

So I started a 1 month remote unpaid internship in a public health network abroad (I am a Master of public health student). This is my first internship in the field. The network is highly reputable and I was so excited for this opportunity. However, after two weeks in, all I do is literature reviews, preparing reports, getting basically minimal feedback from the team leader ( I do a well executed job but still), and then prepare a powerpoint presentation ( I don't even present it, just send it to the team leader). Other than that all I did is meet the team and meet some other interns in online calls. I was not taught anything, did not learn anything new. Yeah doing literature reviews and such kinda counts as ""experience"", but I feel really disappointed that I am receiving nothing new, and all I will be doing is tasks for the next weeks. With the schedule being 40 hours a week, I expected to be getting hands-on instructions and frequent mentoring from the team members. But all I do is complete my weekly tasks in a single day, and then do nothing or learn nothing. I do not care that it is unpaid, but I expected to get something in return lol (other than an added section on my resume).
Anyway, are internships supposed to be like that? Any thoughts on the matter? Thank you in advance.",DizzyPersimmon2200,1,1.0,7,1704581936,2024-01-06 22:58:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/190csz7/learning_nothing_from_an_internship/,1,2024
190bz97,Teacher seeking new path,"Career Switching Guidance

I have been a teacher in the US for 15 years and I am trying to make a shift. I have a BA in Education and a MA in Instructional Leadership. I am currently working as a Teacher on Special Assignment supporting secondary math, science and health teachers. I work at the District level kind of like a project manager for the district, running multiple teams of teachers, budgets, problem solving, etc. 

Here is my problem: I don’t know what I want to be when I grow up. I’ve wanted to be a teacher since 3rd grade and never investigated any other path. But there is the chance, if the levy doesn’t pass, that my position will be eliminated. Per contract, they would have to find me a teaching job in the district but I can’t go back in the classroom. My mental health won’t do well. So I need to find a path. 

I’ve considered (and am still open to):
Data analyst
Programmer
Human Resources 
Instructional Design 
Probably some others I’m not remembering 

What I want/need in a new job: 
Must make $100,000+ (I live in Western Washington near Seattle, since geography is important for that piece).
The ability to eat and go to the bathroom when I need to (shockingly important after not having that ability for 15 years in the classroom).
I like to investigate, research, problem solve.
Ideally, I’d like a job that I can just put my head down and do my job. I’m a good leader and a great team member, but I have only ever had jobs that are centered around putting out fires/being in the spotlight. A job that has a little less of that would be nice. 
Work/Life balance - I have a young son and if I have to let go of summers off with him, I am going to want my evenings and weekends to spend with him. 

I’m not opposed to going back to school, but I’m still working on loans from my Master’s, so I don’t want to have to go back and get major loans again. 

Any suggestions or paths to follow? I’m really at a loss because it seems there are a million choices and no choices all at the same time.  TIA",Kind_Ad_5178,1,1.0,2,1704579801,2024-01-06 22:23:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/190bz97/teacher_seeking_new_path/,1,2024

190b3rv,Manager is going to try to not give me my automatic end of the year bonus,"So I have recently submitted my 2 week notice at my current job. For the 5 years I've been at this job I've been a model employee, never in trouble, looked at as a leader, and in terms of metrics I've been top tier. I thought I was going to be retiring here but a change in management in the past year has had me doing a complete 180.

 The regional manager is so psychotic that every single manager/supervisor under her has resigned in the span of 3 months. The lack of leadership has forced a handful such as myself to do the unpaid work of a supervisor/manager on top of my normal duties. Even though this new manager slyly pretends to speak ""respectfully"" to me, she tries to take advantage of my kindness and mild mannered persona by delaying raises/promotions that I have been earned with constant excuses (at the order of my regional manager) and also pretending she is taking care of everyone when in reality she micromanages, and shrewdly tries to push people out he hates. As I spend my last 2 weeks here, our workplace does 2 annual bonuses for all employees, which are not performance based, all you have to do is have worked here during the 1st half of the year and the 2nd half of the year. I know exactly how it works because I've been here for 5 years and it has never changed. This bonus is written out on a piece of paper, pretty simple and standard with nothing fancy on it 

&#x200B;

I know my manager is not even going to mention the bonus I am due if I say nothing so what do I do/say to ensure that I receive my bonus? I would prefer to bring it up in a way that is very professional and not pushy, but if I need to I will. How should I ask about this topic and how would you handle the manager's likely retorts (putting off the raise until I'm gone, pretending I don't get the bonus, etc.)?

1908ein,Getting my Associates degree in the Spring.,"I have two options, I can get an Associates in Math and Science, or I can get an Associates degree in Physics. 

I dropped out of a Bachelors degree program in Mathematics where I had 1 year left. 

MA just came out with a program for free college for finishing your Associates. 

I have enough credits for either degree, which one would be more useful if any? 

Right now, I'm finishing my 3rd IT certificate and plan on working in IT. 

I noticed some IT job postings ask about having an Associates degree in a related field. 

&#x200B;

I know Physics isn't a related field technically but is Math and Science a related field? 

&#x200B;

I'm thinking maybe get the Associates in Physics and then if I ever do go back to school to finish my bachelors degree then I'll have an Associates in Physics and a Bachelors degree in Mathematics. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for the advice. 

&#x200B;

Best.

19078z7,Should I pursue site reliability engineering/devops or software development path?,"Hi Reddit community,

  
I'm a foreign national currently wrapping up my Ph.D. in Computer Science, set to graduate in spring or summer 2024. Prior to my Ph.D., I spent 2.5 years working in backend engineering, automation, scripting, and REST API development in my home country.

  
During my Ph.D., I've focused on optimizing resources for microservice applications in Kubernetes and explored converged computing by running high-performance computing in the cloud for enhanced elasticity. My tech stack includes Kubernetes, Python, Bash scripting, monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana, Ansible, GitLab CI/CD, AWS, Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and more.

  
As I gear up for the industry transition, I'm facing a dilemma. While my experience seems to align well with Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), Platform Engineering, and DevOps roles, there's also the option to apply for general software engineering positions. However, the latter might require a refresher on coding challenges like LeetCode, something I haven't done in a while.

  
I'm curious about the expectations for SRE/DevOps roles – do they typically require a Ph.D., and what are the odds of landing interview calls? Any insights or advice on choosing the right career path and navigating this transition would be immensely helpful.

1906f34,Awaiting a conversation with potential new employer set up by job recruiter I am working with. Good questions to ask on the call?,"I am a 27F working with a job recruiter specific to my field — I do marketing in the motorcycle industry. My objective is to relocate out of state. He is encouraging me to work with a woman who used to be the marketing director of the last dealer group I was working for, who relocated out of state to a new group. I am very new to the recruiting process and would like to make sure I am as professional as possible 

My former employer and myself did not have the same vision, and that is the same reason that the new potential employer relocated as well. This person is now the Chief marketing director of the new out of state group. This person will be able to personally relate to my dissatisfaction and show me a better way to do things because they have been exactly where I was. 

They do not have a current position open, but recruiter gave me a heads up that they want to have a conversation with me and potentially create a special role for me, or a position may be opening up. Either way, I’d like to make sure that I am prepared to ask the most impactful questions I could possibly ask.

It has been a few days since recruiter gave me the heads up, and he suggested that I go ahead and reach out to them myself and gave me my potential new manager’s cell phone number. I askef for it so that I can set up a call and not miss a call from THEM as I could be working (I am currently a server until this process is over).

What I need advice on is phrasing my initial contact message to schedule a call, and some recommendations for impactful questions I could ask to put me in a good position for hire.

1905yqi,Decision paralysis,"RMT, horticulture, or tattooing. I’m 28 and in a dead end, low paying job. I’m not making ends meet and need to make a change, and make it soon. I previously had a 3 year career in tattooing, but the lockdowns during the pandemic ate up my savings, and work was inconsistent so I left for something more stable. But this job has been nothing but disappointing, so now I’m struggling to decide if I should try restarting my tattoo career, or go back to school. I’ve been considering RMT or Horticulture. 

RMT has the potential to pay very well, with opportunity to work abroad, which is a goal of mine; but I do have some back & wrist issues, am pretty introverted, and the course work is pretty intimidating. 

Horticulture is very enticing because it’s something I’m interested in, I like being on my feet and being in nature (I also worked in a greenhouse when I was younger and loved it) but everywhere I read about careers in horticulture, the main complaint has been that it doesn’t pay well, and that worries me.
 
Tattooing I loved and wish I didn’t have to have left it. I still have my equipment, and even though it’s been a couple years since I’ve done it, I do have a small clientele base that I know would come to me if I got back into it. There’s also endless potential for working abroad once I have a few more years under my belt. The downsides are the pay can be inconsistent (and my country is barreling towards a recession which is worrisome) and there’s no possibility for benefits because I’d technically be self employed. 

I have no idea what to choose and it’s been wreaking havoc on my mental state. I feel so lost and I’m so scared of making the wrong decision. And what if horticulture or rmt also turn out to be bad choices? I really wish I could afford therapy to help me work this out. But I can’t, so I’m here.

1900f2q,In front of a dilemma,"Hello everyone,

I’m in front of a decision to make and I don’t want to make a major mistake here.

In 2022 I’ve got a seasonal job as a solar panel installer. Almost always 40h of work weekly. Hourly wage depending on a county that we worked. Average was $68-$88 per hour. Sounds amazing I know. BUT!! It’s not an all year job. In 2022 I worked 6months and earned $76K. In 2023 I’ve worked 5.5 months and earned $66K. There’s a lot of pressure, exploitation and physical hardcore. They don’t tell you when the season ends and basically from one day to another you end up on unemployment. Managers tell you nothing about the dates so you never know how long you’ll work there. Zero benefits.
Now, I found a union job that I’ve just started as a trailer mechanic. $28h, stable al year around job. Full benefits, 10 paid holidays, some sick days, 401K, medical/dental/vision etc. I’ve just started, I have a training of 90 days before I get officialy hired. As for now I love this workplace that seems organized and solid.
I’m single, no wife no kids and I won’t have kids. I’m 35.
We should start with the panels in February. I’ll have a dilemma what to do. Go for more money as a panel installer or stay where I am right now for much less money but more stability. Everyone tells me to stay where I am right now and to not go back to the panels but I know I would make more $$ there. 
I don’t know what to do and I’m afraid that doesn’t matter what I’ll choose I will regret it.

1st generation to go university 

Currently 6 months away from completing a bachelor’s in biomedicine 
Not from a prestigious university, id call it below average.

3 years total experience working part time:
1 year in a retail clothing store (£8 ph)
2 years in a commission based role for a large uk network (base £13ph incl commission £17-25 ph)

I have a position on hold which is a commission only role for a commercial property finance company that would be 0.2% commission to start (example 100k financing deal close = £200) (still unsure about this)

Currently planning on teaching myself project management and to take APM exams and possibly a scrum master course.

(Why you may ask i don’t really know if i want to become a scientist which is what my degree progresses to so i thought i may be able to enter at a management level for the science field)

Finances
I do have to maintain a household with my sibling however i have managed to save roughly £20k

I do want to get into real estate just from seeing it as a reliable method of growing wealth

I am extremely hardworking and adaptable and my main goal is to to be able to be comfortable and eventually retire by age 40-45.
(Comfortable to me is fully supporting parents, family,house,multiple cars, multiple holidays per year)

19000gm,FMLA leave? Other options,"Hi everyone! This is a throwaway account out of extra privacy.  Due to a meltdown on antidepressants recently prescribed, my family is sending me to an “intensive outpatient therapy” AKA outpatient rehab.  I’ve been working at a large company for just over 6 months in the state of New York.  I have about 19 days of PTO that can be used.  It is a hybrid workplace (3 days in, 2 days out).  My understanding is that I don’t really have any rights, and can be fired, since I don’t qualify under FMLA since it hasn’t been a year.   I can provide whatever doctor’s notes are needed.

I’ve worked really hard to get this job and it has provided so much stability. As you know, we all slip.  What are my options here? Do I have any? Anything I can BS or prove that will help me retain my job?  My company is going through a re-structuring so I’m worried about being laid off none the less

Any advice would be helpful. Happy to add more detail. Thank you!",HeadZealousideal9196,1,1.0,0,1704547785,2024-01-06 13:29:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/19000gm/fmla_leave_other_options/,1,2024
18zzgdu,Any Personal Trainers here that quit their previous job even if it was better pay?,"I've always been unsure of what I wanted to do in life and like everyone else who didn't either, I went for a business degree. After working 6 months in JP Morgan as an apprentice/intern, I realised how shitty and lifeless working in the corporate field is. But before going for the business degree I was interested in sports and thougth about going with a sports science degree but didn't because I  thought it wasn't a good career path (financially). But now I'm starting to realise that I don't really care about money that much. I just wanna do something I actually enjoy and that's in fitness. I noticed I enjoy helping my friends with their fitness journey cause I do have quite a bit of experience when it comes to fitness. I started working out in 9-10th grade and also am obessed with boxing. I was wondering if doing a PT certificate and becoming a PT is gonna be worth it. If anyone had similar experiences, could you share what you did and was it worth the move? Also what are some good and reputable courses I could take? I am thinking of becoming a PT but want to incorporate boxing in my career too.

18zygb5,What else can I do?,"Hey everyone. This may be a stupid question, but I don’t know what I’m looking for. My summarized work history is:

- fast food assistant manager
- document warehouse associate (real estate)
- tech support (over ten years), including developing and delivering training, presentations in front of 60+ people at a time, detailed failure analysis reports
- warehouse associate and forklift operator at grocery store

Some college with background in IT

I just would like a decent paying job that is not customer service. And while I realize I have a ton of customer service in my work history, I just can’t do it anymore. I have zero patience after the tens of thousands of phone calls and emails and chats over the years, and zero ability to even pretend anymore. But nobody seems interested in hiring me for anything besides customer service. Is there a lesser known job path that is worth looking into with a background like that, which doesn’t require anything in addition to that background just to get started in a non-customer facing position?

Looking to up skill myself in IT related skills in order to eventually look for another job in an It field, I’ve always liked the idea of being a Team Leader of sorts. 

Currently work as IT Help Desk, which is just standard IT assistance to customers, looking to up skill myself in a more administrative role, but not sure where to begin on what new skills.

Is there recommendations, on what I could research in my own time to begin practising, and would I need additional certification before applying for new jobs.

For reference. Current job pays around 70k, about 52k after tax, managers/bosses aren’t giving guidance or assisting anyone in the department about up skilling or reviewing PD (even though it has been talked about for years at this point), multiple people have left without replacement.

18zwci1,Can your boss's boss fire you?,"I was hired back in mid October. I thought everything was going okay, but today, my boss's boss came in and said I would no longer be working there. This completely blindsided me as I  had not been informed of any performance issues. I was told I did nothing wrong. I pressed further, and was told they wanted someone with more experience and that I did not take any notes - which is a lie, as I took lots of notes, and even started recording (with permission) training periods so I could refer back to the recording to make better notes. Im at a loss because I had no idea I was apparently failing at my job? 

The contract I signed was with my boss, not the person who fired me today. It's not right. There was no paperwork involved during my termination. Can I collect unemployment? Are they even in the right to fire me when there was no written evidence presented to me informing me that I wasn't adequately doing my job? 

An additional thing to add: I worked in a business setting and needed to dress like a business professional. A couple of weeks ago, my boss pulled me aside and said someone had told her that my pants always needed to cover my ankles, sitting or standing. She said she hated to tell me this as she thinks what I wear is cute. I wasn't written up for it. I also observed it was perfectly okay for other women's pants to show ankles but whatever...The day I was fired, I was wearing a pencil skirt (which I made sure was okay, and even brought a change of clothes, if necessary). My department is mostly women..

18zvj5p,Embracing Maturity: Sharing my reflection of professional growth.,"In the journey of professional development, it is inevitable to encounter various stages of personal and career growth. As a middle child, my life has been shaped by the distinct experiences that come with this birth order. The constant jostle for attention and validation within the family dynamics has fueled within me a default setting of proving and competing. In this exploration, I delve into the roots of these tendencies and the journey towards recognizing and managing these traits for personal and professional growth.  
  
In the initial phases of my career, I often found myself caught in the web of competition, not just with my colleagues but even with my superiors. The need to prove myself and assert my capabilities, deeply ingrained from the middle child experience, led me to engage in unhealthy competition, sometimes even with those who were meant to guide and mentor me. This competitive mindset, while motivating initially, hindered my ability to learn and collaborate effectively. Over time, I have learned to appreciate the value of cooperation and mentorship, understanding that true professional growth stems from shared knowledge and collective success.  
  
The fallacy of comparing oneself to every professional in the workplace is a common pitfall. As a middle child, this tendency to constantly measure my success against that of my peers was intensified. This mindset not only created unnecessary stress but also fostered an unhealthy work environment. Recognizing that each professional journey is unique and personal growth should be a personal endeavor, I have managed to break free from the shackles of comparison. This shift in perspective, influenced by the middle child dynamic, has allowed me to celebrate the achievements of others genuinely and focus on my own continuous improvement.  
  
One additional challenge I faced was the responsibility thrust upon me at a young age, echoing the middle child experience of carving out an individual identity. While some of my peers were still at entry levels, enjoying guidance from mentors, I found myself in situations where I had to take on significant responsibilities without the same support network. At times, this responsibility has been overwhelming, pushing me to mature professionally at a faster pace than anticipated. Despite the challenges, it has provided me with invaluable experiences that have contributed to my growth and resilience.  
  
One of the most pivotal changes in my professional growth has been the transition from reactive behavior to thoughtful reflection, influenced by the middle child's constant need for attention and recognition. In the past, I was quick to react to challenges and conflicts, often responding impulsively without considering the broader implications. This impulsive nature not only affected my decision-making but also strained relationships with colleagues. Today, I make a conscious effort to pause and reflect before responding. This newfound ability to step back and analyze situations has not only improved my decision-making but has also enhanced my leadership skills.  
  
It is essential to recognize that achieving this level of professional maturity did not happen overnight. It took hard work and time, and I consider myself fortunate to reach this milestone after a decade of dedicated effort. The journey was marked by challenges, learning experiences, and moments of self-discovery. This acknowledgment reinforces the understanding that growth is a continuous process, and each step forward is a testament to the commitment invested in one's professional development.  


My professional journey has been marked by a transformative shift in mindset and behavior. While it is crucial to emphasize that I am not a conceited person, the middle child factor has intensified the tendency to compare and compete with others. From competing with superiors and colleagues to letting go of the need to compare myself with everyone, I have learned the importance of collaboration and individual growth. Moreover, my evolution from a reactive individual to a reflective professional, coupled with accepting responsibility at a young age, has strengthened my resilience and decision-making capabilities. While I am still a work in progress, the strides I have made demonstrate my commitment to continuous improvement and the pursuit of maturity in the professional realm.",NorthWildling,1,1.0,0,1704530125,2024-01-06 08:35:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18zvj5p/embracing_maturity_sharing_my_reflection_of/,1,2024
18zvbp6,"Second interview didn’t go so well… worth it to follow up with my professional portfolio, or would that just look annoying?","Hi guys,

So I made it to the second (final) interview round of an internship I both really want and think I’m qualified for. Unfortunately I woke up with the flu today AND my power/internet went out (among other frustrations), so while I did make it to the Zoom meeting on time by going to the library, I was flustered/foggy and didn’t do a great job explaining my projects.

I am considering emailing a sort of “portfolio” (basically a PowerPoint with pictures/descriptions of some internship projects) and thanking them/explaining that I was under the weather and wanted to provide more clarity.

Is this a good idea, or will it just make me seem annoying/kill any remaining chances I may have? (The first interview, with a different lead, went really well.)

Thank you in advance. :(",professionaladv2,1,1.0,2,1704529297,2024-01-06 08:21:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18zvbp6/second_interview_didnt_go_so_well_worth_it_to/,1,2024
18zv7co,Career change / job frustration,"Well, I guess I'll start by venting my career frustrations. 

I studied a bachelor's in psychology and an MBA with focus in HR and worked for some years in HR, mainly in performance management and talent development. I ended up hating most of HR and I feel I didn't get any real experience in anything, just mostly did irrelevant operative work. 

I got married and emigrated to the USA for my husband's job, but I wasn't allowed to work here because I was on a dependent visa for about 10 years, which got me really frustrated too. So I decided to go to culinary school and loved it, of course I was still unable to work so I couldn't do anything in a professional level. 

A few years ago, when I finally got my work permit, I returned to the workforce, but mistakenly accepted a position that wasn't focused in my area, perhaps I rushed it and didn't think it thought. I felt that I needed to re-start somewhere and thought that it would help me find something better soon. I ended up doing mostly administrative work for almost 4 years, again, nothing relevant. I continued looking for a job in HR but I assume because of the gaps in my resume and lack of experience in this country, I didn't even get many interviews, and when I did, I wasn't selected.

After a lot of thinking about a career change, I decided to give it a try and took a job as a chef even when I was also getting a pay cut. I really thought it would be great for me to start doing what I love but it ended up being a fiasco: I loved the job, BUT my work place was extremely unsanitary, everything was broken, I didn't have tools to cook, didn't even have a working freezer, the person that hired me kept giving me the round around and didn't care about hygiene, she kept promising to fix the equipment and send a professional cleaner but that wasn't going to happen, she was pushing it further and further. So I frustratingly quit after about a month when I finally found another job in HR. Of course it was very frustrating for me, I really wanted it to work, I was really looking forward to a career change, but couldn't stand working in those conditions, everything in that kitchen grossed me out. 

Now, I find myself working at this company that I don't really care about, in a job that I don't really like, with a salary that I feel is very low and with very poor benefits. Just because I saw it as an opportunity for me to start growing a career in HR in this country. The thing is that I don't see myself at this company because I don't share its values, there's no opportunity to grow or move to a different area in HR, or even make a better salary or have better benefits. I've been there for nearly 3 months and I'm already bored, the work is tedious, it's the part of HR that I hate and I have no interest in learning it. HR here is just paperwork because it mostly has very low skilled workers and a lot of turn over so the company doesn't really value the areas that I like a little bit better in HR. 

A lot of people that knows me keep insisting that I should pursue my dream and start selling my food, but at this point I've given up the idea of changing my career to be a chef, I don't really have any working experience in that area and I don't want to be making minimum wage in my 40s, even though I know that's my true passion. Besides, I keep comparing myself with other chefs and I don't feel that great. 

I know my life decisions haven't been great. I mean, I don't regret getting married or moving to a different country. But I should've done some things different, like a better career choice (I've regretted my career choice many times), or perhaps volunteering as a chef or so. I feel that I waisted a lot of time, but what's done is done and there's nothing I can do about it now. 

I feel really frustrated about not doing what I love but I also have a desire of having a better compensation for what I do, and I don't think I can achieve that as a chef. Actually, at this point I'm very uncertain that I can achieve it at all, I really feel that I'm not good at what I do and that I don't have any relevant experience that helps me find a better paid job. 

Anyway, in one of my old jobs, I worked a little bit with analytics and I enjoyed it, so I'm thinking that it can be my area of focus and I'm starting to look for couses or a certification in people analytics to prove my luck in that area and maybe find a job that I enjoy a little and pays better. However, I'm still hesitant that it would help. So, I guess some of my questions are: 
	- Would studying a course help me find a better job pr do I need to get certified?
	- Would I need to start at the bottom again even if I have a little experience in the field but in another Country?
	- How long should I wait until I start looking for another job?
	- How should I justify my job change again? 
	- Should I not give up my dream to be a pastry chef? How would I do that? I don't even know how or where to start now.

I really been feeling trapped for many years now and I don't know how to continue. There are times where I just want to quit my job and be at home with my dogs, but I know for a fact by my previous experience that it wouln't make me happy either because I wouln't feel productive. So I keep getting up every morning, go to the office and fake it just to get a small pay check every two weeks, and again getting the feeling that I'm going nowhere in my career.",lgce07,1,1.0,0,1704528798,2024-01-06 08:13:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18zv7co/career_change_job_frustration/,1,2024

I really just wanted to post in this thread as I’m debating between going down a couple different sales paths and wanted some general advice from those who understand the industry.

With that being said i know with certainty that i want to be in as much of a client facing role as possible especially early in my career living in a big city ( truly open to living anywhere in the US). The two routes i keep debating are going down the ads route and trying to break into a tech company ( think google, Microsoft, Amazon etc.) in house associate program which combines account management ( helping preexisting clients with their ads on the platform and trying to get them to spend more) with an active sales role of getting new customers to advertise on the respective platform. I went to a pretty reputable university but still getting a job at a FAANG company out of university is pretty difficult so my first question would be where else do you guys recommend i look to get experience before going in house at a tech shop ( agency route never attracted me as making >45k does not seem feasible for my lifestyle). The next route i was considering with the boom in gen ai/ big data/ cloud etc. over the last few years was a career in Saas Sales ( think snowflake, mongodb, aws etc.) I’m not innately passionate about “the cloud” perhaps but i see the industry growing exponentially at this point and i truly believe in my ability to influence and sell so i thought just as a money hungry kid out of school it would be an interesting area to develop a skill set in.

Currently, I have an AAS in Industrial Automation Technology & Maintenance and am working on my BS in Engineering Technology Management.

Because of this, I decided to pursue a bachelors in ETM so I could still acquire a 4yr degree to pair with my AAS.
I understand graduates of ETM programs aren't considered ""Engineers"" by CE/ME/EE/etc, but it was the only option I have without attending sus online EE/ME programs. Am I wasting my time with this program?

Bonus question: would it be worth pursuing a masters in Industrial Engineering or Eng-Mgmt upon completion of this BS?

18zt8h2,Thinking of a change of paths,"I love my current job.. its in a small SIZE commercial construction company but does large scale projects. Us low level guys are all basically project managers but and we sub contract the labor. So my job is to put material lists together, order materials, read the plans and inform the workers on how to build it, and basically babysit the site all day and make sure everything is operating smoothly and on schedule. Each manager is typically running 3-4 jobs at a time and they are large scale commercial jobs, like hotels and stores, hospital remodels and stuff like that, i just finished 3 at home stores last year. 

We only have 3 estimators, 3 project managers, and 4 internal laborers that kinda do a little of what i do but on a small scale, basically my eyes on the job when im not currently there. So this company is small. So it’s literally like a family. They are real loose on the rules and work with you if you need help. Like we have a set amount of days off we can have before termination but say you are out of time off and you got sick or something came up they will be fine with it and it won’t risk your job. They are very generous and good people, they have even straight up just given me money before because i fell on hard times, just told me they will call it a bonus. The best company you can ask to work for honestly. 

The issue im facing right now is the pay isn’t keeping up anymore. The pay was doing great for me a few years ago but with inflation doing its thing its just not cutting it. The problem is inflation is hitting the company too. The material costs are very high right now and margins are thin. To add to that our subcontractors we use are having to raise the pay for their guys to keep good ones around so our labor costs are up too. And we have lost some of our best guys to bigger companies. So our crews are significantly less productive than before. Having to raise the bid prices to accommodate this makes it difficult to win jobs in this market. So they take thin margin jobs to keep everyone busy. So while we are making money still, it’s getting tight.

There isn’t a whole lot of room right now to ask for more pay. I want to ask for more because i think im worth more but I know what is going on in the company and how tight it is. Im currently a hair over 50k a year. Im still hourly at 24/hr. But right now 50k is the new 30k. Back when i got to this level i was doing good for myself, got a house and a truck and was living comfortably. But its super rough now. Also with this company since we are so small they cant find affordable insurance options so we get no insurance but we do get good pto and 401k with a match but thats the only benefit we get. 

I have been playing with the idea of leaving but it makes me sad to consider leaving such a great job ran by great people. I do love the job itself too. But i got a offer from my buddy who works at our supplier and it was for a boom truck operator for 120k/year. I thought about a little too long and they filled the spot. And was talking to this guy today at a food product trucking company we are doing a job for rn and he was saying their company hires for 80k/year just trucking in town and home every night. And for over the road positions like cross country they start at 100k+ with a 8k sign on bonus. Dude was ready to take down my info right then and there. It’s getting increasingly harder to stay on my current path when im getting these offers. Im also a certified pipeline welder because i went to trade school for that. So i have many options and I know im wanted in other fields of work. 

What is keeping me here is the fact that i have put in 6 years in this company and they are EVENTUALLY wanting to move me up to estimating and that position pays well. But they want me to gain more field experience before i move up and they need someone to replace me in the field if that happens. This can take a while. So what should i do reddit? Take these offers from big companies where i will become just another disposable employee. Or stay in this career that i have invested a lot of time in to with the hope of someday moving up the chain and making a good wage? The odds of me moving up are pretty much 100% but the issue is the current times. Business can go back to booming and we all end up making bank, its the nature of this business. So im afraid if I leave i will be capped at the other companies when if i stay i can be a part of that boom and have a lot of potential. I have been losing sleep because im constantly going over pros and cons. So what does reddit think of this situation?",oofboof2020,1,1.0,0,1704521394,2024-01-06 06:09:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18zt8h2/thinking_of_a_change_of_paths/,1,2024

Officially on paper, I have no relationship or connection to their org. But I feel like an unofficial intern. Over the past few months I’ve built chemistry with the team and their lead, and they’ve offered to be references when I go external. Ideally I would be an internal transfer, but we are currently on a hiring freeze.

On my resume, how would you present this unofficial intern-like experience? Would it be okay to include this under professional experiences and just give myself the title of “Intern, Department Name”?

18zq5qk,Feeling lost and a bit hopeless in my career trajectory,"I (26F) have had a tough break in my professional life thus far. I’ve had many jobs in my lifetime, and it took me about six years to finish my bachelors degree due to a myriad of financial and personal reasons. I have my BA in English and have predominantly been working marketing and communications jobs since graduating (about 3 years). 

Throughout undergrad, I deeply struggled with envisioning myself in a practical career. I was tormented by it, to put it lightly. I am a creative at heart and thrive most when I am making art. I’m a musician and a writer, and when I go too long without creating anything or pursuing my personal projects, I feel utterly hopeless and depressed. I want nothing more than to fully throw myself into my pursuits and try to make a living as an artist. However, I have had a financially tumultuous upbringing which was then extended to my college experience and hindered me from seriously pursuing an artistic career. I truly struggled through school. I switched my major a few times and eventually settled on English because it felt like the most generic yet versatile degree that I would genuinely enjoy pursuing. 

At 26, I have a lot of student debt, which feels insurmountable at times. I worked a paid marketing internship at the end of college and stayed there for about six months after graduating before finding a position through a temp agency doing internal marketing communications. I found the work unbearably boring. I don’t mind boring work, especially if the pay is decent, but the jobs I was in were eating up all of my creative energy, too. Marketing and comms is predominantly writing-oriented (at least the kind that I was doing), but it was a lot of mind-numbing technical writing and making presentations and such, and at the end of the day I didn’t feel like doing more writing for creative fulfillment. It was bleak, and I hated it. 

When my contract ended, I collected unemployment for a few months before going back to the marketing job I had interned for in college. I didn’t want to, but I was interviewing for a bunch of other positions and receiving zero offers. The place I had interned for offered me a temporary position, but it quickly became toxic and incredibly draining. I was overworked and underpaid and had no benefits or PTO (I even had to take unpaid medical leave for an emergency surgery). I was stressed and crying all the time (and I’m not someone who has ever cried over a job; I pride myself on maintaining a healthy relationship with work), and my partner eventually encouraged me to take a break. I took a barista job at a cafe near me and was able to quit the marketing job soon after. This was mid-2023, and I’m still at the cafe now.

For the majority of 2022 and 2023 I’ve been interviewing for countless jobs in marketing and communications, where I have the most professional experience. I am highly skilled and have a great resume and a beefy portfolio, I receive compliments from recruiters and hiring managers all the time, and I was consistently getting interviews. I’ve had at least 20 interviews with all different types of organizations from 2022 to mid-2023 when I picked up the barista gig. I was making it to the final round of interviews in most cases, and then I was either ghosted or politely rejected after enough follow-up email badgering. Most of the feedback I receive is that I was a strong contender but they went with someone who was a slightly better fit (usually someone who is grossly overqualified for the job, per my LinkedIn sleuthing). I’m essentially begging for jobs I’m not even that excited about and I’m not getting them. It’s exhausting, so once I got situated at the cafe I took a break from the job hunt for the sake of my sanity. 

I feel like the universe is telling me corporate jobs aren’t for me—which I can definitely get behind, but I need money. I know everything happens for a reason, and I truly feel I do not belong in a corporate environment for the rest of my life, but I’ve nearly drained my savings at this point and I have no clue what to do next. I started taking the Google IT certificate and was ruminating on doing something in that vein (I’m good with computers and it could be a nice change of pace), and I’ve also been contemplating attending grad school for some time now so I can be an English professor. I wish someone would tell me what to do sometimes, because I feel utterly lost at the moment. I just know I need a change of pace. The cafe job has been a welcome change and I genuinely enjoy it, but I can’t stay there long term due to finances. 

At the end of the day, I want nothing more than to pursue an artistic career—I follow musicians and artists who I admire on social media who are making a living pursuing their crafts, and I wish I could model their behaviors, but there is a mental block somewhere. I have enough common sense to understand that social media is mostly smoke and mirrors and doesn’t show the ugly side of these artists’ lives, but I admire the consistency and drive that some creators appear to have. I feel like I’m not prolific because I have it ingrained into my head that art is impractical and my wanting to pursue it is a product of childhood whimsy and I should just grow up already. It’s a mix of fear of failure and impostor syndrome and fear of homelessness, I suppose, and I likely would benefit from working through it in therapy, but I don’t have health insurance and can’t afford it out of pocket. 

Anyway, this was mostly a rant, and I am taking steps to continue with my passion projects whether I can make money with them or not. I just wish the whole figuring out my career thing was a bit simpler. I feel like I should have my life more figured out at this point, and it’s depressing.",jobgrievances,1,0.5,0,1704511417,2024-01-06 03:23:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18zq5qk/feeling_lost_and_a_bit_hopeless_in_my_career/,1,2024

18zotlh,Looking for Advice on Software Engineering Career,"I have a BS in computer science (graduated May 2023) and interned at a tech company the two summer (on a smallish team) before graduation working on mobile apps using C#. This company informed me that they would offer me a position come graduation, but the layoffs came and hit the team pretty hard so they weren't able to get a new hire in. I struggled to find a job and eventually was offered a system test position at a large company on the east coast with a decently sized tech department. I took the job thinking I would work there for a years and make the hop to a SWE job eventually.  
  
Well this past week my gf left her job and wants to move to pursue an amazing opportunity in another city (most likely Seattle area). My current testing job is not what I want to be doing for very long and a lot of days I really don't want to be working there, but I know the job market is very bad for new grads so I'm okay with it. If we left it would be around May, so I would have worked my current job for around 8 months.  
  
Would it look bad if I left my first job out of college after 8 months and how risky is looking for a job while you're currently employed? I'm very aware that I probably won't be able to find a job right away so how big of a gap would it take for future employers to be concerned?

18zooa2,Low GPA and low hopes,"Hi everyone, I am really struggling right now with my college gpa and I don’t know where else to turn to for help. I just graduated from osu, and was very involved in lots of extracurriculars with leadership roles but really struggled with classes ending with a 2.79 gpa. I have really bad depression and anxiety, and found out this summer that I have multiple personality disorder and bipolar as well and that I was actually dealing with addiction to self medicate for more than a year.

With school, I really struggled with motivation and feeling like I was worthy of getting a degree and used these as reasons to slack off and not do whole courses and get failing grades or withdrawal from classes with multiple of those being on my transcript. In my second to last semester I got a concussion and had to pursue intensive mental help but since it was so late in that semester it didn’t reflect in my grades. After getting help, my last semester of school I got almost all As and one B with 18 credit hours and 2 internships and ended college with a cumulative gpa of 2.79.

I found a passion for research in my last year and studied political science but I switched my major many times during undergrad and this led to me failing a few classes as well as I stubbornly tried to make courses fit that wouldn’t fit who I am. I really love learning but would struggle with courses with all I was juggling and putting my extracurriculars above coursework. I’m the first in my family to go to college so as I was getting these grades each year I’d feel embarassed compared to my straight As in high school but consoled myself with the fact that I was going to do better next semester and that all that matters was getting the degree but continuing similarly the next year. 

I don’t really have an end goal career wise but I definitely know I want to go back to school. I currently work at OSU and they pay full tuition for grad programs so I want to ideally do it here but the minimum gpa is a 3.0 with option to petition if you are below. I know I am interested in research or policy writing as I mentioned but I feel like I look like an idiot pursuing it with such a low gpa. 

Obviously hindsight is 20/20 but I have been torturing myself over this.  I wish I could have stayed an extra semester in undergrad to improve my gpa or that I would have gotten help earlier. The thing that is tearing me up as well is that so many people expressed concern to me for my health and I would push them away until this past year. 

I feel like such a failure and I feel so ashamed. I love school and I loved all the classes I took but I should have stopped to get help and dropped some of the extracurriculars. I have so much pain that I can’t go back to undergrad and take courses I am passionate about. I am for sure going to apply to grad school and petition the 3.0 rule and I am planning to take some non degree seeking courses too to show I am prepared. 

My big brother has always had high hopes for me like Fulbright or Rhodes scholar level hopes and he has no clue my grades. I’m so ashamed of myself and I can’t believe I let it get this bad. I want to achieve big things in my life and make a good income and do something I love but I feel like that is impossible now with my gpa and transcript. I am currently working a job I really don’t like as my first job out of undergrad and it feels like my life will forever be this painful.

I’d love any words of wisdom, speaking from personal experience or advice anyone has on how to deal with this and navigate. Thank you for reading this

18zo9e8,Feeling a little lost and would love some career advice!,"Hello there dear redditors, 

I come to you all looking for advice, big and small. 

A year and a half ago, I was suddenly let go from my job and I find myself still lost and listless. I was quite successful managing a sales team in my last job, and through a rewarding bonus model, it afforded me a pretty comfortable life. I was doing this for a couple of years, bought a townhouse, and because our team was so successful, I never really anticipated suddenly being out of a job. Then there was a swath of huge layoffs in fall of 2022, and all senior and mid-level leaders, as well as half of all agents on my team were suddenly out of a job. We live in the Seattle area and it is very expensive here.

It left me kind of reeling and forced me to reevaluate my career trajectory. My former career was kind of niche with few competitors. I had an eight hour interview (yes, eight hours) with a company in an adjacent industry, and it was similar to the all consuming, chaotic grind of my previous employer which did not feel like an good decision for my emotional wellbeing. 

I did my undergraduate studying Economics and Finance, emphasizing international economic development. After I was let go, I decided to invest in a data analytics certificate, and now I'm enrolled in an MPA program. I have a job at the university that I attend so tuition is free for me. 

The problem is, my mortgage and expenses are definitely higher than I can afford  with the salary from the University. My current job is fine, but the pay is worse than anything else I've seen, like $25k below similar roles in government, and I've gone from a bit worried to severe anxiety about bills. My partner works in non-profit and her salary is also under market value.  

I feel like I've applied for 1,000 different jobs across sectors; non-profit, philanthropic, for-profit, government, and no luck. I'm feeling a bit despondent. I think I have marketable skills, but this has been so humbling. It's wild to go from a position where you feel successful and important to making just above minimum wage and no job prospects. 

I don't know what advice I'm seeking exactly. Maybe you have a job that you love that's hiring? Maybe there are hard truths that I need to face? Maybe you would be willing to read my resume and make suggestions? It felt like maybe if I reach out to my internet community, a pathway may appear to me. 

Thank you for any and all advice! ",DeepSeaPearl,1,1.0,0,1704505937,2024-01-06 01:52:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18zo9e8/feeling_a_little_lost_and_would_love_some_career/,1,2024

Its been a while since i last got interview and i want this position so badly. I know i am prepared and can do the job, but the other candidates (its an internal position) are much more experienced (older or already have higher positions) 
I am confident that I can do the job, but the fact that Im not as experienced as others puts me nervous. I know the manager of the position. 

I come to request advice on how should my approach be. 

I want that position because i want stability (i work in construction, and i get to move every now and then), and i want a challenge. Im always challenging myself into personal goals and this now has become one, and I know the manager and me can work really good together. 
I just need someone to trust in my capabilities and to trust that I can excell in this position.

Thank you so much.",pipirisnais92,1,1.0,0,1704500899,2024-01-06 00:28:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18zmezb/most_important_interview_so_far_need_support/,1,2024

Yes I know I’ve probably lost out on opportunities and jobs because of it but also so believe doing that also set me up in the proper places to help advance my career and achieve those goals. I’ve gotten a lot of career advancement opportunities including manager and leadership training when I wasn’t even eligible for them because of how open I was about my ambition to move forward. I’ve even had one job allow me to conduct an interview with an applicant to give me experience and build up my skills because it was a job duty for a  position I wanted in a separate company. I’ve had either a supervisor or manager I’m under take me under there wing and teach me a ton and I’m really grateful for it.

18ziyss,Torn between opportunities…,"I’m a 26 F and I’m honestly one of those people who truly has no idea what I want to do with my life. My career is not going to be my legacy in my life. I know this, I am okay with this, I want to make a honest living and be able to enjoy my life and have a family. With that being said… I absolutely love my job that I currently have. I love the mission of the organization I work for, I get so much freedom in my day to day work and I’m not stuck in the office all the time. My current job is hard. It includes desk work and manual labor. I would be lying if I said I love being outside all day sometimes in the burning heat or the freezing cold doing that specific kind of work, but I get to help people when I’m doing that work and I LOVE THAT!!!  It’s so fulfilling. But it’s also a grant position and the end date is a year and a half away…. 

Well, my boss’s boss came to me the other day and asked me to apply and take a bigger role in the department I previously worked in. This role is completely opposite of what I currently do which is people based. It still involves customer service, but is not at all face to face. I would be at my desk 8 hours a day, leading 12-14 people who are under me every day, hiring, ensuring employees are meeting their metrics, enforcing the rules and policies of the organization, following corrective discipline, putting out fires, managing the drama between the folks, etc… Everything that comes with being a manager of a dozen or more people. It’s $3 more an hour than what I currently make. That’s not pocket change…but it’s also not a ton to make that much more responsibility look that great. Like I said, I have already worked in this department before. I know a lot of the people I would be over, and I get along great with most of them. This would also put me in line for more leadership/growth opportunities down the line… like they basically said they want to mentor me to take on a director position down the line (which would be in a few years). And that would be HUGE. 

I’m just so torn… between something that has the opportunity to be huge for me and my professional growth and my current position that I love, get so much freedom and autonomy with, and is basically my baby since I have been the one to grow it into what it is today. 😔💔 it’s just hard imagining passing on the reigns to someone else who might not have the passion for it and ensure the program is as successful as possible.

18zixuh,How to present career mobility project on resume?,"Generally speaking, I work in the accounting department and have zero interactions with the IT department. I have been a lot of self-learning, certifications, and project-based learning in order to try to achieve a state where I can introduce myself to the IT team and ask to shadow and for me to be a viable “intern”. No one has the capacity to hold my hand from point 0, I have to come to them and make it make sense right?

I have achieved this and after communicating with the team over several weeks, they feel that it’s worthwhile let me tag along, learn some things, and even complete a task/project or two. Everything is very unofficial. I’m still working full time in my accounting department, and I’m essentially learning and doing tasks for the IT team when I have time (or I’ll have to make up time to my actual department).

Due to the company being smaller sized and the company culture, everyone is very open about cross-functional relationships, but I’m positive I’m the first case example of anything like this happening. 

My question is, how do I present this unique experience on my resume moving forward? Let’s assume I work with them for 9 months, and I continue to become more and more involved. And I’m able to find an external IT opportunity before they’re able to internally transfer me (due to budget, openings, etc.)

Is it okay to list myself as a IT intern even though none of this cross-function job learning was officially on-paper as an “internship”? I’m so used to big companies doing everything very official and by the books, and this is my first time with this type of company culture.",JCTA618,1,1.0,0,1704492150,2024-01-05 22:02:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18zixuh/how_to_present_career_mobility_project_on_resume/,1,2024

for example, i love to study about cyber security, software engineering, systems level programming,  
web 3 development, AI/ML, linux systems and opensource.

i love to create stuff/projects related to CS, and have fun with my CS skills, i want to learn so much in this field, but,

ques 1:  my college takes all of my time, attendance, useless assignments, college studying and during my learning i have lost most of my friends, as i give all my time to CS, i don't want to live all by myself so how to handle this?

ques 2: I love to create stuff in CS, but i always get scared by the thing that in few years i had to work 8 hrs a day 6 days a week in a company, leaving behind everything, this feels like i am gonna spend all my life sitting on desk in front of screen, like i am growing too fast!, is there a solution?

ques 3: lot of people told me to don't go into many sub-fields of CS, that i mentioned above, they told me to specialise, but i sometimes love one more then other, and sometimes love another and learn about that, is it important to dive into one field only if i want to make career in CS and earn well enough money?",ActOld5734,1,1.0,2,1704488790,2024-01-05 21:06:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18zhlnk/love_computer_science_but_scared_to_follow_it/,1,2024

On one hand, since sophomore year I have been working with our film/broadcasting teacher and my with districts “creative guild” director to become very successful in film, photography, editing, producing, I have learned a little of it all. I have won over 30 different awards in state and national level competitions for my videos. Many assume this is what I want to go into, and would major in film/journalism/media, i’m not exactly sure. I feel that if I went this route I could either love it or hate it. I know that I don’t want to sit at a computer all day and worry that I would get bored easily. I’m not even sure what I would end up doing especially because I live in Michigan and don’t want to leave the state so I can stay close to family. On the other hand, I really enjoy working with kids and enjoy being around them. I don’t want to go into education so that only really leaves me with the healthcare field. I believe that I would genuinely enjoy being a pediatric nurse and I also plan to go to nurse practitioner school. I think being a nurse will provide me with a much more stable and better paying job than doing something with film/social media. I also really want to travel and have a family one day and from what I understand, a nursing schedule will be much more flexible and a higher income.

18zc3vy,Did computer science but now I'm up shit creek. Idk why people recommend this.,"I fell for computer science / college degree path, and now feel like I'm up shit creek.  

We've been pretty much told we'll be getting laid off within a year, and as many of us know, the tech market is incredibly challenging now to get  into.  I see non-stop nightmare posts from people who can't get interviews, with the same or more amount of exp as me (4 yrs). I don't have a ton of exp with the hot new tools and frameworks that people like to see, and I'm not a LeetCode genius. 

Overall, I feel I have low chances to get back into the tech industry once I'm laid off.

Getting older and have no transferrable skills to go into a different career.  My only other experience has been in food service and outdoor landscaping (mowing lawns), which are both some of the lowest-wage jobs where I am.  

I am not good with people and they tend to instantly dislike me.  Social careers like sales or management are not for me.  I am not good with my hands and struggle to put things together. Also on the older side now. Strenuous hands-based careers like the trades are probably not for me.  I am not a genius at tech, have just gotten lucky with finding jobs when the market was hot, and feel i cannot compete well in this industry at this point. 

Not sure where I fit into society at this point, or what I can contribute.  I feel that if I would have done trades right out of high school, I would probably be perfectly fine, but I'm too old now for that to be reasonable.",Zealousideal-Mix-567,1,1.0,43,1704475131,2024-01-05 17:18:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18zc3vy/did_computer_science_but_now_im_up_shit_creek_idk/,1,2024

18zagyo,Im an indian who wants to pursue math,"
Hey!

My question is: What career opportunities do I have if i pursue math? 
Will JEE be required for colleges if im pursuing math? If yes, Is it always required or just sometimes?
I dont mind preparing for, and writing JEE since it also gives me opportunities for engineering.

Anyways, heres context:
Im in 10th grade and a JEE aspirant of course. I love maths and chemistry, and like physics too.
My parents suggested i try for engineering, and according to them my life is set if i get into an IIT or other prestigious colleges.
They highly encourage me. They are giving me integrated entrance coaching in 11th and 12th.

My problem is, engineering is not my interest. Software engineering is good but otherwise im not interested in it.

My primary interest is math. I want to learn more. Maybe get a PhD and whatnot. I discussed this with parents and my dad advised against it, telling me that its a risk. He told me i wouldnt make nearly as much money pursuing math.
And i myself am not sure what career opportunities i will have by pursuing math. Im not  worried about salary as long as it's 1 lakh +

Im not sure whether my parents have my best interests here. My interest is mathematics. Thats what i want to study and i wish to contribute to mathematics, if possible.",wizenium,1,1.0,5,1704471052,2024-01-05 16:10:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18zagyo/im_an_indian_who_wants_to_pursue_math/,1,2024

18z9rz1,Im stuck with a job that makes me feel miserable. How can I transfer my skills?,"I'm stuck with a job that makes me feel miserable. How hard is to transfer my skills?

I am 27 and I work for a small advertising company where I don't have a vertical knowledge but do different mansions: I make professional PowerPoint marketing presentations and reports, I do a little of social media management, I assist in budget allocation for the campaigns, I recruit talents for the campaign, I manage some clients relationship and coordinate the teams on some projects,I manage influencer marketing campaigns and I buy out of home advertising spaces as well as programmatic advertising. I decide where to spend the money but I don't know how to properly manage the Google ads campaigns myself (I took some courses but I never had the chance to apply my knowledge). Being a small company I'm not sure what even my role could be, I'm presented to clients differently based on what it's needed at the time which makes me a bit insecure. Maybe it's worth mentioning that I hold a degree in communication and media.

I recently realised though that I don't really like this job, makes me feel worthless and gives me no satisfaction. I don't think I like the idea of ""marketing"" in general and makes me feel like I'm just wasting lots of money on nothing... I think I'm quite good at my job but I can't help myself to like it.

One thing I really enjoy at work but also outside of work is to deal with technical issues: when there's a software issue at work I'm super excited to try and fix it and generally to find solutions when technology doesn't behave how it's supposed to. My friend recently got a Steam deck and had some issues with it and I was very happy to help him figure it out. There's nothing that excites me more of solving these kind of issues, I could spend hours trying to make something work and when it does makes me feel really fulfilled and proud of myself.

Is there any way I could make a living out of this without getting a degree in IT? Maybe any courses I could do that could give me some certificates that could help me get a job in this field? Is this industry oversaturated and do I have any chances to get a job even if I don't have proper experience in this field or if I'm not résumé ready?

If not, given my current position, are there any industries l I could apply my skills to that aren't purely marketing related?

We got a client with a team of people who do my job, but they are struggling to attain the goals their leadership set for them so they came to my agency for help. The team I’m working with is based in another country, so time zones are a bit of an issue for scheduling calls but we’re trying to make it work. There have been several instances where I have explicitly given them permission to documents to review structures, keywords, ad copy, and landing pages for their QA as well as any transfer of historical knowledge that may be important for me as I restructure their accounts, and I received no response from them even after several discussions. This becomes an issue when they then claim that the documentation was never shared (despite screenshots and numerous slack threads). Other issues include:

- ignoring requests for additional context in changes they have made
- ignoring or even outright denying that they were warned of a change being made (again, screenshots have been taken to disprove these claims to their leadership)
- saying things like “we hope to have a productive discussion” when they have ignored or declined meeting invites

Now to be clear, I don't think I have the experience to justify the upper end of that range.

I'm hoping the fact that I came in lower will benefit me during the decision making process, but I'm wondering how much higher I could realistically ask for if they extend an offer for $150k.

The bonus is higher than I anticipated, but because it's based on salary I feel like by not negotiating the highest salary possible, I'm potentially losing out on a lot of money.

18z3xt6,Toxic work environment at the gym,"Hey there, I don't know if this is the right place to ask but I have no idea where else to turn to.

So I have been going to the gym for the past year and its a local gym in my local town so not like basic fit or anytime fitness or any of those big gym companies it is the only gym the owners have. First time I got there I remember the owner, I'll call him Richard from now on, had this personality where he is always yelling and thinks he knows best and I thought it would settle down if I just stayed calm with him and be very polite, which I did but this kept going on but I did not have too much trouble with it because when I knew some exercises I wouldn't talk to him other than saying ""Hi"" when I got there and saying ""Bye"" when I left. 

After about 3 months the wife of the owner, I'll call her Anna, who is also there regularly talked to me and said that they are looking for some people to watch over the gym when they are not there and clean a bit. At the time I was busy with school and working for a local farmer so I did not have time and I did not really want to work there. 

So going forward to about a month ago when my dumbass asked Richard if they are still looking for people to watch over the gym because the work at the farm had ended because it is winter season and I thought it would be some easy money since it paid a bit more than the farm and I just had to clean a bit. So there I went for the first few times working there, I could make homework even workout myself while I was there so I thought it was perfect. 

But the owners also have a security company and have camera's everywhere in the building which is not a problem but they keep watching me and calling me and criticizing everything I do.

For example yesterday I was there and we have this cleaning checklist and they ask you to do a couple of things you see that isn't done this week. So I looked at the list and decided to mop the showers since that hasn't been done this week, so while I was doing that the phone ringed and I pick up and it's Anna and she starts yelling at me over the phone and saying why are you mopping the showers when nobody showers and that I should be doing something USEFUL and clean the lockers and then she just hangs up.

And Richard told me that all of us do not clean well and that we check things on the list that we have not done while we actually did and then just keeps yelling at me over other things and I stay very calm and very polite and just keep saying ""Yes"" and nodding and ""Okay, I'll keep that in mind"" etc etc.

I hate those people but I am afraid of telling them because I don't want to work there anymore because they said they wanted an extra day off on friday so I work on fridays for the foreseeable future they said and I know they are going to be really fucking mad when I tell them this also because Richard is a unit of a guy and I am afraid of what he will do and I am afraid I can't go to the gym anymore and the second closest one is 30min cycling while this one is 2min plus this one is local and not too busy.

Now I want to study for my masters degree abroad (I live in italy) I do it for myself as a personal goal but also for making an experience abroad, now I know that probably a msc in marketing wont boost my career much (at leaast is not worth the 15/30k). Could be better if I really want to study for a master degree to choose another course like: Business Analytics? What do you think would be the best choice or a good alternative?  
I aim to work as a marketing / product manager in a big tech company, someday. And I also consider becoming a freelancer when i'm older.  
  
The countries I've considered are the UK / US, I've already selected a few schools to apply, but i'm still open to change route so any consideration is accepted (even tips on my working career), I would like to move to London / US , but I can study in other countries too, especially if they are less expensive.

I started this job back in early October and it’s been my favorite job ever. I absolutely love it. However I have already been forced to take off a day in November as well as a day last week due to family/pet circumstances. My boss was kind of irritated me with this last time.


Today I’ve been having flu symptoms all day at work including cough, fever, aches, chills, general fatigue. I’m debating going to urgent care and testing for the flu in the AM but a part of me doesn’t even want to because I don’t think I can miss anymore work. I don’t think I would get fired necessarily, perhaps I would, but it would be a very very bad look considering my most recent absence last week.

18z2870,Long haul ahead... 28 years until retirement.,"Hello, all good people! I was wondering: how can you manage working 30–40+ years if you are not ""lucky"" enough to have a job that satisfies you? I am 36 years old and have 28 years left until I can officially retire, and I honestly cannot even fathom how I will manage that. I've been working full-time since I was 18 years old, and I've had part-time jobs since I was 15 or 16.  
I was a graphic designer most of the time, stumbled across the profession by accident, and stuck with it for about 14 years—until the creative process and dealing with clients completely chewed me and spat me out.  
I then started looking for other options and landed on a bit more technical side of things instead of creative, still dealing with clients, but not so intensively.  
However, I must say this is nowhere near my ""dream"" job; it's just there to pay bills. It does not satisfy me or make me feel fulfilled. I work within a team, and some of my co-workers really have a lax attitude towards the job, which irritates me to no end. I am introverted and would really like something where I could be responsible for my own results without having to deal with similar things.  
I have no idea what I would like to do; I just know what I don't like. Therefore, it's very hard for me to think about other careers, and when I think of the time frame of 28 years left, I already feel kind of down and defeated. I am working towards investments, which should help me retire a bit earlier if everything goes well.  
But the fact of the matter is, I will have to work one way or another; I just have no idea what I will do for the rest of the 28 years.

18z1228,Struggling to decide between two internships,"Hi! I'm currently a 3rd year computer science student, and I am having trouble deciding between two internships that I've accepted. I don't know who to reach out to. I'm scared to talk to Career Services at my university, since one of the companies has a campus recruiter. 

Job 1 is a Cybersecurity Consulting internship with a Big 4 accounting firm. It doesn't sound like a position that involves a lot of technical knowledge. I'm also pretty introverted, I hate presenting, and I don't know if consulting is something that would be for me.

Job 2 is a Cyber internship with a defense company. They seem to have fairly good reviews online, but I've gotten a bit of a strange feeling from my communications with them. The initial interview was cancelled and rescheduled 3 times on very short/no notice, and on one occasion, I sat in the call waiting for an hour. (I received an email several hours informing me that the interviewer was unable to join.) They also accidentally sent my offer letter to somebody else (and didn't realize for several days) which gave me only around 2 days to make a decision. 

Neither of the positions are in software engineering, which is what I think(?) I want to end up doing, but I just accepted them in case I ended up with nothing for the summer. I'm still applying for Software Engineering internships, but I haven't managed to get an offer.  I also have no experience with cybersecurity, and my only previous internship experience was an IT internship that just involved fiddling around with Excel. 

I'm really stressed out about the whole situation, and it would be really great if somebody could offer some advice. Thank you!",canolasea,1,1.0,1,1704439432,2024-01-05 07:23:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18z1228/struggling_to_decide_between_two_internships/,1,2024
18z07un,Feeling very lost in career at 30,"I, 30 F, am feeling very lost right now.

I graduated with master's in accounting, but I really suck at accounting. I chose a safe career path where I thought I will have the most likelihood for success. I worked at a small audit firm for a year after that and worked in a small family business for around 3 years. I quit my job 4 months ago because I really couldn't tolerate the work environment and have been unemployed since then. My resume shows one and a half year of employment gap in total since my graduation. 

I used to be very ambitious, diligent and passionate while in school and early career of my life. I did my internship since high school up to college, but the more I grow up the more I feel helpless. I even sacrificed my dating and social life for my career because it used to mean so much to me. I wanted to have a corporate job, move up the corporate ladder and eventually start my own business. I did have opportunities to work at big firms, but due to personal reasons or being eliminated at the last round of interview, I didn't end up working there. I regretted choosing a small family business and turned down working at a big firm. Currently, my resume has nothing much to show, and moreover, has gaps of unemployment, including the current one. Looking back, I was always working hard and in a rush, and always chasing for the next opportunity but they all seemed to somehow slip. I don't know what to do anymore, and I am severely depressed.

I have expressed my concern to my manager, but it seemed like she took it as an attack (to the person who was capable to help me but did not do so)

18yxhwj,My boss logged into my Amazon account and placed $1000+ orders without my knowing,"A little context

I’ve been on vacation since Dec 15. It’s supposed to end early next week. Prior to this, I gave my boss and all necessary parties a 3+ week notice that I will be unavailable and that I will be checking my emails sparingly but to request all parts needed till mid January to be safe. Some people did this but I found out the day before my last day that my boss told the other parties to not place any orders and didn’t even inform some people that needed to know. 

In the beginning, I spent a week and a bit of my vacation logging in working for about an hour here and there. I haven’t worked since then. Yesterday, I started getting a couple email notifications that multiple orders were placed on my Amazon account. This account is under my corporate email with my password and it is not shared by anyone. Everything on these orders were also charged to my work credit card. I don’t believe my card has been hacked since everything ordered js what we’ve ordered in the past.

Also no one reached out to inquire about needing these specific parts at all.

My questions are:
Is this illegal?
Should I bring this up to HR? If yes, how?
How do I bring this up to my boss to let them know this isn’t ok without getting fired?

Bottom line, I don’t want to get fired but I’m pretty fucking pissed as this could have just been ordered on their Amazon account instead.

I enjoy the field of work I am in as I've been in it for over 10 years now. At first I thought ok, this is going to be great longterm, i know theres going to be challenges but i got this. Trying to be positive with a fresh start and new environment.  I was paired to work alongside one of the established, employees within the firm they said needed some help.  After a few days of training and was put with her, almost every day I've been working along side her she's always got some kind of negative outlook, nitpicks quite a bit, seems most of what i do needs to be redone to her liking, is honestly rude and deaming in the way she speaks to me about my job - just all around seems really like an unhappy person and its starting to weigh on me, as in being around her all the time being so negative and just unhappy - it truly sucks.  I've almost about had it so I contacted HR twice, and spoke about my concerns long term because it's actually starting to affect my actual work due to how she wants things her way but it doesnt seem to have been an effective suggestionor solution... I start each day doing my job based on how I was trained and I guess it doesn't meet the standards of what she's expecting of me with her files so I'm trying to appease her in some way to make her happy with how she wants things done in her files/routines all the while my trainer/HR is saying do it the way I was trained but now it just feels like a big cluster of a messy situation especially trying to lonitor deadlines and always having to backtrack.  So it starting to feel like a tug of war(?) With how to do the job.  Also, I guess it came to light the person I work with was not utilizing the internal software for her file management documents so that's something they are focusing on more than anything.   I don't know, the job itself is fine but my partner is awful no matter what i do ro try and make it work.  What would you do?

I also don’t really have any undergraduate student loans, so I’m more open to taking out some for grad school… idk what do yall think. Am i making a big mistake going to grad school? The positions i want to be a lot of them require masters degrees like the $150k+ paying jobs . I thought about my MBA but … i like this other program much better. Any advice is helpful. Thanks!

Even If I finish my degree I won’t land my target job (working for a FAANG or another tech company), non-target college, average grades, no experience (I have to aim to internship or junior positions) and thats my feeling in my entire life never is enough and/or mistakes were made and I can’t change it.

All my friends living their best lives (finishing PhD, getting married, meeting new people, hell even those that bully me they seem successful with their family and business). Basically the best you can do in your 20’s but I literally I did nothing. Even I think I had to do a different degree because corporate world is more structured (to start working at a large bank or at Google than say as nurse or physician) and I might not “fit” there even if is my professional dream.

Thats why even I have thinking a lot lately on suicide comes to my mind a lot because I won’t recover my years lost (my 20s), my professional career might never take off to start thats why I think a lot on suicide because I think there are little room to my goals even If I fix things from the past, those times never will return again. Or on how much impact had this on my self-steem I can’t have healthy relationships with another men :( I had my last boyfriend does 10 years old and I feel better alone.

I'm a 31-year-old guy who's spent most of his career in the exciting world of Marketing and Communications. However, life threw me a curveball in May 2023 when I got laid off. Since then, I've been on a bit of a job-hunting adventure, going through about 50 interviews and getting close a few times, but sadly, no job offers yet.  
I live in a cozy town in Ontario, surrounded by other small towns, all nestled by the lake and Blue Mountain. The challenge is that there aren't many opportunities in Marketing/Comms around here, so I've been applying for remote positions within Ontario.  
Now, I've recently come across something called ""The Better Jobs Ontario"" program by the government, which supports 52-week Ontario college programs. I'm considering making a move to broaden my skills and horizons or change my career. 

The programs that caught my eye are in Supply Chain Management (super interesting to me!), HR Management, and Bookkeeping.

I'm reaching out for advice and wondering if anyone has been through a similar situation or has some valuable insights to share. I'd greatly appreciate any advice or thoughts you might have!

18ywedu,How to have professional conversation with boss about raise and hours?,"I started a job a year ago, I am 23, it’s a Project coordinator job in NY. 

I started out as a project coordinator making 60k. Then I was tasked to take over the safety department, traveling to job staying a few days at a time, then I was asked to learn a special program for surveying jobs ( they previously paid a company 2 per job to do so) , now they want me to get into entry level estimating. When I started the hours was 7-3 now as an “estimater” my hours are 9-5. And pay has been the same. 

I am coming up on my one year and want to draft a very good argument for a raise and also preferably 7-3 hours ( long story but I have a really good side job that can pay up to 1/3 my weekly pay working evenings. If I’m 9-5 I loose that money). 

My intial thought was to ask for a compensation adjustment, not raise, ( sounds better) and ask for 75k and end up with 70 k With my 7-3 hours. 

I have a feeling that’s a big ask, but to stay at my 9-5 means I would need to make at minimum. 15k to break even with what I’m doing now. So it’s a large raise with realisticly no real benefit in the big picture. I would probably ask about 80k plus a week extra pto to stay 9-5 which is a huge jump I do realize. 

How do you approach these conversations? I feel bummed that all of a sudden I have to negotiate back my original hours which makes me seem like I’m asking for more than I should be as 7-3 was the standard all this time.

This is fine however there are times where I've had to stay even as a full team working as we had a lot of work. 

Now one of our key team members is quitting and today he apparently applied for ""pto"" none of which was approved by our management btw as my boss and manager were confused by his absence. The other important member was actually on vacay, and another one was wfh doing who knows what as he was away on teams most of the day. It was just me and one other coworker and we ran our respective folders with all the work accumulated from the others. I ended up staying like 9 hours.

Today my boss sat me down and asked if I would stay at the company converting to full time but I was very unsure as the pay in this dept ranges from the high 40ks to mid 50k range. I think this isn't really fair compensation for how much work we do.

18yveoi,Former colleague in the same role received a higher salary than me?,"I was working a two-year contract in a bit of an interim role in the department as my manager was serving as an interim in another, higher up role in another department. 

After 18 months into the contract, without movement on the position becoming permanent and general chaos in the department (not due to my doing, primarily because we were understaffed and under resourced), I accepted a permanent position elsewhere, in a different industry, in a new city to be closer to my boyfriend. 

A new person was hired into my former role and was placed on a 1-year contract. This new individual lasted 6 months before resigning due to the understaffing and lack of resources in the department.

My manager approached me, essentially begging for me to come back, and assured me that it was very likely that the position was to become permanent within the next few months. I accepted, and returned to my former position, on a 6 month contract, as I am really hoping to get back into this field (higher education) and wanted to move back to my hometown to be closer to family. 

I recently found out that the individual who was hired to replace me when I left was receiving a higher salary than me. I am confused as to why this would have been permitted, seeing as I had previous experience with the role and company, and we both have the same professional qualifications.

I feel hurt and want to bring this up to my manager. I know she was receiving a higher salary as I was looped into an email chain with HR discussing my salary and her salary that I probably shouldn’t have been sent.

18yv4jz,negotiating a job offer with Groupon,"Hi all, posting on behalf of a colleague- she is talented, and has 15 years experience as a lawyer prior to joining tech sales at my company.  She was exceeding quota at my company and was laid off (reduction in force) along with other top performers.  


Groupon made her an offer yesterday for an Account Executive role. The base is 40K and the variable is 10K and there seems to be a dispute about whether or not the variable is uncapped.  


She doesn't have any other job offers lined up, really needs a job with an Account Executive title, and is wondering is it worth embarking on a negotiation with them under the circumstances?

18yv2qu,"There's already not enough work for my team do, but they're hiring another new member. Is that good news or bad news?","I am on a team of 5 people at a tech company (plus one manager, for 6 total). I regularly only have about 2-3 hours of work per day, which I've learned to stretch to look/feel like 4-5 hours (I swear that's the best I can do to pretend to look busy). I know this is the case also for the other 4 non-manager members of my team.

I'm the newest member on the team, and after about 3-4 months on the job, I realized that there are really too many of us for the amount of work available. We need probably 3 people max to be productive and busy without being overly stressed. Honestly, the two most productive members of the team could manage everything alone, but that'd be starting to push them toward burnout.

My manager recently announced that they've started a job search for a 6th member to the team. They haven't announced any new projects or given any reason other than ""we need more bandwidth to cover our current workload."" They've assured us no one is getting fired or replaced by this new hire. But, given how underutilized we all are already, I can only imagine a new hire is going to make that problem even worse.

You might be thinking ""gee, only 4 hours of work a day sounds great."" But my goodness is sitting there at my desk pretending to work for 4 or 5 hours every day so exhausting and numbing. And now it will only get worse with another person sharing the already thin workload.

I’ve mentioned in passing to my director a few times that I’m ready to take on more work but I don’t think it was caught. 

I’m afraid that I threw away my last job for one that isn’t going to be sustainable.

18yt614,Did I shoot myself in the foot?,"Ive been at my job for 3 years. I'm currently wondering if I just demoted myself at work.

I work in a water testing lab and we recently hired a wet chemist assistant/floater. Over the past month the lead wet chemist has pawned off her new assistant to learn my work because she doesnt feel he is competent enough to do her work. I'm also a lab technician but I don't have a direct department, I'm just overworked and run a bunch of different water analyses around the lab. 

So I brought up the idea, what if I teach him 80% of my job and then I can become her assistant to which she responded, that originally I was hired to work with her but the lab manager decided to teach me other analyses since that was the main priority at the moment. Well after that, she reached out to the manager who told that he was okay with the idea and that the more cross trained everyone is the better.

Now I'm discussing the situation with my husband and he's telling me, it sounds like I just gave myself a demotion since I'll be under someone instead of left to my own work. We haven't finalized the change as the new hire doesn't know yet, so I'm wondering if I should back out when I go in tomorrow or see where this goes.

18yskqr,Should I drop and restart my undergrad degree elsewhere?,"So I messed real bad.... extremely bad. 

I'm in first year engineering at the University of Toronto and failed one course and got Cs in the other two. I haven't received the grades for Calculus but I'm pretty sure I failed that as well. Thank God I dropped one course otherwise I would've failed even that.

Based on this my GPA is coming out to be around 1.08. Terrible would be an understatement for this. Now this disaster happened because of a lot of reasons. I'm an international student and due to a few personal issues back home I joined uni 3 weeks late. Catching up was a nightmare and I was struggling until the very last day. I was also diagnosed with depression and anxiety only a few days ago for which I was given some medications. All of this contributed to my pathetic performance. My high school average was 95% so dropping from there to this hit me like a truck and Idk what to do.

I'm thinking of dropping out completely and just restarting my undergrad elsewhere (maybe USA) because I don't think I can make a comeback from this unless I score a 4.0 every semester which is very unrealistic. I'm afraid I'll mess up my life if I continue here. My parents are fine with me restarting so that's not an issue but I'm just so clueless right now.

18ysi9d,"""senior"" coworker makes more money than me but does the exact same work as me. how do i approach a salary adjustment?","Hi all! This is not quite as straightforward as ""coworker and I do the same work but they get paid more"" so hang in here with me.

I (late 20sF) work at a small company in a department of less than ten people. I was hired for decent pay in a mid-level position, and a year later my coworker (late 30sM) was hired into the same position but as a ""senior [job title]."" I have worked at the company cumulatively for several years; coworker was an outside hire so has been here for a year now.

When they started hiring for the senior version of my position, I asked what the difference was between my position and this new one, and my manager said basically more experience and a different pay bracket.

So, coworker was hired. He has worked in the industry for years, and seems to have applicable experience, so I accepted that he would probably start getting more responsibilities and take more leadership roles compared to me. I waited a year to see how things would go, but so far this coworker is doing the same exact tasks as me - we basically just split all the work I previously did by myself. They don't take any leadership roles or take much initiative to start/suggest projects or voice ideas. (And it doesn't seem like this is changing anytime soon.)

I can't help but compare our positions, work product, and pay and feel slighted. I have more responsibilities, produce more content, and take the lead in more projects than my coworker. In fact, a year into the job, he is still under constant supervision/instruction from my manager - basically still in training (for comparison, I was left to work entirely independently and started picking up my own projects just a few months after starting in my position). My manager seems to trust me more since they give me more tasks/projects and more responsibilities than my coworker, and I work closely with my manager fairly frequently, sometimes even picking up some of their smaller tasks when they are busy.

It's a fact that I produce at least the same quality, quantity, and type of work that my ""senior"" coworker does. The only difference between us is our experience level - but I still put out more/better work than him (I require no supervision/instruction, rarely have edits/corrections, etc.)

I feel like I have a strong case for a pretty significant salary adjustment and/or title change. However, what's the best way to approach this? I've read that it's not good to compare your pay to your coworker's when asking for a raise. However, in this case, I want to outline the value I add to the department, lay out my accomplishments/successes, list my current responsibilities/tasks/projects, ask for the raise, and say that I believe my proposed salary adjustment is fair based on my work/etc., based on the estimated salary median for my job in my area (based on Salary dot com), and based on the fact that the senior position does the same tasks as me with the same quality/quantity/type of content. So basically saying that I do the same job to the same/higher degree of excellence as the senior version of my position. Would this approach be smart? I don't want to make a big deal out of my coworker making more money or start comparing specifics or throw him under the bus in any way, but I want to draw attention to the comparison of our work and pose the question why it is that this position/coworker gets higher pay for the same type of work.

Some context: My department's work product is very tangible and we all review everything that everyone works on, so it's easy to measure my productivity/quality of work compared to my coworker. It's a very transparent work process. Also, I love my job and do not plan to leave. I make enough money and am not necessarily unhappy with my salary, but I'm pretty bothered by the principle of the matter. I'm aware moving companies is the best way to achieve higher salary, but I don't want to do that.

TLDR: My coworker is in the same position as me, but labeled as a ""senior [my job title]"" and is in a higher salary bracket than me. However, they do the same tasks as I do with the same level of productivity/quality of work. I also have more responsibilities and take on more projects than him, take the lead more, my manager trusts me more, etc. How do I approach a salary adjustment and/or title change? Would it be a good idea to focus primarily on my quality of work but still mention of the fact that the senior position and I do the same job, but I do it for less pay? Since this is the driving inspiration of my request, I feel strongly about mentioning it, but don't want to throw anyone under the bus or make it my sole argument, obviously.",Confident-Peace-1650,1,1.0,3,1704413538,2024-01-05 00:12:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ysi9d/senior_coworker_makes_more_money_than_me_but_does/,1,2024
18yshsm,New employer and a pay bump or a promotion with my current employer?,"I’ve been with my current employer for 2 and a half years now at the same salary (70k Canadian) The only way to get a raise is to get a promotion, so I proposed new duties and a salary target to them and they agreed this was a good next step for me. However, I’ve been badgering them for over 8 months for the sign off on a promotion. 

Last month I took an interview at a new employer that is fairly new and they have all but confirmed they would like to sign me on at (possibly) 100k Canadian. This would be a lateral move with the exact same title, but I would basically be the only person in the company doing what I do. 

The only issue is that a few weeks ago (after my interview) my employer finally decided to give me the promotion and give me a raise (80k Canadian). This title carries more weight and may give me future opportunities when interview, it also looks great on a resume that I was promoted. 

So I’m wondering — what’s more worth it? Stick it out with my current employer and work this job I’ve created for myself (it’s mostly work I enjoy.) or be a big fish in a small pond, make 20k more but keep the same title and duties.

I could have changed my major but it would have added at least another year or two of schooling and my scholarship wouldn't have paid for it. 

I am a creative person and really enjoy writing, but poetry won't pay the rent. I have been looking at potential jobs in the publishing industry such as copywriting, editing, and sales. I think I would enjoy giving feedback on other people's work and helping them get published, but even the entry level positions seem out of my grasp. I don't know how to get noticed by hiring managers with my limited experience. I'm currently working retail and my partner and I make enough to support ourselves, but this is not sustainable in the long term. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you get out of this awkward spot?

18yr3an,Need Advice,"I (18M) started a degree apprenticeship in accountancy (ACA Qualification) around six months ago. So far I have completed the first 2 out of the 15 exams and start my next course in a month or so. I am currently on a salary of £23k at a very small public accountancy firm of around 10 employees. 

Before taking this job, everybody around me (friends, family, teachers, colleagues etc) told what a great opportunity it was. It was a great alternative to taking the traditional university route (which was something I definitely didn’t want to pursuit) as I’d be earning money whilst also studying for degree and avoiding debt. However I very quickly found out that I do not like the job, the industry or the people I work with. Don’t get me wrong, the people are nice, work hours are very generous and I could definitely expect my salary and career to progress if I stick with the qualification. But I find the work itself and the people so incredibly boring. We will often sit and work in silence for hours at a time.

I also decided to get my old part time job at a warehouse back around 3 months into the apprenticeship. As a result, I’ve realised how much I enjoy working with my hands, in fast, chaotic environments, interacting with people all day. The trouble is, I don’t know if I should give up and do something else instead, or stick with it for a few more years until I get the qualification. I have given some thought to what I could do instead: Firefighter/Land surveyor/Army. However I know that if I did quit I would probably regret it, as positions like these are very rare and I am very lucky to have a landed this role. I also would not have a qualification which I feel would set me back a bit. 

The advice I’m looking for is what should I do? Should I continue this apprenticeship in hopes of better prospects, or even just finish it to gain a qualification? If so, is there any advice on working towards ACA? Any advice for getting into the roles that I mentioned or anything I should know before considering these roles? Any other roles/courses/qualifications that people could recommend that match my interests (I am open to anything)? 

Any advice is much appreciated.",--Cod1n--,1,1.0,0,1704409970,2024-01-04 23:12:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18yr3an/need_advice/,1,2024

18yowom,How do I approach my current situation?,"Hello everyone and I need your advice and guidance on my current situation.

  
Recently, I started my role as an HR Officer at a construction firm, and it has been two days since I started. Despite having one year of experience, I was pleasantly surprised to secure this position. However, I've realized that the job description presented in the initial posting does not align with the actual responsibilities. The company is in its starting, lacking a solid foundation, and I am tasked with constructing and implementing the company handbook while overseeing the entire HR Department and report directly to the COO.

  
The base pay offered is below average given the amount of responsibility that I'll be handling, with an additional clause in the job offer indicating a potential salary increase based on the contribution I bring to the company. The question now is, how much would the increase be for substantial contributions? My father suggested that the current opportunity is good for me, especially given the early stage of the company. He mentioned that if the company surpasses its anticipated growth, I would go grow along with the company. However, given that it's a Chinese family-owned business, I anticipate that the compensation may fall below the average. On the positive side, the COO is young and open-minded, showing a willingness to retain employees and learn. Nonetheless, it's worth noting that the COO lacks strong leadership skills.

  
As of now, I have not signed any contract, submitted pre-employment requirements, or been registered in the payroll system. Surprisingly, I have not undergone any onboarding process either. A new opportunity has risen, and it seems more promising. It involves on-site work on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with remote work on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This position is with an international company based in Singapore, offering a base salary better than my current job for a similar title but at a regional level. Moreover, there is an HR Manager I can consult for guidance on my tasks. Considering the stark contrast between my current job, where I received minimal guidance and faced internal conflicts and office politics, and the new opportunity that promises a more supportive environment, I am inclined to accept the latter. However, being new to this field, I seek advice on whether I should formally inform my current employer that I have decided not to proceed with the HR Officer position.

  
I would highly value your input as I navigate through this decision-making process.",DominusArts,1,1.0,0,1704404768,2024-01-04 21:46:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18yowom/how_do_i_approach_my_current_situation/,1,2024

18yof85,How to approach my lead about her behavior towards me + mixed signals?,"The project we are working on is getting extremely busy and I can sense that everyone is stressed, including myself. 

Yesterday was a day full of meetings, literally. I didn't get a break to check my emails until 4 PM. At this time was when my ""boss""/lead (not technically my boss but also kind of) starts sending group chat messages aimed at me asking if I did x y z today. Like the clock just turned 4 and I just got off the last meeting... no I haven't had a chance to eat or use the restroom properly let alone review all of the emails that were piling in and respond to them and do what they were asking of me because the meetings were actually ""we need your attention"" type ones, especially because I am the one that writes the notes for these calls!! 

Regardless, I was hurt that she did all of this while in a group chat with others. I privately messaged her a thorough response to all of her inquiries in a respectful/professional way and she said ""understandable thank you yada yada"" and started being nice and hearting my messages and saying thank you but how I view her now is totally tainted. I find what she did really unprofessional and rude. It didn't feel like a learning opportunity for everyone bc everyone in that chat was above me. It felt like a shaming opportunity and to let steam out on someone that can't retaliate. 

Moreover, I keep getting so many mixed signals and messages. They say do x I do x then it's why did u do x you shouldve done y then i do y and its why did you do y it's x like holy moly. I can't win! 

Perfect example: 

We have scheduled meetings with external groups for 1 week at 2 time slots in the day. We sent this to the groups and allowed them to pick a time slot. Well 1 group picked the time slot when we would normally have an internal meeting. I went ahead and scheduled the group for this meeting because in the past I was told to prioritize external meetings and ALSO WHY DID WE GIVE THEM THOSE TIME SLOTS IF THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY AVAILABLE?! Make it make sense!! I was told off for this but in the past I was told off for not just going ahead and scheduling things and to take initiative and be in charge of scheduling more firmly but when I do then it's just complaining. 

I have to approach my lead with this because it will drive me insane if I don't and I need more clarification of her needs, expectations, goals, standards etc bc it feels like things are being made up as they go which would be OK but don't make it seem like I F'd up then when you keep switching things up.

Curious for your take on how to update an enterprise AE resume for a product with 12-18 month sales cycles when I'm 1.5 years into the role at a SaaS/hardware company. I'm evaluating an opportunity from a recruiter, and the prospective role would start in 1-2 months not allowing for my ARR in pipe to be realized.

While I have sold multiple accounts and booked ARR, the strategy is quasi-land & expand with 2-3 phases over a year, so most of my ARR achievements are waiting to be realized as we work through the initial test period (high conversion rates).  
  
Would you simply list unqualified and qualified ARR pipeline?  
  
My pipeline for both is in the top 10% of sales, and since the company only built a larger sales team (series C) in 2021 - only the original salesperson (10 years at co) has booked substantial ARR - my pipeline as compared to peers is the most realistic metric to compare.

18yjsqe,What should I do with my life exactly?!,"Okay, another question that's ""Not Stupid"". 

This includes some very boring things to read, but your opinions are highly appreciated. I'll try to make it as short as possible. 

I'm a doctor with an MBBS degree, sitting at home in the name of preparing for PG entrance. But I barely study, waste time on my phone.

I really loved mathematics in school. My interests jumped over to Physics too during end of high school. Even though biology was not of my interest, Somehow I have been telling my parents since my childhood that I would become a doctor which made them happy. This led to a conflict in me while selecting Biology vs Mathematics for 11th and 12th STD. I chose Bio-maths. Did decent in 12th with 94% but failed the entrance exam for Medicals. But I could crack the Engineering selection. I decided to repeat and this time I somehow made it upto only 4.1k rank in NEET-UG but got into MedSchool. Since then, it's been a downpath for me. I would cram during University exams and barely pass all of my medical exams. I failed in some at the first attempt but managed to get out with only 6 months delay fortunately. I started selfdoubting myself if I'm worth becoming a doctor. I started to question even my intelligence. Any bit of motivation that comes up will be shut off immediately by contradicting questions within myself. 

Recently I decided to do some IQ tests and find out if Im dumb, duh! I knew I was better in things before med school. 2 tests gave me IQ ranks of 130 and 142. My Mensa score was 135. I think those are not so bad scores but, I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I like being a surgeon but it takes a lot of effort. And does IQ actually mean anything for doctors? It's all about learning as much info as one can as far as I'm concerned in Medschool. Am I capable of becoming a doctor? Am I capable of cracking NEET PG? I don't know what to do with my life if not medicine at this point. 

Other things I like are Drawing, Playing Piano and Reading. I sometimes picture myself making great movies and music 😑",ScaryLimbo,1,1.0,7,1704392250,2024-01-04 18:17:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18yjsqe/what_should_i_do_with_my_life_exactly/,1,2024
18yjarz,Leaving after holiday shutdown week?,"Hey yall,

Currently in a role that no longer serves me and been debating to quit for about a year now. I stayed long enough to take the paid holiday week shutdown. We all came back on the 2nd of Jan. Originally iwas thinking of putting my notice in next friday so it doesnt seem like I stayed just for the paid vacation (even though i did lol) but i honestly dont think i can hold on for another week at this point, so considering ripping the bandaid off sooner rather than later. 

Anyway, does that seem ok? I worry they might not wanna pay me for the vacation which is why I was going to wait another week for the notice but this isnt something im basing off of facts, just overthinking. Does it not matter because I technically would resign after? Anyone know if insurance stops the day you put your notice or when you are officially gone? Im not sure how i could get this info as its not in our employee handbook and obviously dont feel i should ask HR lol",ghost_inthemoonlight,1,1.0,0,1704391037,2024-01-04 17:57:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18yjarz/leaving_after_holiday_shutdown_week/,1,2024

I know this is very common in adults in their early 20s but it is getting to the point where I am stressing out about where I am going to end up. I live with my fiance who works a 9-5 and he is just as miserable as I am with what he does. We live on our own so we can't afford to not work or take a job that pays us any less (combined we probably make 70-75k a year). Rent prices in our state are extremely high so we pay almost 2k for a one bedroom apartment with two dogs. We have talked about moving south where rent is so much cheaper but jobs don't pay as much. He says he will only move if we save up enough money for us to live comfortably until we can both find jobs down there.  
  
This story is probably sounding like a mess but I am trying to summarize my life in a couple paragraphs so I apologize in advance. Going back to the beginning, I would love to be a mom in the next couple years but I want to be able to raise my kids and not have to take them to daycare. My dream is to own a laundromat or car wash one day but I am so lost on where to start. I don't have the money by any means but I know loans are an option. I wish I had a guide but nobody I know has ever even owned a business. My ultimate goal in life is financial freedom, but how do I even achieve that? Am I wasting my time in school? Do I stay at my job and try to keep growing here even though I am miserable? Do I look for a business partner? But where? I wish I knew what steps to take.

18ygtsv,Should I sign the 3 yr contract?,"I’m a 25F college student working full-time as an admin assistant for accounting consultants at a state tax firm. I’m currently working on completing my associates in accounting spring 2024 and will transfer to university to complete my bachelors soon after. My ultimate goal is to get my CPA license. 

I’ve been working at this job for a 1.5 years and it’s a small company. 12 employees, including the owner. When I was interviewed for the position, I was told by the owner he can help me with tuition reimbursement. Now that I’ve came to him with my tuition receipts, he told me he will only cover the costs of business/accounting related courses. And if I do receive his help, I would have to sign a 3 year contract that will obligate me to work for him for that period of time. 

My 33F colleague said she received some help to complete her master’s in accounting but I don’t think they’re paying her a competitive salary based on her education and experience.

I live on my own and don’t receive any other financial help. My current salary is barely getting me by but I justify my pay because of my lack of experience and education. And I’m at a crossroad. A few of my trusted peers have told me that it isn’t worth signing the 3 yr contact to only get $1,600 reimbursed, especially because they think I should be getting paid more than my current salary and because my employer doesn’t offer a 401k. They further explain that if I sign the contract, I could potentially lose out on other opportunities.

I personally wouldn’t mind signing the contract, especially if they’re willing to help reimburse courses later down the line, especially the CPA exam. I’m thinking that I could just use this time to learn as much as I can from this industry. Plus I do enjoy working with everyone here and it’s not a stressful environment.

I have a question and don't really know what to do or if I can fight this somehow. So, I work as a help desk/systems admin and we're a small team of 5 people total. Recently, my boss let me know that my ""role"" is going to change to full-time in office yet everyone else will still be hybrid. We have a lead sys admin, another sys admin/cyber-security, a data guy, and our IT director. Is he allowed to do this/is this fair that I'm the only one on the team being singled out? I feel like I get picked on a lot here, like I get called out for things out of my control and for things someone else told me to do. He also forgets a lot of things like for example, 2 weeks in advance my team member and I were working New Year's Day from home and he said I chose to work from home that day despite literally him saying it was fine. Also, my other team members show up late, our lead sys admin seems to always have stuff going on so he's practically fully remote always saying he's wfh that day when he's supposed to be in office. He says it's for ""the better of the company"" and it just seems like bs because I get all my work done, I finish all my projects, and I don't even really talk to anyone and stay in my lane.

18ygcld,Finance and Accounting Guy - Uncertainty about career orientation - Seeking advice,"I'm a young professional currently working at a Big 4 Accounting Firm. Coming from a developing economy, I graduated with high distinction in accounting from a top local university. Since then, I've been exposed to various finance sub-fields like accounting/auditing, financial analysis, and advisory. However, I find myself feeling lost in terms of my career orientation.

Back in my school days, I was a high achiever with numerous national prizes in STEM subjects. Despite this, I feel like the skills and knowledge I gained aren't fully utilised in my current job. It's not that I hate the work; I just sense that my personality doesn't align with the business world's expectation of being sociable, aggressive, and, at times, even unethical.

Moreover, I'm uncertain about how my work truly adds value to my clients, and I fear that my skill sets might become obsolete in the future. The grind and relatively low pay I endure leave me questioning whether the results are worth it, especially when the outcomes remain unclear to me.

A little bit about my personality, my plan, and my ability: 

* I excel in explaining/training people
* My MBTI is INFJ-T
* I enjoy learning new things, even if they're not immediately useful
* While income isn't my top priority, I still aim for financial freedom in the next 20 years of working
* I prefer working in a small group and don't seek non-working connections
* I am not getting married in the next 5-7 years
* Strong with numbers, math, probability, and related tasks
* Effective time and task management, a survival skill at the Big 4

As the title suggests, I'm seeking advice for the next steps in my career. Here are a few options I'm considering:

1. Stay until I reach a managerial position (3-4 years) and then transition to industry.
2. Quit now, find a less intensive job, and use free time for freelancing or learning new skills.
3. Pursue an MBA abroad.
4. Quit, take time off, and explore a different job, possibly in a quantitative/data/programming field.

I'd greatly appreciate any advice or insights to help me redesign my career path, whether in one of the mentioned ways or an entirely different direction. Thanks in advance for your valuable input!

Hi everyone, I am seeking some advice about my situation the HQ manager does not have any common sense about what the real business is, always says yes to others without thinking, and always considers our job is so simple. 

My background is in consulting, and I always try my best to finish all the work professionally. I can not stand any unprofessional work since I learned that way when I worked in the consulting industry. However, I am now struggling with the thought: the upper management teams are a mess, they always want to copy other competitors and want quick results. My HQ manager can not understand the nature of the department that he is doing and always goes in the wrong direction. He also has a very high ego, which is sometimes very hard to tell him. I don't even know why he can stand at the firm for the last 4 years without being kicked. 

Now I am so worried about my future and in this crisis, I just started to work for this firm for 5 months. I can not just quit cuz I also need money to survive. Besides, My desire is that I want to deliver something good, but I don't know if it is worth my dedication if I still work for this company. The only point that makes me stay here is that my middle manager is now in charge of our region, and he can decide everything, so at least we can professionally do things the way we want. But I just worried so much about my future, like should I accept this mess and find the best way to do my job or should I just look for another firm?

In my 8 years out of college, I spent the first 4 as an MEP engineer doing project management, the following 4 I’ve spent trying to turn my family’s niche manufacturing business around.  
  
I’ve tried literally everything up to finding investors and I’ve come to the conclusion that there’s no way forward for me at this company due to factors beyond my control.  
  
I’m trying to leave but am struggling to decide what to do next. I do not want to return to engineering. The most interesting career I’ve come across is Data Science. I’ve started to learn python and SQL, luckily, I have some stats background coming from ME.  
  
I have an alternative path and I’m struggling to commit to one or the other. While in my role I’ve built a solid network of business owners, a couple have been mentoring me. They are urging me to take on a COO type role with any other manufacturing company, ideally a startup. I know I’m well suited for this, but fear it will lead to burn out over the years and will require a major time commitment. Not trying to make excuses, but I have ADHD and have found 45-55 hr weeks quickly lead to me losing my mind 😅.  
  
I have a friend getting his PhD in data science and he insists I can get into the field with my BS in ME and some informal training. He goes on about the salary, flexible hours, and how much need there is for people who have the skills for Data Science and have real business experience.  
  
I need to get unstuck and start moving forward. If I’m going to leverage my network in manufacturing, I need to use it sooner than later. I would love to just take time off and think, but I have a mortgage to pay and don’t want to put that kind of burden on my wife. I do dream of a lower stress career but that does mean lower pay…

Her disability leave ends in early March and we need to find her a work from home before then. With little computer skills and being out of date with things having worked in her blue collar job for years, what jobs could she apply to?

I’ve been searching the internet far and wide for remote customer representative jobs that would provide her with insurance. She needs it for her insulin. She can’t afford her medicine otherwise. Many of them seemed like scams or didn’t provide health insurance. I don’t know what to do and time is running out. I have to oversee this job search because she hasn’t applied in 15 years and has no idea what she’s doing or what job she can do next. I’m so stressed out and feel so hopeless. I’ve made no progress after two months.

18ydffw,"Safe, comfortable job I like? Or prestigious upper management job?","Little bit of back story: I have a double bachelors in social sciences & gender, sexuality & queer studies. During my senior year I headed a diversity and equity committee for a local high school. The whole she-bang. It went off perfectly. Since then I have worked a number of DEI consultant jobs, as well as at other non-profits (in various capacities) where I was able to incorporate DEI into much of my work. I also have a masters degree in Diversity, Equity and Social Impact.

I currently work as a case manager at non-profit (T). Specifically I am a case manager for the homeless. While working here, I have become friendly with our director (S). I mentioned to her that my true passions lie within diversity work. She mentioned that she used to do diversity work, and the subject came up often when we talked. 

Under my own steam, I developed a mock proposal for our organization, just to kind of see what she thought. She absolutely loved it and offered to show it to our VP. We both discussed that we hoped this would lead to a diversity officer or director of diversity position, as T does not currently have any form of a diversity office. VP also loved the proposal, but said that unfortunately a new position was not in the budget currently, and we should see where we're at in a year. 

A few weeks ago S came to me and told me that she had gotten me an interview for director of diversity at her previous organization (C), if I was interested. I figured why the hell not. Took the series of interviews and did well. Well, they offered me the job. 

Here's my dilemma: I'm not sure if I'm getting cold feet or what. I'm just realizing more and more what a rare thing I have at organization T. I absolutely love my job. I'm very good at it. It is rewarding and every day I come home satisfied with what I did that day. I adore my boss, and my bosses boss. I feel respected, and valued. I'm trusted enough to essentially make my own schedule. I'm by no means rich, but the pay is adequate. There is an excellent work/life balance. However, I know that eventually I'm going to want to get back in to diversity work. I'm already feeling the itch. 

But this directors position. It's everything I've worked the last decade for. It would be a huge boost to my career. Corner office on the top floor huge. Double my income huge. I've spent so much time and effort on my education and resume. This is everything I've ever wanted. Everything I've worked for. Maybe I'm scared? I have no idea. 

So, that's where I'm at. Do I stick with the easy, safe job? Or do I make that leap to the next level?

Tl;dr - Got offered a high paying, upper executive level job at a different organization.

18yczmg,UPSC CSE VS Career in IT,"Hi,

My first ever reddit post. Hoping to get some advice from y'all.

I am a 24 Year old guy, working in an MNC presently. It's always been my dream to try and get in the Civil services, but i come from a lower middle class family. My dad ( Age 48 ) lost his job during covid and we've been struggling financially since then. I started working as soon as i graduated in 2020 and was the sole breadwinner for my family at some point of time. My dad tried his luck at many places and finally has landed a job in a private construction company this month itself ( He's an engineer).

The thing is that my parent's made really poor financial decisions when they were young and now we are stuck living bill to bill with absolutely 0 savings. Adding to that my father was an Alcoholic and had anger issues which led to our family being in such a bad position financially. 

We are free from any liabilities as such but still live in a rented house and have no house of our own. I also have a younger sister who is in college and i am taking care of her education. 

Things are realtively stable now, but i am just confused as to what should i do career wise. I don't like this IT job, moreover, i am in Network domain which is just way too boring. I am earning close to 5LPA right now and plan on switching domain to cloud engineering by next year. But at the same time i have an inclination towards UPSC CSE. If i plan to stay in IT Sector, i ll have to upskill myself but then I won't be able to devote time to CSE preparation. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",Regular-Butterfly865,1,1.0,0,1704374339,2024-01-04 13:18:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18yczmg/upsc_cse_vs_career_in_it/,1,2024
18ybnbe,Co-worker wants to act like my manager,"Since I started this job, my co-worker who happens to be a 65 year old man while I am half his age, continually tries to boss me around and check all the code I develop. The ridiculous part here is he doesn't want me checking over his code too. Every other company I have worked at has code reviews for EVERYONE, but his code is absolute messy garbage. He doesn't use semicolons, he misspells words, he has commented out junk everywhere, he doesn't test some of his code, but somehow he believes he should be reviewing my code even though we are both senior developers.

My first month on the job, we met with an outside contractor, and this coworker presented himself as the ""lead programmer"". Later I asked the manager if he was the lead, and the manager laughed and said ""no, he's not"". I told the manager that I don't think it's fair that he wants to review all my code and is hyper critical of me, while he gets angry if I find any bugs in his code, and the manager said -- ""ok, I won't have you guys work together anymore really"". The annoying part is that the co-worker still looks over all my code and tries to find issues, but now he goes directly to the manager when he ""thinks"" he finds an issue. On Friday I merged some code and didn't push it out since we have a policy to not ever deploy on Friday. Then he went to the manager the next week to say how I had code that I ""forgot to deploy"". I told the manager I didn't deploy since we never deploy on Fridays, and asked why this coworker is even checking over my stuff to begin with. The manager just replied ""he wants to know all code that is going into production"". Sounds like they are still letting this guy act like the lead developer.

He has overwritten my work twice, once causing me to work an extra 8 hours to re-do some things that I didn't save since we work in a sandbox environment, the protocol is to give a 24 hour notice before refreshing, but I am pretty sure he does it on purpose to make my job more difficult. My manager got upset the first time he did it, but he did it twice. I won't be surprised if it happens again and he will claim he ""forgot to warn me"".

I made a very small update my first week to a process he worked on, that he told me to make. Then a bug that he had in his code showed up the next week (which was there for months) and he told the manager the bug was my fault even though it was clearly his bug. I tested the code very thoroughly and he said I wasn't properly testing even though I'm the only one that writes out test cases. He tests his stuff once and releases. This is just a case of deflection.

Once I had to fix an issue with an exposed process on our website, so as a quick fix I setup a basic token authentication process to utilize the process, and since the token was in our private code repository (this quick fix was done to secure the page while I could work on a better solution) he said on a meeting ""some offshore developer wrote some garbage code that is insecure and has a token in our repository"". He knew it was my code. The next meeting he said ""oh sorry I see that bad code was yours. Well, I want to start reviewing all code you put out from now on."" I told him I want to review all of his code from now on as well, and then he ended the call, telling the manager, and then the manager said we just won't do code reviews any longer.

Whenever we have 1-on-1 meetings about something, he will act rude and not bother to say ""hi"" or ""thanks"" or anything like that. I still treat him with some politeness, but when group meetings come around then he suddenly acts like he is nice to me before he does something else to try and criticize me. Every time I get a new certification he will frown and say nothing or say how it's not important.

He passive aggressively mocks me on every meeting, but then always says how awesome all the other co workers are. There's a young woman in our department, and he always says how he would do anything for her and how great she is. He also sucks up to the manager. Nobody cares when I speak and he walks away from his desk on purpose. Once I didn't speak on a meeting because I wasn't too involved in the project, then he commented ""I should just LURK and not talk like a weirdo"". He is constantly saying these rude things, but he is careful not to say my name as to not incriminate himself.

He has, a few times, said things in a very rude manner so that my manager even noticed and said he didn't mind me sticking up for myself. But recently my manager seems to not care any longer, and seems to side a bit more with this guy. The problem is, my wife and I recently lost our only child and I got sick and couldn't get out of bed for 3 months while I have still been working my job, only to have this guy picking on me every chance he can get. It's literally killing me dealing with him because I already am sick enough, but I need to pay the bills. Should I go to HR? Is it risky to contact them in a smaller company like this? He is friends with a lot of people here. I figure a lot of jobs have narcissistic jerks, but it's still ruining my health dealing with him every day.",Specific_Thing_6376,65,0.9300000071525574,52,1704370077,2024-01-04 12:07:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18ybnbe/coworker_wants_to_act_like_my_manager/,1,2024

One: I have no idea how to gain a qualification without putting myself and family in huge amounts of debt. I've started free code camp but no idea if this will be any good on a CV or not
Two: I thought about applying to jobs that train you as you learn on a lower wage. Think apprenticeships or similar. All the ones I've seen are massively under what I could afford to take a pay cut with. I have a house a partner and two kids to support. (My partner works also) 
Three: Time, this is the biggest hurdle. I'm currently trying desperately to find a job in my current industry that is less hours to give me more free time to train. They literally don't exist. Every company I've approached about taking me on with reduced hours has basically laughed me out the door. The minimum I can find is 44 a week. Which is industry standard and occasionally we get a 40 hour come up. But they're such a commute.from me I'd loose time again.

18y85pp,Should I change my major from Computer Engineering to CS?,"Hello,

I'm currently contemplating changing my major and require urgent help please. I am pursuing Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto and just finished my first semester. 

Now I realised that I don't really have much interest in hardware courses like circuit analysis, signal processing, etc. and my university teaches a ton of these since the first two years are common for both electrical and computer engineering students. I think I'll like the software side more so I'm thinking of switching to Computer Science. But my first semester grades are pathetic (I barely passed) because I had been going through a lot of family and personal problems. 

So I won't be admitted to the CS program at UofT because they require high grades for transferring. That's why if I'm gonna switch I'll either have to transfer to a university in my home country in Dubai or just restart as a freshman again in Canada/USA (depending on where I get admitted). My parents are suggesting me to stay with them and complete my undergrad here and then go abroad for Master's as they think it'll be easier for me to transistion to something else if I don't happen to like CS as well. Also, the entry barrier is low here so they might accept my transfer credits as well.

It makes sense to me but the thing is that universities in the middle east aren't really good and very few of them have good accreditations like ABET so I think getting a degree from here will limit a lot of opportunities for me. I'm very hesitant to pursue my undergrad here because I worked very hard in high school to get good grades and other achievements so I'm afraid that all of that will go to waste. I don't know what to do. But at the same time it's much cheaper and I won't have to restart again as a freshman.

So I'm thinking of just pushing through the hardware courses at UofT and getting my CompEng degree. Then maybe I can apply for software jobs after graduation. But I don't know how difficult it will be to get through those hardware courses if I have little to no interest in them.

Can anyone please advise?",whysoserious011_,1,1.0,1,1704356547,2024-01-04 08:22:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18y85pp/should_i_change_my_major_from_computer/,1,2024

AI in Business (AI Fundamentals, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing):  


[https://handbook.latrobe.edu.au/aos/2024/SPE-AIB01](https://handbook.latrobe.edu.au/aos/2024/SPE-AIB01)

&#x200B;

Data Science (4 subjects of: Spatial Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Exploration and Analysis, Data Mining, Analysis of Repeated Measures, Probability and Stastitics for Data Science)

&#x200B;

[https://handbook.latrobe.edu.au/aos/2024/SPE-AIB01](https://handbook.latrobe.edu.au/aos/2024/SPE-AIB01)

&#x200B;

I like the AI thing but I want to have the choice to work in different fields like media and music, which I think data science is closer to as it can make me able to specialize in various fields (more than AI), am I right in this? Apart from that, what is expected to have more opprtunties and pay more in the near future? I did some research in Google but still would love to hear your opinion to differenciate between the two specializations",Radioheader377,1,1.0,1,1704347112,2024-01-04 05:45:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18y5nhe/ai_in_business_vs_data_science_what_do_you_guys/,1,2024

18y4cnd,I feel like an awful person leaving my job for a new offer.,"I apologize for a longer post but if anyone reads and has anything, advice, criticism or questions, I'm really looking for just anyone's thoughts on the topic as I'm a single dude with like 2 close friends.

Here's the situation. One year ago I took a part-time job at a small business, single store restaurant. I had a boring 4-12pm day job that was unfulfilling, so having a morning prep job was fun and I enjoyed talking with: customers (a lot of regulars), employees (only 7 and all high schoolers), the GM (a bit of a weird one) and the boss. The boss has similar religious and moral beliefs as myself and is the personality that doesn't shy away from the any convo if you bring it up. I like to yap and so naturally we talked a lot, being were the only ones running the restaurant in the morning. We weren't CLOSE by any means but we got along very well and the day to day was a breeze. The GM I didn't see since he came for the evening and night shift, he was a bit of a complainer and communicated super spotty. I eventually got to a point where i'm texting the boss asking for time-off requests and etc.

8 months into that (roughly 4 months ago) the GM calls in 3 days in a row saying his dog threw up and needs to clean it. Not a great excuse for a 8 hour shift. Boss and him get into it on the phone and he never shows back up. Naturally again, i'm working mornings with the boss so we are talking about everything, he mentions he'll be hiring for a new GM spot if I knew anyone up to the task. I asked how much he was paying and he responds ""Salary 40k a year"". My day job 4-12pm paid 16/hour and was mental prison to work. I was already thinking about it switching but really hadn't put any work in to finding something. I also have previous experience managing kitchens but left to give my body a break. (This sentence will be important soon). This job opportunity was laying at my feet, and I knew how much work it took to run that store, and really, in comparison to any other place ever (besides a food-truck) it was very very easy, and light on the body work. And for more than I've ever made? First time on salary? It checked all my boxes. I told him to not look for anyone, I'll put in a notice at my full-time and work for him. He was overjoyed really, even chatted about gods plan, how hiring a GM from scratch would put him behind schedule with the business and family since he didn't even get a notice from the previous GM. 

We are now 4 months into me GM'ing for him. Its going literally fantastic! Sales are good, the day to day is great, I don't hate waking up to go to my job, and most importantly there's no staffing crisis 24/7 like I feel I'm always going through at restaurants as an employee.

Enter: the GM for the job I worked a long time ago that strained my body (the sentence I highlighted). Briefly, this job has an entire history I'll spare you from hearing as well. If people would like to hear that I'll add it, its a smallish chain too but already in the growth stage (9 stores). He approaches me on new years day (literally 3 days ago) and explains to me how things at that business are exploding, in a good way. They've just made multi-million dollar contracts to expand in different states (since they're only in one state). This means that everyone in the company is moving up, and he is now the regional manager for 3 of the 9 stores. He explains he needs an assistant regional manager to work under him and corporate is allowing him to hand pick the person. He came to me wanting to hire me back on. This is like a dream opportunity once again laid at my feet. I permanent career I could see myself doing in a company that is blowing up right now. He offered to pay just under double what my current job does.  

I really feel so terrible telling my boss who I just started working for, the one I told not to start hiring because id take it on. The one who last week I was talking about how great everything is going. THE ONE WHO TODAY HANDED ME MY BONUS FOR LAST QUARTER, and tells me this coming week I'll be taking over ordering and employee meetings. The one who is ready to finally leave the restaurant to younger more capable hands that's passionate about the moto, message, and goal of the business....that I quit. I mean I can say everything I've typed here to him and maybe he'd understand but I know its just coming completely out of left field to him, I mean shit its come out of left field even for me. I really want i thought, and I know I have to tell him ASAP so he CAN start hiring but its only yesterday after talking to family Ive decided to take the job offer. I committed to a job I was ready to work for and grind and now am going to quit. What advice can you offer me. 

I'm very lucky to have these opportunities however I'll say, I failed out of college (first in family to do so) and had no life purpose until covid when I just decided to stop being a shitlord and work as much as possible. All of these opportunities came from working 6 days, never calling in, and covering peoples shifts and anyone can do it. I tell all my employees the same thing!

Also lastly I've realized proof-reading this, that since I'm the one breaking a step-above-a-promise and a step-below-a-contract, that that does make me a bad guy, and the hard convo I have to have is p much my punishment for that choice I've made. Maybe I'm just here to vent....maybe I do need a gf for these things not reddit.....aware....",Tr1smeg1stus,1,1.0,5,1704342919,2024-01-04 04:35:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18y4cnd/i_feel_like_an_awful_person_leaving_my_job_for_a/,1,2024

18y3h9b,How to transfer from healthcare industry to business/tech? FEELING STUCK,"finally getting myself to admit that i 100% regret choosing healthcare as my career and i feel stuck because i'm not entirely sure what I should do to get out of it. i've only been a registered nurse for 5 months and everyone's been telling me to hold on for a year before switching units/facilities but I'm going to be honest -  i absolutely do not think I will be able to stay here for a year. the unit i work in is burn out central, and being a new grad nurse on top of it all makes the adjustment period 100000x more stressful as is. the turnover rate at my unit is so high, and i'm ashamed to say that i already feel burnt out even though i've only been working here for such a short time. i'm afraid to find out what bedside nursing is like in any other facility, but from what i hear, it doesn't seem like it gets significantly better. 

PROS of being a nurse include feeling fulfilled after every shift as there's a sense of accomplishment seeing what i do, feeling like my shifts fly by as i'm always on my feet, and the hospital pay/benefits and security of the job isn't so bad. 

CONs include my long drive to/from work (at least 1.5 hrs) as I am a nurse in NYC, dealing with traffic before/after a 12 hour shift can be mentally taxing, let alone driving after being sleep deprived on b2b shifts. lack of help at work - poor management, a messed up healthcare system, not feeling like my personal wellbeing is prioritized by my employer, and feeling like a pawn in the system, easily disposed/replaced whenever needed. I guess you can say the biggest con that doesn't sit well with me is knowing that they can give less a fuck about my health/safety. i feel like i'm placed in unsafe situations that can be detrimental to my physical being AND can put my nursing license at risk due to the lack of resources we have in the hospital. 

after having realizing the flaws of the healthcare system, i genuinely don't think this is something i want to continue doing in the future but i'm only staying for the meantime because i'm not sure how to proceed and where to go since i currently have a ""stable income"" and health insurance, and benefits... and if i were to quit then i'd lose that stability. i just feel like i'd be so much happier once i leave these unsafe conditions and start prioritizing myself again. i genuinely don't feel like i'm being treated fairly or even humanely in certain aspects of my job. while i'm proud to say i'm a nurse, i'm also mentally/physically exhausted and it's definitely taking a toll on my health. 

if you made it this far and have any genuine advice for a 25 y/o who feels stuck in life, please leave a comment! i would love to hear from a new perspective as i've been repeatedly ranting to the same few friends who i feel bad for because this is all i talk about nowadays.

18y2x1t,I am currently rethinking my life/education - what are some options to reach a 200k/year salary given my history?,"I was two semesters away from finishing a degree as an engineer and had some very serious medical issues that took my attention away from everything, including school. I ended up being put on academic probation after one bad semester and thought I could keep going given my medical issues and ended up dropping classes the following semester and kicked out of my school. I haven't told my family or friends and have felt like a failure since(a year and a half). I, since, was given an opportunity as an analyst and loved it. When that contract ended I officially as of this year interviewed and was accepted for another analyst position making \~100k/year. I was accepted last summer to take a test to get a PMP certification which would be huge for my future, although assuming I get a degree I suppose.  
  
As an engineer, even if I graduated with the degree, 200k a year is more than likely never going to happen. The average engineer in CA makes around 120k with highs I hear honestly being around 150.  
  
I have already done all of my math for engineering, so any degree involving math or other relations to engineering would be a quick two years to finish.  
  
All of my family/friends are in medical and 200k/year is not only doable but fairly easy in that field. Growing up with engineering being pushed, i've never really gotten the chance to hear much about other math/office related jobs that can make that much.  
  
Now let me preface this all by saying I live in California, where 200k/year is doable. I do know that in order to reach that marker I will more than likely need to get a degree and was wondering what kind of options there were to reaching that benchmark, especially given my history now within analysts/project management? I want to go into an a field that involved mathematics or can utilize all of the classes that I already have taken.",ReasyxD,1,1.0,7,1704338595,2024-01-04 03:23:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18y2x1t/i_am_currently_rethinking_my_lifeeducation_what/,1,2024

18y1wr6,Any extroverts working a remote job? How do you not get burnt out?,"I have a 9-5 office job & my schedule recently changed from working in the office twice a week to only once a week. 

This change appears to benefit everyone on my department except for me, so I’m not against it, I’m just a bit disappointed.

Coming in the office gave me something to look forward to throughout the week.

I graduated recently so I don’t have many friends in my area and I live alone. I have a few hobbies & try to get out of the house as often as I can but I haven’t really made any new friends there yet.

Working remote has its benefits but my  remote days can get lonely and draining sometimes when I’m spending most of the day alone on my couch or desk. I work at coffee shops sometimes but it’s still lonely.

18y0ve9,"Manager assigned me additional tasks/deadlines I’m worried about meeting during a goal review, after expressing concerns about my current workload. They sent their expectations to me in an email - do I respond?","Context: I’ve been at this job for nearly a year and recently had an end-of-2023 performance review with my manager to discuss goals/expectations for 2024. I work for a large corp but on a small, data-focused team with the assumption that I’d be focused in a specific area (think ROI analysis). A few months after I started, they laid off another individual on the team who specialized in different tasks (think UX analytics). They did not rehire, and I naturally became the person to take on their workload as I’m the only other person who uses this specific program for analytics. 

I am in way over my head, doing work I did not expect to do. A lot of this work requires tedious, technical maintenance and I’m basically learning from scratch as I have no support - my manager started only a few months before I did and doesn’t have any idea what needs to be done. I don’t think he realized all the work my former colleague did since it’s “unseen labor”. All the advice he’s given me has been unhelpful, like “try talking to this person” but I already have and they couldn’t assist. If I don’t do the work, no one else will and it would affect multiple areas of the biz. 

I expressed that I struggle to get things done because it takes a while to figure out what I’m doing, or I discover a lot of problems that need fixing along the way, or I realize no protocol was established and now I have to figure out the best way to establish processes. I’m also in a position where I support multiple departments, so I’m getting all types of requests thrown at my from all directions. I stressed the need to have someone in the position of the laid off person, and even proposed adjusting my “official” responsibilities to accommodate some kind these tasks (at the expense of the role they hired me for, which has maybe taken up like 40% of my time). 

We weirdly had - what I thought - was a fruitful meeting where he heard my concerns. But then I got a surprise email from him detailing my expectations for the coming year, and it involves none of the tasks I proposed and more duties that I genuinely don’t think I can meet - like monthly reviews with each department I support, creating a bunch of reports, scheduling regular “office hours” where I can present what I’m working on, stuff like that. It was sent just to me but he may have BCC’d his superiors.

I’m trying to give benefit of doubt, he’s trying to prove himself too. He approved a full bonus for me a few months ago which I appreciate. But… I’m drowning and can barely get my current workload done. I find myself starting earlier and staying later than other people when I’m in office. The guy they laid off maybe wasn’t the best employee, but he sure did a lot. 

I have an unsettling feeling like I’m being set up for failure. He put the end of the month for some of the timelines he set but I have a backlog of things on my plate. As for the “office hours” he wants me to coordinate, I barely understand what I’m doing because I’ve done so little regarding the job they hired me for!

18y0ofh,Got a raise and I’m pissed,"I recently had a review with my boss about my job performance. It was after my first year working as manager and third year working there full time. I have 5 years of experience in my field and have progressed through my career quickly to where now I am project managing. Some history: I almost left to a competitor about a year ago and when I told them they said what I wanted to stay on, I gave them my needs and they met them. One of them included a 3$ raise. They honored my request and also moved me to salary with two weeks of paid time off. I was stoked at the time. Fast forward after a year of never calling in sick and being consistent and hard working, meeting deadlines, being a driving force in the company. When I had my review they gave me a 1,000$ or 1.6% raise to my yearly salary.

18y0fi8,"Mid 30s, 18 years self employed personal trainer, Can I get a job in sales or account management?","I've been self employed 18 years as a personal trainer and I am heavily considering moving out of this field into something else. I have run my own business, built multiple websites, done marketing, legal, hired part time workers etc.

I have soft skills, managing personalities, keeping clients on for many years, closing clients at consultations, understanding what people want and need, listening to what people mean underneath what they say. I am extremely good at taking a goal and breaking it into minor, achievable goals over the course of year and then hitting those milestones. I'm good at getting buy-in from the client that I know what I'm doing and to trust me.

My heart just isn't in training anymore. I make a good living, over $100 an hour, I just can't do the hours of standing there with clients anymore. I think my skills could potentially transfer into sales.

I'm highly independent, clearly, capable of setting and following goals, but I would love to work with a team. I'm so unmotivated and think I would respond well to having a boss and quotas, something external to motivate me. I'm also a competitive personality. Ex-athlete.

If you have any input in what kind of sales you think would work well or how to transition I would really appreciate it. I'm used to managing people for years so maybe something where you work with people longer term. I'm not sure if you can even apply for a sales or account management job with no direct experience. I haven't written a resume in nearly 20 years. I do not have a degree.

18xztyi,Seeking Help with Overwhelming Interests and Time Management,"Hello Reddit Community,

I'm an apprentice in the electrical field with plans to pursue additional training in IT around mid-2025. Currently, I am very content with my apprenticeship, but I'm struggling with my diverse interests and the associated time management. I love trying out various things, but often find myself overwhelmed and burnt out, leading to a lack of improvement and ultimately doing nothing.

Here are my current interests:

- Cooking
- Baking
- Digital Design (UI and social media posts, as well as print media and web design)
- Animations (After Effects)
- Smart Home planning and programming
- Artificial Intelligence
- Social Media Marketing and Community Building
- Carpentry for crafting my own furniture (potentially with built-in electrical gadgets)
- Motivating others and helping them through life situations


I'm challenged to consolidate these interests and improve my organization. Are there any tips on enhancing my time management? Does anyone know of resources or experts who can assist me in structuring my interests? And perhaps, does anyone have experience in building something on the side and even making money from it?",SaturnStriker,1,1.0,0,1704330109,2024-01-04 01:01:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18xztyi/seeking_help_with_overwhelming_interests_and_time/,1,2024
18xziac,My career is plateauing in Tech/Software support!,"My career is plateauing in Tech Support role? Advice to advance?

So I am currently at a tech startup and slowly beginning to realize my career growth and opportunities here are limited. I have been working in customer facing support role for the past 4 years. My current company is not super technical and I am basically just troubleshooting their SaaS product.

I want to change to a new company to gain more experience and bump my salary. I feel I can leverage my support background in tech to get my foot in the door in a new opportunity. 

Any advice for me with someone with a tech support background?

My confusion is, I am not sure what to focus my time on to get myself to the next level. Do I get cloud certifications and learn cloud? Do I focus more on learning to code (ex. Front end). I know I need to get more technical - I just don’t know WHAT to spend time on and will compliment my current experience. 

Just simply mentally drained, unhappy, and unchallenged in my current role. Would love to hear anyone who advanced their career from Support

18xywj2,Should I switch from finance to medicine?,"I'm graduating this spring from a T-20 university that is a target school for finance. I've been conflicted between pursuing finance or medicine all of undergrad, but last year I started veering more toward finance and my major is in a related field. I've also had 3 internships in the industry, and got a full-time return offer back in September.  
I enjoy the job I got but it isn't a passion of mine. There's another sector of finance I'd like to work in, but seeing as though I haven't even started this position yet, I don't think I'll be able to switch for a while. I do still like medicine, but I'm not OBSESSED with it like many other people I see are. I do want to pursue graduate school, but don't know where to go from here. My options are: stick to finance and try to find a different job in a few years, work for a year then do a post-bac pre-med program (most pre-med requirements are completed, I would just have a few left), or say fuck it and go to law school (random, I know, but my thoughts are that it interests me, and I could work in a sector of law related to finance).   
To be completely honest, I'm a first-generation college student and do care a great deal about making money, it's my main priority as I also support my family. The job I've taken pays 70k a year and is in NYC.  
Also, my GPA isn't the greatest. Because of the pre-med classes and other stuff, my GPA suffered in my first couple of years. I've worked really hard since, got straight A's this past fall, and now have a 3.047. I realize that this is still low, and I'm trying to see what I can do to make up for it.

I've always had these 2 paths in mind, but I'm struggling hard with ways to make it work. I want to go to college and get a degree of some sort, AS or BS was my main look for lengths. My whole life revolves around music. I've always been so intrigued by sound design and music in general, and I've learned how to play piano, drums, and almost any other percussion instrument, guitar, bass, you name it. I've taught myself how to record, mix, produce, compose, write, and publish my own music and music for others since a very young age and I love doing it with any free time I can get. I used to work as a Coding Instructor for kids at a coding institute that taught basic JavaScript, Java, CSS, and HTML and I loved doing that as well. In my high school, there are options for ""career pathways"" to base your class selection on, and I'm in both the Fine Arts Pathway for Jazz Band, Marching Band, and Symphonic Band. I'm also at the beginning of the Computer Arts Pathway for Intro to Technology and Web Dev. I know I probably am not going to be able to take both up as a career/degree, and I'm not sure what I should do. If I went with my Programming route, I've thought of trying to get a degree focusing on Software Development, since I know it pays well and is in high demand. I know it would be decently difficult, but I think I'd be capable of getting a degree for it. I just don't know if I'd like to program for the rest of my life. If I went the Music path, I'd probably try to focus on the Music Production side of things, but I'm open to learning almost anything. I don't think there's high demand for music producers and decent pay (preferring over 60K Starting but I know I don't have too much of a choice lol.) but I'd love to take music up as a job. I love performing and playing, but I also love the technical side of things, especially music. Soundboards, waveforms, you name it, and I'd love to learn more. I just don't think it would be as simple to get a decent job in the field. Some colleges I've looked into are mainly DSU (Dakota State University) since I live in SD. But I'm open to moving.

18xr6hu,Do I take this job?,"I’m young and I have wanted to break into the IT field for some time. 

I have no experience and no certs and I live in a very competitive area to get into entry level help desk jobs and have not been successful; thus promoting me to get a very lax remote customer service job at a large company (pay is not great)

I interviewed for a help desk job at a small IT company 6 months ago and they loved me and started the onboarding process (background check which I passed) with me but ghosted me afterwards when emailing back and forth about a follow up to meet with the CEO before being actually hired 


6 months go by and I get an email in my inbox saying they are finally ready to hire and would like to meet with me.



Do I take this job? They were so rude in ghosting me and I have a pretty cozy remote customer service job, I’m also worried about job security as this is a very small contract IT company. But at the same time I really need to get some experience under my belt to help me break into IT seeing as I have no certs this is a no brainer to take this job.

18xr25f,how to start with my writing/how to start a portfolio?,"i got a degree in creative writing and spent the whole four years getting it + last 6 months the since grad regretting it. had a sit down with my family to tell them i finally got hired at a cafe, which would be my real first job ever, so i would have an income now instead of feeling like a leech, and they just told me how they expect me to (eventually) be happy in my career with writing..

i feel totally useless since i haven’t made any efforts towards it due to being lost and having no connections or friends from my major. i messed up by not staying in contact because i thought id have a career change or find something by now that would interest me and i see that was wrong. im still very unhappy with writing and dont think id like to do it for work, but im hoping maybe i could find something to spark my interest again.

i thought maybe id be happy doing something like writing articles for games i like, or for a brand or someone’s blog, making content for their website or even managing a business social media account and such (i don’t even know the correct term for those if there even is one) but i have VERY limited experience with graphic design (canva and procreate) and no idea how to even build a portfolio for that with 0 experience. so, i need some help on how to get started or what i could do to build that experience? my only written samples as of now are fiction short stories which isn’t helpful..

i’m tempted to ask my work when i get more settled there if there’s something i could do to help manage their social media accounts since i noticed there’s hardly any activity (last posts being august and september 2023). but im scared they’ll say no as im very new there and have again, no experience. i’m going through a training period starting this week and i only got the job because they liked my personality so i don’t want to push anything yet.

18xpp05,Went to put in my 2 week notice and was hit with a completely unexpected counter offer...,"Just recently accepted a new Senior Specialist position (I'm going to keep things vague for anonymity) at an established ""semi-corporate"" medical company that nets me about 15-20% more salary, 2 WFH days a week, better benefits and a promising career growth path. 

My current company is a very unique life sciences company that's become very well established and grown a ton in the 4 years I've been here. However, in those 4 years I have not received a promotion and have only received relatively nominal raises just once, maybe twice (covid was a blur). I'm very well praised by my supervisor who has since become the VP of the company. The issue is upper management has effectively caused a lot of tension in the company by being overly stringent and it's impeded company growth, internally (externally, we're growing beyond our means). 

Benefits aren't terrible, but aren't great either - probably just a bit worse than average. I saw no room for growth here, unfortunately, as it's a small company and my department is even smaller. I wasn't making as much money as I felt I deserved for this role, so I began looking elsewhere and found the job I have already accepted. As mentioned, 15% base salary increase, 5% annual target bonus, 5% profit sharing, 3% 401k match, better benefits across the board - 2 wfh days a week, shorter commute, and a more senior title. Sounded great, so I took the job.

I went to put in my two week notice last night to my supervisor and it went very unexpectedly... Basically, they're very supportive and respectful of my decision, and if I choose to go, it sucks but so be it. But had I waited just another month or two, we would have had a very different discussion... 

This has been very under-wraps and only upper management knows, but the company is about to go through a MASSIVE restructure, and I was to be a key part in that restructure. My supervisor would be getting promoted to either CEO/President, and they were going to make me manager and give me a significant raise. I trust this person - we have a very solid working relationship and they're a no bull-shit type person. All the paperwork has already been signed and things are going into motion. The discussion was set to happen at end of month.. 

Basically, the current upper management that makes salary and benefits decisions (that has hindered the company to this point) will no longer be making such decisions. All my prior concerns with this company are apparently company-wide concerns. They've been such reason for issue that my supervisor, and a couple other upper management, have hit a breaking point and we're going through a major restructure to address those issues and allow the company to grow. 

My supervisor agrees that I'm severely underpaid for my position. They've asked I allow a day for them to come up with a counter offer. They know they need to beat 20% increase in salary, 5% annual raises, etc. The new position at current company would be better on the resume than the new position at the new company would be: manager > senior specialist. 

So I'm looking at a 20%+ increase in pay, a promotion to management, and a promise of better benefits in the company restructuring if I stay. Versus taking a 15% base salary increase, but overall better benefits and a slightly less senior level at an entirely new company that's a bit more ""corporate"" than I'm used to.

What do I do here? Normally in these situations, counter offers are reactionary where the company ""suddenly has the money."" This is a much different scenario than the norm. My current job is very comfortable and relatively stress free and I'm so engrained in our processes, that I'd be very hard to replace. If I make 20%+ more salary with a manager title, I'd be sittin pretty. Especially since I have such a good working relationship with who is becoming, presumably, the CEO/President. Vs going to an entirely new company that I'd have to conform to. Do I take the counter? I feel like I'd have to...

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Accepted new job with 15% base salary increase + 5% annual bonus and 5% annual raise, and better benefits. Put in two week notice and was countered: company is going to go through a major restructure that promotes my supervisor and makes me manager, with a significant raise (expected to beat 20%+). Informed that benefits will be revised, and all concerns I've had with the company are being addressed. Do I stay or do I go?",Rogue_sector,1,1.0,20,1704305419,2024-01-03 18:10:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18xpp05/went_to_put_in_my_2_week_notice_and_was_hit_with/,1,2024
18xpjnl,Stuck with placements!!!! Please suggest what should I do ?,"
Hey all,
So, I am kinda posting for the first time here, a quick intro of me: final year from EE at an NIT (Tier 1.5)

so, i will be graduating this year during May. During my first year I was busy with my branch change stuffs (I was previously in mining engineering, but I wanted to be in CST, but due to competition, i was allotted EE), during the 2nd year(3rd sem) I struggled a lot acquanting myself with EE (P.S. : i still try to acquaint with it :(  )

now in 4th sem I started with dsa and dev stuffs, i still don't know what did i do, i literally wasted that time.. 

Now came the 3rd year, aka the internship season, so a VLSI company came for hiring both interns and FTEs, so, somehow i managed to clear the online test and appeared for the interview, result: I wasn't selected (which i am happy with), now from that day itself I thought, to prepare for this company, as it was giving a huge CTC of 34.75 LPA. So all my 3rd year including the summer vacation before the 4th year, I prepared literally everything for getting into it, be it digital electronics, digital ic design, microprocessor and microcontroller, arm, static timing analysis, physical design, verilog and alot of more stuffs. I was fully confident that I will crack the interview. So on the first day of placement itself (18th august) that firm came to our college again, result: ( didn't get shortlisted for giving the interview, reason: multiple face detection in the test platform)

Now I had no options left, so I thought I would try for any consultancy firm and get an IT exposure, and maybe then after joining I will upskill and grow myself into the IT domain.. so I practiced and got hands on experience with all the python frameworks, learns dbms, sql, power bi, excel.. And made 2-3 decent projects, all I did within 2 months, now i started applying for those companies in our campus which in which these skills were demanded.. I am having this much of bad luck, that not even a single time I was shortlisted for giving an interview, today is 3rd jan 2024, and I have literally sit for zero interviews in this placement season, now as time passed, majorly 75% in our department have got placed, so I thought to sit for core companies, then the same thing I did, I prepared for it, electrical machines, power systems, protection, switch gear, power electronics, plc. i gained a basic overview of the subjects, which is i guess sufficient for the interviews.

Now, recently a core company came, and i applied to it, luckily for the first time I got selected for the interview, the firm is paying 7LPA (45-48K inhand per month), but the most nightmare for me is the firm's T&C; they have a training period of 12 months and service bond of 2 years. 

I thought that if I won't get into IT/consultancy domain, then I'd have 1 year experience in any core firms and then pursue an MBA. But this service bond and training period is really a nightmare for me, as I will get stuck into a domain in which I don't have any interest that too for a long period.

Also, few consultancy companies are left to visit our campus, but if I get selected in this core firm, then I won't be able to sit for that..

So, could you all please suggest what should I do now?

Do well in the interviews? Accept the offer? Or I shouldn't take, and prepare for MBA exams, or I should focus on VLSI and apply offcampus, or I should apply for consultancy firms, what should i do ??? 😭😭😭😭",Wrong_Baby4633,1,1.0,0,1704305064,2024-01-03 18:04:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18xpjnl/stuck_with_placements_please_suggest_what_should/,1,2024

18xm3ue,"How can I help my partner land a job in B2B sales with job gaps, communication issues, and lack of education?","
Hi all,

My partner has a background in retail selling cosmetics goods like straightners, red light therapy machines, and other hair tools ranging from $200-$5000/6000. He essentially worked at a kiosk handing out samples to hundreds of people per day, running demos, and closing mall customers on the first interaction. He did extremely well in this role and closed a total of $600,000 over his two year tenure. 

Additionally, he has a background working as a cellular technical & customer service agent back in his home country. 

I’m worried about a couple things when it comes to him landing a job in B2B sales: 

1) He has 2 significant job gaps. One that was a year  in between his technical & customer service agent job and his retail sales job. The other one was after he had left his retail sales job back in December 2023 due to an unhealthy work environment. He is now back on the job market after waiting a year for an open work permit. I’m not sure how to explain either as he didn’t get up to much

2) English is his second language. It wasn’t a problem while working in retail, but his vocabulary hasn’t expanded much and he regularly makes grammatical errors while speaking.

18xkw9j,Feeling handcuffed in executive leadership,"I started at a company 15 years ago as a programmer. That company grew, and I became the head of product development and IT and eventually moved into the head of information security. The company currently has about 450 employees.

As I look laterally to similar IT, engineering, and infosec roles in other orgs, I find myself with the ability to fill the requirements of the role, but without a bachelor's degree, I just don't qualify. I'm making pretty good money now, but want to remain relevant and keep leveling up. I have certifications, just not that piece of paper that say that I went to and graduated college. 

I'm really not sure how to even look into a degree. There seem to be so many predatory online degree programs. And the idea of spending 4 years studying my butt off while working full time is not very exciting.

 Just looking for ideas here. I'm M49 in the US and starting to feel like I've plateaued. ",owner123456,1,1.0,13,1704292752,2024-01-03 14:39:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18xkw9j/feeling_handcuffed_in_executive_leadership/,1,2024

I started working remotely for a startup based in Europe full-time at a research position a month ago, they're getting their work done for dirt cheap basically (around 260 euros which afaik is not even minimum wage of the European country, but since I live in a 3rd world country, it converts to an okay-ish amount). 

Right now I'm working overtime without getting any compensation for the extra time, and I'm also working much more than what the job description said when I applied. On top of that, they paid me 20% less than the agreed amount for this last month. 

They have also for some reason not sent me the signed job contract yet despite reminding them multiple times. They keep saying we're working on it or that it's not been signed by the CEO yet. 

Now today they told me that they are ""not making enough profits"" and will have to cut my salary even more and that if don't want that I can stop working from tomorrow even though the notice period for quitting or layoff both was supposed to be 30 days. 

I don't know what to do because I won't be able to manage my expenses in the ""new"" salary, but I also won't be able to find a job very fast + my country is going through a financial crisis (it took me 2 months to get the job that I had before this even though I have a decent profile considering I graduated less than a year ago) and if I tell them that the new salary they're giving is unfair, they'll lay me off and I'll basically be jobless from tomorrow so it's a lose-lose situation for me rn.

18xj94q,Hating the subjectivity of it!,"So, I’ve been working as a graphic designer for the past 12 years, have done fine and the money is okay.

But, about two or three years ago I started to hate the subjective part of the job, basically dealing with the tastes of whoever is approving my designs, with the older C level that doesn’t understand branding to the younger marketing managers that want things to “pop”. I took a new job recently and it is just annoying dealing with same dynamic over an over.

I really want to deal with stuff that is measurable, and can be backed with knowledge or functionality, I did a lot of web design earlier in my career and I was thriving until I got trapped by the corporate benefits.

How I can get out of this work by guessing type of job? I would love to somehow use my experience, so some ramification of the design field could be perhaps an interesting path. I’m considering a masters as well. Also, I love the problem solving part that sometimes is needed in design.

I don’t want to go the freelance route because of healthcare and paperwork, it is too expensive to have a private healthcare insurance and dealing with tax paperwork and stuff seems to be a pain.

Has someone made a change in this way? Any recommendations, or guidance?

18xj04m,Should I be honest about sexual harassment in my exit interview?,"Hi there, I put my two weeks in and was asked for an exit interview. There’s a couple reasons I’m leaving:
boss has anger issues, health insurance is kinda shit, the company never pays our vendors on time so we can’t do our jobs well

But a big reason I’m leaving is because I reported sexual harassment and unwanted touching to our HR (my coworker kept putting his hand on my thigh) and all my company decided to do was make both of us take sexual harassment training and said that he can’t sit next to me or across from me in meetings. I got basically threatened to be fired if I spoke about the investigation at all at work. And he ended up getting a promotion several weeks after I reported this.

I’m just wondering if this is something I should mention in an exit interview or if this is something that may make them believe I’m trying to sue/file a complaint. I’m not really interested in going that route and just want to leave this behind me. I’m not sure if it would be worth it to tell them since I’m sure the can probably put two and two together but they obviously don’t give a shit about what happened.

In 2021, I decided to pursue an MBA, which I completed in 2023 and I couldn't secure any job afterwards. It's now the second day of 2024. I'm jobless and will turn 30 in a few weeks.

Qualifications: Engineering (2011 to 2015), MBA in Operations and Marketing (2021-2023).  
  
I want to put my past behind me and start my career from scratch. Currently, I'm exploring Power BI and Excel and find them interesting. My goal is to restart my career by using these skills and gradually build upon them. I am hesitant to enter the field of teaching civil services subjects as I think I'm horrible at them and don't want to revisit the path.

I am a career sales person. I have always worked in sales and I used to be REALLY good at it but I got burned out, and lately I have been drifting from job to job. When I started, I had a chip on my shoulder and I wanted to prove everyone wrong. Life changes happened, a death in the family, and for the past few years I have been questioning what the hell am I even doing?  

I have been working at top companies in my industry with great pay, etc but now I am underperforming, I dread every single day, and I am getting 0 enjoyment out of work. 

I feel like I need to quit my job and pursue a job that gives me joy - like maybe something in fitness or martial arts, or something creative. I basically just sell software now, which is for me: mind numbingly boring. I do not do anything creative, I am not passionate about what I sell, its simply about making money.   


Now in regards to money - I want to live well. I have around 5M in investments, so I know that if I quit I can survive, and I will be able to support myself. But my fear is that I will use all my money and I am not ready to retire and liquidate all of money. 

  
Lately I have been planning on moving to a low cost of living area, cutting down my expenses, and eventually quitting so that I have more runway to find something. 

I REALLY would love to find something I am interested in doing on a daily basis, but do not even know where to start. My only skills that I have were from corporate sales, and I really do not want to do anything that involves sales again. 

Anyone ever been in this situation and found a solution? what would you do?

18x8ve5,Pay raise Resulted in less money due to accidental overpayment??!? How do I handle it?,"I have worked for this company for almost a year and a half. I was notified in October that I would be seeing a 5% raise on my next check. My next check came and it was short so I looked back on old stubs to make sure I wasn’t missing something and took the question to HR. It was then noticed that they had been accidentally overpaying me for the past year. HR flagged management and ever since it has just been sitting there and I think it was decided that we would just leave it without formal closure on the subject. I have been praised for how well I do and haven’t received any negative criticisms that didn’t come from me catching my own mistakes. I also get along well with everybody I work with and always have a positive attitude, at least outwardly. I never really received a formal review or anything regarding my performance and the company I work for is small. I don’t really have a manager or supervisor besides the president, who is never in, as he is elderly and he and his wife have health issues. I obviously would like to make more money but now it is going to take some time to even get back to what I thought I was bringing home. I am also aware that I should have caught this when I started there but I didn’t, otherwise I would have said something. Do I ask for a raise? Do I leave it how it is and say nothing? How would you all handle this situation? I’m at a loss and feel a little awkward about it.

18x7jxx,"People who have achieved career success with middling intelligence, what besides hard work did you focus your career on?","I’m currently in a rut making just okay money (130k) with a mid-tier background (corporate tax, CPA). I’d really like to break through that 200k wall while I’m still not old (sub 40), but I’m not sure what to invest my time in to get the highest returns.  

From my point of view I have 3 paths, going back to business school but even an okay one (around T20) would be difficult considering my mediocre background. I could exit to consulting (Big 4) but I’m worried I’ll be pigeonholed into the field even if that might be the most straightforward way. Unfortunately even being a tax manager is taking up a good amount of my time since I’m just not that smart apparently, and I feel I’d have even less time to focus on applications in Big 4.  

I could also build on my technical skills which so far are just okay, PL-300 certified and I would say I’m lower intermediate in SQL. The same issue presents itself in terms of my intelligence though, and with a greater investment in my time as I move up I’m not sure how much more of a capacity for hard technical skills I have.  

The last option is to start my own business but I just don’t think this fits my personality type. I don’t really have the single-minded or knowledge to run even a tax consulting operation yet, and I’m not sure I have the mental capacity again to run anything impressive?

I enjoy driving, maintained a clean record, and have a plan for maintaining my health bc i already do things for that such as consistent and convenient workout routine, physical therapy & stretching & clean eating. Plus theres always places hiring for a CDL A job in my area and they all pay really good However, I'm aware of the challenges, including the physical toll long term and the reputation of alot of the trucking companies that truckers talk abt. What are your thoughts on this path?

Option 2: Dental Assistant & Real Estate License

My friends believe this is a more sustainable long-term option with less physical strain. However, concerns about the dental assistant job market which is low in my state & area plus the pay which ranges from $15-20 and $20-35 with added on certification’s if your lucky and potential challenges in real estate like how current agents are saying the market is going to crash in 2024 and prices for houses are at an all time high anddddd how over saturated the industry is have me hesitant. What advice do you have for navigating this career combination?

18x62f7,Should I let my employer know I am a state license holder to sell the same product/services?,"Recently, I obtained my state license in the field in which I currently work as a W2 employee. My employer supported my pursuit of this license, perhaps not anticipating my success. Now faced with a choice, I’m unsure about how to proceed.

I own a handyman/remodeling business, and my existing relationships in the industry could give me a head start if I decide to strike out on my own. I have three years to default on my license without activating it, providing some time for decision-making.

There are currently two license holders at my W2 company, and I’m considering whether to disclose my new qualification. Should I approach ownership to negotiate a higher position, potentially seeking equity (though I recognize this might be unlikely in a family business)? Alternatively, is it wiser to remain quiet and explore the possibility of becoming a competitor?

I’ve recently expressed interest in buying into the business or having it sold to me, but it seems unlikely due to the next owner being a family member.

18x58w3,Changing Fields - Current Engineer,"I am 25 and have a degree in biomedical engineering. In my first 3 years out of school I would say I’ve been successful (relative to time out in the industry). I’ve been promoted to a Senior Engineer and make around $100,000 a year. I work in medical device/technology and get to work on industry leading technology…. But I think I’ve come to terms that I don’t enjoy being an engineer as much as I thought I would. I am a very motivated worker, which leads to long days and often lots of stress (sometimes which is out of my control) . I am not sure if I want to stay in this kind of environment my whole career. I am strongly considering a management track rather than a more technical role, but I am not sure I will enjoy that anymore than my current role. 

My wife and I have both noticed that I am not passionate about my work nor my career field. I have been considering changing career fields but honestly have no idea where to start. I’m hesitant for a few reasons:

1. I’m very proud to be an engineer and worked very hard for the degree. 
2. I don’t believe money leads to happiness in the end, but it certainly aids in my wife and I being able to do the things we love. And I make a pretty nice living already just a few years out of school. And I know I can continue to be successful (but at what cost).
3. I’m not really sure what fields my skills would be transferable into.
4. Everyone in my family is successful so there’s the external pressure that makes me feel like I need to stick with it.

The things I’m most passionate about in my life are sports (especially the NFL and golf) and the outdoors (hiking, rock climbing, etc).

I would love some advice or personal testimonials on how to successfully change career fields and/or how an engineering skillset can be transferred to other fields!

18x542f,Unqualified teaching assistant,"From the UK

So I want to get into becoming a TA/Nursery Assistant as I have some experience from when I looked after my neighbours kids through most of my secondary school life and then in year 10 I volunteered for a month during the summer at my former afterschool club where I helped to pick up and drop the kids back to the club, helped prepare food/ get their lunches ready, setting up activities, helping to monitor them during computer time/free play. Tagged along during swimming, going to the local adventure playground and library.

I really enjoyed both experiences and found it rewarding.

I also want to to do this as I am doing a TEFL course and wanting to teach English abroad at some point in the future and this would help.

I've applied to some (looked up whether they are legit or not as its so easy to get scammed in this sort of setting) just waiting to hear back. I've also applied to apprenticeships but I get rejected as I don't have enough experience but I also find it shocking that they will pay that little money for someone more qualified.

18x4d4o,Thinking of getting an MBA to break into film or gaming – worth it or nah? [27M],"I (27M) am considering going back to school to get an MBA. I completed my Bachelor of Arts, majoring in communications with a management minor, in 2020. Since then, I've been employed in both administrative and communications roles at a public policy think tank, based out of Alberta, Canada. I’m hoping to receive some general advice or feedback on my current perspective on things, as I feel extremely naive and uncertain.   
  
My primary motive for pursuing an MBA stems from a belief that more fulfilling career opportunities await me. Currently, my duties as an admin and comms coordinator involve tasks that I find menial and unsatisfying, such as data entry, handling reception duties and organizing events. I also find certain aspects of my communications role, like writing social media posts, less than stimulating. I view an MBA as a pathway to more strategic and overarching roles, allowing me to collaborate across departments rather than feeling like a cog in someone else's machine.  
  
Another consideration is that I'm drawn to more culturally significant industries, such as film or video games. I believe I have strengths in strategic problem solving and writing, but admittedly I still feel like a kid who doesn’t know what they want to do when they grow up. So I'm not even certain what I would do in those fields (maybe that's what I would learn in an MBA program?).  My ambition is to avoid a career full of monotonous tasks and instead engage in broader, more impactful work—perhaps akin to what a project manager in a studio or a typical CEO might do.

  
A couple of tidbits: I also want aspire to have a good salary (like 150K) and I think a career like Reggie Fils-Aimé's would be dream.  
  
If I were to go back, I would do an evening MBA part time in my city, which would take 2.6 years and cost roughly 50K (according to the school’s tuition fees document). I intend to maintain my current job, which offers a $60,000 salary, while pursuing my studies—fortunately, my VP supports this plan and I've also verified that the GMAT requirement will be waived for me.

18x49hy,No in person interview for hybrid job,"No in person interview for hybrid job

I'm in the process of interviewing at a company for a business process engineering job 

I currently work full time remote and miss going into the office and working with people in person. I have a 6 month old baby though so looking to only go in two or three days a week. 

The job I'm applying for is a step back and a pay cut but has better growth opportunities than my current job and would put me back in my desired industry plus a few days face to face theoretically. The recruiter and hiring manager confirmed it is hybrid with Tuesday and Thursday in office though hiring manager alluded to still in the process of getting people in consistently. 

I asked them both about the hiring process and they both said in person panel interview with case study presentation. Despite this when I received the invitation it is a teams call and when I asked they said they're doing them all that way. 

I already overlooked the fact that the position is listed as entry level but it was clear they needed someone with experience (expected to work with minimal supervision and long term goals build op ex dept and culture). Also going from $115k current job  to $85k if everything went to job offer. 

Is it odd to never interview a potential hire in person when they're local and expected to work in person on some regular basis?

If I get an offer could I ask for a site tour on an in office day before deciding?

18x3ac0,How I should navigate my studies and align them with my passion ?,"Hello,  
  
I don't know if it is the right place to write this, but I'll try it. I'm writing to get your advice and thoughts on my current situation. I'm 20 years old, a freshman at university, where I'm studying software engineering.  
  
A bit of myself:  
  
In my final year of high school, at the age of 18, I started going to the gym. I quickly developed a passion for it, realizing that each day I went was a day I did something positive for myself. After high school, I enlisted in the military for 9 months, in order to discover more about who I am and what I want from life. After the whole military stuff ended, I was accepted into a university program in software engineering. This opportunity is especially meaningful to me because the program is state-financed, so I don't have to bear the financial burden. The reason, I chose software engineering is because I've always been surrounded by computers and had an inclination that I would enjoy this field. After I moved to another city from my parents, in my study city, my parents still help me financially a bit (I'm saying that they are not wealthy), I started to think about my future more and more, I started taking my time very seriously, trying to spend it as wisely as I could. What I mean by that is, go gym, do homework, watch some videos, and make some food.  
  
About five months ago, I began a strict diet, cutting out junk food and monitoring my calorie intake. This discipline has resulted in a lean physique, which I take great pride in, despite my parents' concerns about my eating habits. I understand their worries, but this fitness journey brings me immense joy and satisfaction.  
  
I've never smoked/vaped, or drank. I find it challenging that I don't have friends who share this level of focus and dedication to their goals.  
  
The reason I'm reaching out is to gain perspective on where I stand currently. Specifically, I'm struggling with my studies. Despite putting in considerable effort, I find the subject matter unenjoyable and sometimes fail to pass some courses. I might succeed but not be happy. My heart leans towards pursuing something related to my fitness journey, not necessarily as a bodybuilder, but in a capacity that could provide me with passive income. My ultimate goal is to achieve financial freedom for myself and my parents.  
  
Any advice on how I should navigate my studies and align them with my passion for fitness would be greatly appreciated.",Goblinas123,1,1.0,1,1704236636,2024-01-02 23:03:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18x3ac0/how_i_should_navigate_my_studies_and_align_them/,1,2024

That being said, I feel like a lot of what I do in my spare time holds me back somehow from being the professional that I aspire to be in many ways. By that, I mean in a more senior role hopefully one day!

I see a lot of other people who work in the same industry as me, who either don't have social media as far as I know, or if they do they just have a LinkedIn or a Twitter account that is basically LinkedIn for them (i.e they retweet what their company posts out, etc.). Meanwhile, my Twitter mainly consists of retweets of video game art and the occasional shitpost.

Is it wrong to think that my hobbies (video games, anime, films, etc.) are a poor reflection on myself as a working professional? I feel like a lot of other people who are either on the same level as me career-wise, or miles ahead of me have more 'mature' hobbies - and that feels like a strange thing to type, but it also feels like the truth at the same time.

I honestly don't know what constitutes a 'mature' hobby when I say this - but I think it stems from guilt of not being productive 24/7 (something I have talked about here previously) and perhaps taking too much of social media at face value and not seeing the bigger picture (again, something I have posted about recently) but I want to know what your advice would be; do you ever feel this guilt or like there's something in your way that stops you from unlocking your true potential? Or like, you feel like you can't be your authentic self while also holding down a stable job?

If you're someone who likes to play video games, usually as a main hobby, do you feel like it reflects on what you do for a living, or just on you as a person? Ideally, I want to be able to enjoy the hobbies that I do, but not feel this sense of guilt everytime I do because I am a 'professional' and feel like there is a level of standard I have to achieve each day if I want to be succesful as well in terms of my career, like something is telling me in the back of my mind ""You either want to be a gaming nerd, or a working professional, you can't be both. Choose one.""",ChocobroMoglord,1,1.0,3,1704230421,2024-01-02 21:20:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18x0ozl/do_you_feel_like_what_you_do_in_your_free_time/,1,2024

18wzcck,Thoracic Surgeon or Corporate Lawyer?,"I am a 10th grader, I have strong leadership skills, great communication skills and I always have a strong desire for working hard and smart to keep my status and what I do everyday perfectly, like Bree Van De Kamp but in career. I really like the healthcare industry because I'm detail oriented (which allows me to love learn Biology and especially Human body anatomy), love helping people and working hard to see my results. But then, I bump into these reddit posts about how the med school students are dropping out, absolutely hating it and getting depressed over it, that makes me rethink but at the same time I don't wanna be regretting how I didn't go into the healthcare industry on my deathbed.


Now, for law,
I've always wanted to be a lawyer but I don't have a deep passion for it like I do for healthcare. When I imagine myself as a lawyer, in court, it doesn't entice me or challenge me. It's basically unimaginable. But I have liked how I get to make people follow the ""rules"" and correct people, because that's just how much of a perfectionist I am when it comes to serious stuff in life. 


So please, if you work in the healthcare industry and legal field or have been endured this kind of situation, feel free to help me out!

I recently got the opportunity to get an internship in SAS but I know that their software is kinda old in the data science field (opinion based on a brief reddit search :) ). But I also made some research and seems that the company is approaching its IPO and they're trying to implement some python/R code or packages so feels like something under the table is going on. So I'm asking here, for people working there or if they've some experience: do you use python/R and some open source/ data science more common tools in your day to day or ""I work at SAS I just know SAS""?
How is it considered working there?
My question is that I'm afraid that this experience could lead to nothing in my hands for the job market.

18wxa64,Am I Being Pushed Out?,"I've been a receptionist at this activities facility for a few months now where my job is to check people in, answer the phones, and process payments for equipment and reservations. I've been getting nothing but rave reviews of my work ethic and efficiency by my management team and even from other people who my managers were talking highly of me to. 

Something has changed though and I don't know if it's a one off thing or I'm being pushed out. I went into work for a short shift on new years eve and when I arrived, I said hello to everyone and noticed another manager sitting in my seat (and the only place we have access to processing payments, answering the phone, doing the job, basically). This is a manager the general manager has told me in the past to ""kick out"" of my seat because they ""want to be a receptionist but they arent"". I, for obvious reasons do not feel comfortable kicking out a higher up and someone who has been at this facility multiple seasons longer than I have; this is my first season. 

So I stand near them and start small talking about the holidays hoping they'll see I'm here and ready to work and they can leave. They don't. So I ask my general manager ""are we both receptionist tonight?"" And they tell me ""if you don't want to be here, you don't have to be, you can go home. But yeah you both are because it's a short night."" I was like...dumbfounded so I said ""ok I'll take a seat at one of the other front desk chairs"".

So I do and because I don't have access to anything I have guests coming up to me instead of getting in the longer reception line and I have to then look silly by telling them to get in line to be helped. They, naturally all look at me confused like ""what are you doing here?"" And that's totally fair because I'm starting to ask myself the same thing. 

Someone comes up wanting to buy equiptment and my general manager stands behind the manager playing receptionist to try and get me to come over and check them out on the computer. Of course though, the manager ""receptionist"" stands up and uses her body to block the computer, I assume thinking my general manager was me. So GM looks at me kind of like wide eyed and surprised and shrugs like ""well, nevermind, I was going to have you do this No_Cow, but that's not going to fly."" 

So a guest asks me for help with lockers, I can do that so I grab the key and leave. When I come back all of the front desk seats are taken by receptionist manager, my general manager, and one of the supervisors of the entire outdoor activity center who has been there the whole time, I assume, witnessing all of this. 

So i decide to go sit in the little snack table in the back since no one is paying any attention to me or moving or anything and I just get on my phone. I give it 10 minutes, my general manager walks past me, doesn't say anything or acknowledge me. I probably looked sad too because I was. I love my job and it was no surprise that I was going to be there that night as general manager and I had a conversation about it the night before. 

So I get my coat on and gather my things as receptionist manager comes back to ask me if I'm leaving and after I say yes they ask me to watch the desk for a moment while they get water. Sure. But we have a ""be right back"" sign for a reason.  

I go to my GM and tell them I'm leaving and they say ""ok. I'm sorry about [insert manager] they have a habit of doing that..."" I say ""oh yeah, well, it's a short night anyway."" So we say goodbye and I'm so annoyed at their reaction. They are a few decades older than any of us and especially that manager receptionist who is younger than I am. Why couldn't they do something about this situation? It's literally their job. 

So I go over to the company supervisor to say goodbye and that it was nice to see them. They ask me, surprised, if I'm leaving (I've only been there and clocked in for maybe half an hour at that point). I said ""yeah"" and they asked me why so I said ""oh I have plans later I'm going to get a head start on preparing for, and I feel like there's really no work for me to do here tonight, and I also feel I'm annoying customers by being at the desk and being unable to help them outside of asking them to get in line."" He had a look on his face I can't pin point the emotion of and said ""ok."" He's usually a man of few words. 

Overall, I'm just hurt. I like my job and I'm confused how to move forward with this or if I should even say anything. It's a seasonal job so maybe it's just not really a professional environment like that. I already work a full time job, this was the perfect part time to give me extra money for books and other materials while I'm also studying in college and the schedule is flexible. It's perfect in every way and I don't want to lose it.",No_Cow9852,1,1.0,2,1704222267,2024-01-02 19:04:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18wxa64/am_i_being_pushed_out/,1,2024

I'm depressed about how my drug addiction has brought me to this point I know my future and career's ruined right now. And I want to move from the past and want to start fixing and building it now for the better. There's not much scope for mechanical engineering in India unless student's skilled and know the subject. And I've no idea if even if I manage to clear my backlog in the next 2-3 years (coz my university allows me to apply only 6 subjects per chance & I'll get 3 chances to clear in a year, assuming I'll pass 6/6 subjects in a go, giving 3 times in a year, I'll probably take 2-3 years of extension). I do not have much idea of the mechanical engineering field and if I can get a good paying job with my extended degree, after getting the degree I'll have to do courses and learn skills that will be needed to get a job cause just the degree won't suffice much as I'll be having to apply off-campus for jobs.

18wvy50,"Promotion + New Payband Last Year, Salary Adjustment Question","Hello all, just wanted some perspective on the following situation:  
I've been at my company for about 2.5 years. (Healthcare IT/Gov Contractor). Last year myself and my managers fought for a larger salary increase based upon having excellent performance, unfortunately we ""lost"". We average 3% salary increases based on merit each year.  
Instead of a larger than normal increase, I got promoted into a new payband with about a 4% salary increase (3% annual and 1% tacked onto the promotion).  
My question is thus: Before the promotion, I was about 1% lower than the midpoint for that payband. After the promotion, I am at the very bottom of my new payband (like, the floor basically).  
Since I didn't get a ""real"" raise to go along with the promotion last year, during this performance eval season I wanted to discuss with my manager getting a salary adjustment to the midpoint of my new band. This would be about a 29% salary increase. I understand that is probably unrealistic, but being at the floor of my payband as a top performer also is.  
I was thinking about asking for a 20%-23% increase instead, so it gives me 2-3 more years of annual increases before hitting my new payband's midpoint.  
Would that be a reasonable ask in this situation? My performance isn't in question and my team/managers all love me and have bat for me before, usually it's just whatever HR machinations go on in the background that prevent a more substantial increase.

18wvhhg,"5 months in, and my new ""dream"" job is not what I thought it was.","I'm wondering how long I should give it a chance. I don't really want to leave, but I only see more responsibilities getting added to my plate. 


There are aspects of the job that I really love, but there also some things that I worry are going to become deal breakers over time. While I have great benefits, good company culture, and hybrid flexibility, there is also little opportunity for pay raises and promotions. That is usually why people end up leaving. Too many responsibilities for too little pay. 


There were some job cuts before I came aboard 4-5 months ago, and many employees ended up taking on more work/responsibilities from jobs that had been cut. 


To keep it as vague as possible, I work in a creative/design role, but I've ended up doing a lot with social media/email marketing/analytics, project management within my department, plus dealing with external vendors. While I don't mind spending of these tasks, it's becoming too much. I feel spread too thin and like I don't have enough time to focus on the main responsibilities of my role (the main one being *actually* designing things lol).


I spend a lot of time just simply trying to get ahold of vendors/hold them to agreed upon deadlines and make sure projects are running according to schedule when that isn't even what I was hired for. There is a reason I'm not a project manager, and I don't really have an interest in being one. 


When asked how things are going, I have brought up my areas of struggle to the higher up folks in my department, and while they are understanding, they are equally overburdened with extra responsibilities, if not more. Everyone seems to be taking on additional raises that they weren't hired for/don't really know how or even want to do. 


I like the company I work for, and I like the benefits and my coworkers ... But I only see more tasks getting added to my plate. The odds are slim to none that new hires will be brought on to replace the cut roles. 


I don't really know the right solution. This was supposed to be a dream role at a dream company. I was planning to stay for a long time, but now I'm just trying to convince myself to give it a full year before I consider moving on.",ahhhhthrowaway101,1,1.0,0,1704217990,2024-01-02 17:53:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18wvhhg/5_months_in_and_my_new_dream_job_is_not_what_i/,1,2024

18wst4v,Transitioning from languages into business,"Hi everyone,

I've turned to this subreddit to ask for career advice. I'm 24 and feel a bit behind because my peers seem to have everything sorted out.

I'm about to graduate with a degree in English language and literature and Spanish from a German university. I've always been praised for my language skills, so naturally, I gravitated towards that field. However, the harsh reality has caught up with me. Most jobs in this domain are either on the verge of being replaced by AI or come with low pay and limited chances for advancement.

During my studies, I stumbled upon a part-time job as a language trainer for a company that offers tailored language lessons to local businesses. This exposed me to people from various fields - project management, human resources, sales, marketing, you name it. As a result, I've become interested in business. I find project management particularly appealing.

To make myself more marketable to employers, I'm contemplating doing an MSc in international business. It's a broad qualification that seems to open up opportunities in various fields. However, one question remains: how can I merge my passion for language and culture with this newfound appreciation for business?

18wqjk7,How to transition into accounting/finance career?,"TLDR version: left sales, work at a college finance, love it but want to get away from public-facing roles and into traditional accounting/finance roles (probably CPA, more interested in accounting than financial analyst roles). Not sure which route to take, but I want stability and marketable skills, so with my background and current role, accounting makes sense. I’m 30 and want to really jumpstart my career (and earnings potential) while my wife and I are young and have minimal responsibility aside from work.

I have a BS in Business Management. It was fairly useless. I was young and didn’t take undergrad seriously, and that led me to about 8 years working in sales. Burned out and left sales. Now work at a community college in finance (A/R, third party billing, advising students on payment options, etc). I love it, but my goal is to move away from the public-facing, customer-based roles and into accounting/finance roles, likely eventually obtaining my CPA, but still exploring options.

Two paths I can take:

A) Utilize my employee benefit of free community college tuition to take my required 30ish credits needed for CPA. No degree - just take the classes and self prepare for the exams. Would take longer - few abbreviated sessions, and not all courses are offered online, so less flexibility. Less course options to really explore my career interests (CPA or bust) but again, it’s free as long as I’m employed there.

B) An online Master’s of Accounting from a good state university. My employer may reimburse tuition partially on a case-by-case basis; without that, it would cost around $20,000. I’d think this should better prepare me for CPA exams, I’d have a Masters degree, an alumni network, job fairs, etc. I’d imagine a better ROI this route, or at least a quicker path to upward mobility, and more options to explore and find a niche.

I’m leaning towards the Masters, but it’s tempting to utilize free tuition. I’m concerned that ~10 community college classes with no degree, alumni network, or career center would leave me poorly prepared for the CPA if I go that route, and poorly equipped for my next career move, as I’d have nothing to show for it until passing the CPA.

Anyone have any suggestions as to which would provide a better ROI and quicker path to career growth?",stayxvicious,1,1.0,0,1704205338,2024-01-02 14:22:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18wqjk7/how_to_transition_into_accountingfinance_career/,1,2024

18wq8x6,"I quit my job, started a business, and still don’t know what I want to do long-term.","TL;DR: I used to work as an architectural designer and a couple bad experiences have led me to question my career in architecture altogether. I’m now out of the workforce and just do my business full-time and take a class, neither of which I’m over the moon about either. I feel clueless to my long-term career goals despite having previously been ultra passionate about architecture and genuinely don’t know how to figure out what I want.

I used to work as an architectural designer and quit a few months ago. Since finishing school in 2020, I have worked in two separate offices (was laid off from the first) and have absolutely hated both of them. I’m not lazy or careless, but I felt incompetent all the time. I would make honest mistakes and felt that the learning curve was so incredibly steep. Anything short of perfection was basically intolerable in these offices, and I would get reprimanded by the lead architects for forgetting something (nothing ever structural, mostly just a graphic error on the drawings). 

I was already burned out by the time I got laid off from the first job. I wanted to take a break, take a low stakes PT job and reassess my career goals (with my spouse’s support), but I let a recruiter talk me into taking the second job, convincing me that there wouldn’t be any job opportunities if I waited. By the time I quit the second job 1.5 years later, I was so miserable, anxious, and depressed. 

I’ve since taken the break that I needed, and still out of the workforce (I volunteer; I’m taking an online class PT, and I’m about to start working in an afterschool program), but I haven’t figured out what I really want to do. The class that I’m taking is interesting but I realize it’s not really where I want to take my career. 
I started a business selling my handmade decor items as something to maybe do on the side in the long term. I don’t even know if I enjoy it. I wanted to do art full time but kind of felt like maybe I’d miss design or creating tangible things. I’m nervous try doing architecture again because of my fears of incompetence and disliking it again. 

My business is so far from taking off, and in general I just feel like such a waste. I was so passionate about architecture while I was in college, but the professional experience I’ve had has made me question if it’s for me. I know that not every office is the same and that I might find one that I enjoy. I just hate the idea of taking another job only to keep it for a year. So basically, rather than trying out a new job I’ve retreated to doing nothing at all and not knowing where to turn. I never imagined that I would quit architecture so not having a clear vision for the future is disorienting. 

I really would like honest advice and ideas. TIA",tulipfiona,1,1.0,0,1704204479,2024-01-02 14:07:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18wq8x6/i_quit_my_job_started_a_business_and_still_dont/,1,2024

Mainly because one, I stupidly pulled out the ""well that depends"" because he usually likes the nuance of my analysis about certain patients. And two, he's about 30-or-40 years older than me and grew up in a very rough environment, whereas I'm only 20 years old and have been sheltered my entire life.

He often brings up politics so tied to his childhood experiences that no matter what I respond with (agreeing, disagreeing, nodding along, saying I don't want to talk about this, etc.) he'll always tell me something along the lines of ""well that's why you have to learn"" or ""you're going into social work; it's important"" and try to make the conversation even more extremist and political.

Also the rambles are getting much, much longer. I keep feeling bad because he'll talk to me for thirty minutes to an hour and a half while my coworkers are working, and I can't find a way to cut the conversation short so it doesn't look like I'm slacking off talking politics with my boss. The only way the conversation stops prematurely is if the phone rings, but that isn't happening as often anymore now that open enrollment is coming to a close.

It's gotten to the point where he's sending me documentaries about WWII to me. Which, okay if it was just sending me documentaries I would be fine with it because clearly he just wants someone to talk about his interests with him. But then he sends me a text saying ""Exam questions:"" and a list of actual questions pertaining to the documentary. And I just can't. He expects to actually school me on this and I'm supposed to bend backwards watching 2-3 hours of documentaries every day out of sheer respect??? AND keep up with tons of fear-mongering news AND deal with his one hour of bullshit at work where he tells me the reason I'm not allowed to marry a muslim guy. (I'm fucking single and none of my coworkers even know if I have dating experience or not. And just for your information, no I've never dated a muslim person, so even if they knew it still wouldn't pertain to my life at all.)

If my parents weren't fucked up enough to not let me have another job besides this one (They have rights and access to my car. WFH jobs are tough to find but I'm trying.) I would have quit long before this even happened. And for those who are saying to report him: I haven't seen his extremist viewpoints be a concern when seeing patients. He seems good at leaving his politics at the door when it comes to his professional life, but I think because I've worked there for so long he no longer sees my presence as ""professional"" anymore.

Something else that also sticks out to me is that one of my coworkers told me he was like this when she first started working. She was shy and not willing to talk about her life at the time and, to make conversation, he would also send her WWII documentaries for her to watch. Which I find interesting because I don't like indulging in my personal anything at work and just give out the most non-answer answer someone can make. I've been taught that this is the best way to avoid confrontation, but now I'm wondering if it's doing the complete opposite for me...",Monthly_Vent,1,1.0,30,1704201209,2024-01-02 13:13:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18wp4yu/how_do_i_stop_my_boss_from_talking_about_politics/,1,2024
18woqhm,Opinion?,Long story short I was hired on a whim. He told me I had no qualifications for the job in the interview but I interviewed so well he hired me. That turned out to be false. He hired me because the other applicant could not pass a drug test. Fine. Well the lady training me had 1 week to train me. The problem here is that we had tech issues the first 2 days so I got 3 days of training which isn’t close to enough. I know I’m not qualified and have an idea. My manager told me that when he hired me he hired my wife too. Well my wife is more than qualified for this position and I would like to keep this income and be honest at the same time. My wife and I spoke about this and have decided maybe I should talk to him and tell him I know I’m not qualified but my wife is. I know it seems weird but I’m drowning already. I mean they desperately hired me? I would rather be honest and let him know it’s not for me. But also provide my replacement which is my wife.

18wmxie,Burnout due to role or is it just me?,"Hi,
I’m struggling with this one. I’ve been at my current role 2 years as a manager level (independent contributor). My workload feels like it’s excessive and I’m working above 8 hour days every day during the week. Many times I go into work early in the morning but still don’t feel like I’m able to stay on top of key projects. 

Previously I’ve moved roles abut every two years for more responsibilities, higher pay, etc. in the past I have felt my workload becoming stressful but rarely to the point where I feel like I am drowning.  I also don’t feel like I have the support at work to help with this issue as I have tried asking before. My plan was initially to stay at this company for longer because I was finally happy with the role and the pay. I do know that I could leave for a promotion somewhere else for a $30k raise but I am afraid as I am already drowning in work at this level. I don’t have the option to take time unpaid or not be working. 

Is there any  advice on how to manage this stress? Should I begin looking elsewhere?  If so, how do I ensure I don’t end up in a similar position again?",Acceptable_Bad5173,1,1.0,1,1704193479,2024-01-02 11:04:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18wmxie/burnout_due_to_role_or_is_it_just_me/,1,2024
18wlbp6,How to work with team mates who are unavailable and passive aggressive?,"I started on a new job two months ago in a recently formed team. My manager, who was hired six months ago, works remotely, while the rest of us are in the office. There are 3 others on the team and they also started roughly 6 months ago. My teammates are often offline and rarely come to the office. Most of our work can not be done in isolation, and we frequently need to consult each other. However, they miss meetings, respond late to Slack messages, and  use 'Do Not Disturb' or 'Out of Office' statuses whenever they feel like without prior notice. They keep rescheduling meetings, unavailable and give off some kinda passive aggressive vibes.

They blame the remote nature of our manager and time zone differences and justify skipping meetings, regardless of the time. I knew the team is a distributed one and that I have work across time zones before joining. The late night or early morning meetings are just once or twice a week and don’t go beyond an hour. Funnily, it’s easier to reach out and get support from my colleagues overseas than the ones who are in my location. 

As a new employee, I find it hard to build trust whewwn I can't even get their availability. It's frustrating, and I'm unsure how to discuss this with my manager without seeming like I'm complaining about them. My project timelines are being extended due to this issue, and I find myself taking on more work and completing tasks independently because my teammates are not cooperative or present.",Frosty_Housing_734,1,1.0,1,1704187122,2024-01-02 09:18:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18wlbp6/how_to_work_with_team_mates_who_are_unavailable/,1,2024

18wjrv7,Been unemployed for 3 years how do I explain this away?,"So the reason I've been unemployed for 3 years is because my former employer fired me because I suffered a MC (miscarriage), and I was scheduled for a D&C and had a doctors note I would not be in work that week because of what I had endured. During the week I was going through my MC, I was calling the office, texting both my bosses, emails, and neither of them ever replied to me. I went back to work the week after suffering the most traumatic thing a woman could endured and I was called into my office manager's office the second I got into the office and he asked me was ""what is wrong with me?"" and when I told him what happened he actually laughed at me and he than told ""my health was to unstable and I was being terminated immediately."" Now this was the only time I missed work, I was never late, always 40 minutes early and the first one in the office.  So I pursued a lawsuit against my former employer who violated several laws including Americans with disabilities law and the American pregnancy law. So because of this lawsuit I have been unemployed for 3 years and my former employer even went so far as to blacklist me during this time. Now my case is public record so my name will always come up. When I go to apply for jobs the first 2 questions I get asked are 1. I worked for X? and I reply yes and they say Never apply here again, the second question is How come I haven't worked for 3 years? The case was settled out of court but my former employer is a huge national/international company.  I've been trying to explain that I've been helping my dad care for my mom whose had cancer, which is true but when companies do background checks they see the real reason. 

I don't know what to do, I need a job but this will always be on record now. Does anyone have any advice?

18wjalm,"Should I move away from Videography, Editing and the visual arts?","I feel like I may have made an insanely bad career move. I was working as an automotive technician, hating it, after 3 years in the field and a few years at a community college. I was all in and gung ho about being a mechanic, but after 3 years I wanted out. wasnt very good money, nobody was happy, flate rates garbage, and I dont want to destroy my body

I made alot of youtube videos and have been into video for a very long time, Im a very creative person and have always secretely wanted to do something with the arts. I decided to go back to school.. at 26, for the past two years for graphic design/video. I figured, worse case scenario I would buff up my skills for making videos

now, technologys hit a point where the barrier to entry is super low, competition is global for editing and design, and alot of creative work. not to mention AI is getting better, and somehow looks like its going to diminish alot of creative work, one way or another. Im very seriously worried its going to take over the the industry entirely

I was hoping to start freelance video editing and doing some videography, which I am, but the future is looking very sketchy for the long term and it is very brutal.

Im also pretty entrepreneurial and want to start my own business or at least work for myself. But I wouldnt mind a decent creative job either

am I a total fool for sticking with this? or should I start positioning myself to get into a different type of work?

Should I stick with creative jobs and try to evolve into more of a creative director type position that may command AI, type of thing in the future?

my hope was really to get a remote video editing job, but of course its very competitive and maybe my portfolio isnt strong enough. Ive been applying, I know the markets rough

18widoo,Advice Needed: Just Passed State License – Unsure of Next Steps within Current Company,"Recently, I obtained my state license in the field in which I currently work as a W2 employee. My employer supported my pursuit of this license, perhaps not anticipating my success. Now faced with a choice, I’m unsure about how to proceed.

I own a handyman/remodeling business, and my existing relationships in the industry could give me a head start if I decide to strike out on my own. I have three years to default on my license without activating it, providing some time for decision-making.

There are currently two license holders at my W2 company, and I’m considering whether to disclose my new qualification. Should I approach ownership to negotiate a higher position, potentially seeking equity (though I recognize this might be unlikely in a family business)? Alternatively, is it wiser to remain quiet and explore the possibility of becoming a competitor?

I’ve recently expressed interest in buying into the business or having it sold to me, but it seems unlikely due to the next owner being a family member.

18wi9kl,Transitioning from languages into business,"Throwaway account, FWIW.

Hi everyone,

I've turned to this subreddit to ask for career advice. I'm in my mid-twenties, feeling a bit behind while my peers appear to have everything sorted out.

I'm about to graduate with a degree in English language and literature and Spanish from a German university. I've always been praised for my language skills, so naturally, I gravitated towards that field. However, the grim reality has caught up with me - most jobs in this domain are either on the verge of being replaced by AI or come with low pay and limited chances for advancement.

During my studies, I stumbled upon a part-time job as a language trainer for a company that provides tailored language lessons to local businesses. This exposed me to people from various fields - project management, human resources, sales, marketing, you name it. As a result, I've become interested in business.

To make myself more appealing to employers, I'm contemplating pursuing an MSc in international business. It's a broad qualification that seems to open up opportunities in various fields. However, one question lingers: how can I merge my passion for language and culture with this newfound appreciation for business?

Thank you so much.",False-Cartographer96,1,1.0,0,1704175354,2024-01-02 06:02:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18wi9kl/transitioning_from_languages_into_business/,1,2024
18whwaj,Am I being impulsive in wanting to make a career switch at 25?,"
I (25F) have been working in management since I turned 18. I got a job as a cashier and quickly became a manager within 3 months. I was there for almost 4 years and was given the opportunity to run my own store at 19 but I declined because I just didn’t see myself working there and I wanted to explore different jobs. I had a second job working at a daycare so I decided to quit my management job (November 2019) and go back to school for business since I dropped out of college. Covid happened a few months later and I was out of a job and spiraled into having an alcohol addiction. Dropped out AGAIN I worked random jobs (Book keeping, and account management) the next 2 to basically feed my addiction. I lost all motivation and my mental health got worse. I always struggled with depression but man I truly lost my will to live. One night of putting my nose where it didn’t belong I almost OD. I’ll never forget having a moment with myself where I thought I was going to die and accepted my fate. I closed my eyes and to my surprise I woke up the next morning. The next day I decided to focus on my sobriety and get back into some sort of career path. I got a job as a property manager and after a year I was let go due to having a new supervisor who wanted to give my position to a family member. I felt so defeated after that. I have been very fortunate that 18 year old me put money into stocks and I paid all my debt (Car, credit cards) that financially I was able to support myself for the year without needing to stress about a job. It did come with the cost of no longer having a savings to fall back on but it was well worth it to me. So I took this last year (2023) to focus on my mental health and travel.

I texted my boss on Sunday that I would come late to work. This was the convo 

Me: Hi, I have a doctors appointment tomorrow, will be in around 1 
Him: Why didn’t you go on Sat, I need you for a task ( this was due on Monday and which I wasn’t informed about, he wanted last minute help) 
Me: I had to schedule the appointment as per convenience. I had scheduled this for last Monday but couldn’t go. ( this was because I had to represent my manager at office cause he was at a shoot) 
Him: we are all working on weekends, trying to catch up with deadlines. I have been working with fever spells and finishing work 
Me: I understand. But my priority at the moment is taking care of my health. 

He didn’t reply after this and texted me the next day about how he was taking the day off. 
This really pissed me off and disappointed me cause this manager acts very nice and friendly in person. I was extremely sick that week and he tried to make me feel guilty for taking a few hours off work. I’m an intern who consistently does great work so I was taken aback when he said this.

18wfitj,What I've learned so far..,"Hey there!

I hope you find this post helpful especially if you are just starting you career and seem anxious or stressed about work and where you're heading in life. For those who are experienced, feel free to drop in some additional comments to someone out there who needs to see this.

Probably like you, I was both excited and nervous about my first job despite my lack of experience but really needing it to get myself going in my career. Right off the gate, I was involved and had my share of working some late nights here and there as well as living remotely on job locations in the middle of nowhere. Everything was manageable and things were going well learning on the spot and getting stuff done at the same time. 

Everything was going well, until... haha

One day I was discussing with other Co workers an area of a project we were working on and I expressed some knowledge of the area as it was near my masters research area. I went back to my office and went back to work AND ALL OF A SUDDEN my boss walks in and starts a frustrated rant about how I need to be more of an expert on this stuff (the area we were looking at) and how I needed to answer everyone. I was thrown off since I thought this was more of a learning opportunity for me since I've been only doing this for a little over a year at the time. He finally ends the rant with: 

""If you can't justify your reasoning for being here, you know what happens to you, right?"" 

I was stunned. My motivation for the day let alone the rest of the week was gone and didn't want to go into work. It felt pointless at that moment. It got bad to a point where I called my parents (yes teens. Growns up still call their parents on bad days lol moms and dads love it when you call them when they're longer working. Call them and tell them you love them.) Anyway, they advised me to talk to him off the side and ask what my expectations were (which he never answered and dodged it). 

At first I thought it was me and I'm not doing enough and losing a job could've been a possibility. As time went on, I started noticing my boss on phone calls apologizing about not emailing people back, messing up at parts of his job and what he does, and even had higher end people in the company tell him needed to work on managing his stress ans not take the job too seriously. 

These moments made me realize a lot of things that I'm glad I learned early that I hope you can take away from me to help you enjoy your career and work while also being able to manage your anxiety and stress like I did.

1) Don't let someone else's stress deter you away from you improving your craft and ruin your experience.
2) You cannot control how someone acts or handles their own stress so sometimes you have to let them be.
3) Don't judge someone because of something that have said or done like what happened to me. You may not entirely know where their stress is coming from or what they're dealing with. Be respectful.
4) If someone is giving you constructive criticism, listen to what they are saying and not how they're saying it.

As far as managing personal anxiety/stress:

1) Your job and career is temporary, but your health and well being should be your priority. Find physical activity that will take your mind from any work. Mine is weightlifting and body building.
2) Invest money. I'm about to start doing this. I feel like doing something to prepare yourself for the long run can not only be motivating to work harder, but eases your stress of being fired and not getting paid knowing you have money building up somewhere else.
3) Find hobbies. Something to do after work hours and keep you away from thinking abkut work. Mine is video games after working out.
4) Remember that one opportunity will set you up for the next opportunity and that every opportunity will lead you to the thing you were meant to do and love.
5) Be good to people and stay in touch with them. You never know who will help you and be there for you in your next stage in your career.
6) One thing I did after my confrontation with my boss and i realized I've done way more than expected at my job and realized other opportunities I could look out for on my next big job hunt when the time comes. Find something to write notes in and write down all the things you have accomplished and did at your job. You'll be very surprised what all you actually have done when you sit done and focus and think about it. I went off for 30 minutes realizing what I did was more valuable than I thought I was for my job at the time.

I hope whoever you are you find this helpful and hopefully finds you a sign of hope and happiness for yourself ans your career. I kkow poating this made me feel better about my work and life and reminded me how thankful i am for being where i am today and where i am going in the future. Have a great year and good luck to you! :)",Mysterious_Echo_9580,1,1.0,0,1704166651,2024-01-02 03:37:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18wfitj/what_ive_learned_so_far/,1,2024
18wf6qg,End of Year Review,"Hi, I'm filling out my self asscessment to complete my co's end of year review process. I can't say that I've been very excited with how the last year went. Context: the company was/is undergoing a 'reinvention/rebranding/repositioning' and there was just a lot of politics that added to an already challenging year, economically speaking. 

Question is: How honest should one be with this review process. I'm a little bit more than jaded after this last year. Also, actively looking to make a move this year so don't want to raise any uncessary red flags while I'm still on.

18weqyq,Is it possible to make a living off of social media alone?,"Im not going to lie I’m on social media everyday. More than often. Usually on tik tok, instagram, YouTube  and these people well influencers claim they make a living off of social media.

It’s this one girl I follow on tik tok says she makes money solely off of social media, her art (she’s an artist), OnlyFans, and has other forms of income that she is gatekeeping she doesn’t want to disclose the information. She’s also into stock market/crypto. 

Another girl posted on her story that she’s a stripper, reseller, brand promoter, spicy content creator (OF), and does social media full time. 

Plus I follow YouTube families such as Tricia/kam, rissa/quan, and dolce/nesha. And they don’t work average 9-5, there YouTubers/brand promoters. And stay home!

I’m like that actually sounds like the life. They work from home and they don’t work an average 9-5. I strive for a lifestyle like this as I’m tired of being on the streets and hustling for my money. Especially since I have social anxiety and hate folks!

Is it even possible to live this way solely off social media for the long run?

18wecza,Promotion denied,"Hello, I am seeking advice from those with Biotech experience or experience advocating for oneself and obtaining promotions. Some context below:

I have been at my job in the Biotech industry since March 2022, so I am nearing 2 years. This year during mid-year performance reviews I presented my boss with a list of accomplishments and their response was, “This is great. How can I support you?” I said I had a goal in mind to achieve a promotion EOY. They responded kindly and mentioned it would need approval.

This year I have volunteered to support two projects, one which completed and one which was placed on pause in lieu of higher priorities. These took place in addition to my main responsibilities. I am essentially 2 rungs above an entry level technician and looking for the next scientist position.

Supposedly to get to the next position I needed to complete an independent project. They gave me one and I completed it within timeline. Perhaps a caveat is that it wasn’t a super sexy project but it needed to be done and I had no other option. I did my job well and thoroughly.

Our company claims we’re on a “two year promotion timeline” yet I’ve seen people with less than that get promoted, scientists included. I am seeing it now for our other science-based departments as people are posting their promotions.

Fast forward to now and I am planning to have a discussion about why my performance was rated < 90%. I am frustrated that I went out of my way to show my commitment, do extra work, and have nothing to show for it. It appears that I could have just went about my business showing no initiative and it would have been all the same. And for the record, I did score more highly last year when I was just getting my feet wet.

Another thing I want to mention is I am fairly active in meetings, despite being the most junior I ask questions and make suggestions during meetings. However I am in the lab so much that I don’t have as much time to present data as the others who aren’t (and are higher scientists). It could partly be me not pushing back on workload and wanting to get things done, but in all reality lab meeting should not be the priority, moving our projects forward should be IMO. However, I may be mistaken.

After all this, how do I show promotion “readiness”? What can I do? It’s going to be tough to get a new Biotech job in this area without moving, but alas. How do I respond to the rejection? Can I stick up for myself?

I am still learning the nuances of corporate politics. I am still learning how to stay sane realizing it’s not about your work ethic but how well you play the game. It feels so fake and so sad.

Thank you for reading. It is incredibly distressing the grip I feel these people have on me. I am grateful for any kind advice you may provide.",SpunkyScout,1,1.0,1,1704163294,2024-01-02 02:41:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18wecza/promotion_denied/,1,2024
18we2jx,I really don’t know how to choose between 2 jobs! Could really use help and advice,"Hey everyone,

I’m going to put my heart out because strangers often give the best advice ever.

I’ve been working at my current company (fortune 10) since I was an intern. Fast forward I’ve gotten a masters degree and celebrated my 5th year anniversary and I’m still here. I also work remotely and I’ve been able to move and it’s pretty felixible with work/life balance. I don’t like my current boss and I’m also sick and tired of the common layoffs that happen every 3 months that cripple me in bed. A few months ago a company reached out and interviewed me they were great they’re in consulting and they have massive billion dollar clients, they offer an insanely higher salary (50%) more. growth and challenges that will offer me learning and new skills since I’ve been at my current company I’ve been complacent I kinda stay for the paycheck and the good work culture but I’m tired of my boss she’s a lunatic and controlling I’m in my 20s and take care of my family financially 

So during my Christmas PTO which I saved up 2 1/2 weeks the new company reached out and offered me the job they told me if I could start Monday (I’m off on PTO with my first job) I thought sure I’m off and I’d like to try out this job bec I have this weird attachment to my first job regardless of how many of my friends they laid off 

I’ve never had stability in my life so here’s my chance to try something new and break my fake sense of stability in corporate America 

And so I started this new job while on PTO with my first job (I know I feel endless anxiety and guilt) 

This new job although prestigious with cool clients has worked me 10 hours a day and the manager keeps telling me it’s bec we’re in a new project but won’t always be this way now I’m exhilarated and excited to start something new but afraid to let go and give my two week notice to my first job and as a matter of fact I don’t know how to give them a two week notice anymore bec im kinda working for the second job as I thought heh I’ll just trial it and see how it goes while on break.

For the past days that I have been working I feel immense fog and stress I feel like I can’t catch up and my imposter syndrome is creeping up on me (senior PM role) my boss started pulling other senior people on high priority meetings and leaving me out (I asked him if this is the normal work life balance so maybe that’s why he left me out, but I have a feeling he thinks I’m incompetent bec I ask so many questions and can’t seem to get things right) 

Someone please direct me on how I should proceed move on because im scared. I’m scared of the damn layoffs at my first job and just can’t see my friends keep getting affecting waiting on me. Idk what to do or what to choose and I feel so nervous thinking about how I’m gonna succeed at this new high paced environment",Next_Report_3032,1,1.0,1,1704162516,2024-01-02 02:28:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18we2jx/i_really_dont_know_how_to_choose_between_2_jobs/,1,2024
18wdztu,Moving from Higher Education to Business,"Hey everyone, 

I'll try to keep this brief. My situation right now is that I (23M) work as a Hall Director with a salary of $40,000 annually. This position comes with benefits that include free housing and food so I pay for absolutely nothing outside of my Spotify subscription and gas for my car. 

That being said, I am about $65k in the hole from student loans in undergrad as I graduated this past May. I have already paid about $5k due to me being able to send about $800 per paycheck towards them. I am currently in Graduate School in a MBA program because I ended up realizing I was uninterested in my undergrad major during my senior year, which I am paying fully out of pocket so there is no additional loans incoming. 

The only issue I have with being a Hall Director tbh is that it is a lot of on call work where I am and I know I will want to develop more and grow into a position that makes more money in the Business Management field soon enough (probably in 2 years or so after completing my MBA) I should also have the majority of my loans paid off by then. 

Does anyone have advice on moving from Higher Education to Business Management? I feel like I have some skills that translate since I supervise 30 people or so as well as help with the future strategic plans of the university's residence hall, but I also know there is much more to Business Management than that. 

TLDR: I work in Higher Education to more easily pay off loans + do Grad School and am wondering if anyone has advice on transitioning from Higher Education to Business Management.

I'm almost 16 and I have no idea what to do with my life, I didn't finish middle school because my mother took me out, and I'm the kind of autistic that makes it hard to do basically anything, so I figured I'd start with a job. I never had much opportunity in my life and I'm very much lower middle class and my family doesn't own a car so  I figure there are very few options. I have a job I actually want, which is a butcher, but I have to be 18 for that so I feel like I need some sort of occupation now just to have something going for now.

18wdehj,Can I use all my PTO before quitting or will I have to pay it back?,"I work at a company that gives all PTO for the year on January 1st. The caveat is that it does not roll over. You use it or lose it. That being said, I am about to have ~160 hours (13.333/per month) of PTO for 2024 when I get to work tomorrow that I am free to use whenever.

With that context, I have been working at a toxic workplace so I have been applying for other jobs. I found another job that I start in two months and I'm planning on quitting in ~1.5 months.

Can I use all that PTO (assuming I can convince my manager I have some trip/opportunity I want to use a lot of PTO on and it gets approved) or will it be prorated at the 13.333 hours/month and I'll have my final paycheck deducted for whatever hours I used that I hadn't ""earned""?

I can't find anything at work about this when reading about PTO and benefits from HR. Has anyone done this before where you use all your annual PTO before quitting?

TL;DR Previously worked at a company where you earned PTO each month and I currently work at a company where you receive all your PTO on Jan 1st.

Now, I work in the hospital and make much more than I would make at any other company, but I am extremely unfulfilled and unhappy. Most people would love to have my job, it's pretty slack, but I hate it. I get home exhausted from just not doing anything most days, or from always giving patients bad news.

I have no idea what other career I'd like, or be good at. I want to return to school, but I don't want to waste money on something that I will end up feeling the same way about as I do now. I also can't get any loans for financing anyway so, that's kind of on the backburner.

I'm wondering if it would be stupid to go into another position in this field that likely pays less, and pretty much ""start over"" - but that I might actually enjoy. Or how I could find what I'm truly passionate about and switch fields so that I'm happy? Money seems to rule every decision, and cause a lot of fear.

The thing is, this is my first ""real"" job. I'm 20, but I've only done a couple freelance and volunteer positions, and that's it. Honestly, I'm surprised that I even got the job. I'm certainly not the most qualified/experienced person for the job. The company has an awesome retention rate and plenty of options for growth, so I'm hoping I don't mess up.  
  
I have to go through a week or two of training which would normally be done in the main bank location, but I live many hours away from there. I was offered the option of having hotel and Uber provided for the week of training, or to train virtually from my local branch. Initially I said I would do the virtual option, but I'm wondering if that was the right answer?  
  
I just got my driver's license last week, and I don't have my own car. I would be totally dependent on the provided Uber (which is only to the training location and back to the hotel). Also, it's in a major city that I've never been to before. I don't want this to sound like I'm whining, but I want to explain the situation. I have never spent time away from my family like this before so I'm not exactly excited at the thought of being hours away from them in a place I don't know. My mom mentioned that I would get a chance to meet people from corporate (I'd be going to the corporate branch), so now I'm having second thoughts. I am a very introverted person, and honestly just accepting this position was hard for me. But I want to make sure that I'm making the right decision here.

18w8xqh,What would you do in my shoes? (Next Chapter In Life),"I'm posting this in a couple of different subreddits that I trust and respect. 

  
I see a lot of great support on Reddit. I have always been hesitant to post about my life, but I feel I’m at a place where I need the support. I’m a 34-year-young high school graduate with some credit hours from an accredited online college through a company education tuition program a year back. From middle school until recently, I never knew what I really wanted in life or what I wanted to do for a career. What I did know was I love electronics, technology, engineering, and learning how things work and understanding why, regardless of the topic in question. I’m always eager to learn, I don’t turn down a challenge, and I’m very competitive when it comes to my work and my career. 

  
I live in central Texas (40 minutes from Waco, 40-60 minutes from Round Rock, Georgetown, and Austin). I have no problem relocating and prefer to try and land something near Round Rock/Austin.   
I have worked in hospitality as a server at a few restaurants, worked in a few big box stores in various positions from the sales floor to the stock room, spent a few years in landscaping, worked as a sound and lighting technician for a production company, worked as an order selector at a distribution center for a large Texas-based grocery chain, and worked as an order filler at a global laminate company. The only thing I knew throughout this time was that I always wanted to work in a job related to tech, electronics, or engineering. 

  
About eight years ago, I left the laminate company and took a pay cut to take a job as a design department sample assistant for a corrugated packaging manufacturing company. While it wasn’t tech, or electronics, it was at least a foot in the door to an engineering department. Without going into detail, I was offered the design manager position within a year, and then a customer operations/project management position within three years. A year later, I championed a company Sustainability program and started helping in sales for local house accounts. 

  
The sales manager, who was once a general manager, and is now the Chief Operating Officer/Vice President of the company, took me under his wing and has been mentoring me since the first year.  I have been fortunate to have his support, along with a handful of other veteran employees and people from various vendors within the industry. The knowledge and experience I have gained at the company has been incredibly valuable. Unfortunately, the last two years have become stagnant with empty promises and a nasty workplace atmosphere. It’s to the point where it’s positioning me mentally and emotionally. It will eventually turn me into something I don’t want to be.

  
While I originally planned to stay at this company and they have ‘promised’ me a lot, I know it’s time to move on. My plan is to either find a position to get my foot in the door or ride it out at my current company while I finish my degree. I started a Bachelor's in Data Analysis a few years ago but stopped so I wouldn’t get burnt out. (We had a lot happening at work and in my personal life that I had to take care of). I’m finally in a place to go back and I have decided to change my degree. Which brings me to why I’m posting this.   
I love project management, and I have become very interested in product management. I also enjoy operations, cloud security, and data analysis. I’m trying to decide what degree I should chase that would provide the widest array of future positions. I’m very interested in any company's product and how the company works to support and sell that product. I could see myself in a plethora of positions within a company. The main thing I care about is finding a company with an atmosphere of support for their employees to learn and grow in order to help the company.   
There are so many degree options to choose from, does it really matter? Or is the most important thing that I get a degree to show that I have the knowledge and commitment to complete the degree program?   
I have been looking into:   
Business Administration for Project Management or Information Systems Management   
Computer Science route for Project Management or Information Security  
Information Technologies for Project Management for IT, Cyber Security, or Business Management   
I have also been looking at Project Management Certification. Should I get my PMP certification and not worry about the degree? Or maybe do both?   
If you were in my shoes, what would you do to help reinforce my career foundation for the next chapter in my life?   
**So, my question is this:**   
If you were in my shoes, what would you do next to help reinforce your career foundation for the next chapter in life?

18w7zhp,About to jump ship,"So here's the situation. I've been working at (enter retail store here) since May 2022. I started out the gate pretty successful as my role needed. I was hired as a Sales Manager for context. In the first 3 months I went from $16/hr to $19.50/hr because of performance. 

My first issue I had at the time, is my general manager WOULD NOT cross train my into operations or any other departments. That, and my computer based learning was a ""Get it done in three days or they'll be issues."" Whatever was the thought I initially had until 6 months go by, and I'm being told that I should prepare to be able to run the store seeing as the general manager is retiring soon. Odd, I have no other actual training but.. okay great!

My second issue, my run-in with my district manager. It's a Saturday night, I have the weekend off and I needed some supplies for my DnD session the following day. This town had two locations of this store, so I popped into the other one. It was 20 mins before close, I was wearing a Naruto hat, a spicy Spencer's graphic tee(this will be important soon), and some TMNT pajamas. The General Manager of this location came up to me, asked if I needed assistance, and introduced herself. I introduced myself and we both chuckled about my undercover boss outfit. She then asked about my manager's retirement. Of course, out mutual respect I told her that I wish her the best and I hope they find her a good replacement, ""someone like me"" we both chuckled... I finished my shopping and left. 

The following Monday I was told my district manager would be there Wednesday and that I should cut out some time so we can have a conversation. I excitedly nodded and went about the rest of the week. When he arrived, I waited for peak to die off and offered myself to our conversation. He sent my manager to the floor and closed the office door.

What followed was me being berated for my ""half naked cartoon girl T-shirt"" and turtle ninja pajamas""... I was taken aback. He even said I said ""people like you"" shouldn't go around announcing other people's retirement. 

What the hell...

He then drilled me about how I had an extra day of vacation on my Christmas week check... Just so you know, I never requested it and I can't edit or approve my own time; that and even if I could, I was never actually showed how to use my time management system...

There's only 3 people that can and know how to edit timecards in my store: my general manager, My operations supervisor, and for some reason, another supervisor has my managers codes.

Long story short it was my manager, and she never owned up to it or apologized to me.

After our conversation, I trudged on. Pissed, annoyed, and shocked. In the following months I was requested to go to other store and provide sales manager help 2-3 days a weeks while that manager covers a store an hour away. I did earn a merit increase... it was .39 cents because ""I don't have enough knowledge about operations/other departments... huh... I wonder why...

Third issue... Three more months pass, and guess what... my store location is now closing in 4 months... so goodbye general manager position... oh and my district manager? He ended up in rehab according to my general manager because he was ""a major alcoholic that can't be reasoned with or even talked to unless he's had a drink..."" Nice... that explains A LOT... in the mean time we have another district manager covering us, and he was awesome...

So my lease was to end at the end of June and I planned to move a good bit closer to family. I did have my first (and last) discussion with my regional vice president and he promised me my position wherever I transferred to. I move and I take a week off (to settle in) and begin working the following Monday.

Now this store... oh jeez... where do I start... it's a mess all the time, people are REGUARLY tardy, metrics are garbage, even so, the manager is pretty cool and loves to teach so.. that's pretty cool. When I started here, my new district manager gave me a $1.11/hr raise. Which I later learned is what the current sales manager makes, and he only gave that to me so there wasn't any ""issues""... whatever... I'm just happy to have the money.

Two more months pass and my new district manager asks me for my help. My help with another store that just lost their general manager. I want to make it known, that store is an hour and 45 from my house. So I negotiated... no nights, no weekends, and paid mileage. Which after getting approval, he happily obliged. 

Now, again, this store was on fire too, but I was going to make it my goal to fix everything I could. A part of me thought I could be just what they need and the new General Manager. Everything was pretty good. The staff loved me, the clientle wasn't crap, operational it was pretty awesome. And.. best of all.. for the next four months, I was in role and... happy... the commute sucked, but at least I was getting decent mileage.

The beginning of November I was told they I hired a new manager for this location and a new sales manager started. The new sales manager was/is an adult child concerned about going to raves, time off, and her friend she got hired alongside her. Things began going downhill... which leads me to my fourth issue...

Pay. The new manager they hired with no relevant experience is getting paid more than me. So me being pissed.. I first reached out to district and recieved the equivalent of a verbal shrug. I then went to HR and they told me they can match her pay ""until my assignment ends at this location""... so after everything I was getting mileage, sure, but nothing more on my regular income. I feel used.

So here we are, 1/1/24... the new manager stated today, and I have two more weeks with this staff, and two more weeks of a raise. Then I'll be put back in the dumpster fire of a store and be miserable; chasing metrics no one else actually seems to give a heck about.

You're probably wondering why I didn't just apply for the manager position here... well... I did...

My district manager said I need to know more about operations and other departments before that can be entertained.

I'm now pushing, daily, until I get my RPA bonus in March.. then...

I don't know what next...

I was told by my district manager after the fiscal year ends and the dust settles, he might have some realignment and a new assignment for me.

So reddit, what next..? What do I do... I'm so stressed, my body just want hours of sleep... but no matter how much I get, I'm still exhaused..

18w76i9,(Advice Needed) Asking for a raise after an improvement plan,"I am in need of advice. I started my current job in January of last year, and I absolutely adore what I do.  Thing is, my introduction to my position was less than stellar. Initial training basically didn't exist, I was basically thrown in the deep end on day one and I was given the hardest type of projects to handle. Additionally, over the course of the past year I went through the whole progression of struggling, getting diagnosed with a new mental illness, getting proper treatment and support for it. I communicated all of this regularly to my supervisor and HR, just to be professional. It definitely did affect my job performance during the past year. Throughout the process, my superiors/HR were surface level supportive but the actions didn't really reflect their words. 

  
I asked for ADA accommodations for my mental illness in writing to my HR person and was ignored for months until I asked for it AGAIN in writing for my component of my annual review (which HR has to OK before my supervisor does my review with me) and then finally they, begrudgingly, provided accommodations. I would say I really got it together and got really good at my job in late August/early September. My particular position is one where when my work got really good, it wouldn't be reflected in the stats until a month or so later due to the nature of my projects. My supervisor mentioned that my stats weren't great and what should change. I told my supervisor that she just needs to trust me, my numbers are about to skyrocket.

  
Following my company's annual review in September, I was told I was getting put on an improvement plan due to my poor performance, without providing any context as to why my stats weren't up to par. In that review, I was told I would not be given a raise. I asked my supervisor if my numbers had been up to their expectations, would I be getting a raise. I was told yes. 

  
In the actual improvement plan, they laid out some goals I needed to meet within the next 3 months (set to end in the next week or so).  In that same improvement plan meeting, they cherry picked stats that looked bad without providing any context for any of it, both of their poor training or my severe mental illness struggles. They framed it as ""your decision to show poor work"", which pissed my off to no end. Thing is, by the time that meeting rolled around I was handling my mental illness really well and killing it at my job so I destroyed all of the goals 5 weeks into the 3 month.

  
I have the follow up meeting following the end of the timetable for the improvement plan in the next week so and I need advice on if I should ask for that raise I would have gotten back in September. My logic is that the improvement plan was to get me up to ""meeting expectations"" and I have demonstrated that I am doing that. I am even going well above that. I nearly doubled every goal and metric they laid out and I feel like I should be compensated for it. Even compared to the best performers in my department I am performing among the top. I am keenly aware that I don't have the best bargaining position considering I am just coming off an improvement plan, and I want to stay at this company long term. What do you think I should do?

18w72m2,"“Best way to pivot, post grad”","I am looking to maybe pivot out of the field I obtained my degree in which is fashion because I’m struggling to obtain roles that I wanted and that I see some of my peers have gotten. I have had feelings of wanting to aim my job search in other fields since my junior year but I ultimately decided to stay in the major to just finish it out. There are a few options moving forward that I am considering. 
One option could be I could just work a retail job and try to move up and keep trying until I get the role I really want and went to school for (merchandise assistant). And maybe get a masters in fashion merch while doing that. 
Option 2 since now that I’m out and have been applying for the past 5 months, I’m looking to maybe aim to get a masters while working in basically any job I can get for the next year or two while getting masters a field like social work or maybe school counseling. These fields seem to be solid employment for where I reside and I know they don’t pay a ton in the beginning but those jobs can be very sustainable long term for where I live. 
Option 3, which is obtaining a CNA license and do that instead of taking on debt for the masters.

As such, I have gained a significant amount of responsibility managing clients that make up 18% of our total revenue (includes project management / implementation and servicing / support ongoing ).

 I am on a team of 14 and recently there has been a higher than normal amount of turnover (about 3 ppl quit a year).  

I always had a hunch that some of the new hires were making more money than me but recently our last person who quit who was in a similar role to me, same work experience in terms of college degree and years experience etc shared with me that she was making about 17% more money than me. 

I’ve asked for more money in the past and was told they don’t have any budget for it yet they keep hiring new people for much more pay than me. 

I have about 125k in my savings so I am strongly considering quitting without a job lined up because I’m so disgusted with how my company treats my pay vs other people who do much less work. 

How dumb of a decision would it be to quit without a new job lined up? I’m under some what of a crunch because I need to quit within one month so I can get paid out on my accrued vacation time before they aren’t required to pay out (they swapped to “unlimited” vaca and as a result decided not to pay out the accrued vaca associates had)

18w5tmq,I want to change careers but don't really know where to go," I used to love my job but since COVID it has gotten increasingly toxic and I want a way out. I've spent the last decade working at a major Orlando theme park shortly in a kind of HR role but mostly as a VIP tour guide for luxury Guests (people pay $4,000-9,000 for the service). I spend at minimum 7 hours a day with people doing this, so I feel my interpersonal skills working with people at any level and background around the world are exceptional. In that role I've helped develop both our training methods and new products, including a $12,000/day tour (both aspects that were removed from my job after COVID, leading to me feeling stagnant,  underutilized, and bored). 

I have a masters in global community engagement, an undergraduate in humanities/religion, and I hope/plan to get more education as well. Before my current employer I worked in the service industry, college recruitment, and non-profits. My skills are largely interpersonal in a face to face environment which is difficult in an increasingly digital world. My passions include developing individuals, training/education, and helping people live better lives (very vague, I know).

There's nothing at this company I can do that wouldn't be taking a 70% pay cut due to the fact that I can receive gratuities as a tour guide and the employer doesn't take that into consideration for compensation. While I know I will have to take somewhat of a pay cut regardless most likely when switching careers, dropping well below $50k annually is about the only option at my current company and I am not willing to do that at this point with my experience and education level. Maybe that's unrealistic of me but that's why I'm asking strangers for advice as most of my network is in the wildly underpaid theme park industry.

18w33io,Career change advice for a lab monkey,"I'm a 32 year old medical technologist with a bachelors in molecular biology, and I need a career change. I've been in this field for about 10 years, doing manual PCR and next-gen sequencing in clinical and manufacturing spaces. Unfortunately, this is very rough on my hands (think 8+ hour days of manual pipetting), which are starting to become more and more painful. I've gone through hand therapy and seen multiple orthopedic and rheumatology specialists with no success, they say it's overuse. I also have other chronic health issues that the high stress environments I've worked in have only made worse.

I'd really like something where I can work from home and have some work life balance. I'm not opposed to a masters degree, but it has to be something with opportunities and pay increase. In my experience, most hard science masters degrees don't get much more than the BS+experience I likely already have, and healthcare professional masters lead in a direction that doesn't offer the flexibility I need (sometimes I need to flex my work hours, wfh, or take time off due to hospitalizations). I'm not interested in a PhD, it's such a long commitment. I'd probably be terrible at sales, I'm not a people person. So, I'm asking reddit: help me figure out what to do with my career?

I was hired to support the manufacturing side when they needed me the most, but the need kind of dissipated and I’ve been wasting my time not learning actual engineering. Problem is, we had a layoff that changed the org chart so now our new manager is off site. The manufacturing crew that I have to work with is difficult: they lie to me, do things they are told not to do, and they don’t respect me one bit. This has been an ongoing conversation with my manager (in a polite way - I never outright tell her that they are lying) and nothing happens. All she does is wants to make everyone happy so she sides with them and sometimes tells me that I need to work on my communication skills. 

I’ve honestly had it. I don’t deserve this kind of treatment and if she won’t intervene for political reasons then I’ll switch positions. I just don’t know how to do so…I’ve already told my manager that I want to switch jobs and once again, nothing happens. How can I go about this?

18vz3qr,Should I go for preschool teacher or stick to what I’m doing?,"I don’t know what to do because there’s pros and cons on both end. I was thinking preschool teacher because when I have my own children I would be able to take them with me and not drop them of somewhere else. Where are the kids suppose to go once they have their school breaks, so I was hoping to do it in order to take breaks with them. But if I worked as a dental hygienist, during their breaks I’ll have to take them to daycare and I don’t feel comfortable about that. Another would be getting in the work force early as a preschool teacher. I’m 23 and I lack social life communication skills because all I have been doing is focusing on my education, if I become a preschool teacher I’ll be able to work on that and start going out more. If I do dental hygiene I’ll be done with program by 27 which is late. And still in the same boat about lacking social life and communication skills. I can’t  balance studying with going out at all, that’s why I barely see anyone. The pay is awful as a preschool teacher even if I get a master in early childhood education I feel it won’t make a difference and honestly I feel I won’t have breaks like public schools would. Dental hygienist pays way more and I will be financially comfortable and stable I never want to struggle with money and that’s how I feel with preschool teacher. I’m taking prerequisites for dental hygiene rn as it was my passion and I honestly struggling so much with chemistry and microbiology let’s say I do not understand it at all, I spend hours and still not getting it which makes me feel l won’t be able to make it in dental hygiene as it’s all science based and heavy work with 6 classes per semester/quarter. My initial plan was going for hygiene but I thought about how much I lack in life because I always put education first. I also thought about if I did teaching I’ll heal my inner child once I work with children, I went through rough times when I was a kid which makes me not stand kids at all, but I want to love them like I used to but because of my trauma it’s making me not stand them nor want to have kids. So if I worked with them hopefully my heart will open up to them and heal in order to become a mother in the future.

Background, 22 year old South African, I have a dual major degree in Marketing and in Business Management. I am currently working in an internship for a dealership, half was digital marketing and the other half was sales executive. I really disliked both lines of work, I am not thinking of going back to sales so I wont touch base on that, but the digital marketing I disliked because it felt unrewarding, and felt like anyone can do this job — I didnt need a degree to do this.

I want to do something that is specialized, where I can leave my country and be accepted for job posts internationally because my skills are specialized, and the digital marketing that I was doing did not feel like that. It doesnt need to be specialized like how brain surgery is special, but something that is a lot more respected, and has a lot better pay because its a harder job.

I do like the idea of market research and analytics, so perhaps something in that field. I do also want to go for a field that is more lucrative. From what I have seen between my friends from highschool, the ones who went into an IT field have been killing it. I would like to do a short term course in a coding field, but something that can be combined with my knowledge and skills as a marketer. Sort of like a marketing/business + IT field.

18vv379,Quit my corporate low paying job and go back in unskilled/manual work?,"Hi guys,

I'll try keep this brief

From the ages of 18-21 I worked as an IT Trainee, but I hated the helpdesk life and I didn't fit in with many of my colleagues at work, so I left the job.

 For the next year I was in and out of warehouse jobs, until I found a stable one when I was 22. I managed to save money and buy a cheap flat. I liked the job, the people did not care if you were a loser or a success in life, they just wanted to do their job and go home. The money was quite good aswell.

Because of that job I managed to buy my own place and leave my parents house behind me. An indepedent man finally.

In 2023 I got the opportunity to go back into the corporate world and that would mean going back to live with my parents. I left my job (which was nights) and took a paycut, because it's a 3 year trainee scheme,for 3 years I'm going be on 7000£ less than what I was making as a night shift worker.

 The other issue is that, I feel like I'm socially inept to be working in corporate spaces, whereas where I was working before, people come from all walks of life so no one really cared who you are.

Is that a pathetic reason to leave my job? Maybe, but I'm 24 turning 25 soon, and I'm just focused on doing the right thing now, ofc in 4-5 years the corporate job may very well pay more than any other job I can think of doing, but the downsides are huge, such as having to become dependent on living with my parents again in somewhat of a toxic household, smaller wages and the fact that I  just can't seem to fit in/",dj2l1,1,1.0,16,1704109159,2024-01-01 11:39:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18vv379/quit_my_corporate_low_paying_job_and_go_back_in/,1,2024

How can I make it clear that I really want to be brought on full time, but if that isn’t a possibility at the end of my next contract renewal, I will have to leave? Alternatively, should I just stay and get more experience?

__
__

I’ve been a contractor for about 2 years now. I was an intern before that.

On one hand, I feel like my company is doing me a favor - I have no college degree (you usually need one for this job), and this is the first job I’ve had in this field so the only experience I have is what I’ve learned on the job.

On the other hand… I feel like I’ve been a real asset to my team. My position didn’t exist before I started working there, and it’s been really helpful for them to have someone dedicated to the highly specific tasks I do on a daily basis. 

I LOVE my company. I love my team. I enjoy the work I do. But being a contractor is killing me. I’ve been getting so burnt out lately, as I’ve had very limited paid time off in the 2 years I’ve been working here (only holidays). I also just feel like I have no job security as a contractor, and I’m the breadwinner in my household while my partner finishes school.

I’m nearly positive my contract will get extended for another 6 months. And if it’s not possible to be brought on FT at the end of that 6 months, I’d ideally want to be looking elsewhere for a FT position. How can I apply that pressure?

18vtsrx,What are some career options/paths for someone with my interests amd background (Neuroscience B.S.)?,"I (23F) recently graduated with a neuroscience degree. Initially, I was a premed student, but my interests started to change after I completed a summer research internship during my junior year of college. I still wanted to go to medical school, but I wanted to delve more into research first. I looked into and applied to graduate schools to get a Master's in neuroscience. I was accepted into my top choice program, but I didn't wind up going because I didn't receive any funding. Between the end of my junior year and the beginning of my senior year, I started to get cold feet about applying to medical school. I want a career that gives me a good work-life balance and allows me to pursue other interests outside of work (such as traveling) and start a family. When I was premed, I was mainly interested in a career in neurology or cardiology, and those specialties are the most unforgiving when it comes to time. I feel like it's especially hard pursuing a career in those specialties as a woman.

Anyway, another career interest of mine is inventing new medical technology/devices and selling them. I always imagined doing this after working as a doctor. I really admire Alexa Canady (brain shunt) and Robert Bartlett (ECMO) in that sense. However, over time, I realized that if I went to medical school, it would be a long time before I got to pursue those interests. A couple of months ago, I started to look into biomedical engineering programs. Out of curiosity, I looked for biomedical engineering jobs because I wanted to see what was out there and if there were plenty of opportunities available. Unfortunately I didn't find much, so now I'm not so sure about working in that field. 

Lastly, despite getting cold feet towards medical school, I still find myself being drawn to healthcare. I'm currently looking into optometry programs (it's a healthcare field with a good work-life balance, and I feel that my neuroscience background will help me with optometry). Aside from loving science, another thing I really like about the medical field is the job security. It's also very hands-on, and I like how you'll always be learning something new.

Right now, I am getting a Masters degree in Management and eventually, I will get an MBA. Business is another interest of mine because I am interested in breaking off and starting my own medicsl device or healthcare company/practice or moving up into leadership positions at whatever job I work at.

What careers would you suggest for someone in my position and with my background? What other healthcare careers have a good work life balance? Are biomedical engineering and optometry good career paths? I feel a bit lost at the moment, and I'm just trying to keep an open mind. It's definitely weird and a bit scary not knowing exactly what you want to do :(",the-moonandthestars,1,1.0,0,1704103574,2024-01-01 10:06:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18vtsrx/what_are_some_career_optionspaths_for_someone/,1,2024

18vsr1t,My boss is spreading rumors about me tarnishing my reputation. Please advice..,"I am a woman in corporate, and my manager has accused me of sleeping around.


I’m a self-made 27 year old woman. I lost my parents, I had to give up on my education in grade 5 and lived in poverty. 

I used to go to every office for walk-in interviews, and finally got my first job. All my managers from past companies adore me for my work ethic, ambition and sincerity. I’ve always been a top performer. 

I joined a company that’s in retail 2 years ago, my managers were women, instantly I became a top performer here too. Being the only person in my division to get 100% employee rating. I was due for a promotion. 

We suddenly faced a re-org, and my new general manager is a man who’s known to be a “boss” - Upon my first meeting with him, he asked my what jewelry I liked. My mistake was to smile, and continue our conversation. 

Every time I’d walk in, he’d look at me with awe. He would say things like “I’ll give you what you want” and “don’t be shy” I considered this nothing but flirting from his end to pass time. 

Suddenly, everything fell apart. People started looking at me strangely, asking me if I’m even good at my job, asking me things as “how do you feel about office relationships with your bosses” and I faced extreme distress because I was bullied and accused of getting promoted because I flirted with my new boss. This was baseless, I was due for a promotion. 

This new boss would send me warning emails because I left his office at 4:30 and not 5, even though no one from his team was there. He would implement 5 days in office just for me even though his team members would come 3 days. He turned everyone who saw me as an asset against me to the point they run away. 

No guy wants to be near me, girls look at me strangely and this is impacting my performance.. 

Lastly, an aquaintence outside of work told me they met him for a business meeting and my name came up, upon which this boss said “we will be firing her soon, she’s progressing in her career through sexual benefits” 

I’m distraught, disgusted and at loss. I didn’t do anything to him, my previous bosses fought to keep me in the company due to my high performance. He’s just waiting for an opportunity to fire me. 


Please give me your guidance and advice. I’ve worked extremely hard for my reputation to be completely screwed because of just one guy. 

Every other man in the company has been me with nothing but respect until now.",Interesting-Market-6,1,1.0,121,1704098905,2024-01-01 08:48:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18vsr1t/my_boss_is_spreading_rumors_about_me_tarnishing/,1,2024
18vspvt,"I’m in a weird spot, I feel like I just left a toxic relationship after resigning.","So… i work in finance and I just put in my resignation to my now former employer. I had a stint with them for about a year and came back around June of 2023. 

After coming back, I immediately got slammed with a ton of work. That was fine, but the team I was on did things a little differently than the team I had been on prior. So I had to learn their processes and procedures, reporting requirements, etc. 

My manager has been EXTREMELY micromanaging. And I mean… EXTREMELY. Would berate me if emails were not worded correctly to her liking (I’m an experienced professional, I know how to write an email). Would CC other financial analysts on my emails to ensure accuracy, would message me during meetings where I would be speaking and word something differently if she didn’t like what I was saying, etc. it has been extremely exhausting and has caused me to second guess everything I do.

We have reporting deadlines every month, however, she would set her own deadlines for when our stuff needed to be submitted, and it was often sooner (a lot sooner). 

I don’t have issues with this, but i worked with a lot of people who aren’t familiar with how to read our financial data or are very new, or how to just pull general data, and often times I would be put in positions where I had to do the work of 2-3 people. I’ve raised this issue to her, but she would brush it off.

I find myself working 50-60 hour weeks. Keep in mind I’m also in a masters program, and I have been neglecting that for work and it’s caused me to not do as well in my classes.

Anyway, we have Christmas to New Years off, and today I decided to put in my resignation, effective immediately. I feel like a huge burden has been lifted off my chest, but I also feel like I left a toxic relationship. I liked the people I worked with, but I feel like they’re going to be hung out to dry since I won’t be coming back. And because the company took me back early this past year. 

I’m just not sure my mental health can take it working under those conditions with everything I have going on.

18vrriu,Should I give my coworker a heads up I'm job hunting?,"Usually I would say ""hell no"" to this.

However:

* I'm interviewing for a job I'm pretty confident about on Wednesday morning. Ofc, that's no guarantee I'll get it.

* He's going on leave for two weeks overseas. Ever since COVID, every single person I know who's been overseas has ended up being away another week or two at LEAST because they all got sick due to my country being closed for a couple of years and our immune systems still playing catch up even over a year later. We're also going through another wave; the pandemic isn't over here. So if I did get the job and moved quickly, there's a significant chance that I wouldn't still be here when he got back.

* He's fresh out of school. this is his first ever job, and our workplace is such a disaster that no matter what our employer says, my poor coworker WILL be up shit creek without a paddle once I'm gone and he doesn't have years of experience to fall back on. He'll be doing two jobs. He's already had to do this when I went on leave myself and then got sick.

* I genuinely like this guy and would feel like I'd be stabbing him in the back if I didn't at least give him a heads up.

* I'm his only administrator and it's a public facing job. My absence WILL caused increased hostility from the public; his predecessor told me all about what she faced before I came on as there was a gap between when the last person quit and I was brought on.

The job I'm interviewing for isn't a guarantee no matter how optimistic I am about it, but me not saying anything would put someone I genuinely respect in a very bad position that he doesn't deserve to be in if I end up getting it. I could let him know while he's away if I do get the job, but I don't want to cross any boundaries if he's not comfortable with it, so I guess a compromise is that I could just ask him if he wants me to text any big changes that affect him that go into motion while he's gone.

I've broken some of my personal rules for this guy before (eg not answering texts outside of work hours) because of how chaotic our workplace is; he's always been grateful and has never made me regret it. I guess the only reason I'm hesitating is because it goes against conventional wisdom, and I don't want him to spend his leave stressing about something that may not happen.

I want to look out for him. Our employer won't.",Halospite,1,1.0,11,1704094624,2024-01-01 07:37:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18vrriu/should_i_give_my_coworker_a_heads_up_im_job/,1,2024
18vrprm,Advice on salary reviews for salespeople?,"
Hi all, 

First post on Reddit and I’m typing on my phone, my apologies in advance if the formatting is off. 

I’ve been working at my current company for over 2 years now. I work in sales and have a base + comms structure. Last year they reviewed my salary, here’s what I was offered: an increase in the base salary, but a reduction in the commission % (to avoid being specific, let’s say the increase was a 15% jump, and the decrease in commission % was a 14% drop). 

This year they’re looking at doing the same thing (but maybe a different percentage, I’m not sure yet). 

I’ve been wondering if this is fair practice. I accepted last year because my boss is not open to negotiations. How can I go about discussing this openly and reaching an agreement that makes financial sense to the company while also ensuring I’m getting paid what I deserve? The way the current salary reviews are done feels like there is no material increase in my compensation. I just want to add that I do enjoy working here so I’d hope to be able to continue growing with the company. 

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you!",Key-Worldliness1054,1,1.0,0,1704094415,2024-01-01 07:33:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18vrprm/advice_on_salary_reviews_for_salespeople/,1,2024
